Other than the residential buildings, it has a few stores, a school, a church and that's about it. The closest larger building is the local hospital, located at the top of a high hill to the north of the town, with a nice view over the surrounding landscape. Some years ago, this hospital served as a meeting point of patients from not only here, but also a few other small, surrounding towns. However, only two years ago, a new hospital had been built for that purpose, being much closer to the other towns, but further away from Celerysprings. Because of that, the Celerysprings hospital had very few patients nowadays, almost all of them residents and there were also just a handfull of doctors and nurses stationed there, because the others had been paid good to move to places where their skills had more use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, on this day, one person was heading towards this hospital. Who is this person?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clara opened the door to her home swiftly and with so much force that she almost smashed it straight into the opposing wall! Even though she had just come home, she already had to hurry up, because there was still something she had to do today: She had an appointment in about 30 minutes, inside the huge, old hosital on that hill, to the north. It wasn't anything serious at all; Usually one would visit a doctor in a regular, small clinic, but since Celerysprings didn't have these anymore, everybody had to travel to the huge hospital to meet with a doctor, even for trivial, little things like diagnosting a flu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Clara's case, it was even more trivial and little, especially in her own view. A few years ago, some doctor had found a skin marking on the sole of her left foot that he found to be somewhat unusual. Just in case, because there was a very minimal chance of it evolving into something harmful and eventually skin cancer, the doctor had it removed. The problem only was that Clara had been told that she had to come again once every year to check on that area of the skin again, just in case that anything had changed. Those visits had always bothered Clara, because the doctors had never found anything again and because she had to travel a bit to the hospital and back to her home each time. If it hadn't been for some of her family members, especially her grandma who was <i>DEATHLY</i>afraid of skin cancer (and also gave her some money every month, even more than her parents), she would have probably ignored it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut like that, she had went there every year, for about 6 years now, or so and this time, Clara was 17. \"Agh, this damn appointment... It's a Thursday today, those are <i>always</i> bad for that kinda thing...\" Clara angrily mumbled as she quickly ran through the house and into her room. The entire half of her wardrobe was a mirror, which she usually liked to look into for long times. Clara had no problem in admitting that she was indeed very good-looking: She was somewhat tall and rather slim, but with some visible muscles from running around a lot. Her dirty blonde hair laid in slight curls and just a bit down below her shoulders, her face was slim, soft and very feminine with relatively large, greenish-blue eyes, a short nose and pronounced lips. The other curves of her body were rather pronounced as well, especially her breasts and butt. All in all, Clara found herself to be astoundingly gorgeous! \"To gaze upon me is to know divinity itself, yes...\" Clara whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just such a shame that there were far too few people in this ghost-town that were able to appreciate her natural beauty! If only she could move out of this blasted house yet and somewhere else, somwhere far, far away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara sighed, this wasn't why she stopped by that mirror right now, sadly. Dropping onto her generous, soft behind with a thud, she stuck both her feet, still in her sneakers out and frowned a little. Mostly, she wasn't fond of the sheer size of her feet. Her parents had told her numerous times that for a girl as strong and tall as her, it was only natural that her feet were somewhat bigger as well, but Clara herself didn't like it very much, especially as she thought they were still <i>too</i> big, even considering that. And it wasn't at all that her feet were fat, or ugly, or something of the sort; They were rather slim, well-proportioned and formed and overally very long high high arches, a pronounced, round ball and long, flexible toes. If it weren't for the intimidating size, Clara herself would have to admit that they looked extremely cute and downright beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara also wasn't too happy about the state of her shoes; They were regular street sneakers and didn't look bad at all in the beginning, but now, after she had worn them for several months, they looked worn-out, battered and simply... well, old. But the only decent shoe store was in a city several miles away, so Clara didn't get the chance to buy new ones too often. Clara sighed, finally getting tired of looking at her shoes, and kicked them both of with a rapid movement of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, she was once again reminded of the fact she hated the most about her own feet, and feet in general. Clara gritted her teeth and squint her eyes as she moved her long toes around and found the surrounding fabric of her socks literally sticking to her skin like glue, due to all the accumulated sweat. Part of the thing Clara hated most about her feet was the fact that they were usually sweating very easily and very much. Even when she was just idlying, the soles of her feet would get moist enough that they were completely covered with fluid and shone brightly with reflected light if she moved them around. And should she actually do something that made her feet sweat hard... For example, walking around in those old, rattled sneakers of hers, it was of course much worse. Today had been an especially warm and humid day and Clara had hurried up a little because of that blastes appointment, so it had been feeling as if her feet were in ovens for quite some time, and now she was seeing the full effect of this: The entire area of her socks was positively <i>soaked</i> with her footsweat, it was feeling incredibly stuffy, uncomfortable and somewhat itchy. Clara winced as she squeezed her toes together and some of the sweat was actually pushed out of the socks and running down slowly her sole. \"My god... they had been sweating so much that the socks can't even soak it up any more... It's usually never <i>that</i> bad, I - ugh... <i>oohhh</i> my god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was suddenly reminded by the second part of the thing she hated so much about her feet: They stunk. Even minutes after washing them freshly, they would carry a sort of personal scent with them... which would always evolve into a full-out stench! Right now, it was especially bad, the sickening smell of her warm, sweaty feet had spread all the way across her face already, within seconds! Soon it would fill up the entire room again, as it did all the time... Clara took a whiff of the strong smell and shook herself; she was getting so tired of smelling this! It was always the same, a very foul, cheesy smell of unwashed feet and stale sweat. Clara had been cursed with those unspeakably strong stinkers for as long as she could remember, but it was especially bad today! She was actually feeling a tad dizzy right now... But she shook her head and hurried up once more, she still had that damn appointment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYanking those sticky, hot and absolutely wet socks off her feet, Clara freed her bare feet and instantly stared at the sole of her left one. Nope. No change in that area of the skin, at all. Clara was sure that they wouldn't be able to find anything this time, either. But still, she was going to do this... just like every year. Clara continued to watch her bare feet for a little while... Yes, they were still as perfectly pretty as always. The light, pale tone of her sole's skin was shining brightly like fresh winter snow and the texture of them was flawless and free of any irregularities. They were also incredibly smooth and soft to the touch, which surprised Clara a little, considering how much she usually walked around... Nevertheless, it was nice. If only her feet weren't that horribly sweaty and stinky all the time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara sighed as she jumped up again, and looked at the clock. \"Damn... I spaced out again, and the time was lost, like... magically. I need to hurry.\" Clara quickly searched for some new socks, as the old ones, piled together and almost steaming with nauseating stench weren't very appealing right now. No, she couldn't make anyone have to face those... She needed fresh ones! Clara's panic steadily grew as she searched faster and faster, yet found nothing. \"Damnit! All my socks are gone! Where are they? Shit!\" Clara was out of socks, there was no changing that. As she looked at the clock, she realised that she had to go right <i>now</i>... Even then, she would be a tad late, but she couldn't afford to make it even later! Clara cursed and sighed... her only choice was to put on her reeking, wet socks once more or wear her shoes without socks. After a short while, she chose to take her shoes  sock-less. How bad could it become, really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara stormed out of her house once more and looked towards the hill with the hospital on top... It seemed even farther away this afternoon. She began to walk quickly, but soon realised that it wasn't enough. She would still be TOO too late, so she decided to actually change her speed into a light running one. Clara cursed once more as she soon felt droplets of sweat forming all over her forehead and face... This wasn't good. Clara didn't dare to imagine what her feet would sweat like right now... But deep down, she knew that she would have to find out sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running for a bit more than 20 minutes, Clara finally reached the building. She slowed down, whiped the sweat off of her forehead with the back of her hand and slowed down her breathing somewhat. Fortunately, it was much cooler inside the hospital than it was outside. Unfortunately, it was also looking a tad... creepy in here, just like every time she came here. Clara couldn't quite put her finger on it, but something about this huge building, it's old look, the fact that most parts were almost empty and sometimes even dark and the general lack of people there was just unsettling... Or rather, it was <i>everything</i> about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was slowly walking through a long corridor, towards a room she remembered from last year as suddenly, someone shows up behind her!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Are you looking for something, miss?\" A light, yet somehow sharp voice behind Clara suddenly rang out. Clara spun around quickly with her trained reflexes and stared into the puzzled face of one of the local doctors. \"Ah, sorry. Yes, yes I am. Uhhh, I have an appointment and was supposed to be here...\" Clara checked her watch \"...15 minutes ago. Sorry.\" The doctor waved her hand dismissingly \"Ah, don't worry about that... We hardly have anything to do here, except for paperwork most of the time...\" \"Yes, thanks, so... Yeah, I had the same kind last year, but back then the room was over there!\" Clara said, pointing to an empty, dark room. The doctor just nodded \"Yeah, they changed a lot of things again. Moved many people as well. I just came here a few days ago. Oh by the way, I'm Dr. Rules.\" The doctor spoke and Clara just nodded her head, biting on her lips and unsure what to say. Something about this doctor just seemed... strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rules was a woman that looked like she was in her mid-twenties, or early thirties at least and she overally very pretty looking. She was very slim and overally a tad shorter than Clara, which felt a little strange to her already. She wore the typical white clothes of a physician, her dark brown hair was rather short and her hazel brown eyes stared intensely at Clara at times. This Dr. Rules just had something... unnerving about herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway... I would suggest that you follow me into my office, or rather... my office like room. The only place with a running computer and network connection here that I know of, at least...\" Dr. Rules spoke a bit absent-mindedly, already walking ahead with a startled Clara following her shortly. \"Ah, yes! I'm coming!\" They walked for a short while before entering a strange, large, round room that looked somewhat off. \"I think this... room wasn't usually a meeting area, or office of any sort, right?\" Clara said as she looked around, but Dr. Rules just shrugged. \"I don't know, really. They told me where most of the rooms now are, but not what function they served in the past... Anyway, let me check here for a second...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rules pointed to a chair in which Clara sat down uneasily as the doctor started to bang on the keys of the keyboard loudly. At the end, she clicked the mousbutton with enough force to chop down a small tree and exclaimed \"Ah there! At three inea the afternoon, yeah, that was about 20 minutes ago then... You must be... Clara then, right?\" Clara eased up a little involuntarily, she generally preferred when people started to call her by her last name by now and yet... right now, her hearing Dr. Rules call her Clara sounded better. \"Yes... Yes that's right, Dr. Rules.\" \"Hmmm... And it's just a standard checkup, also, of the skin. Yes, let me check again... As I thought, there is no other one around... Well!\" Dr. Rules suddenly exclaimed, stepping away from the computer, clapping her hands loudly and smiling. \"Looks like I'll be the one to do that as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was a little shocked... She wasn't exactly sure of how bad her feet were right now, but this Dr. Rules did seem kinda nice after all... She would have preferred it much more if the doctor having to examine them was a real douchebag anyway. \"Ahh... I see...\" Clara said. \"Well, let's get started right away, shall we? The place of interest is on the sole of your left foot, correct?\" Dr. Rules asked with a sweet smile and Clara gulped and frowned again. \"Ah... yes.\" \"Well then, why don't you remove your shoe then, so that I can have a look at it? Hehehe\" Dr. Rules giggled for no reason, which didn't help Clara. \"Ok... ok, of course, how else could you... very well!\" Clara raised her left foot, grabbed her shoe, but hesitated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rules had swiftly drawn closer as well, which didn't help Clara at all. \"Is something wrong?\" Dr. Rules asked, tilting her head to the side slightly. \"No... it's just, uh... well...\" Should I tell her the truth?, Clara wondered. No, it would be too pointlessly embarrasing. While a warning would certainly be more... fair, maybe the doctor wouldn't even notice the smell? Maybe she would look at it really quickly and pull away so that Clara could hide it again? \"It's nothing.\" Dr. Rules smiled again. \"Then remove your shoe, please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara sighed. There was no way back. With a sharp movement of her hand, she ripped her old, well-worn sneaker from her left foot. As soon as her bare foot was revealed, Dr. Rules suddenly drew closer, bringer her face nearer to the exposed foot to have a look at it. \"Ahh, it seems like you aren't wearing any socks at all, hmm? Well, this saves us the time of taking them-\" Dr. Rules suddenly stopped mid-sentence and went deathly quiet. Clara gasped quietly, that couldn't be good! And the very next second, she realised it herself: The stench of one incredibly sweaty, smelly foot was in the air! Considering how Dr. Rules was much closer to the offending sole than Clara herself was right now, she felt honestly bad for the doctor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rules remained silent and almost frozen up for a moment... Clara could have sworn she saw the nostrils of the doctor flare a few times!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And urgh... it's really bad right now, too!</i> Despite her thoughts, Clara remained perfectly silent. She could have asked the doctor if she was alright, but right now, every possible answer she could think of would only mean more embarrasment and discomfort for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the smell in the air of that room became more and more tainted by the foul fumes of Clara's moist, unwashed foot... She herself was finding it increasingly difficult to ignore it herself, despite most of the stench being directed away from her face, and into the doctor's! Finally, Clara couldn't take it anymore \"Uhm... Dr. Rules?\" she meekly said, which caused the doctor to twitch slightly, as if woken suddenly from a deep sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her little shock, Dr. Rules then proceeded as if nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... *ahem* right. This should be the affected area, correct?\" The doctor said, poking one spot in Clara's sole softly with her index finger, which sent a sharp tickling sensation through Clara's nerves, if only briefly. \"Hmm... everything appears ok from this perspective, but I need to take a closer look, still. I'll be right back.\" With that, the doctor rose and swiftly walked away to a medical cabinet on the wall of the other side of the room. Clara could see and hear her rummaging around, but she couldn't quite tell exactly what she was doing there from over here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Clara used the opportunity to stealthily whipe the sole of her exposed foot with the back of her right hand. It had cooled down a little in the meantime, but... \"Argh, god... the amount of sweat is ridiculous!\" Clara hissed as she looked at the skin on her hand, which was now running with the gathered sweat from her foot. Clara shook it away from herself with a shriek as some of it began to drip on her clothes. Just as she thought of whiping her foot on something else maybe to at least get rid of all that wetness before the Doctor could come back, she saw something moving from the corners of her eyes!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clara looked up with a gasp to see Dr. Rules standing in front of her again, but the Doctor simply nodded and pointed at Clara's foot with one hand. \"We may continue now, Clara...\" She spoke calmly before getting into position once more, telling Clara to present the sole of her foot to her once more with a wink of her head. Clara sighed and lifted her foot once more. It had been maybe two minutes, she didn't have any time at all to improve the situation! She could also still very much smell the strong, pungent aroma of her sweat-foot in the air, right now, Clara couldn't wait to finally get out of that building and heading back home. The feeling of fresh, cool water on the warm, tired soles of her feet was the thing she craved the most right now. Oh, she'd wash them until the skin felt funny for what they had done to her today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Clara was thinking about that, Dr. Rules was continuing the regular routine with cold professionalism... at least for now! In her hand she was holding something that looked like a very tiny spyglass, which she was now pressing onto Clara's moist foot, so that she could look through. Dr. Rules hissed, removed the device again and whiped the sole of Clara's foot a few times with her own hand, to rid it of the blocking moisture. A chill was running down Clara's spine as she felt that and she dug her fingernails into the palms of her hands as she forced her feet not to kick involuntarily at the sudden touch! <i>Holy shit... She didn't use some sort of tissue to clean the area... She whiped it with her hand! This... can't be normal.</i> Clara though as she watched Dr. Rules absent-mindedly whiping her patient's sweat onto the ground before moving in on her foot once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more she pressed the device into Clara's soft, warm flesh, now much dryer, and then she looked through it with one eye. Due to the instrument's short length, this unfortunately also put the Doctor's face much closer to her patient's malodorous, long foot right now. Clara was sure that Dr. Rules could feel the warmth emitted from her own foot on her face now and what was even worse, Clara could feel the cool sensation of the Doctor's breathing on her sole! <i>She's... downright smelling it right now! What the fuck?</i> Clara thought frantically, but she still hold still as good as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Clara felt the feeling of the device getting removed from that part of her sole, the relief was great... But she gasped a second later, as Dr. Rules was pushing it into her flesh again, on a different part of her foot this time! <i>Why is she doing this here... This is a completely different area!</i> Clara thought, but she knew better than to argue with the Doctor about how she was to do her job!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis then happend a few times in a row, the Doctor kept examining almost the entire length of Clara's sole, her constant smelling grinding unpleasantly on Clara's nerves, before she finally pulled back for good, causing Clara to breathe out in great relief and relax for once. The doctor cleared her throat before she started to speak once more \"*Ahem* Well, this was certainly... very interesting.\" The calm was instantly removed from Clara's mind again! \"What... what do you mean, Dokor?\" \"Wellllllllll...\" Dr. Rules hummed, drawing that word out incredibly long. \"...I have decided that I have to give you some treatment, after all.\" \"What... what is it?  Has it turned harmful from over last year? Do you have to remove anything? But I... I couldn't see any changes myself! Do you think-\" Clara began to ramble, but the Doctor held out the palm of her hand, signalling her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not quite as drastic. I will just need to give you a tiny, little shot.\" With that, Dr. Rules suddenly pulled out a thin syringe filled with a crystal clear liquid from behind her back. <i>Did she already have that one prepared??? How could she have known...</i> Clara frantically thought, but she still remained silent... Until the Doctor suddenly moved towards her foot again, quite rapidly this time! Clara pulled it back and almost yelled \"Hold it! No, wait, please... Tell me, what is that for?\" Dr. Rules stood unmoving for a moment, lifting one eyebrow sceptically. \"It's just some medicine for your foot, of course. You wouldn't mistrust a Doctor, would you?\" Dr. Rules said with a beaming smile, before moving closer to Clara once more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara knew that if she decided to do something, this would be her last chance!</span></div></div>",

Even though she could feel the cold grip of horror taking a hold over her, she remained perfectly still and silent. There was something like a small voice in the back of her head, telling her that everything would most likely <i>not</i> be ok if she just waited, but she decided to tell that voice to shup up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, Dr. Rules had finally taken her postion and was holding Clara's big, tender foot securely with one hand, while taking aim with the syringe in her other one. \"This will only sting for a moment...\" Clara gasped as she heard the word \"sting\", but still stood her ground. Finally, Dr. Rules was piercing the skin of Clara's sole with her needle and empied its contents into Clara's system. \"See? That wasn't so bad, now was it?\" Dr. Rules said with a smile as she got up, walked away and disposed of the syringe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara gave a reliefed sigh and got ready to stand up herself once more. \"Hold on, not so fast!\" Dr. Rules suddenly exclaimed. Clare gave a confused look and asked \"Huh? But we're done now, aren't we?\" \"Yes, but I advice you to keep down for a little while. Patients sometimes feel a little dizzy or light-headed after receiving an injection, so you should wait a bit.\" \"Huh... Well, thanks for your concern, but I'm feeling fine, really. I will just-\" \"No, you will wait for at least 10 minutes!\" Dr. Rules suddenly said sharply, shooting Clara an indignant look. \"You know I would be responsible if something were to happen to you and I've already decided that I would take good care of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara groaned and crossed her arms in front of her chest. \"Fine. But 10 minutes, and then I'm gone.\" \"If you are still feeling alright even after 10 minutes, of course.\" \"Of course!\" Clara said, looking at the Doctor a tad angrily. She wanted to get out of here as soon as possible, this woman had been in direct contact with her horrible feet and even though she had remained silent about their... attributes, Clara was fearing that she might comment about them if she had nothing else to say for some minutes... Clara would probably die of shame if that were to happen! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well...\" Dr. Rules then said, grabbing a nearby chair and sitting down in front of Clara. \"I'll just stay with you in the meantime... Like I said, not a whole lot to do today...\" The doctor said with a heavy sigh as she leaned back and crossed her legs, lifiting one of her feet up in the air a little bit. She kept moving it a little, which glued Clara's gaze upon... pretty much because there really wasn't anything else to look at. Dr. Rules was wearing simple white flat shoes and her feet seemed to be more of a regular woman's size than Clara's massive own ones. Also, Clara hadn't been able to see it clearly before, but now she could see that Dr. Rules was tan brown nylons and it looked as if she wasn't wearing socks as well, but Clara couldn't tell that clearly from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hummmm... It's still a tad hot in here... I think I'll take off my shoes for a bit, I trust you don't mind?\" Dr. Rules suddenly said, shocking Clara a bit. \"Uh... no of course not, go right ahead. \"Since it's not longer than a few minutes now, it'll be ok.\" The Doctor said with a sly grin. \"Huh?\" But Dr. Rules didn't answer and simply kicked both her shoes off with ease. \"Ahhh... this feels so much better!\" She said, her grin intensifying. Clara looked at the now exposed foot over the Doctor's knee with a mixture of interest and disgust... As she had thought before, Dr. Rules wasn't wearing any socks over her nylons... But as she could now see a bit of their downsides, she could tell they had been horribly discolored with sweat! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had a much darker, almost grayish color there, which was especially bad around the toe area and on the heel... What was worse was that Clara could also see a certain moisture glimmer behind the dark fabric, and there was really only one possible explanation for this. <i>Holy shit! Dr. Rules has incredibly sweaty feet as well! Ewwwww...</i> And then something hit Clara, confirming that observation even further... It was a horribly sharp, cheesy and sour stench, the typical smell of sweaty feet! Clara inhaled sharply and almost had to cough loudly, before holding her breath! <i>So that was why she had said it's only for a few minutes... Could she be getting back at me for making her suffer my feet?</i> Clara wondered, letting the sharp tinging in her nose die down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another breath, this time mostly through her mouth... But she could still feel the stench. <i>Damnit... I'm not sure if my own aren't worse still, but... smelling someone else's feet like this is something completely different! I wish I could ask her to put her shoes back on, but... After what I put her through, that would be really selfish...</i> Clara said, ignoring the stink as best as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Dr. Rules started to smile again... but this time, it didn't look like a pleasant smile anymore, at all! <i>Hehehe... she can smell them from over here... I did a good job of getting them smelly like this, after all. Finally I've found a subject fitting for all my wonderful ideas. Oh, there's no escape, my dear girl... But before I get started for real, let's tease you a little bit</i> Dr. Rules thought, slowly getting excited. She lifted her one foot from over her knee a little and stretched that leg a little bit, which brought her wet, steaming foot a tad closer to Clara. Dr. Rules giggled as she saw Clara squirming a little... The smell was instantly getting worse for her, even over such a little change in distance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, I hope the smell isn't bothering you. But it's probably alright, you must be used to smelling this kind of thing.\" Dr. Rules said with a cruel smile. \"Huh???\" Clara shouted, a bit too obvious. \"Ohhh, don't play dumb with me girl. I had your foot almost directly in my face. It didn't quite smell like roses, either, you know...\" Dr. Rules felt great pleasure as she watched Clara blush furiously and bite on her lips after hearing those words. She was hitting her right where it hurt, and she wasn't about to stop! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it's not like it happened the first time to me. And I know my own feet stink pretty bad, sometimes... Well, every day, really. But I've never had to smell anything as bad as your feet, Clara!\" Clara was feeling desperately trapped, she knew that this Doctor spoke the truth, that's why her words stung her like a thousand gleaming daggers... She couldn't deny it, if only she could just leave already! \"Please... please stop.\" Clara spoke quietly, and Dr. Rules had to fight back laughing loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really. Do you know what you put me through? I can't just turn away my patients, even if they have, well... bad foot hygiene-\" Clara suddenly shot her a very angry glare, which amused Dr. Rules even further. \"I don't! I can't help it!\" \"Oh, please. I'm pretty sure you didn't wash up before coming here, did you?\" \"Well, not directly before, but-\" \"And you didn't even wear any socks. What were you thinking? Do you enjoy making others smell your disgusting, unwashed feet?\" \"Sh-shut up!\" <i>Oh no, I'm just getting started!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWidening her smile further, Dr. Rules now lifted her other foot as well and raising and stretching her legs, she put them both into the lap of a very shocked Clara. \"Hmmmmm... You know, it's even more comfortable this way...\" Dr. Rules purred, wiggling her sweaty toes and sending brutal waves of piercing, rotten stench up into Clara's face! It smelled as if someone had dipped some Swiss cheese in vinegar and was now rubbing it directly under her nose! Clara scrunched her face up as a simple, quick whiff was enough to turn her stomach with its brutal, sweaty aroma! \"Are you crazy, get those off me!\" Clara barked and moved to smack the offending feet back down from herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it didn't work! With great shock Clara realised that her arms were suddenly feeling incredibly heavy and her hands moved very, very slowly. She pushed weakly against the Doctor's terrible feet, but they wouldn't budge. Worse, Clara got warm, slippery sweat all over her fingers that way and it didn't help the stench either! \"Awww, isn't it cute? Poor little girl can't even stand having my feet in her lap. How do you think I felt as I had your reeking foot right in my face, huh?\" \"Shut up you crazy bitch! Let me go!\" Clara tried to get up, but it was if the feet on her lap were pressing her down... Everything was slowly starting to twist and turn. \"You know, I think you owe me one for making me smell your foot! Let me return the favor...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara watched with horror as those sweat-covered, dirty-nyloned feet rose slowly from her lap and moved slowly towards her chin... The nauseating aroma of cheese and stale sweat getting stronger with every passing second! Even her eyes were starting to get irritated by the sharp fumes, the reek of these feet was otherworldly strong! Clary grabbed them by the ankles and tried to push them down, but she might as well have been a fly. Effortlessly, they moved all the way to her face... Before setting down directly over it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smell my feet.\" Dr. Rules said calmy as she held her deadly feet firmly over Clara's face, who was effortlessly tugging on them. Finally, Clara had to breath...And even though only a part of the stench entered her nose, it blew her mind with an explosion of pure stench! Clara felt as if a horse had kicked her in the head and collected all her remaining strenght to jump up and run away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara failed horribly. Her upper body moved away from the chair, but her legs moved too slowly and she clumsily rolled to the ground. Everything was already slowly fading to black and the last thing Clara could see was two wet, deadly nylon soles coming down on her face. \"I think you already know this, but that was not medicine, in my needle. You won't be going anywhere in the near future, my dear...\" Clara heard the twisted voice of Dr. Rules say and the last thing she felt before falling unconscious was the sticky, warm feeling of sweaty feet on her face and the worst stench she had even smelled before...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clara couldn't remember what had happened during those last moments clearly... There had been... this terrible, wet feeling on her face. Moist, smothering and yet soft and smooth like velvet. And that... stench! It had been the worst she ever experienced before. Musky, sweaty, cheesy and sour. The typical stench of... feet? Yes, that was right... Feet, feet... Two nicely-shaped, but ungodly-smelling feet had been pushed over her face and knocked her out of her misery! That doctor... That hospital!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaargh!\" Clara awoke with a start and had almost jumped up, if only her body allowed her to do it already. \"Oh... No! No, no, no! This wasn't some nightmare... I'm still here!\" Clara began to have a short series of hysteric screams and wails as she tried to get up properly, but only fell down again due to her body not working properly yet. \"This fucking... what was that shit? I can't believe I let that fucking bitch do that... Oh, I'll fucking kill her when I get the chance to... I need to get out of here!\" Clara screamed, pounding her fists on the ground like a gorilla. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... listening to you is almost worse than what they did to me... No wait, I take that back...\" A frail, tired voice suddenly called out somewhere next to Clara. \"Ahh! Oh man. Now you're telling me I wasn't alone with my, erm... thoughts? *Ahem* No, what am I saying... This is great, let's get out of this fucking hole! We'll just need to wait a bit until I can use my legs properly again...\" \"Sorry Miss, but that's useless. We can't get away. I already looked. There's a door and it's locked. We're trapped in here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara cursed silently. \"Of course... after doing this, they won't just let us walk off... Hey, listen...\" Clara attempted to speak a tad more softly now, as the other voice had sounded very young. \"My name's Clara. Who are you?\" \"I'm Billy...\" \"Listen, Billy... there has to be a way out of here. And together, we have better chances! I think I will just need some more minutes before I get up and then, uh... Maybe I can pick the lock, or kick the door in? Yeah, something has to work!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Clara's blood froze as she heard a very dreaded, familiar voice laughing dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, a loud click was heard, then the door opened and a grinning Dr. Rules came in. \"I'm afraid you will have to let go of that idea, unless you still have the skill and strenght after we're done with you... Hmmmm-hehehehe... And of course, we don't intend to let go of you, both of you!\" Dr. Rules said with a beam, glancing in a direction that seemed to be complete darkness to Clara. \"Oh, but let's turn on the lights first...\" Dr. Rules said, flicking a switch nonchalantly. A series of dim, flickering lights came to life with a few buzzing sounds, bathing the room in a grim, yellow-ish light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Clara could see this Billy for herself... \"Oh my god! You're just a kid! You fucking monster!\" She spat as she glared indignantly at the Doctor. Dr. Rules just smirked and waved her hand. \"Don't thank me too much, this one was Elliot's find...\" Rules joked and Clara noticed Billy going deathly pale, more than he already was. \"Elliot?\" \"Yeah, nurse Elliot, to be exact. Come in already, baby, don't leave us waiting!\" Dr. Rules yelled as Billy began to mumble \"No... no no no no no!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara squint her eyes nervously and waited, but almost instantly, another person came through the door, it was a very pretty nurse, like Dr. Rules she appeared very young, maybe even a tad younger than the Doctor... Clara guessed her to be about 22 or 23, but what was more interesting about her was her facial expression... it was one of pure <i>evil</i>. Seldomly had Clara seen someone look quite as sadistic while enjoying it, not even from Dr. Rules... And this nurse wasn't even doing anything yet! \"No, not her! Please, please not her! Anything but her!\" Billy suddenly began to squeal as he crawled into the furthest corner and curled into a ball, almost like a hedgehog. As he whimpered quietly, Clara felt herself getting angry more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You devil! What did you do to this child?\" Nurse Elliot just smiled, but Billy answered for her, during fougth back crying. \"It... it was horrible... She did really gross things to me... Made me feel really strange and funny... It smelled so bad.\" Suddenly, Nurse Elliot threw her head back and let forth a loud, piercing shriek of a laugh that made even Dr. Rules jump a little. \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahaaaaaa! Oh, well... I made him smell my socks-\" \"Ohhh, those nasty, reeking pieces that you wear every day for work?\" Dr. Rules teasingly threw in, despite her already knowing about this \"Exactly those! Oh, how long has it been since I started to wear those? Three, four weeks? And it's so hot too, the last time! It's like my feet are sweating non-stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara angrily clenched her fists and said \"Yeah, alright, we get it, thank you!\" \"Hehehe... Oh yes, where was I? I made him smell them real good, I stuffed them in his mouth, I made him smell my bare feet, I had some... heh... fun with him. Yes... This is why he was <i>chosen</i>. And you, girl... you were chosen because you also have a unique talent... Quite related to us!\" \"Uh... please don't say-\" \"YES! Your feet! Ahahahaha!\" Nurse Elliot exclaimed, happily dancing around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara exchanged a few worried glances with Billy. Things were looking grim indeed. As Elliot saw this, she suddenly went deathly serious. \"No, you don't understand. Oh yeah, now you think, Ohhh, this woman is just craaaaaaaaaaazy, right? Hah! So what if I am! Ah no, wait, let me try again. Don't you <i>SEE</i>? You, my girl, are a rare specimen! You are young, absolutely attractive and yet blessed with such heavenly stinking feet! This is... a once in a <i>LIFETIME</i> opportunity!\" \"I agree...\" The calm, collected voice of Dr. Rules came in sharp contrast of Elliot's wild ramblings. \"I have so many ideas in mind... Had been hoarding them for some time... Waiting for a chance, only... You are this chance, Clara. You should be happy. Oh, the possibilities... They are endless!\" \"Yeah! Like that new serum you crafted not too long ago! You said you used it on this girl, didn't you, Amber?\" Elliot asked. Dr. Rules nodded smugly. \"I sure did. And just take a look! She still can't quite move her muscles, even now... Yes, unless most things I have worked on before, this new formula doesn't put the patient to sleep, but simply tells their muscles to... relax. Allowing for maximum efficiency!\" Dr. Rules exclaimed, bashing her fists together!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're full of shit, doc!\" Clara said, trying to make a triumphant grin. \"I was knocked out by your weird stuff. Mission failed!\" But this only earned her a loud laugh from Dr. Rules. \"Oh dear... You hyperventilated out of panic and started to sniff my feet directly between my toes for several minutes. In my entire career, I haven't met a single person who <i>wouldn't </i>be knocked out after experiencing that!\" Clara was looking down again, but Dr. Rules quickly clapped her hands together loudly, bringing her attention back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well! I say it's time we finally conduct some business, so to speak... Time for some experiments! As I said, my dear Elliot, Clara's body is still weak from my drug and her feet are more than potent! You could confirm for yourself how good my serum is working, or maybe you'd like to move on to something completely different, already? This first choice shall be yours, my dear colleague!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Elliot smiled broadly as she took a few steps forward. She had already made up her mind...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh yeah, I know. Let's see if this serum of yours really works as good as you told me, Amber...\" Nurse Elliot purred as she slowly walked closer to a horrified Clara. \"Well, girl... What do you say... Would you like to give my feet a nice, little whiff?\" \"Hnngh... stay away from me!\" \"You know... Usually, most people would run away once they hear I'm about to unleash my feet upon them... With good reason, too. But you don't! Hummmm... Why might that be?\" Nurse Elliot taunted with a cruel grin, finally getting within reach to the still grounded Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara frantically moved her arms around, which started to work again, slowly... but unfortunately for her, she still couldn't move the muscles in her legs at all, as soon as she tried to stand up, she lost her balance and fell down again. Clara began to furiously slap her own legs with her hands as Elliot got into position! \"Argh... please... Please work! I must get away... I must- ugh... oh god...\" Clara could smell it already. The sickening, cheesy stench of feet. It was so strong already, even though Elliot's feet were still in her strange shoes, and still relatively far away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot noticed her reaction and her own pupils widened in thrilled joy. \"Ahh! Do you smell it yet, hmmm?\" She said, outstretching her foot. \"Smelling good, hmm?\" Clara gasped as the disgusting foot came closer and closer into her field of view, she could see the dirtied, sweat-soaked parts of the socks behind the shoe's holes, and she could definitely smell it already! There was just no wait out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's so nice for you to stay! Here it comes, enjoy!\" The worst fears of Clara became reality as Nurse Elliot pulled her shoe off with great pleasure and her horrible, stink-sock-encased foot came floating directly towards her face. Clara held her breath and tried to twist her head away, but suddenly, there was another foot there, as well! Clara turned her head back and saw Nurse Elliot sitting on the floor now... And the next second, she saw nothing anymore as two big, soft walls of crusty, moist sweat-sock covered feet suddenly sprang up to her and pushed directly into her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was in pure hell... And the sniffing hadn't even started yet! Her face was getting stuffed and rubbed against endless waves of fuzzy, sticky wet sock fabric, it was moist, it was warm and it was obvious that those socks had been worn far longer than any socks should ever be on a foot... Especially on feet that had such a strong natural smell! But then, Clara's suffering intensified tenfold as she actually had to breathe in... and took a deep, loud sniff right from the toe area of Elliot's left foot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn explosion of rotten, thick stench overcame her senses, flooding her entire system with traces of cheese, old sweat, vinegar, and something distinctively bitter and sickly sweet. \"Oooh, she's doing it, she's smelling my feet! Awesome!\" The Nurse exclaimed as she pushed even harder into Clara's face with her feet, knocking her sitting form over with little problem. Clara fell on her back and desperately tried to shield her face with her hands... but it was useless, the nurse's deadly feet just moved by them and placed them directly on Clara's helpless face once more, grinding their sweat and stink into it as Clara groaned and gagged from the intense nasal onslaught!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing, Amber! I can tell she would like to do something, but... she just can't! This is too good to be true...\" Nurse Elliot said, drawing her feet back for a little while, causing Clara to quickly take huge, hungry gasps of relatively untainted air. \"Ugh... *huff* please... *cough* no more...\" \"Oh... I'm just getting started!\" Elliot said with a demonic grin, slowly peeling her sweat-soaked grimy socks off and returning her feet, now bare, but not in the least any less smelly, back on Clara's face. She giggled as she felt the cool breath of her victim's nose tickle her lethal, slimy toes, knowing that it put unspeakable aromas upon her sense of smell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot continued to gradually rub and push her bare feet into Clara's exposed face, while Billy was watching in helpless horror and Dr. Rules in cold, scientific interest. Clara got weaker and weaker with every minute of inhaling this madwoman's potent foot-funk and it just didn't stop! Eventually, everything was beginning to spin around and turn fuzzy and dark... Clara remembered that feeling... She was being defeated by unspeakably stinky feet again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But then, in the last second, Elliot pulled her feet back and said with a smile \"Wait, wait... don't go back to sleep just yet! I still have one great idea to try out first...\" \"Oh! What is it?\" Doctor Rules said, coming over as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara already feared what she was about to hear next!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nurse Elliot drew back slowly and walked around back and forth, quietly mumbling to herself while sometimes pointing at Clara or the ceiling with a triumphant smile. In the meantime, Clara was still coughing and trying to regain her breath a little bit... Even though the thick stench of cheesy, unwashed feet was still heavily present in the air, it helped, at least a little bit. It still seemed to her as if everything was tumbling and spinning ever so gently, but at least her vision began to clear up once more. Dr Rules had also walked over and got a little impatient as Elliot simply kept walking and muttering around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what is it?\" She asked and almost flinched herself as Elliot turned around lightning fast, pointing in her face and grinning widely. \"Well! I was thinking...\" Elliot flicked her tongue and licked her lips \"You said this girl had pretty good feet as well, no? Good good, ya know? The good kind?\" Dr Rules squint her eyes slightly and spoke quietly \"Yes... Yes, she most certainly has. You'd have to experience them for yourself, though. Words can hardly do them justice, hehe...\" \"Yes! So...\" Elliot turned around once more \"I think we should put them to the test right away. This kid here.\" Elliot pointed at Billy, who flinched like someone just slashed with a whip. \"He will smell them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Clara yelled suddenly. Dr Rules face distorted into a wide, demonic grin as she kept thinking. \"Ah... I see what you're thinking of. You and me, we obviously have no moral qualms about holding our horribly reeking feet into the unfortunate faces of our hapless... patients.\" \"Yeah! It's fun! Hahaha!\" \"Yes, yes, certainly... But as I was saying, this girl here does. Knowing how she's aware of the terrible state of her feet, she'd probably do anything to avoid making someone else suffer beneath them. <i>Yeeeeeeesss...</i>\" Dr Rules suddenly shivered shortly and her cheecks blushed. \"...This is going to be most interesting. Hehehe... Hahaha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara felt all the newly-regained strenght in her fading once more. She hated to admit it, but Dr Rules was right. She couldn't allow those lunatics to make some innocent child suffer the nauseating stench of her sweat-marinaded feet... She just couldn't! But what would she have to do in order to avoid that? She had absolutely no control over anything right now... Even if she cooperated, it wouldn't surprise her if those crazy bitches just stabbed her in the back afterwards, anyway... Clara sighed heavily. She would at least have to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought was interrupted by Dr Rules clapping her hands loudly. \"Well, what do you say, girl? I have a special deal for you in mind... If you make little Billy here smell <i>your</i> cute, little feet, Elliot and me won't have to slowly make you sniff yourself into a footodor-induced coma right now. I make no promises about the future, but... Let's say I will at least try to go soft on you. Or else... oh yeah! Let's say if you do <i>exactly</i> as we say, at least the boy will be spared. Otherwise we'll make sure you will never smell anything again, except for the pungent aroma of overworked feet. Poor little Billy too, of course. The choice is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Clara could even try to answer, Billy himself interjected \"Clara! Please... I don't want to smell feet anymore! Those were so disgusting...\" Nurse Elliot laughed loudly \"Oh, there's still so much more we can do with you aside from just letting you smell them like that... We will make you <i>wish </i>you're only just smelling our feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Rules snapped her finger, cutting off Elliot who was about to burst into laughter. \"Well, Clara... time's up. Time for you to choose your fate... And Billy's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one last, heavy sigh, Clara makes up her mind. </span></div></div>",

And Dr Rules's feet had been so bad that Clara was knocked out cold before. Nurse Elliot's would most likely have the same effect, if given enough time. That would be the most terrible thing... But at least it would be their fault, then! Making Billy suffer because of her own selfishness... Clara would never be able to forgive herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Rules clapped her hands in excitement and walked closer to her prey. \"Excellent! Not the most favorable answer, but it will still do!\" <i>Breaking this girl's resistance is going to be so delicious...</i>, Dr Rules thought. \"Come on, Elliot!\" She spoke out loud \"I heard this girl here wants to smell both of our feet at the same time!\" Elliot released a brief giggle before jumping over and Clara herself cursed quietly. \"I just <i>knew</i> it! Goddamn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot and Dr Rules sat down next to Clara, who still hadn't managed to get up yet and positioned their deadly weapons; biohazardous stink-feet over her. Dr Rules's were still holstered in the same shoes she wore earlier, with the dirtied nylons as well. Elliot had put her feet back into her strange, hole-ey shoes before pacing around in the room as well; Why waste perfectly toxic footsweat on the ground, if you could smear it into someone's face instead? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... one more thing. I don't want you to put up some pathetic struggle again, you hear me? You will give our feet deep, long sniffs and you will remain still and silent while doing so. Are we clear?\" Dr Rules said with a deathly serious expression on her face. \"Oh... Ooooh! She's playing the bad guy now, watch out! Hehehehehe!\" Elliot giggled, much to Dr Rules's frustration. \"Thank you for ruining that moment... But no, seriously. If you struggle and complain or refuse to smell our feet properly, the boy is going to get yours in his face. Not to mention the fact that we will have to be especially harsh on you, as well. You should be glad that we give you the chance to at least take the semi-soft way. But enough talk! Enjoy the smell.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara had little choice as both Dr Rules and Nurse Elliot kicked off their respective shoes, almost at the same time and as their glistering wet, sweaty soles were exposed to her, a wave of hot, humid air rolled over Clara's entire head. She flinched and had to suppress a loud gagging sound as she took the slightest whiff of the combined stench of those deadly, wet feet. While both of them smelled incredibly strong even on their own, the aroma was absolutely unbearable right now... And Clara hadn't even sniffed them directly, yet! That was about to change, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara had little time to appreciate the beauty of the feet above her as they descended upon her face quite rapidly. As Elliot's feet pressed onto her face with a wet, squishy sound, Clara was amazed how she had managed to build all that sweat up even after taking her sweat-soaked socks off, some time before... Her feet must sweat extremely strong at anytime! Dr Rules's feet, clad in her moist, discolored nylons weren't better at all, but seeing how they just escaped the tight confines of her work shoes, it was quite understandable that they were so sweaty. Not that it made the situation any less horrible, for Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you sniffing yet?\" Dr Rules suddenly barked, emphasising the order by slowly rubbing the entire lenght of her foot down Clara's nose. Clara tried to brace herself as good as possible, but as soon as she took the first, loud sniff, it became clear that her body would never be ready for this kind of stench. Clara's eyes shot open and tears began to form as the brutal, stinging stench of Dr Rules's nylonfeet, strong, cheesy and sour washed into her system through her lungs. Even after breathing back out, the disgusting smell just wouldn't leave... And even worse - \"Again! Do it faster!\" - Clara had to refresh the potent aroma way before she was allowed to recover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Clara was forced to sniff the reeking, moist feet of Dr Rules, the funky aroma of feet enhanced further by the distinct flavor added through her old, worn nylons over and over again, and as Dr Rules moved her feet around over her nose, she was forced to smell every stench her feet had to offer... Of course, the doctor stopped especially long when her toes were all around Clara's nose. The world started to spin faster again and her vision blurred slightly as Clara had to sniff those ten times in a row in quick succession, blasting her senses over and over again with the most brutal stench Dr Rules feet had to offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Dr Rules decided to have even more fun by taunting her victim a little bit. \"Hmm, you may note the distinct extra flavor in my foot smell... Since I am sure you are more than familiar with the stench of feet anyway, haha... But no, I am talking about my nylons... Aside from not having washed our feet for about... Hmm, how long was it? Two weeks? Three?\" \"I think it was a month or so. At least!\" Elliot chimed in cheerfully. \"Yeah, something like that. Aside from not washing our feet, we've also worn the same footwear the entire time. Can you tell? Take another sniff.\" Clara had to avoid gagging with all her might as she took a further sniff right through Dr Rules's slimy toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure you can tell. Me with my nylons and Ellie with her socks. Also we've been wearing the same shoes the entire time, naturally. While mine are relatively airtight and thus excellent for cultivating foot smell, Elliot's let a lot of air out... But that is compensated by the material making her feet sweat especially much and trust me, both of our feet are incredibly sweaty by nature.\" Dr Rules gave a satisfied sigh as she removed her feet from Clara's face. It was so moist with Dr Rules's footsweat that it was glistering and shining like a thousand drops of dew on a fresh spring morning. Except that they were far from fresh and pleasant smelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara thought this was her chance to get a nose-ful of relatively clean air. She realised too late that this was a bad idea as Elliot's feet took Dr Rules's place the very next second and Clara's desperate sniff filled her lungs to the brim with overpowering, well-fermented aroma of Elliot's cheesy feet. Even though both her and Dr Rules's feet shared the general aroma of smelly feet, right now Clara was painfully experiencing the subtle differences in their respective scents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh! Eager, isn't she? Hahaha... Again, it felt so good when your breath cooled my toes. Make it a deep one, come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Elliot's feet smelled even more of cheese than Dr Rules's did, the sour and bitter notes were somewhat weaker and replaced by distant traces of something sweet... Yet nothing close to smelling tolerable, let alone good! Much like Dr Rules had done, Elliot was making Clara sniff her feet for quite some time and eventually, she was getting a little bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is fun and all, but let's spice things up a little bit, shall we? For example, Clara's nose is doing a fine job, but her tongue is so idle right now... How about we give it a proper job, as well?\" Elliot suggested and Dr Rules responded with a quiet chuckle. \"Good timing. I was just about to suggest something of the sort as well. So, what do you say, Clara? Ready to experience both smelling and tasting our feet at the same time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was at the brink of passing out again. The combined strenght of her tormentors feet had weakened her past the limits of her usual tolerance already; It was a wonder that she was still awake at the moment. Sure, she had sworn to herself that she would do anything to at least keep the innocent Billy as safe as possible, but could she really go that far?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clara bit her teeth together and gathered all little strenght of will she had remaining in herself. She couldn't give up now. Not for her own sake, but for Billy's. She knew that if she couldn't even save this innocent child right now, there would be no chance for her to eventually save herself. She'd simply have to do it, because it was the only way. She'd have to do it for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing a heavy sigh, she squint her eyes and spoke with a weak, shaky voice \"Fine. I'll do it. Just don't lay a hand on that boy...\" Dr Rules chuckled as she heard this and she had to bite on her finger to not release a squeal of pure excitement! <i>Unbelieveable... Even after smelling feet like ours, this girl still has that much of a fight left. Ohhh... I can't imagine what breaking her must feel like!</i>, she thought, before clearing her throat and trying to speak with her usual, commanding voice \"Very well! Then open your mouth! You will now lick our feet, while smelling them at the same time!\" Try as she might, Dr Rules couldn't hide the small trace of shakiness in her voice. She was simply too excited about this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she wasn't the only one! \"Ohhh! Awesome! I can't remember the last time I made someone lick my feet!\" Elliot squealed in delight. \"It was just earlier this week...\" Dr Rules said flatly, but Elliot shook her head. \"Nah, this is still special. Let's go!\" Clara shivered as she felt the hot, sweats touch of Elliot's toes on her lips. She could already taste their rancid flavor, not to mention that they smelled directly in her nose right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said open up! And out with that tongue!\" Dr Rules commanded, and Clara dared not refuse. As soon as her tongue was out, Elliot placed her foot against it, the tip of Clara's tongue directly on the round, sweaty ball of Elliot's foot, rich with a devastating aroma. This time, Clara couldn't avoid gagging loudly. Smelling those devilish beasts had been one thing... But literally tasting them at the same time? It was pure hell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I tell you not to complain? You better start licking fast!\" Dr Rules ordered. Clara groaned weakly. She had to admit, that crazy doctor was right in some way. If she didn't pull herself together now, Billy would suffer, she would have suffered for nothing and they would both lose. She couldn't let that happen. With a gasping sound, Clara gave a long, strong lick all over Elliot's sole, taking with it an extreme amount of disgusting sweat which gathered in her mouth. \"Hmmm... Don't you dare spitting that out. Swallow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara cringed at the thought alone, but she couldn't do anything but obey. The salty load of pure sweat burned her mouth and throat like acid as it went down and once again, Clara had to seriously fight back the urge to throw it up right here and there. She was panting heavily and tried to regain her composure, but Elliot gently poked her in the nose with her big toe. \"Hey! I didn't tell you to stop, now did I? Hehehehehe!\" Clara groaned as she gave that moist, reeking foot another lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then another one. And another one. The stinging, salty taste seemed to get worse every time and soon, it never even got any better inbetween her licks. The smell was another factor, of course. With her mouth busy, Clara's nose was doing the entire job of supplying her body with oxygen. And in doing so, it also delivered loads of toxic smell directly into her system! Finally, as Clara was about to give in, the feet from her face vanished... Only to be replaced by Dr Rules's own ones the very next second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is hopeless... They will finish me right here and now! I might as well give in...</i> Clara thought as everything slowly faded to black. <br>\r\n\"Not a bad job. Now, if you serve mine in the same way, you are done and the boy gets spared.\" Dr Rules said with a grin, noticing that Clara was about to pass out. <br>\r\nDr Rules's plan worked perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bright flash of sudden energy, Clara's mind came back! <i>No... There's still a chance. I might still do this!</i> She thought as she gave a hungry lick straight to the sole of Dr Rules's foot. Licking the nylon's fabric felt distinctively different from licking a bare sole to Clara, but it still carried a similarly disgusting flavor and unfortunately, it didn't filter the sweat at all! Just like with Elliot's, Clara was forced to gulp it down and to make matters worse, Dr Rules cupped the moist toes of her foot directly over Clara's nose the entire time, blasting her continuesly with the thickest, cheesiest scent her feet were capable of. <i>This bitch is seriously trying to finish me off right now! I can't lose now...</i> Clara fought, sniffing and licking away, delivering the worst scents and aromas of Dr Rules's smelly feet over herself over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it just wouldn't stop. With every flick of her tongue, every breath her nostrils took, Clara could feel her body getting more and more intoxicated. Everything seemed to have faded away into a nonsensical mess already. She could barely hear anything anymore, and her sight was absolutely blurry and shaking. It was a true miracle her body was still surviving this brutal onslaught of foot stench!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then finally, Dr Rules's foot retraced... <i>Am I done? ...Did I really do it?</i> Clara wondered, not daring to give in to any sort of false hope yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been too early, truly. Next thing she knew, five long, absolutely wet toes actually pushed into her mouth! Panic overtook Clara as more and more foot moved into her mouth, the toes hugging her tongue tightly and showering it in sweat and another set of toes came to hug her nose in its sweaty dephs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beyond terrible. With an even stronger taste and just the worst smell, Clara's mind was getting annihilated by the devastating aroma of feet! What she didn't know was that the toes in her mouth belonged to Elliot and those around her nose to Dr Rules... They were combining the unique flavors of both feet to create the ultimate suffering for their victim! Either way, Clara had no chance. Slowly, she lost control of everything. All her muscles went limp and a last, pained groan escaped her throat as she finally passed out for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she did do her job well, didn't she? Would Dr Rules keep her promise?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clara was drifting further and further into unconsciousness, ready to let go of any and all feelings and embrace the peaceful embrace of pure nothingness on all her senses. However, in the last moment, she felt the distant sensation of a needle pricking her. And to her greatest horror, she felt everything coming back to her, with rushing speed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...should make her last a few minutes or so. Oh look, even her eyes are focused again! Why hello!\" The voice of Elliot cheered and true enough, her madly grinning visage also became clear to Clara once more. \"Well, while we are not usually the likes to deny a sweet girl such as you her much-needed beauty sleep... Especially if it was induced by our very feet, haha...\" Clara could hear the dark voice of Dr. Rules chuckle. \"...But we still need you to watch something. And we must inform you that you have failed. Tsk, such a shame, you were so close to succeeding, too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara felt a surge of anger rush through her, but she didn't even have the strenght to ball her fists. Her situation was beyond pathetic. Dr. Rules smiled as she saw Clara's furious expression and she let out an overly melodramatic sigh \"Oh dear. And to think, you were so spirited in the beginning! I really thought you wanted to save this kid...\" <i>I do want to, you fucking bitch!</i>, was what Clara wanted to say, but even her mouth wouldn't work properly. \"...oh well, too bad you were so weak. But let's wrap this up swiftly, as soon as your latest dose wears off, you will without a doubt drift away from us once more, probably instantly. You are simply that... frail.\" Dr. Rules laughed heartily for a moment and then signalled Elliot to her with a snap of her fingers. \"...Get the boy over her, Ellie...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara's pupils widened in horror. <i>You can't do this! I did everything you ordered me to do!</i> Still no use. While Elliot went off to grab Billy, Dr. Rules got down to Clara's feet, which were still safely behind their old sneakers, at least for now. But that was about to change. \"Ohhh, how it will stink when I pull those off. And poor Billy is going to smell it directly. It'll be so much fun!\" Dr Rules taunted, just as Billy really did come over, although being pushed and dragged by a much stronger Elliot. \"Aw man, he's struggling like crazy! Oh, I know! I'll just stuff one of my socks in his mouth, that should both keep him still and make him sniff better!\" Elliot said, to which Dr Rules clapped her hands. \"Excellent idea! Do so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly instantly panicked. \"No! Not your socks, please, please no! Ahhhh!\" It was no use, Elliot had already taken one and pushed it squarely into his face. The rancid, sweat-soaked piece of footwear literally took his breath away as his nose was being pushed directly into an especially dark gray area, most likely the toe zone. Elliot giggled as she started to rub the horrible, reeking sock all over his face, Billy couldn't hold his breath forever and as he did take a sniff, the powerful aroma of Elliot's sock struck his head like a bolt of lightning! Not only did the vile stench drain all his energy in no time, he also involuntarily groaned in disgust and pain... And thus opened his mouth widely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot did not waste her chance. With a swift, fluid motion her well-worn, moist sock traveled into Billy's helpless mouth, toe area first. He retched and gagged helplessly as his tongue was pushed against the fabric and received endless signals of the most terrible tastes. Elliot kept pushing as far as the sock would go in... Then, she simply let go of Billy completely! As she had thought, he tumbled to the ground instantly, his hands rushing to his mouth in order to get the revolting sock out once more... But Dr. Rules quickly caught them and pulled them away, leaving him hanging there awkwardly with his knees on the ground but arms in the air. \"Come now, assist me! I hold his hands still, now you have to pull the shoes off!\" Dr Rules said, and Elliot was too eager to assist her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly, just like Clara herself could only watch in horror as Elliot took Clara's feet and slowly lifted them up from the ground. Billy tried shaking his hands free, but Dr. Rules was too strong. He tried to push the sock out of his mouth with his tongue, but it was stuck. He only ended up licking it over and over again and growing weaker from the disgusting taste it had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Elliot finally did it: With a swift move of her hands, Clara's shoes flew off... And a huge cloud of hot, moist air evaporated from her exposed feet... Directly into Billy's face! Billy's eyes rolled up and his entire body shook as he got his first whiff of Clara's feet. It was absolutely devastating, a hulking stench of stale sweat, cheddar cheese and the unmistakable scent of unwashed feet. Billy's mind worked overtime as his weakened brain tried to comprehend the situation. <i>Clara... The only one on my side... And now I have to smell her feet... It stinks!</i> Billy tried to scream his despair out, but due to the moist sock still stuck in his mouth, all he could produce was a pathetic, sputtering mumble. \"Hmmmmhmmmpffff!\" \"Ohhh! Ohhh! What what, what was that?\" Elliot chirped in excitement. \"You want to smell them more closely? Here you go, enjoy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot laughed as she seized Billy by the back of his head and dove him face first into the soft, mushy soles of Clara's large feet. Despite the unbearable stench hammering on him the entire time, Billy couldn't help but note just how soft and smooth Clara's feet were... Also incredibly large. But for the most part, he somehow was content with being forced to endure their stench... At least, he knew that it was not her fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is all my faul!</i> Clara's mind scolded herself and she began to cry in absolute desperation as she helpessly watched Billy struggle, his face burried in the ungodly dephs of her sweaty soles. Even now, her horrible feet couldn't stop sweating, it was oozing out and running down Billy's face in various places... Dr Rules laughed cruelly as she noted Clara's reaction. \"Oh, my bad, bad, little girl. See what your stinky feet have brought you now, hmm? First you told us you want only the best for Billy, and now this! See how he suffers, just because of your feet. You could have avoided this. But you didn't.\" Dr Rules couldn't suppress a squealish laugh as she saw her words striking the hapless Clara like a cracking whip. Clara was visibly shaking now, her eyes closed firmly to block the image of Billy suffering at her feet and more and more did her tears stream out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>An image of the utmost beauty...</i> Dr Rules noted and shed a single tear as well, not because she felt bad for any of her victims, but simply because the excellence of the situation moved her so. Finally, Billy made an especially pitiful sound as all his muscles went limp. \"She did it! She did it! Lil Clara knocked the brat out! Huzzah!\" Elliot cheered, jumping up in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I suppose this is it, for now. Now you really fucked up, girl. You will fall asleep soon enough anyway, but let me help you...\" Clara felt the horribly familiar feeling of moist, warm toes slipping over her face and entrapping her nose once again. <i>I deserve this...</i> Clara thought as she took the first sniff, blasting her mind with an overwhelming stench of feet. She took another sniff, even deeper this time and felt herself starting to fade away. <i>I am...guilty</i> Another huge, painful sniff, and Clara was finally, absolutely knocked out. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a long, dreadful sleep in total dark nothingness, Clara finally awoke again. The first thing she noticed when she opened her eyes was the blinding, unbearable light coming from every direction, so she quickly shut them again. And still, wide, colorful spots very visible in her vision. It was terrible! Clara had no idea how much time had passed since she was knocked out brutally by Dr Rules's footsmell, but it felt like it had been weeks. Clara's ears were ringing and despite lying completely still, it felt as if everything was spinning and tilting sideways slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about five minutes until everything cleared down and Clara was able to relax somewhat. The ringing in her ears was replaced by eerie, distant sounds of somebody typing and hushed, incomprehensible voices and her vision was once more complete darkness. Now Clara decided to change this by opening her eyes once again. Yup, she was almost directly looking into some sort of lamp, actually a large multitude of smaller lamps attached to a large mechanical construction which was looming over her. Clara tried to move without thinking and suddenly found that she couldn't do so... The next instant, she let out a scream of shock and anger as she looked down on her body and found thick metal straps holding each of her limbs tightly to a sort of elevated table on which she was lying. She was also tilted backwards slightly, which felt a little odd, but the real concern was the incoming \"clack clack\" of somone's footsteps. And Clara could already guess who those belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good mornin' sunshine! Hope you had a pleasant sleep, my dear... Because I'm afraid things might turn very unpleasant again for you, very soon again!\" Dr Rules said with a cruel grin as she finally walked within Clara's field of vision. \"You... damn psychopath! When are you going to let us go! Didn't you already have enough fun?\" Clara screamed in anger. Dr Rules just chuckled and waved her hand. \"Ohohoho, we haven't even properly <i>started</i> the fun yet. Besides, this isn't so much about fun. It's about... <i>science</i>...\" Dr Rules moaned the last word in an overly sexual way, like someone experiencing seven orgasms at the same time. Clara found it to be a little disturbing, also because Dr Rules was just about to start drooling when she suddenly catched herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for me, at least. I think Ellie's all in for the fun. And I'm not about to deny her that... So! I'm sorry, but you two will just have to stay with us, for a while.\" Dr Rules smiled and licked her lips as she saw Clara's eyes widening in horror as soon as \"you two\" was mentioned. \"Oh my god... Billy! What did you do to him?\" Dr Rules smirked \"You mean after you knocked him out with the rancid stench of your disgusting, stinky feet?\" She felt a wave of arousal wash over herself as Clara flinched visible from these words alone. <i>Ohh girl... You're making this almost too easy.</i> Dr Rules shook her head and cleared her throat before continuing. \"*Ahem* Yes, well, we intentioned to have the same kind of fun as you already know with him as well. Well, he also already knows it pretty much, but still. Sadly, since your feet did such a good job, he was out for hours, so he's waiting in a similar room as you, right now. Don't worry, we'll personally make sure he won't miss any of the fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Rules laughed heartily as Clara was shook by a fit of undying rage. \"Easy, easy now. Not like you will miss out on it. Here, have a sample!\" Dr Rules smirked as she raised one foot, still clad in the same nylons and shoes as before and shaking the shoes off eagerly, until it fell to the ground with a loud clunk. Dr Rules instantly flexed and spread her toes out widely, taking in the furious expression in Clara's face with great pleasure. <i>Just look how much anger she still has... How much energy! She still hasn't succumered to despair yet! How long will it take... Oooh, I'm so excited!</i> Dr Rules thought gingerly before pushing her moist, reeking foot squarely into Clara's face, rubbing it around slowly. Clara gave an angered growl, the slick, steamy touch of nyloned sweat-foot filling her senses once more with the all-too familiar scent of Dr Rules's overworked feet while the skin on her face was blessed with the soft, silky touch of the amazingly smooth and squishy sole, although that sensation was ruined by the insane amount of sweat it brought directly to her head as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dr Rules watched her victim struggle weakly and effortlessly under her slimy foot, she couldn't help but taunt her some more \"Hmmm. How does it feel to be trapped in a situation like this? To have feet as magnificent as mine coming straight into your face and knowing you can't escape, can't fight back, can do absolutely nothing? How does it feel to be completely and utterly helpless?\" To Dr Rules's amusement, Clara seemed to get only angrier at this as well... \"Oh well. You'll realise I speak the truth soon enough. There's nothing you can do...\" With that, Dr Rules slowly retracted her foot again and slid it back into her shoe. \"I hope the smell is good, as always?\" \"*cough* *pant* Fuck you... fuck you...\" Indeed, the smell had been quite similar to before. A thick, heady aroma of cheese and sweat, unpleasant and nauseating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, just wait what Elliot will have in store for you...\" \"Huh?\" \"Well, see!\" Dr Rules said brightly, clapping her hands and starting to pace around. \"We're about to do a few tests with you. For the first one, we have something really simple in mind. We know you're relatively quick to faint and it's usually harder for people to faint when they are in a position like you right now: Flat on your back, with your legs slightly elevated.\" Clara checked it quickly, Dr Rules was exactly right \"...So, the question is: How much will we have to make it worse to achieve the same effect even in this situation? Ellie is preparing for it right now. She'll run the test and I'll observe and collect data. Oh, and if you wonder what exactly Nurse Elliot is doing, I just told her to run around the building about ten times.\" Clara's face fell. \"The <i>entire</i> hospital building? But... it's huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Rules laughed \"Yes, Ellie's been out for about 30 minutes now. And as I know her, she's running like someone on fire right now. Quite literally, considering the temperatures outside.\" Clara gulped noisily, causing Dr Rules to release a throaty laugh once more. \"Oh yes, I can see you understand. It's all to get her feet ready. Her socks can soak up a LOT of sweat and trust me, this girl's feet produce a LOT of sweat as well and combined with the heat, this should make for... the perfect brew! Ahehehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Rules was about to start a mad laugh, as suddenly the door to the room was smashed open and a painfully familiar voice cried out \"I did it, Amber! *pant wheeze* I ran all rounds... *gasp* FULL SPEED!\" Dr Rules clapped her hands in great joy. \"Perfect! Come over here, I knew I could rely on you!\" Clara trembled as she heard Elliot walk over... each and every one of her steps was a dull, shishy sound, telling her exactly the kind of condition her feet were in right now! And even worse... Clara could smell her. And it didn't smell nice. \"Oh god... don't tell me this is the smell of her feet- Oh god!\" Clara sputtered as Elliot walked directly up to her and looked into her face from above. Sure enough, Elliot's face alone was red and glistering with sweat... Clara did not dare imagine what her feet must look right now... But she was afraid she'd find out way too soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench was overwhelming already, despite Elliot's feet being quite a way under Clara's head and having the back of her head facing them, rather than her face. It smelled definitely sharper than before, but it still had the overly thick and heavy aroma of spicy cheese. \"Hey there! I'm so happy that you're awake right now! Because I worked really hard to make my feet as stinky as possible! Enjoy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara didn't even have time to scream in horror as Elliot kicked one foot up, her loose hole-shoe flying away and then quickly but softly brought it down directly on her victim's face. Clara was in hell! The intense heat and moisture of the foot was brutal enough to knock someone out, but the stench was indescribable! It smelled very similar to how Elliot's feet has smelled before, only much, much stronger! Clara struggled and squirmed in her bounds as every breath brought with it pure agony to her nose! Clara tried to scream, but quickly found one stuffy sock foot pressing itself tightly against her lips, muffling her screams into weak murmurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Rules ran to her side with a small clipboard, on which she hurriedly scribbled some lines. Her notes soon became nonsense as she was taken in more and more by the display in front of her eyes. Even SCIENCE couldn't compare with this. \"Oh dear... how she struggles... how she suffers! My... my goodness!\" Elliot on the other hand took everything much more lightly \"Ahehehe, oh man, this feels so great!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Clara was finally starting to feel really weakened. The stench was obviously much worse than before, but the Doctor had been right, she was surviving for longer now. It obviously wasn't a good thing, though. With every breath, every laboured sniff, she absorbed more and more rancid foot odour through that horribly discoloured, sopping weat sock foot. More and more sweat oozed out and ran down her face. It was pure torment! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she heard Dr Rules say \"Ok... Take them back for a bit... She stopped struggling, let's see if she's still with us, and as the feet came off her face, Clara gasped and dared to open her eyes again. Her eyes seemed to linger at one spot for too long and her expression suddenly changed too, it looked almost... pleading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Rules sighed heavily and slowly stood up straight. \"All right, we might have something there...\" Dr Rules wordlessly turned to the door and loud footsteps from outside were suddenly heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she sighed heavily. \"Awww man... This could be trouble!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The doors to the hospital creaked open with a ghostly wail, rays of sunlight entering into the dark and dreary reception area. A pair of shiny, near impeccable boots first entered, then came its host.<br>\r\nOffice John Smith was a man of average proportions: average build, average height, average weight, even average IQ. However, the only thing above average was his duty to the community, and to \u201cprotect and serve\u201d his fellow man. <br>\r\nStanding just a few inches below six feet, he had the standard build required of a law enforcement officer, muscles bulging underneath his brown buttoned shirt and khaki pants. A deputy badge was worn proudly on his left breast, a symbol of excellence in the field and beyond. Wearing a black tie to match, he was the spitting image of the quintessential police officer. <br>\r\nRunning a nervous hand across his forehead, his fingers grazed against his blonde buzz cut as he immediately took note of his surroundings.<br>\r\nThe reception area as he had feared was deserted, devoid of any human life of activity. Blankets of dust had already accumulated on the coaches and other pieces of furniture. Magazines dating back years were scattered across blocks of wood mistaken as coffee tables. And just to add even more credence to his initial suspicions, the receptionist was absent from her position, leaving behind a rusted bell and a rolling chair.<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAnd she said my university was a ghost town,\u201d</i> he smirked aloud, hearkening back to a previous conversation with his wife. Officer Smith was a prime advocate for justice, but he isn\u2019t so diligent in his work as to not make light of an already dark situation. <br>\r\n<i>A teenage girl disappearing into a hospital with no evidence suggesting a kidnapping or any potential witnesses may be seen as weird by some people, but weird was just another Tuesday for Officer Smith.<br>\r\nClara\u2019s mom, Hannah, had called 9-1-1 about fifteen minutes ago, a full two hours after her daughter was supposed to finish her medical appointment. Every time she tried Clara\u2019s cellphone, she got voicemail. Same for the hospital. So naturally, she feared for the worst and notified the authorities. <br>\r\nThankfully, Smith happened to be in the area, so with nothing else on the radar, decided to take the initiative.</i> <br>\r\nFor a second, he contemplated reporting this to his department to mobilize a full investigation. After all, he had his thumb on his field radio clipped on his shoulder. Then, he remembered that most of his colleagues were either off-duty for personal reasons, or supervising the latest Civil War Reenactment in the city park.<br>\r\n<i>\u201cNo need to make the boys worry about something I can verify for myself,\u201d</i> he reasoned to himself, shrugging off his gut feeling to radio for backup.<br>\r\nOblivious to him, this would be his first mistake.<br>\r\nApproaching the receptionist desk warily, he kept one hand scratching his chin and the other resting firmly on his sidearm, a .45 caliber Glock handgun. Strapped to his belt, the gun was his most reliable partner, one that he could call on without a moment\u2019s hesitation. <br>\r\nHis eyes narrowed in suspicion as he peered over the desk, only to see an archaic computer about 15 years past its expiration date and a mountain of old files stacked each other. Eyeing the mess of parchment, he was about to investigate further when a sudden noise beyond the double doors to the right caught his attention. <br>\r\nIt was loud, jarring, almost like a metallic screech. Naturally, his curiosity got the better of him.<br>\r\nPushing down the leathery strap to his holster, he grasped the gun handle as he circled around the desk. His instinct once again told him to radio in for support, before he stumbled upon something bigger than he could handle.<br>\r\nAnd he was starting to ponder that option when a voice, distinctly feminine, sounded across the hallway. It was desperate, unfiltered and powered by raw emotion. His trained ear could pick up many things, but that was definitely a cry for help. <br>\r\nDrawing the Glock instinctively, he quietly pulled back the slide of the semi-automatic, taking off the safety. A soft clicking sound confirmed the weapon was combat-ready. He had taken the oath, and now it was time to follow it through.<br>\r\nAfter all, if he hesitated now he\u2019d be putting an innocent girl\u2019s life to chance. He had all the \u201cprobable cause\u201d he needed; now was the time to act. <br>\r\nKicking open the double doors with his boot, he was immediately greeted by darkness. The ceiling lights were useless, and the medical equipment around him didn\u2019t even seem to be plugged in. Officer Smith's eyes narrowed irritably as his worst fears were confirmed, and he realized that this hospital could be serving something else then medicine: namely adolescent teenaged girls. <br>\r\nGripping the handle with both hands, he brandished it in the firing-ready position as he checked his left and right. After making sure the coast was clear (for now), he slightly relaxed his grip.<br>\r\nBiting his lip, Smith quickly brandished his flashlight on the other hand, forging a white beam of light through this sea of darkness. Aiming his Glock in the direction of the light, he let his academy instruction kick in.<br>\r\nCautiously padding across the abandoned corridor, he twisted his body left to right at the various rooms that flanked him. The flashlight would occasionally pass over empty beds, skimming over old T.V.s, baskets of laundry, even mountains of worn sneakers, oddly enough.<br>\r\nProdding one door halfway shut open with the toe of his boot, he waved his gun inside, only to immediately turn away in disgust.<br>\r\n\u201cGahhh,\u201d he grimaced, nearly vomiting into his sleeve. The putrid stench of what was once socks that could\u2019ve been worn by trolls permeated into the hallway, catching him off guard. Mentally unprepared for this nauseating assault to his nostrils, he could only glare at the mountain of socks atop the patient bed for a fleeting moment before closing the door in disgust.<br>\r\nThe smell, however acidic and intense it may be, had a distinct origin that even he was perplexed to discover: an accumulation of sweat and pure body odor built up over days, possibly weeks without a washing machine.<br>\r\nReaching the end of the corridor, he reached a crossroads in his path. The right seemed to be more of the same, while the left contained a sign that faintly read, \u201cGeneral Surgery.\u201d<br>\r\nPushing through the double doors with his shoulder, he reached another metallic hallway, only with the same odor only amplified present. Producing a spare handkerchief from his pocket, he held it over his nose to somewhat mask the scent as he advanced.<br>\r\nStill not deterred by the ominous, hostile atmosphere, he continued to inspect each room, inevitably coming to the startling realization that something is fundamentally wrong with this establishment. Who, or more possibly what, was the real question.<br>\r\nOccasionally shooting wary glances over his shoulder, Officer Smith reluctantly traveled through the literal sweatshop, with the smell only growing more repugnant along the way. A rookie would've followed protocol, and simply waited until backup came.<br>\r\nBut he knew better. When it comes to human trafficking, they tend to move between places with no indication of a visible transition. If he didn't at least process a face, then Clara would be as good as dead.<br>\r\nComing to a stop a few yards from the doors he had entered through, he was finally about to call in for backup anyways when he heard <i>her </i>voice.<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh dear\u2026.how she struggles! My...my goodness.\u201d</i><br>\r\nSmith wasn\u2019t an expert on the medical profession by any means of the word, but even he knew that doctors tend to take their work, especially the life-threatening variety, quite seriously. Having spent two nights in the emergency room for his best friend, Mike, to finish undergoing a kidney transplant, the tone of the doctor most certainly wasn\u2019t \u201ceuphoric and elated.\u201d<br>\r\nTaking quicker, more deliberate steps towards the source of the voice, he kept his gun at the ready, his index finger itching to squeeze and his heart racing a mile a minute. <br>\r\nThere was a certain amount of pleasure in those words, of the sexual kind. It was almost like she was relieving herself off of a victim, possibly Clara.<br>\r\nSeemingly confirming his epiphany, his nose began shriveling up as he recognized the rancid stench from earlier, now prevalent in this corridor. It was like someone had ran a marathon around the hospital, and used their sneakers as a ceiling fan. <br>\r\nHis back collided with the wall as he inched towards the corner of the corridor, holding his gun close to his chest and taking slow, calculated breaths. Mentally preparing himself for whatever was around the corner, he checked to make sure the magazine was loaded. If bad came to worse, it\u2019ll be empty after he finishes up.<br>\r\nHis trained ear picked up on some other noises, noises that could\u2019ve emitted from two animals in the wild mating, much less a \u201cnurse\u201d shouting her elation. Whatever depraved, demented souls were behind this sexual torture, he was determined to put a stop to it.<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOk...take them back for a bit\u2026\u201d</i> Her voice now resembled a somewhat restrained, more scientific tone, like the professional that this woman pretends to be. <br>\r\nAs soon as he turned around the corner, he spotted a single room to the left, with an illuminated entrance that made it impossible to miss. Narrowing his eyes, he began to stalk towards it, abandoning any element of surprise. <br>\r\n<i>\u201cAlright, we might have something here\u2026\u201d </i><br>\r\nThe door, slightly cracked, was directly within his sights. As his boots sounded into the metallic floor, he could hear their excited shouts melt into hushed whispers. Whether for better or worse, he had just given away his location. <br>\r\nBut all that would be worth it to bring a little girl back home to her mother. <br>\r\nHis footsteps resembled impending thuds on the floor as he came within earshot of the doorknob, only for it to begin turning from inside the room.<br>\r\nAs soon as the door opened, everything changed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Officer Smith\u2019s commanding voice bellowed throughout the room.<br>\r\nCharging in with only his Glock as backup, he quickly took a mental snapshot of his environment, before his eyes widened. For the first time in his career, John was legitimately speechless. <br>\r\n<i>There are a few times in the life of Officer Smith where everything just stopped: time froze, and so did the world, captured in a perfect freeze frame. It\u2019s the moments where he remembers exactly where he was, what he was doing, and how this one moment would change his life, forever.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, these were one of those moments.</i> <br>\r\nFirst, he noticed the closest person, a stern yet slim woman with light brown hair and hazel eyes. Doing a quick head-to-toe examination, he noticed that she was wearing a white physician\u2019s uniform, pretty ironic considering what she was doing right now.<br>\r\nThen, he swung to his right and zeroed in on the second perpetrator, a college-aged nurse with a wild, slightly unhinged look on her face. Sporting blonde hair, she wore the same uniform and gave off the same uneasy, possibly mentally unstable vibe. <br>\r\nFinally, his eyes focused in on Clara, the innocent in all this.<br>\r\nStrapped to an elevated metallic table, Clara was tilted backwards so that her head was much closer to the ground than the ceiling. A giant mechanical construction loomed menacingly above head, adorned with various lamps that threatened to blind her.<br>\r\nGlaring up weakly with her face resembling a plush tomato because of all the blood rushing to her temple, she made an excited sound as she realized help had finally arrived to liberate her.<br>\r\nAnd just to put the poisoned cherry on top of the rotten apple, those two seemed to be enjoying torturing this teenaged girl.<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity of simply staring dumbfounded, Smith returned his incensed gaze to the older woman, aiming his muzzle at her chest cavity. <br>\r\n\u201cIs there a problem, officer?\u201d she finally managed to say after clearing her throat, her voice tepid and skittish. Clearly, she tried to phrase her words correctly, while remaining oblivious to the incriminating evidence all around. <br>\r\nNoticing that the name tag on her coat read, \u201cDr. Rules,\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but wonder how any semi-reputable medical school would even license this clearly disturbed woman. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell kinda operation you running here, Doc? Kidnapping young girls, forcing them to be your own personal lab rats? I thought hospitals help people, not force them into playing whatever sick game this is,\u201d he growled, his voice finally returning to him as well.<br>\r\n\u201cWe are,\u201d the other nurse insisted, before taking a step forwards. \u201cWe\u2019re-\u201d<br>\r\nSmith briefly aimed your gun at her. \u201cShut up. You take one more step and I\u2019ll put a bullet through your kneecap. You try to run, and I\u2019ll put one in your chest. You understand?\u201d<br>\r\nBriefly scanning her lab coat, he found her name, \u201cNurse Elliot.\u201d <br>\r\nShe nodded, before wisely taking a step backwards.<br>\r\nNoticing her reluctant compliance, he returned his glare back to Dr. Rules, the \u201cbrains\u201d of this operation.<br>\r\nDespite the current circumstances, she maintained a stoic, almost casual exterior. Her internal psyche, however, was a beast of its own.<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have any right being here, officer. This is a restricted area, and I suggest you leave now,\u201d Dr. Rules demanded simply, enunciating each word with an authoritative tone to appear imposing in front of a man currently holding her at gunpoint.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere unless you and Dr. Strangelove over here start explaining just what the hell you\u2019re doing with that young girl. And you can start by untying her,\u201d he retorted, nodding towards Clara whose senses were returning.<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to explain anything to you,\u201d Elliot started to respond angrily, before Dr. Rules held up her hand to silence her.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done nothing wrong, officer. If the need to satiate our human curiosity is a sin, then by all means, guilty as charged. But as you can see, this is all a matter of\u2026.<i>science</i>,\u201d she almost moaned the last word while taking a prolonged breath, long and drawn-out. <br>\r\nSomething about the way she said that gave Smith shivers, but he shrugged it off. <br>\r\n\u201cYou call this science? Forcing people to be pawns in your twisted experiments, keeping them in this dungeon away from their loved ones?\u201d he pointed out.<br>\r\nShe almost smirked, like she was enjoying her aura of superiority in science over him. \u201cScience isn\u2019t perfect, officer, and neither are we. We\u2019re merely fulfilling our hypothesis to its logical conclusion. As they say, success requires experimentation.\u201d<br>\r\nSmith couldn\u2019t tell if it was her calm, collected composure, or her coy grin, but there was just something...<i>off </i>about this woman.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a Glock, Dr. Rules. It\u2019s killed criminals like you before, and it\u2019ll be killing criminals long after you\u2019re behind bars. Here\u2019s what I think. If you don\u2019t tell me what you\u2019re doing with this girl and if you\u2019re holding any other people here, then I predict in the next twenty seconds you\u2019ll be suffering a sudden case of lead poisoning. How\u2019s that for a hypothesis, Doc?\u201d he snarled, pulling back the hammer on his handgun to emphasize his threat. <br>\r\nShe bit her lip, perhaps contemplating a snide remark. Smartly, she swallowed her pride before crossing her arms indignantly. <br>\r\n\u201cThis is me asking nicely. Untie her. NOW!\u201d he grated, briefly gesturing at the still bound and groggy Clara with his weapon. <br>\r\nAlmost like it was a side thought, Dr. Rules lowered her gaze to Clara, who was still breathing heavily through her mouth. Pure adrenaline was rushing through her veins as she realized that the tables were finally turning, literally. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah...you heard him, bitch!\u201d she spat weakly, putting as much malice and hate into her words as possible without wincing due to asphyxiation. <br>\r\nInfuriated by her remark, Dr. Rules made a step towards her, but Office Smith intercepted her, nearly jamming the barrel of the gun into the base of her neck. <br>\r\n\u201cYou may think you\u2019re smarter than all of us, Dr. Rules, but the truth is that you\u2019re not. What you\u2019re doing is wrong, and if you can\u2019t see that, then you\u2019re dumber than you look. Hell, I know you better than you know yourself,\u201d he told her through a scathing whisper, keeping the muzzle pressed down on her neck.<br>\r\nGritting her teeth irritably, she slowly turned back towards him, as he continued.<br>\r\n\u201cPeople like you get off on this power. You like the control you have over weaker people; you crave it, don\u2019t you? Maybe that\u2019s why you do it, to feel like your bullshit science is actually worth a damn. But here\u2019s the thing. You\u2019re not in control anymore. I am. And just to be clear, you don\u2019t have that power over Clara anymore. She doesn\u2019t have to fear you anymore,\u201d he declared firmly.<br>\r\nBriefly locking eyes with Clara, he nodded in understanding, to which she reciprocated with a gratifying smile. <br>\r\nAs he did that, Dr. Rules took advantage of his monologue to give the smallest indication of a nod to Elliot, who had remained quiet and subdued since her initial outbursts. <br>\r\nNodding in understanding, Elliot began slowly lifting her right leg behind her, before blindly reaching for her socked foot. <br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d she sighed, feigning defeat. <br>\r\nReaching out towards the table, she wrapped her fingers around a knob, and began turning it clockwise. The table immediately began resembling its horizontal position, with Clara\u2019s head slowly lifting from the ground. <br>\r\nAfter ten seconds, Clara was level with the counter next to her. Still writhing against the restraints, she gave another appreciative smile to Officer Smith, who kept his weapon trained on Dr. Rules.<br>\r\nOblivious to him, Elliot began quietly peeling off her sock, tugging at the brownish, moist end of the fabric with her fingers. Slowly, the sock began sliding off her ankle.<br>\r\nNow, Dr. Rules began freeing Clara from her sweaty prison, slowly unbuckling her leathery bonds. Naturally, she was just stalling for time.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sad, Dr. Rules. I\u2019m sure your prison roommate will share your same...<i>passion </i>for science,\u201d Clara mocked as Dr. Rules begrudgingly undid the leathery strap wrapped around her right forearm, before starting on her wrist.<br>\r\nGlaring at her with the utmost contempt, it was obvious even from Officer Smith\u2019s perspective that she wanted to strangle the girl. Thankfully, the gun pressed against her neck begged to differ.<br>\r\nOut of her periphery, Dr. Rules could see Elliot finally remove her sock completely, unveiling her bare foot, in all its sweaty glory. Narrow and well-arched, her toes were adorned with faded black nail polish. Almost gliding across the room with the subtlety of a ninja, Elliot\u2019s naked foot left sweat marks on the floor.<br>\r\nFinally untying the her wrist strap, Dr. Rules briefly looked down on the ground, noticing Elliot\u2019s shadow approaching. Either by dumb luck or rookie oversight on Smith\u2019s part, he had neglected to check on Eliot's position.<br>\r\nMoving in a crouched position behind him, Elliot held her sweaty sock in one hand, the sweat practically dripping off. Now literally a yard away from jumping on him, she gave a slightly confident nod to her partner.<br>\r\nStopping, Dr. Rules turned towards John, flashing him a knowing grin.<br>\r\n\u201cSo officer, you wanted to know what we were doing down here. Fair enough, but allow me the honor of introducing my hypothesis. Do you like women\u2019s feet?\u201d she asked with a mischievous glint in her eyes, her grin only growing bigger at his slightly confused expression. <br>\r\nHe was taken aback by this unorthodox question. \u201cNo, why?\u201d<br>\r\nHer grin grew even wider. \u201cFunny. Because I theorize within five minutes, you\u2019re going to be licking my feet like the dog you are. If you would be so kind, Dr. Elliot\u2026\u201d <br>\r\nBefore Officer Smith could respond to this seemingly ludicrous threat, Elliot pounced on him from behind.<br>\r\nHe thought he had the situation under control, that was, until she forced her sock around his nose.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elliot literally threw herself torso first into Officer Smith\u2019s unsuspecting back, catching him off guard in a single moment of hesitation.<br>\r\nWith his attention focused on Dr. Rules, he was completely susceptible to an attack from behind, a desperation move facilitated by the oldest doctor and carried out by the true \u201cwild card\u201d of the two. <br>\r\n\u201cGet off you crazy bi-ummph!\u201d Smith\u2019s voice was suddenly muffled by her sock clamped firmly around his mouth.<br>\r\nArms flailing about wildly, he was hell-bent on throwing this clearly unhinged woman off his back, but soon found that with each frantic breath he took in, he was breathing out through her moist sock.<br>\r\nHer legs swung like a pendulum as he twisted his hips left to right, trying to fling her to the ground but she clung to him like hot glue. Wrapping her forearm around his neck, Elliot was adamant in snaring her prey, even at great cost to herself.<br>\r\nClara\u2019s surprised yelp and look of absolute horror was scary enough, but Dr. Rules possessed a look of demonic glee, her cold, scientific tone melting into a euphoric sigh.<br>\r\nSmith was attempting to grab her by the hair and hurl her off with one hand while keeping his gun arm trained on Dr. Rules, who was simply staring in hushed excitement, clearly waiting for an opening to capitalize in. <br>\r\nAs he staggered back towards the table, he was forced into a predicament: either waste his energy trying to throw her off knowing that she clearly had the better position, or simply shoot her now and pay for the hospital bill later.<br>\r\nIn a moment of desperation like this, John chose the latter.<br>\r\nAfter making one last plea to her that was naturally muffled by her damp sock, he reluctantly took his sights off of Dr. Rules and aimed the handgun at himself, moving the muzzle around his uniform and towards Elliot\u2019s lab coat. <br>\r\nHis greatest mistake was not just in turning his back to the \u201cmuscle\u201d of the two, Nurse Elliot, but in underestimating the true unpredictability hidden within the \u201cbrain\u201d of the devious duo, Dr. Rules.<br>\r\nJust as he found the nonlethal portion of her torso, Dr. Rules made her move, lunging at him in a frantic decision to seize the ultimate equalizer in this situation. <br>\r\nGrabbing his handgun just before he could pull the trigger, she smartly forced her own index finger into the trigger guard, preventing him from firing. Her next move was wrapping her slender fingers around his balled fist, and attempting to tear the gun away from his grasp. <br>\r\nGritting her teeth in frustration, she brought her right knee, and thrusted it into his groin with all of her weight behind it. Excruciating pain washed over Office Smith as he immediately stiffened, his sore testicles throbbing rapidly. <br>\r\nWincing heavily, his knees buckled instinctively as surges of pain shot through his thighs and torso.<br>\r\nTaken off guard by her low blow, Dr. Rules exerted enough sheer willpower to wrench the gun away from his grasp, her sharp fingernails clawing at his palm to ensure no sudden misfire. <br>\r\nAs lines of blood dripped off his knuckles, Dr. Rules backed up slowly, a downright sadistic grin crossing her face as Elliot took advantage.<br>\r\nWithout the gun to distract her, Elliot easily wrapped her long legs around his torso, crossing her ankles as her thighs tightened around his waist. Leaning on his spine with all of her body weight on top, Smith was being attacked on all sides, but now, his senses were under siege.<br>\r\n\u201cGahhh!\u201d Elliot\u2019s sock pressed firmly around his nose, clinging to it like a wet rag and refusing to let go.<br>\r\nAn explosion of rotten, vile stench attacked his nostrils without mercy, the smell intoxicating at best and repulsive at worst. It permeated his sense of smell with the subtlety of a graveyard of corpses, causing his nose to shrivel in half disgust, half horror while his face became a tortured mask. <br>\r\nThe foul stench was so thick it quite literally slapped him across the face with every second that Elliot pressed her damp footwear across his face, and while Officer Smith was a varsity swimmer in high school, he could only hold his breath for so long. <br>\r\nNow in control of the situation, Elliot used both hands to stretch her sock over his nose like a rubber band, relishing in his loud grunts as he struggled to hold his breath. <br>\r\nAs she continued constricting her legs around his chest, he soon found it harder and harder to abstain from oxygen. Her thighs were strategically tightening against his ribcage, making it harder and harder for him to breathe.<br>\r\nAs Elliot tightened her vice grip over him, he had no choice but to open his mouth before he succumbed to asphyxiation. His head was starting to resemble a plush tomato with all the blood rushing to his head, and his vision was beginning to blur. So, Officer Smith chose the lesser of two evils, and opened his mouth to breath.<br>\r\nCapitalizing on a golden opportunity, Elliot continued smearing her drenched sock all over his face. Watching with baited breath as he took the inevitable breath, a coy grin crossed her face as she felt that initial gush of air seep through her fingers. <br>\r\nThe putrid stench hit him like a brick through a glass window, instantly breaking through any mental barriers that he prepared. Taking it all in, he both retched and coughed violently.<br>\r\nInhaling forcibly through her sock, Officer Smith immediately felt his strength start to erode away, as if her foot aroma was somehow sapping away at his willpower. Still trying to throw her off, he found his struggles to grow more and more reticent with each sniff he took out of necessity.<br>\r\nThe repulsive fumes of her foot-drenched sweat continued to attack his nostrils. His eyes bulged in shock as the aroma began penetrating his honed mental psyche, whilst killing his brain cells with a stench that could\u2019ve possibly emanated from a corpse. <br>\r\nNot only was this method demeaning on every level, it was also surprisingly effective. He could feel his sense of self starting to evaporate as his eyes began fluttering. His arms began flailing more than fighting off her advances, and her weight began feeling heavier by the moment.<br>\r\nSeeing no other alternative, Officer Smith continued to inhale reluctantly, and immediately regretted his decision. <br>\r\nThe smell felt like a cannon of compressed rotten corpses blowing up into his nose, immediately causing his body to slump forward in a dazed haze. His blue eyes rolled over as he felt the wet fabric press against his nose, and also felt his mind being completely obliterated. <br>\r\nNibbling playfully at his ear, she giggled as wave after wave of foot stench began breaking down what was left of his once disciplined psyche, destroying it like a wrecking ball to an abandoned building.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good boy. <i>Smell</i>,\u201d Elliot whispered approvingly in a sultry purr, her lips curling into a vindictive grin as she continued wiping the moist toe end in between his nostrils like dental floss.<br>\r\nStill moving his body left to right, he soon found that this move was making him dizzier than she already was. Fixating on his pained expression, she seemed completely oblivious to his faint struggles, if any. But then again, this woman would be oblivious to a lot of things if she subjected innocent people to this torture. <br>\r\nOf course, none of Elliot\u2019s sensual mannerisms could compare to the self-made orgy that Dr. Rules was currently displaying. Watching this entire encounter with long drawn out breaths, she was clearly deriving immense sexual pleasure from his plight. Her fingers instinctively touched her groin area as she witnessed the mental breakdown of Officer Smith.<br>\r\nEyes bulging in pure euphoric glee, Dr. Rules exhibited characteristics of a hormonal teenager, positively giddy and energetic. Obviously pleased at this new development, her wild mannerisms seemed to contradict her usual stoic and cold exterior.<br>\r\n\u201cGet him on the floor,\u201d she commanded softly, brandishing the gun at him as she calmed down.<br>\r\nNow in an ironic twist of events, Officer Smith soon found himself taking a knee to the devious Dr. Rules, but not voluntarily. Taking deep whiffs of her rancid fabric had utterly drained Smith of not only his dignity, but his willpower as well. Feeling his joints starting to slacken and his limbs beginning to wobble, Officer John Smith was now being hit by the surprising realization. He, a trained officer of the law, had just been brought down by two false nurses not by force, but by smell.<br>\r\nGroaning incessantly as his knees hit the floor, Officer Smith was closer to passing out than he was passing any encouraging looks to Clara, who was practically hyperventilating at this sudden twist of fate. <br>\r\nLiterally wiping his face in her sweat-soaked victory, Elliot briefly tore herself away from her euphoric ecstasy to return back to reality. <br>\r\n\u201cSo what do we do with him now?\u201d Elliot asked with an almost girlish enthusiasm.<br>\r\n\u201cThe same we do with all of our patients, Dr. Elliot,\u201d she playfully reprimanded, before fixing him with a wide, almost sadistic smile. <br>\r\n\u201cI was just about finished with the girl anyways, but this fine officer has graciously volunteered himself to be our next lab rat. Or as we women of science say, <i>footslave</i>,\u201d Dr. Rules purred coyly, towering above his downed form as to assert her dominance.<br>\r\nSure enough, Dr. Rules kicked off her own shoes, a pair of used ballet flats to reveal her own bare feet, clad in grayish nylons. <br>\r\nThe absolutely nauseating aroma that peeled off of her nylons hit Officer Smith even worse than Elliot\u2019s bioweapon, immediately causing him to instinctively flinch in disgust.<br>\r\nStruggling with renewed energy, he attempted to free himself but Elliot was an anchor that he couldn\u2019t escape from. She remained constricted around him like an octopus to its aquatic prey, <br>\r\nSpreading and stretching her toes playfully within her nylons, Dr. Rules relished in the sheer look of horror that Officer Smith was giving her, appropriately conditioned by a mere sock.<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get started, shall we? Dr. Elliot, if you would\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>George Defoe was a middle-aged man, thirty-four years to be exact, who was enjoying life. Today would be a great day. He had planned everything right down to the last detail. He had invited his longstanding live-in girlfriend Cathy into the most noble restaurant he had been able to find. Although the reservation had costed him more of the half of his monthly wage, he knew it would be worth it. Cathy had been pregnant for about two months now, and therefore George had decided that it was finally time to ask for her hand. <i>\"Man, I can't wait to see her face!\"</i>, he thought to himself as he stopped his car in the parking area at the hospital of Celerysprings. But before any of his plans could be transformed into reality, he had to finish his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince pretty much three years now, he worked in a small agency that was hired by administration districts every now and then, in order to check the conditions of local hospitals. In theory the routine was simple: <br>\r\n1. Going in.<br>\r\n2. Getting an overview.<br>\r\n3. Asking some patients wether they made rather positive or negative experiences with treatments and staff.<br>\r\n4. Asking some doctors if they are happy with the possibilities the hospital's equipment offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it didn't always run smoothly. Some hospitals were just too big and complicated to get an overview all alone. From time to time the patients he was interviewing just complained about literally <b>ANYTHING</b>. From too cool rooms to too hot meals. And of course the staff wasn't always eager after talking to an undercover hospital investigator. When George got out of his car and moved towards the hospital's entry, a cold wave of air hit him and made his hair stand on end. Something inside told him that this time wouldn't run smoothly either but little did he know how <i>attritional</i> things were going to get..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the hospital, the first thing George noticed was that the reception was completely empty. No patients, no doctors, no nurses..not even the caretaker or a cleaner. Almost automatically he checked his watch for the time, but it was still in the mid-afternoon and a completely normal day..no obvious reason given for this emptiness. \"Okay this is strange..\", George thought and said at the same time. For a second he felt like considering the matter as closed, after all it wasn't his job to search an empty hospital for something interesting. On the other hand again, he didn't want to risk that someone could think he wasn't taking his job seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a long and deep sigh he started to follow the first available corridor constantly trying to make himself noticed by someone. \"HELLOOOHOOO?! ANYONE THERE?!\" Nevertheless, all of his efforts remained in vain - he received not the slightest answer. Instead he noticed that the longer he followed those old corridors, the darker they were getting. In addition with the constant cold blow accompanying his steps it was enough to creep him out. \"Damn, this is not cool....\", it went through his mind, over and over again. \"I fear I will have problems to find my way back to the entry if I just keep on going. Doesn't look like I will find someone anyways!\" After another five minutes George's nerves were completely done and he was about to turn around, when he suddenly heard something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distant and very low clanking noise, together with the familiar sound of someone speaking muffledly, almost like a whisper, floated through his auditory canals and sent his brain a clear message: <i>\"I am not alone. Someone is there. Deeper inside these freaking corridors.\"</i> Despite every integrity, all senses of his body were telling him to turn the fuck around and run. All senses..except of one. A tempting cocktail of conscientiousness, daring and burning curiosity somehow sneaked out of the back of his head and  set his feet in motion. Slowly, tremblingly but also steadily, George lurked forward towards the noise which got louder and more clearly with every single step he took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some minutes he was close enough to the source of noise to understand some incoherent scraps of conversation every now and then. He overheard things like \"strapped down\"....\"smell\"....\"punishment\"....\"experiment\". Over all not enough to make sense of, but surely enough to make George feel uncomfortable. \"I don't even know if I am still in the area of the hospital in which am allowed to be..maybe this is the restricted area of a surgery section. I'm pretty sure that whatever I am going to see next is off-the-record.\" Walking around a corner, he could finally see the illuminated entrance of a room to the left. He breathed in deeply thinking \"Okay, the moment of truth is coming!\" and took the last steps pretty quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was able to see the room's interior, George's eyes widened and his jaw dropped. The room was pretty bright, almost glaring compared to the rather dark corridors. It reminded him of a dentist's room. All kinds of strange instruments were placed on several mobile tables but what disturbed him the most was the sight of a surgery table in the middle of the room. Strapped down on it he saw a teenage girl with a desperate look on the face. She looked right into George's eyes, her lips formed something like \"<i>HELP ME</i>\". Still hit from the first shock, George needed to think a while. He resisted the temptation to run towards the girl and just free her, after all the one who did this could still be there. \"I need to get help as fast as possible\", he thought and with only this in mind, he began to move..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the options on the table, Clara wondered which was the best - to save Billy, or herself. The two cruel women stared at her with a mix of amusement and evilness. In Billy's face there wasn't a single drop of blood left, just panic and fear. It was hard to admit, but in the end of the day self-preservation would always win. With guilt already filling her heart, Clara finally said:<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, Billy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Elliot and Dr. Rules can't help but laugh coldly. The poor boy's eyes nearly pop out of his head, in horror. Although his voice is shaky, he manages to utter:<br>\r\n\"No... Clara... PLEASE!\"<br>\r\n\"Rules, who would say that the fair, noble, Clara would betray her precious comrade? People are so predictable, aren't they?\" Elliot wondered, pinching Billy's cheek in a manner that bordered sadism.<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Let's start the experiment, for this will be most interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rules pulled a notebook and a chronometer from her pocket. <i>She wanted to see how long the Billy boy would hang on.</i> Nurse Elliot grinned widely as she dragged a screaming, crying boy from a corner and onto Clara's lap. Clara would be regretful of her choice, if something had not died inside her soul. <i>She felt some pity for the child, but she also wanted to see her family and her friends again! If that meant abusing Billy to pleasure two stinky-footed women, so be it!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara unlaced her battered sneakers. There were a few moist spots where Billy's tears fell. <i>Dr. Rules and Nurse Elliot eagerly observed the scene.</i> With a final sigh, Clara took off her shoes. Immediately, she could sniff an intense, eye-burning stench. She scrunched her toes in an attempt to hide the smell, but it only worsened. The smell was a revolting mixture of rotten eggs and out-of-date vinegar, with a small hint of, I would dare say, pungent cheese. Already, Billy avoided breathing through the nose. <i>He could run away, but the two pseudo-scientists blocked the only exit to the hellish dungeon and Billy already knew which punishments awaited him if he attempted such deed.</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P.U.!\" Nurse Elliot was heard saying, waving her hand in front of her nose \"Clara, you could surely be one of us! In fact, start the show already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This was it. For Clara, there was no turning back now.</i> Despite Billy's yells, she pushed both of her feet against his face. Needless to say, a boy of such a tender age was no match for a resigned teenager. Billy tried to hold his breath for as long as he could, he tried to push those ungodly chemical weapons from his nose, but when need for oxygen finally came, he took a long whiff. As the stink went up his nostrils, every single nerve in his body seemed to say \"Get the fuck out of there!\". There was a sudden burning in his throat, his eyes were watering, this time not because of the despair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the background, Elliot and Rules giggled like little sadistic schoolgirls. <i>The air that passed from Billy's nose through Clara's toes actually felt nice to her. In a certain way she liked it... but no, she couldn't! She must keep her morals straight!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmfgm...\" Billy mumbled from beneath Clara's feet. Surprisingly, Clara grinned because her victim's... <i>no, friend's!</i>, agony. Elliot and Rules appeared most amused from this reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery second, Billy's lungs demanded fresh air, but his body didn't have the strengths to free itself from Clara's tighter and tighter grip. Clara had never felt such an awesome emotion. <i>Was she becoming a sadist, under Rules and Elliot's umbrella?</i> No matter what was the answer, to Billy it was almost over. Gradually, the last of his forces gave up the fight, his eyes lost life and his respiration got weaker. His head hurt so badly, he just wanted to lay down and pass out. <i>Wish granted</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara stood up. <i>Wait, she could walk again! How had she not noticed that?</i> Run, don't run? Escape, don't escape? Stay quiet, fight her way to the exit? A thousand thoughts raced through her mind at the same time. Before she could even move a finger, her mouth was covered by a wet piece of tissue. It smelled funny. Suddenly, she sensed the world spinning right round, like a record. In seconds, her inert body fell to the ground unconscious.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the young teenager woke up once again, she found herself in a empty room, laying on a examination table fully dressed. Much to her surprise her  sneakers were also on, already collecting sweat for her reeking feet as she recovered. Sitting up, she begins to stretch her slender muscled body before Nurse Elliot and Dr. Rules walked in, giving Clara a look of approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to puzzled teen, Elliot smiled rather evilly. \"My, my you did far beyond our expectations. You rather enjoyed torturing someone beneath your putrid feet. For a second I almost mistaken you for one of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rules chuckles as she came over putting a hand on Clara's shoulder. \"Now wouldn't you like to experience that power rush again? To feel someone quivering beneath your powerful feet? Your's outshine both of ours and has true potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara hesitated a moment, her breathing quickening at the idea, remembering the thrill of control all too well as she forced the poor boy to inhale her putrid odor. Slowly a slight curious smirk forms on her pretty face, slowly scumming to the influence of these two sadistic women. Part of her told her to resist but a stronger side was already set on exploring this new side of her and testing her putrid feet on more victims. <i>What is happening to me? Why did I enjoy torturing that poor boy so much?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have never imagined it would feel so good.. I am starting to see why you both enjoy torturing someone underfoot so much.\" Clara replies in a low tone, still unsure of all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot and Dr. Rules glance at each other with a knowing evil grin seeing how they'd make Clara one of their's soon. Signaling to Elliot, she leaves the room leaving Dr. Rules alone with Clara. \"You are experiencing the first taste of true sadism with having a helpless victim beneath your feet. Why not test it out a bit further and see how fun it can truly be. If you still wish to leave then you may go back of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Elliot returned dragging the reluctant Billy into the room, being nowhere nearly strong enough to pull away from the older woman.A pouting expression comes to Clara's face as she thinks about what to do next, having difficulty deciding, knowing she couldn't get free unless she complied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please don't do this! Clara don't listen to those monsters!\" Billy pleaded hoping he could reach out to his only hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Clara shook her head before reaching down to begin unlacing her sneakers. \"Sorry Billy, but I won't get out of here unless I follow what they say and if you need to suffer for that to happen, I have no choice but to follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot proceeds to drag the poor boy over while Clara takes off her old sneakers with a light plop, revealing her damp sweat dripping large feet, showing off their perfectly smooth curves, causing a dizzying toxic odor to waft around the room. Elliot forces the boy down to lay on the floor before Clara's rancid glistening soles then moves a couple steps back so she could get to work while Dr. Rules watches on. \"That's the spirit Clara, you're one of us now. You know what needs to be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara nods, a hint of regret showing in her eyes as she stands up, planting both of her beautiful bare feet down besides the boy with a expressionless face, subtly feeling enjoyment out of seeing him in such a distressed state. Not giving him a moment to recover, the corrupted teen suddenly plants one sweaty sole roughly on the boy's small face causing a light squelching noise to be heard. Just as the other two wanted, she began to rub her large soft sole all over his face, smearing it with layers of her putrid foot sweat while her flexible toes pressed firmly against Billy's nose, engulfing it with it's sickening earthly stench. The poor boy thrashed and squirmed helplessly beneath the stronger teen causing a sadistic grin begin to form on her face as she curled her toes, causing his nose to bend back before spreading them, gripping his nose so her sweaty toe jam smeared across his nostrils, doubling the intense cheesy like stench. The boy's eyes soon became glazed as a sudden giggle came from Clara's lips as she felt the air rushing through her toes, loving the sensation and empowerment she felt from it. Her toes grip his nose tighter as she impulsively speaks in a mocking tone, full of glee, surprising herself with her own cruelty. \"What's the matter little bitch? Can't handle the smell of a teenager's feet? In that case why don't you try to breath through your mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrying now, the poor Billy tries to open his mouth to get much needed air but his respite is short lived as Clara shoves her other foot inside, blocking off his airway so he could only breath from his nose. His lips stretch wide as his eyes widened in fear, sending shivers of pleasure through Clara, savoring every little pitiful reaction he was having as she became more enthralled by the thrill of the sadism. His cheeks began to bulge as she forced her sweaty toes deeply into his mouth, causing Billy to gag while his face reddened from the pressure and overwhelming stench of both her feet, his senses now being completely engulfed as she stood on top of him fully, covering most of his face. Dr. Rules and Elliot watched on with glee clearly turned on by her sadism and how much the boy suffered beneath Clara's hot sweaty soles, using his face like a rag to air out and clean her pale soles. Brushing her gorgeous blond hair back a bit, Clara begins to thrust her right foot in and out of Billy's mouth, much like a cock, forcing his gums to conform to the shape of her foot while her toes violated the back of his throat, gripping his tongue, forcing him to clean off the sweaty gunk while coating her toes with saliva. Her heartbeat quickened with clear excitement as she continued to grind his nose between her toes, creating more imprints of her foot on his face as she brought one hand up to give the poor boy the middle finger, letting her bitchy side come out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How ya like that you little foot bitch? You're such a fucking loser, I bet I could crush you like a bug if I wanted to but that would ruin all the fun for me and my new friends.\" Clara smirked back at the two before bringing her large foot up from his nose only to stomp down on his face with a good amount of force. A muffled grunt of pain vibrated from Billy's lips along Clara's other sole deeply wedged into his mouth, causing a delighted giggle to come from her lips as her green eyes took in his helpless form. Despite her soles being incredibly soft, they could pack quite a hit due to her strength and size. She repeated the process a couple times, creating light reddish bruise marks all over his face before plugging his nostrils with her pinky and ring toe, giving him a up close feeling of her feet as a puff of steam emitted from her feet due to how powerful their putrid odor was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw! I never imagined this would be so fun! I can't wait to experiment and make you suffer!\" Clara cries out in pleasure, her flushed face seemed even more amused with his suffering even then Elliot and Dr. Rules as she progressed with her newer sadistic side. </span></div></div>",

However, now that you've turned to our side, I can finally explain you my plan\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara, now corrupted by her her newfound feelings, began listening to whetever the doctor has to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, when you came years ago and we found about your foot mass which was removed, we were really curious about what that strange thing was. After studying it we found out that was a colony of a special kind of bacteria. Using your dead skin and sweat, these bacteria were capable of generating by their metabolism some very powerful type of pheromones. These pheromones were capable of doing very interesting things to those who smelled them. I found out that whoever smells the feet of those who owns this kind of bacteria, becomes very weak and addicted to the smell. Becoming not only dependent on the owner's feet, but completely enslaved and brainwashed. The more feet smell and are drenched in foot sweat, the stronger the enslavement is. That's why we had to check your feet every once a while, to see if your feet and your bacteria were doing the right job, and they were, ahahahah. I made out of your feet, a serum that makes me resistant to your foot smell, and another one which could make my feet like yours..... unfortunately, it seems like, even if my feet got the ability to weak others, they are not capable of brainwashing another being\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was listening very carefully to what Dr. Rules were saying, and seemed really interested in her speech. So her feet had the power to submit and enslave another being just by her smell and sweat? That didn't seem to make sense at all!! So, she asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you need me for your plans, right? You have the serum and it's not working, so you need me... what make you think I'd help you?\" Said the girl smirking evily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it Clara.... all these years worrying about your smelly feet and their chronic sweat, now you could finally solve that problem. You and I could become goddesses of this world, making all patients who come in this hospital our loyal and faithful servants, ahahahah. We could change the world in better, if you listen to me and become a true queen, making all the people you want crave for your smelly feet. I've seen in your eyes how you'd love to force others, starting from Billy, to smell and inhale your powerful foot sweat. Through the power of your mesmerizing feet, we could make a perfect society.... a society where women are in charge and men obey every their whim and command.... a society where there will not be injusties anymore.... we could become goddesses of this new world. Everyone will bow to us and our smelly feet!!! Ahahahahahh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was amused by this thoughts. She would have become a goddess in this world and would have received what she deserved. Being worshipped and loved by everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I believe in what you say? How Can I trust in you without thinking you could stab me in the back? Furthermore, why I should share my power with you?\" Said the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's....that's because you and I are not so different.... I saw in your eyes that glimpse of sadism and dominance women should have... Meditate on it Clara, with your power, this hospital and my help, soon you will be not alone anymore. You will have lots of servants and slaves, ready to give you everything you need and desire. We will make experiments in order to make your feet even more powerful. People will kill only to smell your aroma or taste your sweat, ahahahah. I will help you in that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Clara was thinking and meditating about it, Billy who had listened to every word of that speech, began to complain very loudily trying to persuade Clara from not accepting this evil proposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do it Clara.... we are not pets!!! We have rights like every human person...P...ple...please think about it! Don't let her words corrupt you\"<br>\r\n Seeing this scene, Amber kicked  him and said: \"Don't worry boy, soon you will know your true purpose in life, ahahah. You will become Clara's pet and lust after her very stinky and disgusting feet. Her feet will become your only thought starting from morning to evening... she'll need only a little help\" and after she pronounced these last words, she gave the girl another serum ready to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clara, your feet are very powerful, however, in order to gain the maximum power you need this serum. It will completely awake your hidden abilities, ahahah, and unleash your true power. After the administering, it will be only a matter of time. When this boy will be exposed to your foot smell and sweat, he will not be able to resist. He will crawl to your feet and worship you like a true goddess, ahahahah\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...no, please Clara, don't do it!! I know you are a very caring and sweat girl. Don't trust her words, she will only use you, and after that she's going to betray you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara, however, had just made up her mind and injected herself with this serum, while Dr. Rules and Elliot were watching her with a satisfied smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Billy, but they are right. I deserve to be a goddess, I need to rule this world, and people will love me. I will be a good owner I swear, even if sometimes I will go sadistic...\" and while saying these words she couldn't help but smirk. \"You're gonna be the first, so...be honored and accept me as your beautiful goddess\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly couldn't believe what he just saw. This girl appered completely changed from just a moment ago. Now she was completely a different person, and showing  a total different face. He could see her eyes full of malice and her smile very wide. What could happen now?....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elliot moved around Clara (who was still vainly struggling to get her very own body under control) and towards Dr. Rules smiling dangerously. \"We still have plenty of time to let her grow familiar with our feet, Ambi. Remember the first thing you taught me? Always get to know your <i>patients</i> as good as possible! Know your victim is our first rule, so I suggest that we check her out. Discover her weak points, reveal her disadvantages..anything we could use in the end!\" Hearing this, Clara was filled with fear once again. These women were totally crazy. She had absolutely no idea <b>how far</b> they would dare to go, but she somehow knew that it would probably be a hell of a lot <b>too far</b>. In a sudden streak of perfidious humour filling her brain, Clara hoped  that Dr. Rules would convince Elliot to stick with the foot torture for now, because that would mean that Clara would at least know what would come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Dr. Rules was nowhere near forbidding Elliot's plan. As anticipated, she cheered and even said: \"Ellie, Ellie..be careful what you do. If you don't pay attention, you will have me saying something like 'I'm proud of you!' in the end. You really learned something in those past months we've been working and planning together!\" Elliot laughed at Dr. Rules' reaction, then she turned her head and looked directly in Clara's terrified eyes. \"Now back to you, little brat. Let's see what we can find out about you.\"  With these words Elliot and Dr. Rules started preparing several treatments for Clara. While she couldn't do anything but to helplessly lie on the ground, unable to move an inch of her body, she could hear her two tormentors whisper, accompanied by tinkling instruments she couldn't see and Billy's constant whimpering from somewhere in a dark corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillions of thoughts ran through Clara's mind, but none of them had a clear structure or any tangible content. Whenever she tried to focus on one, he slipped away and crashed into the mess of the other thoughts. This was creating a symphony orchestra of blurry thoughts, in which panic was the conductor and her racing heartbeat the timpanist. <i>Waiting for the inevitable torture is even worse than the torture itself</i>, was the only straight thought Clara felt inside, but then suddenly Dr. Rules brutally ripped open Clara's mouth and stuffed one of her dirty nylons, she had taken off before, deep inside. \"Time to get going!\", she taunted, \"And we don't want you to scream. Not that it would help you but it would certainly disturb a sane working atmosphere, wouldn't it?\" Now Elliot came into sight as well, asking: \"Ambi? Don't you want to fix that in her mouth, so she can't spit it out?\" Dr. Rules shook her head. \"Nah, no need Elliot. If she's lucky she is maybe able to scream but her tongue muscle is still too limp to spit that little gag out. No time to lose now, let's begin with the tests!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA word and a blow. Elliot sat down beside Clara and gently slapped her cheek like you do with someone who passed out or a misbehaving dog. \"Today we have three little tests for you, bratty. You don't mind if I call you bratty, do you? Well I guess you'll have difficulties answering that one so, I'll just act as if you had said yes. First I will test if you're ticklish, then we'll look a bit into your experience of pain and last but not least I want to test how you react to electroshocks. How does that sound?\" Clara feebly moaned in disagreement, but as expected it only caused Elliot to mock her. \"What was that? Is there anything you disagree with?\" This time Clara moaned louder and angrily. \"I thought so..\" was all Elliot smilingly answered. Then she nodded and Dr. Rules began to install four small devices, which looked like boxes with small and thin brushes at one end. Two of the devices were placed at Clara's soles, the others in her left and right armpit. Once in place, Elliot pressed a button on each box which caused the brushes to twist and turn pretty fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Clara had never been very ticklish and the anger and hatred she had built up inside didn't really put her in laughing mood, she remained still, made no sound and waited. After about two minutes Dr. Rules and Amber shook their heads and Elliot noted 'Not ticklish.' on a checklist. \"This wasn't quite effective I guess\", Dr. Rules said while making an almost disappointing face. \"But don't celebrate just yet, there's still more in store for you.\" The next minutes were far more inconvenient for Clara. Since they wanted to test her experience of pain, they came up with many cruel ideas. In the beginning, they attached strong clamps all over her almost naked body, causing her to cough at times. \"Oh dear\", Elliot laughed, \"I'm sure you will find some bruises later when we're done.\" After the clamps were removed, Elliot eagerly stood up and turned to Dr. Rules. \"Now I want to test how sensitive your still pretty young breasts are.\" Without further warnings, she slipped out of her shoes and lifted her bare right foot up. She then placed her heel on Clara's right nipple and slowly but steadily applied more and more of her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing how Clara started to complain bitter gag, Elliot said: \"Oh we might have found something interesting!\" In the same moment she quickly and brutally balanced all her wight on her heel, held her position for some seconds and then got off Clara's body with a complacent smile on her face. The muffled but still intense scream of agony, Clara had let out had been proof enough. \"We <b>definitely</b> have found something interesting!\", Elliot cheered. \"Her breasts are pretty sensitive. Would you note that down for me?\" Dr. Rules nodded and wrote it down. \"Then we can come to the last part of today's test. You're almost done, Clara..although I have to warn you..best things come last\", Dr. Rules chuckled while presenting Clara's terrified eyes some cables. \"Hmmmff-Hmmmmff\", she tried to protest, but of course it was in vain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attachment of the cables was already pure torture for Clara. Not the one on her left big toe and on her right index finger, but attaching the ones on her nipples had extremely hurt. Now they were regularly sending shockwaves through her body which were strong enough to make her scream and shiver every time. Elliot spoke to Dr. Rules, astonishment was filling her voice. \"This is really interesting. She is on a very low level of shock, but still it's doing so much to her.\" Dr. Rules agreed and added: \"Now that's what you call a weakness..I think we should end it for now..\" In the first moment, Elliot seemed to agree but then she shook her head and spoke again. \"Soon, very soon. But first I want to check what a 'normal' shock level does to her!\" It seemed that Dr. Rules wasn't all too happy with this decision ans so she made a grimace. \"Hmmmm..okay but be careful, she is still an important test object for us..we can't risk to ruin it!\"  The last thing Clara heard, was how Elliot answered something like \"Okay, okay, don't worry..This is not the first time I'm doing........\" <b>ZAP!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn indescribable wave of pain hit Clara. It felt like her eyes were rolling out of their sockets combined with the feeling that her nipples had become burning isles in an ocean of agony. She could definitely smell something burnt and she didn't know if she was screaming or not. A shrill tone ringing in her ears became louder and louder. Suddenly everything became white. She felt how her body became light and she  started to float. Then she could see again, floating up the dark cell she could see unclear schemes of her body lying on the ground with two other bodies moving quickly around it. <i>\"I am dead.\"</i>, rushed it through her mind filling her with panic for one second. But the next second she felt that she didn't care. Everything was better than being imprisoned by two sadistic merciless women. Suddenly she started flying, flying through the walls of the hospital into the open world, into the freedom..she only felt sorry that she had to leave Billy behind..but even that didn't count any longer..<i> \"I'm on my way home\"</i>, she thought when she flew over the landscape underneath her. <i>\"Finally home..\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother white flash hit her and she felt her body again. Lying on a cold ground and unable to move. She guessed where she was, but she didn't want it to be true. Then the shrill tone faded away and she heard two rushed and worried female voices, two voices she hated more than anything else. \"We've got her back!\", Elliot exclaimed. \"Wow, that was close..\" Then Dr. Rules muttered: \"Pheeeeeeeeew, I freaking TOLD YOU to be careful. And what do you do, you exaggerate. This was almost the end, Ellie!\" Clara heard how Elliot apologized, then Dr. Rules spoke again. \"Okay, nevermind. We rescued it. Nevertheless we won't be able to experiment with her any time too soon. She needs to fully recover before. This will make her sleep a while...\" A light poke hit Clara in the arm, and only seconds after, her senses left her once again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Billy Miller was an eight year old boy, living in a small town about fifteen kilometers away from Celerysprings. His character was adorable, one could call him a keen boy, clearly enjoying the life. He visited elementary school, had not only few friends, played football and loved \"Pok\u00e9mon\". Just today, his mother Judith Miller, living separately from her man Marco Miller, had picked him up earlier than usual from the football training. \"Unfortunately, it's about time again!\", she had said. \"You need to go visit a doctor for the regular checkup, honey. Last time we missed it and as a consequence you had to suffer two weeks of severe measles. This won't happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly hadn't really celebrated these news, but he wasn't too annoyed either. The measles really had driven him crazy and in his worst feverish nights he often had woken with a start, not being able to distinguish reality and nightmares anymore. There was absolutely no way he wanted to risk having to experience similar suffering ever again. <i>\"After all, doctors and hospitals help and protect you from harm. They will always do what's best for you..\"</i>, Billy thought to himself. In addition to his trust in the gentleness and altruism of every doctor, he just loved Dr. M. Erlin. He was calm and nice, he understood perfectly how to encourage Billy whenever he had to endure an injection and best of all, in the end of a examination, he always presented a lollipop for Billy. This time however, things went different. When Billy explained to his mother, that he wasn't fearing any checkup as long as Dr. Erlin was the one carrying it out, she made a  caught face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuhh, I'm sorry honey\", Judith started patting Billy's head, \"I'm afraid we can't visit Dr. Michael this time. I forgot about the appointment today just until two hours ago. That's why I told your aunt I would be there at 6 pm already. In other words: We're in a hurry! If we would drive to St. Barths, we'd have to wait for hours until it would be your turn. This hospital is great, I know, but it's also always brimful. I asked a bit around and I heard that in Celerysprings there is a small hospital as well which is pretty empty all the time. If we're lucky a bit, the whole waiting and checkup won't take longer than thirty minutes. Again, sorry Billy, but you know your aunt. She easily gets stressed, when I'm one minute to late! Can you forgive me and just bear the procedure in another hospital this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmmm.\" Billy's answer was short and sceptic. Actually he was not pleased by the thought of being examined by someone completely unknown and he felt how excitement, almost stage-fright like, rose in his chest. On the other hand he didn't want to show fear. Not even in front of his own mother. He always admired the heroes of the books he read, who were suffering from injuries as consequences from the massive battles they had fought in, and yet never gave up. \"It's okay I guess, mom.\" Judith genuinely seemed eased and smiled. \"You're my brave boy, Billy! Let's go then, no time to lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive to Celerysprings wasn't really taking long, but it seemed long for Billy. Although his hometown wasn't really big, the only thing he could see through the windows of the car were  detached farms, old mills and plain nature. Finally they arrived at the small hospital in Celerysprings and as they got out of the car, even Judith shivered slightly. \"Wow, this is a lot darker place than I imagined. It kind of seems cold..there's something I don't like about this. But it surely is empty..no big crowd here. Are you sure you will be able to get your checkup done here, Billy?\" Billy gulped as he looked at the shaded windows and a sharp squall hit him. He felt as if he wanted to get into the car again and tell his mother to please drive away, far away from this place but he knew that there was no going back for him now. \"Of course, mom. Just..c-c-can we get this done fast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner said than done. Judith and Billy entered the hospital and browsed around. The lobby was completely empty, all lights turned out. No one seemed to be around, which made the scenery even more disquieting. Judith furrowed her eyebrows and took a quick look on her watch. She began to get impatient. Billy in comparison still was overwhelmed by the rather creepy atmosphere. Somehow it seemed that inside the hospital it was even colder than in the wind outside, but both of them realized that the coldness wasn't in the room. It was actually coming from inside their chests, as if entering this hospital had caused something inside them to instantly freeze. Finally, after checking several corners, Judith discovered a small room looking like an office. It was illuminated and one could clearly recognize a human shape through the milk glass. \"Alright, think I found the doctor Billy! Just wait where you are, I'll come after I have spoken with him!\" With these words she entered the office and left Billy alone in the lobby. He sat down on one of the many empty chairs in the waiting area, humming some children's songs melodies. Right now in the half-dark of the oppressively empty lobby, he wished he had taken his GameBoy with him. Playing some Pok\u00e9mon surely could have calmed him down a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally his mother returned, looking a bit worried but still content. \"So, honey. I spoke with the doctor. You will be examined very soon, there should be someone picking you up any minute. Is it okay for you if I leave you here now? Your aunt is probably starting to worry already and I really don't want to let her wait any longer. Also you know normally I would have personally brought you to your father for this week-end like I always do, but as you know, I'm really stressed at the moment. Also me and your dad..it's just not working anymore. I don't want to fight with him in front of you again. But that's no problem. The doctor offered me to let the phone number of your dad here, so that they can call your dad to pick you up as soon as the examination is over. If everything works well they won't call me and if something went wrong and your father can't come, they can still call me back. Are you okay with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lump in Billy's throat became bigger and bigger and so he didn't manage to speak anymore. He just somehow managed to get his excitement under control and nod for a second. Judith noticed it anyways, smiled and gave him a short kiss on the cheek. Then she rushed out of the hospital's entrance and only seconds later Billy heard the car's engine as his mother drove away to her sister. Now the waiting began again. This time it felt even more uncomfortable and Billy remained completely silent. The still rising excitement and the almost painful coldness in his chest prohibited him to dare humming again. At least his mother had been right. This time Billy hadn't to wait for long and after about two minutes..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>..a young nurse appeared out of nowhere. She wore the typical nurse outfit, a white overall. Her hands glanced because of the rubber gloves and her feet where covered in thick white socks, which again stuck in a pair of crocs. \"Hello, I am nurse Elliot. You must be Billy, right?\" Billy nodded and stood up. This woman was a positive surprise, she seemed nice and friendly. Everything was better than some grumpy old doctor examining him. \"Alright then, let's begin Billy.\" With these words, nurse Elliot started walking and with some gestures she made it quite clear to Billy that he should follow her. Although the nurse wasn't exactly \"running\", Billy had to walk faster than usual in order to keep in step with Elliot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis way they must have looked like an odd couple, rushing through the dark corridors and stairways of the wide and empty hospital. Billy knew that it wasn't really empty, but it just didn't stop seeming forsaken and somewhat creepy to him. Finally they arrived in front of a thick brown metal door, labeled with some white letters forming <i>TREATMENT ROOM</i>. As Elliot pressed her right hand against it, the door swung up inwards and nurse and patient entered. \"Billy, you see the treatment chair over there? Please take a seat. Don't worry this will be over soon.\" As soon as Billy had obeyed her order and made himself comfortable on the chair (as good as this was possible), Elliot continued with her instructions. \"Are you sitting well? Good. We'll begin with the basic checkup, which means I'll check your breathing, your heart rate and take a look inside your throat to see if everything's in place.\" This part of the examination really went fast, and after only five minutes, the nurse threw the used smear spatula in a little trashcan making a satisfied face. \"It's all good so far. Your lungs work fine, the heart rate is ok and I couldn't find anything harmful in your throat\", Elliot explained to Billy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we only need to do a few last tests. The public health authority recently keeps urging us doctors to also check the sensitivity of our patient's senses. Especially our younger patients should be examined to that effect, according to them. That's what we're going to do next.\" The tests regarding Billy's sense of touch and eyesight were easy. For his eyesight he just had to read continuously shrinking letters on a small screen. Sometimes he messed up some letters but overall Elliot seemed content with his performance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe check of his sense of touch again was so easy for Billy, that it reminded him some of the games he had played in kindergarden. It just consisted of Elliot putting some small objects in a black bag, which Billy hadn't seen before. Then he had to put his hand inside the bag and describe what he felt until he eventually should guess what kinds of object it was. Next, Billy's sense of hearing was tested. For that purpose, the nurse presented a long piece of black cloth. \"To make sure, I'm really testing your sense of hearing I need to make sure you're not able to see anything. This is a blindfold and I'm putting it over your eyes now, so you have to rely completely on your ears, okay?\", she asked. Billy agreed and once he was blindfolded, Elliot started clapping from anywhere in the room and his task was to describe where exactly from his position the sound was coming. It was actually not really hard, but anyhow not Billy's strength. The nurse's reaction turned out accordingly. \"Hmmmm..not exactly brilliant but alright I guess. Lets move on!\", she said with a good-natured smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Then however, things started to become strange. \"We're coming to your sense of taste now\", Elliot said while presenting a little clip. \"I want you to leave the blindfold on and put this nose clip on as well, so you can really concentrate on the taste without being distracted by the anticipations your eyes or your nose might sent to the center of taste in your brain before you even tasted anything. After I have given you the thing you're about to taste, you will concentrate on tasting it for some minutes and afterwards you will describe the taste to me. All right?\" Again, Billy nodded and let himself get blindfolded and \"nose-clipped\". Elliot made sure that he really couldn't see or smell anything anymore and then she silently moved her right foot out of the croc. In the same movement and without making a single sound, she removed the thick white sock (which was obviously a bit grey on the sole part) from it and turned it inside-out. With a mean grin Billy wasn't able to see, she said \"Say aaaaah!\". Billy trusted her and obeyed and when he opened up his mouth, Elliot gently pushed her sock in. \"That's right, Billy. Now work your tongue a little and tell me what you taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Billy did what he was told to do, a distant but anyhow unpleasant taste started to fill his mouth. He shivered. Of course the nurse noticed his reaction and grinned even more. \"So what do you taste, tell me!\" Now the taste in Billy's mouth was so present that he didn't even had to refresh it once again by moving his tongue. \"Ugh\", he started, \"it somehow tastes like..some..fabric..cotton-like. But also very bitter with some sour aftertaste..and..oh sorry it's really disgusting..and..I think even a sweet note..\" The nurse made a mean face and said: \"Pretty well done. Check! Let's directly move on to your sense of smell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this test Billy had to leave on the blindfold again, although this time the nurse explained that his mouth had to be closed at all time, to make sure he only smelt through his nose. Therefore she removed the nose clip and placed a large strip of plaster over Billy's mouth. \"By the way, I think it's better to immobilize you for now, so you can fully concentrate on your nose and only your nose. The chair you're sitting on has got some integrated buckles, I'm just going to tighten them around your body a bit, don't worry.\" Throughout all this Billy was in kind of a trance. He just accepted what the nurse was doing, not questioning it and without doing anything against it. It didn't feel comfortable at all for him to be immobilized like this, blind and without the possibility to say a word, but he just didn't dare to speak up. <i>\"After all this is a nurse! Why should she harm me? I need to just trust her and then hopefully all this is over soon..\"</i> rushed through his mind. Once Billy was secured to Elliot's satisfaction, she removed her left sock just as silently as she had done with the right one and placed the quite well-worn cotton fabric over her young patient's exposed nose. \"Inhale deeply for the next two minutes, then I'll ask you some questions about the smell and you answer by nodding or shaking your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Billy took the first sniff through his nose, he immediately knew that he was not going to like this test more than the taste-checking before. To his surprise the smell he experienced was pretty similar to the taste he had endured before. Hot, humid air wafted through his nostrils and up his nasal cavities, slightly aggravating his stomach. Instinctively he tried to make his discomfort obvious by moving around in the treatment chair, but the tight buckles all over his body kept him perfectly immobilized. Never had two minutes been such a long time for Billy, but eventually they were over. Nurse Elliot removed her stinky sock from his nose and went on. \"Okay Billy, time to answer my questions.\"<br>\r\n\"Did you smell something?\" He nodded.<br>\r\n\"Did you like what you smelt?\" Billy shook his head.<br>\r\n\"So you would consider the smell a bad one?\" Billy nodded.<br>\r\n\"Was the smell rather strong?\" He nodded again.<br>\r\n\"Did you notice all of the following odors: Sour, bitter, ....cheesy?\" He thought for a while, then nodded.<br>\r\n\"Okay, last question. Have you ever smelt something similar before?\" Billy shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's it. You appear to have a good nose, most of your answer are how I expected them to be\", Elliot explained. \"Now there's really only one last thing to do and then the examination is over. You are eight years old, right?\" Since the plaster was still on his mouth, the only thing Billy could do to say \"yes\" was to nod once again. \"Very good. You see, you are in an age, where you body very slowly starts to develop from a child to a grown up man. To complete the examination we need to make sure that everything is allright with your penis, so that it can develop in the right way. I need to take a look at it and check its sensitivity to certain stimuli, no need to feel embarrassed about it. I've seen a lot of penises from grown up men and from young boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying this, Elliot didn't waste any more time. She took off Billy's pants and underwear and revealed his still small manhood. \"Alright just relax and try to not move too much in the buckles. I'll have to stimulate your penis and control your breathing and heart rate with my hands and a stethoscope at the same time. This means that I will have to use my feet for your penis but nevermind, it's going to have the same effect.\" Billy didn't like were this was going anymore, but there was not much he could do by now. He was still immobilized, blindfolded and gagged by a plaster. Then he felt how something soft, humid and warm (Elliot's bare right foot) began touching his penis and gently stroking it. At first nothing happened, but then Billy felt how his penis got harder and slowly grew. It was not the first time, this happened to him. Sometimes when he jumped in the hot bathtub it just happened. But then he was all alone and not in front of an unknown nurse. When his penis was fully grown, Billy felt how Elliot put it in the gap between her big and second toe and started stroking a bit faster. \"Yeah..it looks good so far, we'll be done in a few minutes!\", she exclaimed. Suddenly Billy felt how something soft, warm and humid clutched around his nose pinching it completely shut (the toes of Elliot's left foot).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to make a low \"hmmmpf\" sound of protest through the plaster but the nurse just said: \"Shhh Billy, shhh..You'll get some air in a second, some odor that might help you relax a bit.\" Some seconds later when Billy started to feel the first appearance of panic and suffocation in his chest, the clutch was released and he felt how the soft, hot and humid something was slid up and down his nose. He took in some deep breaths of relief and the same smell like in the smell-check hit him, only a lot stronger this time. \"Hmmmmpf-Hmmmpff\" Billy moaned through the plaster but Elliot just chuckled calmly. \"Haha no need to scream Billy! We're just about done!\" With these words she increased the speed with which she jerked his tiny and helplessly exposed penis until suddenly Billy felt a strange feeling rise in the lower part of his body. The feeling became stronger and stronger until his penis started twitching all on its own! He was so surprised and embarrassed, that he didn't even notice how nurse Elliot had removed both her feet, put Billy's underwear and pants back in place and taken away the blindfold and plaster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're done Billy! You're a very healthy boy who can be proud of himself. I'll just enter my findings in your clinical record and then you can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Is that so?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Elliot left the room to take care of his clinical record, Billy was still in a shock. He had no words for what had happened to him but he surely knew that it had been the most horrible examination ever. Thankfully it was over and he could go home, or better said, to his dad. The only thing he wanted right now was to escape this hospital as soon as possible to never ever return. Five minutes passed and Elliot returned, but this time she was not alone. In her wake she had another nurse who seemed to be a bit older to Billy. As they moved closer, the unknown woman spoke with Elliot. \"So you checked him?\", she asked, \"Is everything how it should be?\" Elliot giggled before answering: \"Yeah, everything perfect. I tested his sensitivity and all of his parts are capable of performing what we need for our further experiments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they speaking of me? What the heck does she mean with 'further experiments' anyway?\", Billy asked himself when he overheard this little conversation. But before he could spend more time thinking about it, they arrived at the chair and Elliot began to untie the buckles. While she was buy, the other woman stared at Billy with an almost disturbing amount of interest, curiosity and estimation glowing in her eyes. He wasn't able to bear looking her in the eyes for long and so he lowered his head again and looked at her white overall. This way he noticed the little nameplate saying \"Dr. Rules\". After all this woman was a doctor and not a nurse. \"Hmmm, I see what you mean, Elliot. The more I look at him the more I think you're right. He will be a perfect test object, since he is still so malleable.\", Dr. Rules suddenly said to Elliot, re-activating the cold feeling Billy had felt in his chest already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome seconds later the last buckle was loosed and Billy immediately jumped up. \"I need to go now, can you please call my dad to pick me up? I'll wait outside!\" With these words Billy started walking out of the room, leaving some for the moment stunned women behind. He already made it out and down half of the corridor, when Billy's apprehension came true. \"Wait! WAIT!!\", he heard Elliot shout from behind. \"You forgot something!\" Billy paused and feverishly pondered. Should he just run and leave this creepy place behind? Even if his father wouldn't come, he could also walk the way from Celerysprings to his home. It would take him several hours, that was for sure, but everything was better than this place. On the other hand, he didn't want that everything he had endured could be in vain because of an important detail he forgot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot the copy of your clinical record, come back now!\", Elliot shouted once again, this time with a bit of anger in her voice. It made all the difference. Billy knew that without the copies of the clinical record, he might as well forget everything he had done today. It would have been like spending hours taking photos just to discover afterwards that all the time the camera had been without film. Slouchy he turned around and made his way back into the treatment room, ready to pick up the copies and then just get the heck out! The first thing Billy noticed, when he re-entered the room, was that nobody seemed to be there. Something regarding this whole different scenery was strange and some voice in the back of his head whispered to him that he was in danger. But before he was able to do or think anything else, he was grapped from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot used her left arm to grab Billy's body tight, with both of his army pressed to the side of his body. \"Ugh!\", was the only thing he was able to say before her right hand pressed itself firmly on his mouth. He tried to struggle but with his eight years, he had no chance against a grown up woman. Then Dr. Rules appeared again, coming out of a dark corner with a dangerous grin on her face. She slowly moved closer laughing quietly but nonetheless it was a psycho laughter. When she stood right in front of the struggling and twitching Billy, she prostrated so that her head was on one level with Billy's. She looked right into his terrified and wide open eyes, obviously feasting on his fear and desperation. Then she started speaking with an unimaginable glee in her trembling voice. \"You're not going anywhere soon, Billy. You're not going to see your mom, your dad or anyone else..well maybe you'll get to know another girl soon. She's older than you, but in adversity you will become friends faster. At least that's what they say I think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this she revealed her left hand holding a humid tissue and pressed it slowly but energetically under his nose. \"Time to go sleep now, you'll have to be in shape for what comes next! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!\" Billy tried to fight the narcotic smell coming from the tissue at first, but he didn't succeed. He passed out and the last thing he heard was how Dr. Rules' laughter rang in his young ears. </span></div></div>",

You sighed as an Autumn chill went down your spine, pulling your coat tighter you continue to fiddle with your video camera to get it to work correctly in the dying light. <br>\r\nFinally you manage to reduce the noise in the image and have a fairly clear image show up on the screen provided your flashlight is on. <br>\r\n\"Oh, boy, do I have a great for you guys,\" You greet your YouTube audience. You then point the camera up at the dark silhouette that is the abandoned Celerysprings hospital, \"See that kids? That is Celerysprings Hospital, one part care center one part nuthouse. Formally. Got shut down back in the eighties due to quote <i>questionable</i> <i>practices</i> on some of the mentally disturbed. They used to bring people out here due to it being isolated and all. You've all heard it before, not a pleasant story behind it.\" <br>\r\nYou continue up the path to the front door, holding your camera as steady as possible as you ascend up to what looked like a gateway to hell. You didn't want to make it look like you were nervous, but you were, and your ensuring sweating was causing you to become considerably colder the closer you came to the building. <br>\r\nYou used to live in this area when you were younger, this place had always creeped you out. You had always thought you saw a woman staring at you from the windows when you would drive by, and sometimes noises could be heard inside, loud, manic laughing and insane screaming. Yeah, you considered your fear justified. <br>\r\nBut you were 16 now, and you had to prove to yourself you could do this, you weren't a baby anymore. Besides, you had your camera to keep yourself company.<br>\r\nYou soon found yourself standing in front of the big wooden door, to enter the hospital. Taking a deep breath you will yourself to open the door, half hoping it would be locked, and since all the windows were barred that would be it. It was a bust, you could go home. <br>\r\n\"Okay boys and girls, let's do this shit.\"<br>\r\nBut just as your hand touches the rough wood the door creaks open like a clich\u00e9d horror movie. <br>\r\nYou would have thought the door would have been locked to prevent people from entering, but then, this was a small town, and it was quite possible no one had even bothered. <br>\r\nYou entered the massive doorway, stepping into the consuming darkness, tying to keep your cool. \"You'd think the doors would be...\" Your voice trailed off as you talked to your camera, then you looked down at the inside of the door. Your stomach turned and your heart sank.<br>\r\nThe doors had been chained. The huge chains hung down, sagging on the floor behind the doors.<br>\r\nYou stared a bit longer, and upon closer inspection, you saw they were not cut, but ripped in half. And you didn't even need to state the obvious. This was unnatural. <br>\r\nYou let the camera examine the chains, \"Okay, I'm just going to let you guys come up with your own thoughts on this.\"<br>\r\nThis creeped you out, but you would not be dissuaded, not yet.<br>\r\nYou proceeded further into the monstrous buildig, examining the graffiti on the walls, you didn't know if it was the occult or just some kids having fun with spray paint, but you hadn't seen any pentagrams yet. <br>\r\nSuddenly, as you venture further down a corridor, the corridor that held the insane in confinment, and you went further and further from the exit, you felt something. <br>\r\nA fear rose inside you. Not just the fear that you felt coming in. But instead a paralyzing sense of dread that just kept mounting and mounting. You wanted to run, but then you became afraid to turn around, reading what may be lurking in he darkness around you.<br>\r\nThen the smell hit you. Bloody hell, the smell. It was everything foul ramped up to a terrifying degree. <br>\r\nThen something happened to really kick you into panic mode.<br>\r\n<i>Hehehe</i> A small girlish but still terrifying laugh echoed through the hall from what sounded like about ten feet behind you. </span></div></div>",

You landed on your back against the cold, unforgiving floor. You dropped your flashlight and camera, and for a moment your flashlight flickered for a second allowing you the see the large, feminine shape your attacker briefly before going back out.<br>\r\nThen you heard the sound of rusty hinges squealing horribly in the darkness, followed by the sound of a heavy steel door slamming shut and locking into place.<br>\r\nYour heart sank as you realized what that meant.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Plot</font><br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nIn the old, forsaken hospital near the small town Celerysprings, strange things are happening. People in the streets whisper stories to each other, of travellers suddenly disappearing near the hospital and re-appearing weeks later, a horrific stench on them. These people usually keep their stories to themselves, knowing that nobody would believe them, and as such, the officials are entirely unaware of what is happening.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, it will mostly be a story about the foot-related misfortunes of one, or maybe two unlucky people who will be enduring the feet of one or mabye more former female doctors/nurses. Focus will be on forced smelling/worship of feet and I will also try to mix in a certain feeling of horror, if it works out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few parts will be a bit different and act as an intro to the later idea; secretive happenings in one otherwise normally running hospital (Again, foot fetish based).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Basic rules</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Try to maintain a decent level of quality. As in, don't make overly short chapters, don't take one option that suggests one thing and do the complete opposite (For example, if the option said \"You go ahead\", don't write something about the character suddenly turning around) and importantly, try to maintain good grammar and spelling. I make some errors myself, quite often, but do you know those infamous chapters where literally <i>everything</i> is just a mess? This is the kind of thing I hope to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Since the surroundings of this story are naturally very dark, violence is generally permitted. Try to avoid death if possible and don't go too overboard with blood and gore, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The feet in question always belong to a female person. It doesn't matter if the people having to smell them are male or female, but again, the worshipped one must be a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. While this story is mainly based on feet, other fetishes are generally allowed as well. The only ones I absolutely can't stand is anything related to piss or shit, so keep that out, please. Also, please try not to make things conflict, as in, don't suddenly add fetishes out of nowhere to a storyline which had nothing of the sort for several chapters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Use third person perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. This one should come naturally, but as I already mentioned before, don't take a point of a story that is already \"somewhere\" and then suddenly make something completely different out of nowhere and with no explanation. I've seen that happening a few times in different stories and it usually completely destroys otherwisely great stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's about it. I don't think I will be overly strict about the rules, so unless someone messes up <i>big time</i>, I will contact them first before deleting or changing anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, have fun. I'll be looking forward to every add and if you have ideas or opinions of any sort to the story, don't be shy to let me know!</td>",
