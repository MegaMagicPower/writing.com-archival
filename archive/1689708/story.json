It was a position she had lost recently all because she had dated Xadner Harris.  Xander Harris had cost her her place in society.  And having dumped his loser ass she was no questing to return to the post of Bitch Queen.  The going was not easy as her former 'friends' truthfully her loyal sheep had abandoned her when she had started dating Xander who was admittedly beneath her social status.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that her one time 'friends' would ever understand that Xander was something of a hero what with his secretly fighting vampires and demons once the sun went down saving the world for the whole human race.  To them he was just the son of the town drunk who dressed badly and was weird, with weird freinds.  All of whom had saved those same popular kid's lives several times over without any thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment distancing herself from Xander and his freinds hadn't helped her any.  All she had to show for it was the new student following her around.  Still a follower was a follower so Cordelia wasn't looking this horse in the mouth.  And Anya was unaware of the full scope of Cordelia's relationship with Xander so Cordelia could bitch to her hearts content over the slights real or imagined that she had had while dating Xander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you wish you could do to him?\"  Anya asked after Cordelia had finished ranting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia didn't even stop to think she grinned evilly.  \"Oooh, I wish people could see just what kind of a mutant freak Xander really is.  Like his freaky comic book freaks he always reading.  I wish he looked on the outside like the mutant he is on the outside.  That he couldn't mingle with us normal regular people without us knowing it on sight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DONE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia looked up from her clenched hands to find that Anya had changed.  Her face went from pretty  to ugly, like someone had skinned her face and replaced it with demon's wrinkled visage.  Eyes widening Cordelia realised she'd been talking to a demon all this time.  A demon who'd just done something.  Backing away Cordelia raised her hands in front of herself in defense and watched as the girl winked out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the school quad a scream rent the air as Xander Harris  doubled over in pain.  Those closest noticed that he seemed to be changing.  Changing into something... changing into...</span></div></div>",

He pumped them opened and closed as he walked across the school quad, he winced as his feet began itching painfully.  He eeped when it felt like his tailbone had been kicked by a giant.  Without warning his eyes felt like he'd been maced.  His arms felt like they'd been put an taffy puller.  His chest was tender like someone had been hammering blow after blow upon him.  And frankly he couldn't even begin to describe the horror of what was happening in his pants, it was like his dick was being ripped in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping to his knees he yelled as all the pain suddenly intensified to the tenth power. Shaking all over he tried to struggle to his feet but stopped as he caught sight of his hands through his eyes watering.  They had swollen several sizes larger than they were normally.  His finger's seemed to be stuck together in pairs of two giving him Star Trek 'live long and prosper' hands.  He was just about to call out for help when pain sprouted in his mouth like someone was pulling his teeth out.  He groaned in pain only to suddenly scream as he felt something break through the skin at the base of his spine.  Dropping down to his hands and knees he tried to make his way to the school.  He needed to get to the library, something bad was happening to him, something weird, he needed to see his friends.  After all they dealt with weird on a daily basis, so they'd know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA kid close to him took one look at Xander and let out a shocked, \"Whoa DUDE! I think your having an allergic reaction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl he was walking with looked down at Xander and recoiled, \"Fuck allergies!  His eyes are yellow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander tired to pay attention to what they were saying but the pain was overwhelming his senses.  It was a struggle to move onward.  But he pushed through the pain.  If he didn't reach the gang then he'd be dead meat.  Because what was happening to him, what he was going through, was nothing natural and he was pretty sure it was going to kill him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Xander?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackness gave way to light as Xander slowly cracked an eye open, through a dry throat and mouth he moaned out, \"oooooowwwww.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRupert Giles gave a relieved sigh and leaning over the boy as he was smiled wide at seeing the boy's eyes slit open.  \"Xander can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungh.\"  Xander groaned.  He tried to raise a hand but found his arm was to tired and that it couldn't even move, like it was strapped down with hundred pound weights.  But the bleary shape of Giles hovering over him was reassuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xander, it's Giles, nod your head if you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander nodded slowly wincing in pain as his head flare to life in agony at the movement.  He groaned out a small, \"ow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your in great pain I take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW.\" Xander managed with a little more force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid there's not much I can do for you there.  I have just your average over the counter pain killers or the tranquilizer darts we use to subdue Oz when his lycanthropy over takes him.  Which will admittedly do little other than knock you out, it will not ease your pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ow.\" was Xander's disappointed reply, containing all the sorrow he felt over his miserable choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, I'll get the Advil and a glass of water then?\"  Giles said patting the boys shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander groaned internally at his choices.  He could let it ride and just wait through the pain.  Take an Advil and hope that that helped eventually... or he could knock himself out and do the light trip fantastic.  Decisions, decisions.</span></div></div>",

The water felt good on his dried out throat however.  He finished the glass of water and pulled his head back, signaling to Giles that he was done.  The older man took the hint pulled the glass away and lowered Xander's pounding head back down to the pillow it was resting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles sat at the edge of the boys bed and toyed with the glass in his hands.  Frowning he set the glass on the bedside table and let his hands rest atop his knees.  \"Now I imagine you have questions about what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander grunted an affirmative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, we're not sure exactly what has happened to you, or rather, we're not sure why what has happened to you has happened to you.\"  Giles clarified.  \"However I'm sure your more immediately more curious about what it was that happened to you, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAffirmative grunt was an understatement,  Xander's eyes fluttered open as he looked at Giles,  he remembered what those two in the quad had said, the girl specifically. He managed to whisper. \"My eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, I suppose I can begin there.\"  Giles nodded his head and slipped into the cool detachment of a trained Watcher, able to handle the supernatural as any member of the secret society would.  \"Your eyes have changed.  The sclera has turned yellow, your iris remains brown, however your pupil has turned red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander grunted in questioning, not understanding what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles sighed and simplified his words figuring that fatigue and pain had dulled the boys brain.  \"The whites of your eyes have turned yellow, the brown parts of your eyes are still the same, the black part of your eye is now red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander's eyes popped open and he tried to reach for his eyes.  He was stopped after only a few inches he looked down and saw that his wrists were strapped down in thick leather bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles cleared his throat, \"I suppose I should explain those-\"</span></div></div>",

Closing his eyes he tried to fight through the exhaustion he felt to hear what else Giles had to say.  Finally he gave a slow nod of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were of course other changes. Your hair's grown, it's quite long now and it lays in the strangest fashion... comes to two peaks on each side of your head, a bit like horns I suppose.  You developed muttonchops also.  You've grown at least three inches and put on quite a bit of muscle mass, in the upper body especially.  We'd like to gauge your weight change but I figured that would be best done once your were conscious.  Your shoulders are quite a bit larger, as are your biceps and pectoral muscles. This of course would imply increased strength, naturally, but so much so that during your seizures the straps were insufficient to hold you during the seizures. You broke through them and both Buffy and Faith were required to restrain you.  Apparently increased strength on par with a slayer's is part of your... transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander grunted affirmatively and gave the muscles in his arm a tentative flex.  Nothing felt different.  The again was it really worth opening is eyes and the pain it brought to see exactly how swelled up he'd become.  No, no it wasn't, he decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ears have under gone a change.  The tips of your ears have become pointed much like an elves.  That appears to be the sole change.  We'll test later to see if your hearing has improved. Also your teeth have changed.  The canines in particular have enlarged themselves to resemble... well, fangs, I suppose is the only correct description.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander traced his teeth with his tongue and had to admit that yes, he now had fangs, not vampire fangs exactly but still fangs all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curiously your arms have lengthened by four inches, this means your hands come to rest below your knees when your at rest which is- uh- I don't really know how to describe it outside of simian in nature.\"  Giles pressed on, \"Both your hands and feet have grown in size, as you would imagine what with everything else on you growing.  It is, however, the size of this change that is vexing.  Previously your feet were size ten, triple E width, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuh.\", Xander grunted affirmative.  A bit curious how Giles knew that exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had to remove your shoes as your growth was threatening to destroy them during the process.\"  Giles answered.  \"Now I believe it's safe to say you'd be wearing a size thirty or so in a triple O width.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"  Xander chuffed.  He had feet bigger than Shaq's.  Weird.  But also neat.  He idly wondered what that would do for his reputation with the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now imagine your hand as you know it as a fist, it's the size of a very large apple or orange correct?\"  Xander shrugged.  This was more or less accurate, a little on the less side but effective for a mental picture.  \"Good, now imagine that your fist is the size of a very large melon.  Cantaloupe or Honeydew, only larger which is not to say... a Watermelon.  Do you understand what I'm trying to convey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander nodded slowly trying to imagine the size of his hands as he flexed his fingers into fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regretably this is the last of the subtle changes you've under gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow Xander cracked open an eye and looked at Giles who was ashen, with bags under his eyes and unkempt hair, his clothes rumpled and askew.  Giles it seemed was not joking.  Looking down at himself Xander was surprised to see that one he was naked and two he was blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles turned away as Xander screamed, \"Yes, I see you've seen that you've turned blue.  Also you seem to be covered in a fine fur... giving your skin a... well Buffy best described it as velvet covered feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith wide eyes Xander looked up at Giles in fear and shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately there is more.\"  Giles said gravely, \"You seem to have overlooked this but your fingers, the index and middle have merged together into one finger and the ring and pinky have merged together to form another finger.  Leaving you with two very large fingers on each hand.  Your thumb of course increased in size to match the other fingers sheer size.  This was of course one of the first changes, before you hands had reached their apparent full growth.  And as your hands grew so too did the size of your fingers....  They are quite large now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander flexed his fingers, both hands in front of his face as he looked at the massive digits.  A strangled whine passed his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles sighed, \"If it helps ease your mind Faith pointed out that your new, um, fingers were perfect for, uh, fooling around with young ladies who don't want to go all the way.  They're apparently a suitable phallic replacement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander looked up at the blushing Britton and tried to get his mind around what he was saying.  \"Dick hands?\" he choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something along those lines, yes.\"  Giles said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your feet were also like affected.\"   Giles seemed a bit distracted, \"Well, not exactly like but similarly.  All of your toes merged into only two toes, on both feet, however your heel has elongated and sticks out about an inch now, which is peculiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander was momentarily struck by how weird Giles was that elongated heels was the only thing he found peculiar in this situation. \"Un huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is also the tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tail?\"  Xander shouted hoarsely.  Of course his day was now complete.  He had a tail!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's remarkable, you seem to have a fully oppossable tail.  It's a classic devil's tail, actually.  It runs from the small of your back down to your ankle... uh, we'll need to run some tests to see exactly what kind of control you have over it. I thought that we could d-\"  Giles noticed xander's glare and decided that it was better left for talking about tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking away Giles went over the last item on his list of noticeable changes.  \"Then there is of course the situation with your genitals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander choked then let out a strangled whine that almost went ultrasonic he grabbed for the sheet covering him, ripping free from the straps holding him down, looking down once the sheet was out of the way he saw that there were two.  There were two.  He had two sitting one on top of the other.  One left, one right.  He looked lower and was relieved to see that the family jewels seemed to larger than before, however there weren't two of them, so he'd take what he could get.  Now he could make as many claims he wanted of having big balls and be proved right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, when the swelling goes down we'll have a better understanding of exactly what the full extent of the transformation is.\"  Giles said inoffenssively.  After all he didn't want the boy to get his hopes up when his privates returned to their regular size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-th-that is their, uh, I mean, um, that is normal size.\"  Xander said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles looked at the boy's face, noticed the distracted look and surmised the boy was telling the truth.  Under his breath he whispered, \"Lucky berk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, moving on.\"</span></div></div>",

So X now had two fingers and toes, big whoop, strange shit happened everyday here.  So why the fuck did B have her tits in a twist over this.  It's not like X had-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO WAY!\"  Faith shouted jolting to her feet.  \"TWO?  B are you shittin' me?

A bed sheet held tightly around his mid section by his large left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No man wants to hear the word small in conjunction with his, er, equipment..\"  Xander gaze a small grin.  Giles clucked his tongue and rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy released Faith and Faith returned the favor, both women pulled apart and rolled away from one another.  Blushing Buffy looked up at the ceiling while Faith leveled her gaze directly at Xander's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles broke the silence, \"Xander will you sit down before you fall down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander smiled at the man and together to two moved slowly into the living room with the two slayers.  buffy slowly moved over to him and took him by the free elbow, making sure to catch his eye and see if it was okay.  Xander just gave her a big grin.  Smiling back Buffy helped her friend to the sofa and helped him settle in.  Once he was down she moved across the room and sat in an opposite chair.  Faith sauntered over to the couch and sprawled down beside Xander, nudging his sheet covered leg with her denim covered knee.  When Xander looked at her Faith smiled wide, \"C'mon, Blue, lemme see the boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander looked at Faith with a raised eyebrow, \"Faith, I don't shake my money maker nor flash the boys without first having benjamin's in my G string.  You wanna see the show you gotta pay the price of admission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy gaped at the two while Giles shook his head and took the remainig seat in the room muttering to himself about hormones and teenagers and americans and lunacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith winked at Xander, \"I'll hold you to it, Blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking forward to it.\"  Xander nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xander are you feeling... o.k.?\"  Buffy asked softly, this kind of behavior was well outside of his normal wheelhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Xander shook his head, \"I wanna know who was driving the steamroller that ran me over, but other than that.... If you don't laugh, you might as well go nuts.\"  he shrugged slowly, \"and i got more nuts than a Snickers bar already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Well, moving along, i trust that we can keep this just between everyone in this room?\"  Giles asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy nodded her head while Xander flipped a lazy salute.  Faith just gave a grin, \"Oh, c'mon, Jeeves....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faith.\"  Giles said with great aggrivation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Faith was going to have said was interupted by the opening of the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Good.  I'm not going to ask any silly questions, Xander, I know your in pain and I know your not happy about this... so what do you want for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander gave  a small smile, \"Ah, Mrs. Summers, you know me too well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough to restock the twinkie supply every time you leave.\" Joyce walked over to him and sat down on the edge of the coffee table in front of Xander.  She put both her hands on his knees and gave a small squeeze.  \"I'm happy you came through this o.k., Xander, relatively speaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay?  X is better than O.K.!\"  Faith smirked and held up her right hand with her index and middle finger extended, \"Dude, came to with two, count 'em, two dicks!  How'd ya like that shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyce blinked and looked from a grinning Faith who was waggling her eyebrows over to Xander who was giving the slayer a very disgruntled look.  she heard Giles groan and heard Buffy stifle a gasp.  Xander asked,\"Tact is just lost on you isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, man, you got TWO dicks!  Two!  If I was you I'd be tellin' everyone I know!  Shit, I'd be callin' Guinness and Ripley's and those guys, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I want to know how you know this Faith?\"  Joyce asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B told me.\"  Faith laughed and waved a hand to Buffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy eeped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\"  Joyce  asked with a glacially cold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to!\"   Buffy nearly shouted, \"I was- I was in shock!  I didn't know he had two?  I mean- I- Xander!  It was an ACCIDENT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyce looked at her red faced daughter over to Xander who was running his hand through his hair.  When she caught his eye he nodded.  She turned to Giles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, Xander awoke and he and I were conversing about his transformation.  Buffy heard us and in her excitement to see Xander she barged into the room without first checking to see if it was safe.  At the time Xander and I were talking about, uh, well, a serious change that had occurred.\"  Giles said while looking first at Buffy, then Joyce, then Xander and then finally at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith began snickering.  This shit was just too funny for her.   Guy turns blue, grows a tail, looses almost all his fingers and toes and the biggest change according to Jeeves is that X grows a second cock.  That shit was just fucked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are... you okay?\"  Joyce asked Xander with a frown, not exactly sure what she should say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander shrugged, \"Iunno.\"  He cast a side long glance at Faith, \"I'd appreciate it if my press agent would stop spreading the word world wide, tho!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith laughed and laughed, \"Yeah, but think of th' killin' you'd make in porn, X.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room that was not Faith looked at her in amazement.  Joyce was the first to break out of it, shaking her head she sighed, \"While that's true, Faith, let's not urge Xander in to degrading himself for lonely housewives like myself just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith stopped laughing and looked at Joyce, \"Oh, you gotta be yanking my chain, Mrs. S.  You gotta be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask Xander.\"  Joyce leaned forward and patted his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes turned to the blue man who dropped his head into his hands and muttered, \"The first rule of rescuing a woman who actually doesn't need rescuing is you don't talk about rescuing a woman who doesn't need rescuing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"  Buffy and Faith said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xander stopped by a few times a week this summer, keeping an eye on me.\"  Joyce said blushing.  If  Xander was going to be this embarassed by Faith then she'd join him in humiliation solidarity.  \"One time he stopped by when I was, well-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, I can't hear this!\"  Buffy wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can.\"  Faith grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Entertaining myself with a video...  Apparently I was being very vocal.  He assumed I was .... well, Xander assumed I was in trouble so he broke down the front door dashed up the steps to save  me from whatever he thought was attacking me.  And after kicking in my bedroom door he scared the living hell out of both of us!\"  Joyce concluded, she daintily raised her shoulders in a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And one more time, very, very sorry about that.\"  Xander softly said from where he was trying to hide his head behind his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, X, got a free show?\"  Faith asked excitedly, \"Hey, he can return the favor right now.  All that's standin' between you an him and his boys is that there sheet.  Give the word Mrs. S. and I'll have him naked in a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyce looked at Faith oddly, the brunette was really wound up about Xanders transformation.  Was this some kind of new fetish she had or was she just acting out to try and be funny or did  she like Xander that way.  Or...  Joyce put it out of her mind, there were to many possibilities, she'd confront Faith about it later when they were alone.  \"Thank you, Faith, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever else she was going to say was thrown right out the window as Xander who had been looking about wildly disappeared into a cloud of purple smoke.</span></div></div>",
