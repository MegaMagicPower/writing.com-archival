Opening his brown eyes, the 16 year old stretched his body before sitting up and scratching his messy hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, yesterday's trip really tired me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it seems Roni maybe went on a say...hiking trip. He in actuality went on one of his voyages into the world of his anime, hanging out in the awesome world he loved to watch. He had visited the My Hero Academia world and got to watch the sports festival from the crowd! It was awesome and it was more intense to see all the quirks so up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni smiled as he crawled to the foot of his bed, on the floor was a comfy doggy bed was a pug. \"Hey Zed, morning bud.\" The wizard leaned down and rubbed the doggo's head before it relaxed and layed on his penguin toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man soon threw of his covers and started getting ready. Taking a shower, Roni then threw on some grey sweatpants and a pokeball tshirt. Despite his magical powers, Roni still couldn't probably brush his thick spiky hair down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the center of his room, Roni rose his hand and spun his finger. A purple magical circle with multiple unrecognizable letters decorating it started to form. Multiple orbs appeared before the magical circle. Inside all of them was a scene from a anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni was going on another one of his anime adventures. This one would be different as his size magic would come into play. He's experienced this type of journey before, such as when he visited the pokemon world, so small that Pikachu could hold him in his furry palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe circle began to glow and Roni was prepared to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is will he be going alone, or perhaps have a friend with him?</span></div></div>",

However, with high school over most of them were either working or trying to deal with college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard was going solo it seemed, oh well maybe he'll have company another time. Now he just needed to pick a world to enter before shrinking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thousands of orbs depicting anime scenes filled Roni with excitement. He made sure to keep his phone on hand in case someone called, luckily signals reached across the dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.....now where should I go. Maybe some where familar or new! There's lot of hot guys to have looming over, but so little time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni soon summoned a orb and watched as it fused with the magical circle and crafted a portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\", Roni excitedly yelled before flushing as he saw Zed looking at him with amusement on his puggy face. He chuckled and rubbed the back of his head \"Hehe...sorry buddy, it's still cool everytime I open the gate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a quick goodbye to his dog, Roni hopped into the portal. The brunette boy watched in awe as he soared through a stream of sparkling blue light. This was the tunnel between worlds that only wizards could open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni soon felt tingly as he changed his size to that of one inch, he soon saw the end of the tunnel ahead. Soon Roni would be in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich anime world did he go to?</span></div></div>",

It was quite dark and lit only by a few lamps, it had a bookcase with several books lining the shelves. A bed which could've held more than a hundred Ronis of the same size loomed overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni gulped, \"This atmosphere, the dim lights and gothic looking aesthetic..did I end up in the Zoldyck mansion?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni of course would get his answer when the bedroom door swung open to reveal the white haired titan himself: Killua Zoldyck! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni's jaw was on the floor as the boy was an absolutely massive titan heading towards him! The giant was dressed in his usual attire, and what's more...he was visibly sweaty! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had his hands in his pockets as he strode casually across the room. He was unaware the effect his footfalls were having on a tiny individual below. The floor seemed to quake beneath the purple sneakers, Roni was drooling by now at how HUGE and powerful those covered feet seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic assassin boy flopped on his bed and sighed, \"What a day...I wonder what Gon's doing right now.\" The giant's voice rumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni couldn't help himself anymore, he raced towards those feet, using his magic to give himself extra speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn, my feet are sore...heh...I ain't changed my socks in a few weeks. I wonder how bro would react if I stuffed em' in his pillowcase.\" Killua snickered to himself as he reached down...</span></div></div>",

The tiny groaned rubbing his back before his eyes widened as Killua stepped onto the heel of his shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys have been baking for too long, time to let loose!\", pulling on his foot with a considerable amount of force Killua's sweaty socked cloth foot started to peel off the insole. \"Hey come on it's time to come out\", Killua grunted as he tugged on his foot and with a POP the foot came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni looked in amazement, Killua's large feet looked to have a painted on sock as the sweat smeared acros the sole of the foot. A heavy scent suddenly filled the air as Killua's foot let out a strong potent stink, like that of funky cheese odor. The cheesy socked foot soon rested on the heel looming high above the shrunken wizard and blasting Roni with the bittersweet fumes <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the same difficulty, Killua took his other shoe off now having both feet free. The white haired boy chuckled as he wiggled his large toes through the socks, tiny squelchs rang out as the large gallons of sweat smooshed against the socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua chuckled as he slid the sneakers pouring out odor aside. Grabbing the hem of his the Zoldyck grinned as he began to peel of the sweat filled sock. \"Alright you better not stick like the shoes hehe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a sticker peeling rang out as the white cloth, the fabric had somewhat adhired due to the tremendous sweat build up over Killua's activities. The cheddary idor hit Roni and had him sniff it up eagerly as the heavy stench floated the air. The plump soles dripped drops of sweat to the ground, letting out burst of the warm vinegar cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni looked up in amazement as both soles came down, producing loud slaps as the plump sweaty feet hit the ground. The large toes rested before him, the big toe being bigger then him as with each wiggle a cheddary overload from the lint filled toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua sighed. \"That's better, nice do air these digs out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zoldyck then....</span></div></div>",

Killua unsuspectingly flattened his sole flattening roni below he cheesy, musky appendage Roni was suffocated by the seeping stench and the dry and sticky sweat intruding on him from all corners, even into his mouth. He could almost taste the journeys killua's feet witnessed with gon and the others. He squirmed to try get free and reached the toes, large lint coated ones, killua was texting gon and felt roni's movements by his toes tickling him he scrunched his toes wrapping roni and drenching him further. Roni was pushed back under the sole and became stuck to the foot. Killua tilted his foot up and waved it around whilst flexing his toes inviting the rooms fresh air to fight against his grimy foot stench Roni plastered on the sole like a bug on the hunter's soft smelly sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua felt the small mass on his sole and tilted it towards his face and put on a discerning look, \"woah. Look how small you are, heh unlucky you ended up below there Haha.\" Roni chuckled lightly in slight fear as he made eye contact with the assassin. Who licked his lips.

Appearing at a inch tall once the light died down where Roni and Ren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man those tunnels are still wild!\", Ren wiggled his ears as he adjusted to the new environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni smiled and looked in awe at all the furniture stretching into the sky. The room was darkened, meaning whoever the giant is that was staying here most likely was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two tinies were by the wall and about to go exploring when a faint tremor was felt. Roni could sense a large figure through his magic waves, Ren had heightened sense and could feel the distant shaking of the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A giant's coming, oh my Hecate Ren a giant's coming!\", Roni began excitingly shaking Ren's shoulders and subsequently his whole torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah..yesss...I can...sense itttt!\", Ren yelped as he was shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the hotel soon opened and both of the tinies looked in awe at the giant standing in the doorway. It was Edward Elric, standing tall (or short) like a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStomping over to the bed, the red soles of Ed's boots shook the ground before he sat on the bed. Ed huffed with an annoyed look as he pulled off his black jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal of his automail arm seem to glisten with sweat coating it as trails of the liquid traveled from Ed's body to the metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grh can't believe the colonel basterd had me out in the desert! The philosopher stone was just a hoax.\", Ed leaned onto his knees as he brooded over his waste of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni and Ren slowly walked closer, soon stopping next to the large boot. A strange scent soon hit then from Ed looming above, a distinct b.o smell from the numerous trails of sweat going down the alchemist's toned arms and chest. Ed's bangs were sticking to his forehead as from the steamy liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd sighed before.....</span></div></div>",

Edward tested Roni as well, wiggling his bulbous toes and snickering as he saw the tiny 'wizard' squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..I guess the colonel having me out in the desert isn't such a bad thing after all. You guys must have a thing for a hardworking alchemist's scent!\" Edward grinned toothily at their shocked expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How did you...?\" Ren blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe I'm not stupid, I know I stink after today and I could tell you guys were staring.\" Edward brought them up to his gleaming golden eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...want a sniff?\" He chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd let us?!\" Roni blurted eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd nodded, \"Hehe, just think of it as equivalent exchange. I let you at my pits and feet...you tell me about where you come from after.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth tinies nodded, \"Yes Mr. Elric!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward licked his lips, this was pretty awesome! Not to mention, he wasn't exactly the short one around anymore!</span></div></div>",

Don't play on the switch for too long.\" A happy woof was given as Roni petted his pug's head. The spiky haired boy turned to Ren and held out a hand. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen nodded and grasped his friend's hand. \"Lead the way Potter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard playfully huffed before he and the foxboy hopped into the portal. The gate shimmered before eventually dissolving. Zed looked at the few blue sparkles before pawing over to the t.v in Roni's room before turning on his Nintendo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two travelers flooded through the dimensional tunnel, Roni was looking around in fascination while Ren had his hands behind his head as he relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the plan when we get there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni rubbed his chin. \"Well it depends on who we encounter, I mean seeing giants loom over is always cool.

Better hope it doesn't stink up the room too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weapon swayed his feet, feeling the sweat clinging to his socks being smeared over his REEKING soles.

Ren facepalmed as he looked to the giant feet. \"Oh boy, I wonder where he could- oooofff course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni was standing a inch away from the hot socked sole, looking up in awe at the damp and crusty looking fabric. He sniffed in the powerful chessy funk and sighed in bliss, the bittersweet stench clouding his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude do you really have to act on your foot fetish now?\", Ren deadpanned as he saw Roni squishing his palm into the sweaty sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard blushed but grinned as he could feel the hot sole, pushing to release more of that cheese. \"Sorry Ren, but....the sole is so different!

His attention was brought to his large star marked shoes, he could feel his soles squishing against the insole feeling hot sweat lightly splash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh alright time to let the BIG boys out!\", Reaching down Black*Star roughly grasped the ankle of his boot like shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni's eyes sparkled as he hopped in place. \"OMG Ren he's taking off his shoes!\", the wizard gushed. As the foot lifted up Roni looked at the flat grey sole laced with dirt, bound to hold large feet. Ren sighed in amusement at Roni's fanboying, though he secretly blushed as he saw the underarms of Black*Star, more specifically his blue fuzzy pits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star grunted as he started to pull on his shoes, clenching his teeth as it seems his feet cooking in sweat made his sole adhear to the foot. \"ARRGH come on i need to show of my BIG feet too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud POP the heel of Black*Star's foot dislodged from the show. The ninja let out a loud sigh before grinning as he started to pull of the rest of the shoe. Roni was drooling as first the rough heel was in the sky and then following that the meaty sole was revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his physical activities and high energy, Black*Star's soles were quite plump looking both soft and meaty. Sweat was smeared over the sole from the insole absorbing his smelly sweat. The smell was as big as the feet, a thick cheddary odor started to fumigate out into the fresh air and floated down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni breathed in the stench and sighed. The cheesy fumes was both bitter and sweet, making his nostrils flare as the intoxicating stench hung around the tinies like a fog. Renard meanwhile gagged as he pulled his hoodie over his mouth, this was totally different from pits! The cheese was highly potent as the giant blue haired ninja flexed his plump sole getting drops to fall down and splash like buckets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star let out a booming laugh as he pulled off the shoe, tossing it aside to shake up the ground for the tinies. \"HAHAHA! That feels real good!\", leaning down and taking a sniff of his odorous foot, the ninja closed his eyes and grinned. \"Sure build up a sweat today stomping out those pathetic bugs! Sure was an honor to get crushed by the great me HAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen groaned as he clamped his ears shut all while Roni was ogling at the \"perfect giant material\" as he calls it. Black*Star soon took off his other shoe, increasing the faul cheddary funk in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud wet slaps boomed as Black*Star stomped both his meaty, sweaty feet down in front of the tinies. Roni was 5 seconds from running in as he watched the truck sized toes wiggling and heating up the linty gunk between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what the?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Roni and Ren widened their eyes as from above Black*Star was looking right at them! The spiky bluenette had his eyes narrowed and an eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zed watched his owner and friend leave before sighing, already missing the wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPawing over to his dog bed, Zed pulled out a black furred jacket. The pug soon crawled under It, a lump shifting. Suddenly the lump grew and the jacket rose to reveal a young man, with black hair, red jeans, and black boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZed grinned as he picked up his penguin plush, setting it on his shoulder. \"Have fun master, I'll be there if you ever need help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nCiel Phantomhive sat in his office, buisness paper in hand and a cup of tea about to be poured by his butler Sebastian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as Sebastian was about to pour the hot drink he narrowed his eyes suddenly. The demon could sense a strange energy approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sebastian what is it?\", Ciel asked upon seeing the tall man momentarily freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butler soon grew one of his smiles. \"Ah my lord it seems we have some...otherworldly visitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel blinked before frowning. \"Pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebastian chuckled as he suddenly held his hand palm up. \"Ah a wizard and totem, a while since I've seen their kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the earl could question Sebastian, a blue circle suddenly flashed in front of the butler and Ciel briefly spotted two specks falling to the gloved palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni ophed as he fell onto the soft ground. He was confused as he and Ren were supposed to walk out of the portal, not fall from the sky. Looking over to Ren, Roni saw him laying on the soft ground nonchalantly looking at the giant casting a shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard looked in awe as the demonic butler Sebastian Michaelis was looming over holding him and Ren in the palm of his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebastian coyly grinned. \"So you must be our guests! I must say I was not expecting literal small company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni was lost in ooggiling land as Sebastian brought his palm down to Ciel's desk. Ren sighed as he threw Roni over his shoulder and stepped off the gloved hand. The wizard soon snapped out of it as Ren set him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel looked down in surprise at the two tinies before him. He had encountered strange anomalies but inch tall tiny people was a new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth, who are you and how did you appear out of nowhere?\", Ciel looked both in suspicion and curiosity between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni grinned. \"Well my names Roni and this is Ren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo.\", Ren flashed a peace sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason we showed up here is because.....we wanna study here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel raised an eyebrow. \"You what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We what?\", Ren whispered looking over looking over. The wizard sent him a grin and nod, denting some assurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni nodded. \"We come from the future and wanted to try experiencing life in this time period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel kept his eye on the two tinies, staring intensely at them with his merciless might. He finally blinked and looked up to his butler. \"Is what he's saying true Sebastian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butler chuckled. \"He is not from this time my lord, perhaps he is being genuine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earl sighed before looking back down, opening his mouth confused as the two tinies had gotten on their knees and had their heads bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are being truthful, then I will allow you runts to stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two suddenly jumped in the air sparkles surrounding them as they grasped hands and twirled. Both had looks of joy as they cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On these conditions!\", Ciel slammed his hand to the desk, shaking up the tinies before they quickly got back on their knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are going to live in my manor then you must earn your keep. Your size is not an excuse, if I ask you to complete a task you will complete it, understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES MY LORD!\", the wizard and foxboy bowed in sync.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My my, they've adapted quickly.\"</i>, Sebastian thought as he watched the tinies amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel sweatdropped before sighing. \"Now then, for someone your sizes I will be giving you personal jobs. Also I want you to spend time explaining the future to me.\", a impish grin grew on the earl's face as he leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know what events will befall our world, what new creations are made. If such knowledge is in my hands then the future shall be easy to pave the way for my legacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni and Ren looked to each other, the two smiled as they had their housing taken care of not to mention getting to interact with this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was up first?</span></div></div>",

Whenever they entered an anime or other realm...the utmost care was necessary to not alter the timeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCase in point, they were currently in an anime set in Victorian England...so Ciel's request that they simply spill what happens in the future might not be one they could in good conscience follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel scowled and jolted them out of their thoughts by slamming his fist on the desk's surface. \"I gave you two an order did I not?!

The foxboy chuckled and put his hands up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni chuckled before grasping Ren's hand. \"Come on let's get going!\" The two walked into the portal gate, Roni's voice could be heard. \"Just so you know, he mains Ridley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZed grumbled as he started his round, the portal carrying his owner and friend vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard and foxboy flowed through the blue shimmering tunnel, heading to the world of Fairy Tail. Roni rubbed his chin as he held up a hand and formed a small purple magic circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we'll have to give our powers names, like everyone in the show. I think I'll call mine...Mirage Glyph!\", Roni grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen looked over from where he was lounging, the foxboy held up a finger and a blue flame sprouted. \"I might just call mine blue fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard pouted as he dissolved the circle. \"Come on Ren! We can't be basic, well just blend into the back if we don't make a good impression!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Ren flooded over. \"First off Roni, I have ears plus a tail and I'm sure if we ever got separated I could find you by looking at the hair of everyone. Second, were going on a tiny adventure. If anyone sees us were bound to either be running or underneath a foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni's face fell slightly, he had gotten kind of into exploring this world. But a tiny journey was different then a normal one. Ren frowned at his friend's downed mood before smiling and throwing a arm around his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look we can try going on this guild trip later, for now let's just gaze at some giants.\", Roni smiled and nodded at Ren's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen grinned as he tossed a fire ball between his hands. \"You know what, I think I got a name. I'll name my power....Azure Flame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni nodded. \"Cool! Hey the end of the tunnels coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two were involved in a bright light and no longer found themselves in the glowing tunnel. At first, it appeared they were on a platform of sorts, stretching for a mile. But upon further inspection, it turns out they were on a giant table!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice the shrinking spell worked!\", Roni fist bumped Ren as the foxboy looked around in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of the table was a couch, surrounding it were other messy objects like discarded clothes and food utensils. A loud creak soon rang out as the door to the room opened and booming steps could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the room was....</span></div></div>",

The musky odor began to fuse with that of that of the natural B.O coming off Natsu's body. The scent was so strong that it somewhat reached Roni's nose, the wizard smiled as he sniffed the awesome smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen however let out a BLAGH sound as not only did he smell the b.o, but his stronger nose smelled the sweaty musk even more. Ren looked over and rolled his eyes as he saw Roni blissfully sniffing the fragrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ah great, he's off in giant dream land.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu suddenly stopped stretching as he rose an eyebrow. A scent hit his nose, beside his mighty body odor Natsu could smell some other people near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh what the?\", the black eyes of Natsu looked over his pecs and narrowed at two specks below him on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni and Ren looked in awe as Natsu began squatting down. Setting his hands on his knees, Natsu's musk spread more as he looked surprised as he saw the specks were in fact tiny humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!\", Natsu gawked loudly, Roni and Ren were thrown to the table at the booming voice, the foxboy winced as he pressed his fluffy ears to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you...actually why the hell are you guys so damn small?\", Natsu asked leaning his head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni grinned and helped Ren up. \"My names Roni! This is my friend Renard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foxboy flashed a piece sign. \"Yo, call me Ren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard then rubbed his head. \"Umm you see me and Ren are...fans of you, the Salamander of Fairy Tail Natsu Dragneel! My magic let's me control size so we often go on...tiny trips!\", Roni quickly made up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu was still slightly puzzled but soon grinned toothily as he reached forward and scoped up both the tinies. Duo ophfs rang out as Roni and Ren bounced on the warm palm. Standing back up, Natsu walked over to his couch and plopped his rear down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I've gotta a couple of tiny fans huh? I think it's pretty neat, you guys are like bugs to me!\", Natsu chuckled as he looked at the two tinies in the center of his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni had sparkles surrounding him as he felt his giant fantasy playing out. Ren sweatdropped but none the less lounged back on the soft ground, thinking the situation was still kinda cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu suddenly smirked as he flexed a bicep. \"Since you squirts are such big fans, you wouldn't mind pampering me a bit right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen rubbed his head. \"I mean it depe-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Natsu!\", Roni quickly said getting Ren to sigh from the wizards excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon slayer grinned as he suddenly used a finger to rub both of their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah!

The spiky haired boy's feet were far larger then other feet hes stood before. The wizard was shorter then the heel and had to stretch his neck to look up to the toes wiggling in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing forward, Roni smiled as he hugged the rough sole. His whole front dampened as the sweat clung to him, Roni hummed as he inhaled the powerful foot odor sizzling off of Sora's ginormous feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man who knows how many tinies he could stomp, or have worship his feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni soon stuck out his tongue and licked the plump sole, despite only getting a tiny spot numerous sweat drops filled his mouth.

The foxboy chuckled as he looked at the giant feet in the distance, visualizing how much his friend must be gawking over the giant's stompers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen's nose picked up a scent, being part fox his sense of smell was higher. This musky scent was coming from all around, smelling like a mix of sweat and b.o from heat. Sitting on a giant's body was bound to get you surrounded in their smells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA particular spot had a strange difference from Sora's normal b.o.

The spiky brunette suddenly noticed a strange speck against his sweaty sole. <i>\"Huh is a pebble in my shoe?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni was in a blissful state as the heavy pressure along with the plump sole squashing him, the audible squishing noises along with the heavy cheddar stench made for a delightful smooshing. The wizard wiggled slightly feeling the soft and sweaty sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora's eyes widened as he felt squirming against his sole.

Sora sighed as he wiggled his large toes, feeling the musky chesse fumes emit from his odorus plump soles. His socks while absorbing his sweat also let drops fell showing how much his feet were swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller teen whistled as he bend down and caught a whiff of his friend's cheddary sole. Riku soon smirked and chuckled as he could spot a faint bump in Sora's sole, the 'bug' was still squirming as it was smooshed into the foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora then managed to dislodge his other foot, leaving his two dirty socked soles on display. The boy hummed as he tapped his feet, getting wet slaps. \"I think I'll take the pit bug out first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising his arm over his head, Sora reached into his sleeve and felt his greasy warm pit. The boy let out a triumphant \"ah ha!\" as he took out a tiny squirming speck between his fingers. Sora closed his fist around the speck, chuckling as he reached for his socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok let's get your buddy out!\", grabbing the sock of his unoccupied foot first Sora began to peel the wet fabric off with a peeling noise. The brunette sighed as the air hit his baking feet mixing with it's chessy fumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for his other foot, Sora peeled off the sock and let out even more cheddary odors. Holding his palm below his sole Sora flexed his plump sole, after a few drops hit a small body landed on the fingerless gloved palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni panted as he looked up to the looming sole he'd been squashed into, the steamy fumes were now stuck to his body, giving him the scent of Sora's chessy feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey come on show the runts.\", Riku said wanting to see these super bugs who could survive his friend's stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora grinned toothily as he opened his fist over the palm, letting the pit bug join the foot one.

The sweaty hot skin of Riku pit released its steam and hot musky grease stench. Bringing his palm to the open pit, both tinies were hit by the thick and sour musk much like a a heat wave filtered through sweaty odors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen blushed before running towards the edge of the palm and jumping into the pit. A squelch rang out as Ren faceplated into the sweaty wall. Riku sighed as he felt the speck rub his face into his rank pit, pulling his palm away he lowered his arm sealing the foxboy in a hot spour cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the pit, Ren was in a sweet sweaty heaven. The strong sour was eagerly sniffed upped and tingled his strong nostrils. Unlike Sora's pit Riku's muscular arm smooshed him more into the sweaty pit, tangling the greasy purple hairs around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku licked his lips as he rubbed his arm back and forth, felling the speck get squished into his sweaty soft pit. Stepping on the heels of his sneakers Riku began to pull his sweaty hot feet out. Using a free hand, Riku pulled on his soaked sock yanking it off and letting a strong and new odor out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular boy's feet had sweat coating them as well, however they were different from Sora. The stench was more of a salty vinegar tinge and rather then plump the soles were rather muscled with a smooth look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku smirked as he looked down at the wizard. \"You sure you wanna be under me Roni? Ive crushed a lotta bugs with these feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni blushed at the mischievous taunt. \"I-i'll be ok my magic makes me and Ren really tough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips, Riku crouched down and tilted his palm to set Roni before his large smelly toes. The wizard looked up in awe as Riku stood up and clenched his fists before covering his smirking face with the large sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku wiggled his toes before stomping down, Roni hummed as he was pinned to the floor by the sweaty and stinky foot. Riku crossed his arms as he leaned forward putting pressure on both of the tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep those nose sniffing squirts, this is a competition after all!\", Riku impishly grinned as he squished his arm to his body and bounced on his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora looked in awe at Riku's treatment of their new tiny friends, not only were they tough but they liked their smells. It also sucked that he had been unconsciously smooshing his scent into them, meanwhile Riku was giving them the best smell treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni blushed as Riku lifted his heel and started grinding his body into the ball of the firm sole. The vinagar musk was bittersweet as it flared his nostrils and produced the sweet yet salty sweat he eagerly lapped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good minute of squishing the boys, Riku hummed as he lifted up his foot and saw after all his stomping Roni was stuck to his sole. Peeling off the flushed tiny, Riku soon opened his sour pit and detangled Ren out of his greasy hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku held the smelly and panting tinies in his palm as he and Sora loomed above. The brunette toothily grinned while Riku smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who smells more?!\", Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni and Ren smiled before in sync yelling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SORA!\"<br>\r\n RIKU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard and foxboy looked at each other in surprise before Roni clenched a fist. \"Sora's feet are more cusiony and chessy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen tched and pressed his forehead against Roni's. \"Hey the pressure in Riku's pits are amazing plus i thought you like muscled feet?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni pushed his forehead more against Ren's. \"Well yeah but it took a lotta stomping to get me to stick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora blinked confused while Riku awkwardly rubbed the back of his head.

He happily gave many \"thank you\"'s, overjoyed that the giant keyblade user wasn't weirded out by his foot fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora warmly smiled before leaning forward and placing Roni between his towering feet, enveloping the wizard in the funky chesse odor which Roni eagerly sniffed. The giant then put his hands behind his back letting his musky pits breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you maybe start with a rub Roni? My feet are feeling kinda sore.\", Sora asked wiggling his big toes and peering at the tiny boy smaller then his heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni eagerly nodded before rushing over to the right heel, huge wall of cheddary stench and sweat loomed over. The wizard placed his palms on the heel feeling it's soft yet more rough texture. Beginning to need his hands in, the flesh gave way to the rubs and even seemed to let out puffs of chessy fumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora closed his eyes humming as he felt the tiny hands rubbing his huge feet. This was awesome, not only did he make friends with some cool tinies but both of them love smell his and Riku's smells! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You enjoying the smell squirt?\", Sora asked swaying his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni smiled as he pressed his nose into the damp sole and inhaled the sweet and mighty stench. He felt his nostrils not only get clouded but his nose hairs flared from the warm odor. The wizard closed his eyes and sighed as he rubbed his cheek against the chessy sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep your feet are so cool Sora!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora chuckled and flushed at the cute tiny gushing over his plump foot. Roni began to climb the heel soon reaching the plump and even chessier stench shoved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon.......</span></div></div>",

His feet grew softer towards the arches and especially the ball and toes! He wiggled those plump digits up above Roni, fanning down tremendously cheddary air down his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni felt like he had died and gone to heaven. Sora's feet were like the ultimate in foot fantasy! His soles were wide and soft, his toes perfectly shapely and plump. And that intense cheese smell was the strongest Roni had ever experienced in his years as a foot perv!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you can trust Roni had smelled a LOT of feet! \"Your feet are the best I've ever experienced!\" Roni called up to Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe keyblade wielder rose an eyebrow in astonishment. \"Whoa! You've smelled other guys' feet too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! I've smelled and experienced about a hundred or so...but yours are the best! They're so perfectly shaped and soft, and their smell is sooo strong!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora blushed but gained a cheeky grin, \"Hehehehe! I never thought my foot cheese would be praised so much! I'm glad we found you little guys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni smiled and couldn't help himself, he gave the sole a kiss. Sora's eyes widened and he laughed, \"You're kissing my feet! That's so cool! Do it again!\" Sora childishly demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni began giving Sora's feet what was essentially a makeout session. He threw in plenty of tongue action as well, which caused the big boy to groan in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...that feels pretty amazing! Now...</span></div></div>",

Sora was flushing and giggling as the tiny foot lover tickled his feet with the kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Roni reached the top of the foot, the strongest cheesy funk was just above and the wizard propped himself on the cliff of foot flesh before the towering toes. It was no wonder the cheddary odor was so strong, acros the canyon of sweat toes was an assortment of dried and gooey toe jam looking steamy from the heat Sora cooked them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheddary odor was thick and made the temperature between the towering toes hot with its strong stench the sweat and heat had been cooked into the soles and now had it's powerful stinky aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora grinned toothily as he could spot Roni between his big and second toe. The giant giggled as the tiny happily waved to him. \"Awesome you made it Roni!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni smiled before bringing his attention back to the grimy toes, he felt a strong temptation to lick up the toe cheese but didn't know how Sora would feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Sora wiggled his towering toes and smiled. \"Hey Roni are you hungry? You can have some of my cheese if you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard beamed and hugged the sweaty and jam coating wall of the toe. \"Thank you Sora!\", Roni then crouched down, blushing as he took a deep breath of the amazing scent feeling it tingle his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticking out his tongue, Roni liked up the melted jam much like that of cooked cheese. Roni sighed as he swallowed the warm gunk feeling the sweaty heat stay on his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it taste little guy?\", Sora eagerly asked as he felt the tiny licks lapping up his toe gunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni smiled as he picked up a glob, taking a big sniff before tossing it on his mouth. Patting his belly Roni blushed as he let out a small burp. \"It's super tasty, some of the best sharp cheddar i had!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora hummed as he grinned at the compliment. \"Awesome, you can count on me to have the best cheese!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

Riku grew a grin as he set Ren down on his dark purple clad thigh. Ren's nose twitched as the b.o was now being pushed back with a muskier smell.

Ok for real, this interactive will be a tad different from my other Macro/Micro ones as this has a main character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the main character of this story is a persona I used named Roni. ( <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/fudge1999/art/My-Persona-Roni-755385923\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/fudge1999/art/My-Persona-Roni-755385923</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni is a somewhat introverted and geeky young man with a love of anime. This Finnish-American boy isn't actually a human but rather a wizard with all sorts of strange powers. Some in particular are the ability to change size, increase durability, and travel to different worlds that only appear fictional. Roni also has a strange like of being small and experiencing different character's reactions to a tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo in this story, Roni will be traveling to different anime worlds. He can venture on his own however he also be joined by some friends. If you have a persona, oc, or even yourself that you wanna put in the story to join Roni, go on ahead! And if a character is introduced then you can also have your character join them in that storyline as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk so some rules.<br>\r\n1. Keep macro/micro action to male characters. Female characters can show up but keep the tiny stuff to males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Fetishes are allowed except for piss or scat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Please do not bash someone's oc put in here. I say this as in if someone puts in a character and then you put in your character, don't write bad stuff happening to that character just because you don't like the character or author writing the character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlrighty read on~<br>\r\n</td>",
