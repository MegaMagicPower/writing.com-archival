            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Welcome to the Young Eves highschool for girls,\" your new principle said with great happiness in her voice. \"My name is Mrs Spring, I am this schools principle,\" she said with great pride in her words. <br>\r\n(Talking to the reader) Hi my name is Tai Baret, I am a new student to the all girls school known as Young Eves. For me this will be a big change in my life as it will be a new experience to be going to school for once since I was always homeschooled at the orphanage where I grew up. Unfortunately when I was just a few years old, I was abandoned by my parents at the orphanage, I guess because my parents didn't want a freak of nature as their son since I was born with a extremely rare medical case from when I was born, it is a case where I will only grow to the size of around 5 inches when I have fully grown up, but currently I am only 16 years old meaning that I am currently at a height of 3 inches. Anyway I am now attending High school since the orphage hasn't got much room anymore, even for me who didn't take up much room in the first place. Although I happen to be a guy, I was allowed into the high school since they thought it would be safer for me to be at then at a co-ed or boys school where I would more than likely be bullied.<br>\r\n\".... and thats why I am so proud of my school,\" states the principle. Having not listened to any thing that she had said you just nod which is usually the best course of action for this case. With the introduction to the school finished a woman walked into the office and said that she was my new teacher, her name was Mrs Robins. She was in her early 30's, she was a true beauty with a beautiful face, and a stuning figure. She was wearing a white dress with a blue vest, with black nylons and high heels. She took me to my new classroom where I would be spending most of my days in for the next 3 years of my life. It was a real bumpy ride having to be taken to my new classroom in Mrs Robins hands but it didn't last long as we had reached the classroom in no time at all. <br>\r\n\"Ready\" asked Mrs Robins.<br>\r\n\"Yes\" I stated and she opened the door to reveal a room full of stuning beauties that looked amazing. As Mrs Robins entered the room, the didn't even notice me which was a relief since I was a little shocked to see so many girls in one room which were the size of skyscapers to me. Mrs Robins told everyone to quiet down and take their seats. Once all of the girls had settled down, Mrs Robins said \"We have a new student starting with us today,\" with that she placed me on the table in front of the class and said for me to give a introduction.<br>\r\n\"Hi my name is Tai Baret, I will be joining your class as of now and I look forward to getting to know you all\". With that he then gives a bow but when he finishes bowing all the girls are staring straight at him with surprise, I guess they were surprised to see a guy who was no taller then a doll say that he would be part of the class. However the girls surprise changed and everyone was getting really excited for some reason, saying how cute, is he really our new student, etc. While all the commotion was going on Mrs Robins told everyone to quieten down while see continues with the introductions. \"This is the new student Tai, under certain reasons he will be joining us for the next few years, he is new to this as he has been homeschooled for the last few years so I want everyone to be nice to him\", with that everyone in the class said yes mam.<br>\r\n\"Good\", claimed Mrs Robins, \"now to decide where you will be sitting Tai....\"   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ok Tai you can sit at my desk on the chair until a desk can be prepared for you,\" Mrs Robins kindly says. She picks you up and places you on her chair although having a bad vibe of this, you were happy to sit at her desk, besides her chair would be a lot more comfortable than one of the student chairs. <br>\r\n\"Now before we start class I want everyone to know that Tai is to be brought to each of the teachers desks at the end of the lesson and Tai has promised not to skip out on his lessons so I expect him to always be hear in case you girls think about doing anything and keeping him for yourself\". Some of the girls had disappointed faces when they heard this. I was relieved to hear Mrs Robins say this as it wouldn't be the first time that I was kidnapped by someone, in the orphanage, the other children were always kidnapping me and saying that I belonged to them. It still gives me nightmares.<br>\r\nWith that class started, it was math an easy subject for me as I find it interested to solve problems whether they are mathmatical ones or stuff to do which is outside the idea of learning. Thankfully enough being so close to the front of the class, I found it easy to read the board and make notes although being where I was and at my size, whenever Mrs Robins passed by me, seeing as her skirt was on the short side, I kept catching glimpses of her panties which happened to be visable through her black nylons. For half of the lesson, nothing had happened and it was a typical lesson one would expect that a problem started to form. As Mrs Robins has been pacing around the classroom in high heels, her feet were getting tired so she started to head to her seat to rest her feet for a while. However I guess she had forgotten about my location since she was now directly in front of the chair and about to sit down,<br>\r\nThe question is though will she remember that I am here or not, or does she know that I am here and just wants to torment me by sitting on me?</span></div></div>",

With that she opened her draw and pulled out a small desk which was custom made to my size which made me happy since the school had actually went to the hassel of making a custom desk just for me. She placed in the centre of her desk and I went to have a seat, it was perfect, the right size and everything. \"Is the desk ok?\" Mrs Robins asked, and I obviously replied yes.<br>\r\n\"Now before we start class I want everyone to know that Tai is to be brought to each of the teachers desks at the end of the lesson and Tai has promised not to skip out on his lessons so I expect him to always be hear in case you girls think about doing anything and keeping him for yourself\".

The advantages obviously being that I could easily see the board, I was not on the floor where I could get stepped on, and I had a great view of a amazing woman with a great body. However the disadvantages were at the front of the class, I got the feeling that most of the time, the students were paying more attention to me rather then Mrs Robins while see was teaching, which then lead to Mrs Robins becoming a bit annoyed that the girls were paying more attention to me rather then her. Would this create a situation?</span></div></div>",

Seeing as everyone had raised their hand Mrs Robins was the one to decide who Tai will be sitting with. Who does she pick?</span></div></div>",

She laid her hand on the desk indicating for me to climb and she placed my desk around the back of the class in a empty vancancy next to a window, although it didn't make much point since I wouldn't be able to see out of it in the first place but just being a part of the class and having my own desk felt great.<br>\r\n\"Now before we start class I want everyone to know that Tai is to be brought to each of the teachers desks at the end of the lesson and Tai has promised not to skip out on his lessons so I expect him to always be hear in case you girls think about doing anything and keeping him for yourself\".

I was relieved to hear Mrs Robins say this as it wouldn't be the first time that I was kidnapped by someone, in the orphanage, the other children were always kidnapping me and saying that I belonged to them. It still gives me nightmares.<br>\r\nWith that Mrs Robins started the lesson, it was math, a lesson that I found extremely easy, which is good since in my current location, I couldn't see a thing through the forest of girls legs and feet. So I figured that I would just do some self studying as it was pointless to try and take notes when I couldn't even see the front board. Mrs Robins didn't seem to mind that I was self studying by myself as she knew that my knowledge was at least 2 years past what she was teaching at the time. I didn't mind self studying since I was used to since it was similar to when I was homeschooled. However I found it quite hard to focus on my work as I kept on getting a vibe that someone was watching me, which happened to be true as everyone, throughout the class was every so often take a glimspe at me, I guess they were really interested in the new student but I kept on reading my own custom text books trying to pay no attention to the glaring eyes of the girls. <br>\r\nI was actually starting to focus entirely on my self study until the girl behind me slammed both of her feet either side of me. For what ever reason she had decided to take off her shoes to reveal that she was wearing long blue socks. I at first didn't pay any attention to her feet as I figured that she wanted to get a bit more comfy. However is she just putting her feet there to get comfy or does she have something planned?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This story is based around a boy named Tai, he has a extremely rare medical case from when he was born where he will only grow to the size of 5 inches at best he gets older. However at present Tai is only 16 and is at the moment 3 inches tall so he still has some growing to do.<br>\r\nTai is a new student to the Young Eve's high school for girls and he will find that many things will be happening that will in the end change his life. Tai is a orphan meaning that he that he will be living at the dorms at the school which would allow man different chances to appear for him. <br>\r\nThe idea behind this story is that it can be both a type of love story between a girl and Tai or a sexual style thing for those who are more interested in hearing about Tai being tortured by a giantess school girl in many ways. <br>\r\nAs I want this to expand as far as possible, I would like it if people will add to the story if they want. I am going to allow pretty much anything but try to keep the vore to a minimum since it would automatically mean that Tai would die with just a digestion which is kind of boring. I will also allow Tai to die as long as it is intersting to read. Plus feel free to add extra characters as you wish but make sure to give them a bit of a desciption when they appear so others know what the girl looks like.</td>",
