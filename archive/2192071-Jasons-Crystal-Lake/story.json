The sun tried to squeeze his eye open but he resisted. If he got up his mother would stop gently stroking his head. She was playing with the wisps of hair on the top of his head twisting them around her before combing them free again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is time to get up sweetie,\" her lips kissed the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face scrunched up as he pulled into her body more tightly trying to hold on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad people have come to Crystal Lake and people like the ones who parted us,\" he knew he had to get up, they could hurt his Mother again if he allowed them too but it hurt to leave. \"The sooner you get up the sooner you can be back with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe undead snapped his eye open to the cold darkness of the cave he had taken as his newest home. His Mother could be safe here, he lit a candle and saw her mummified head emerge from the darkness.  He placed the worn hockey mask over his hideous visage so the kids wouldn't laugh at him. He left without a weapon but he wasn't worried because his mother had always told him he was creative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered what he would be dealing with out there. </span></div></div>",

The bus rode through a tunnel of trees to the camp with dull gray buildings. A guard tower overlooked the entire camp with the requisite guard watching them with mirrored glasses staring down all of the new arrivals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA police officer escorted the newest arrivals of the vehicle and happily left them to giant threatening to burst out of the shirt after he signed the form for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have been seen here to be changed from the losers you are!\u201d the man bellowed. \u201cI am Ajax.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snicker escaped one of the new arrival\u2019s lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think my name is funny Matthew?\u201d his voice had turned quiet, little more than a whisper but still held all of the menaces of his looming floor. \u201cI assure you I can and will clean the floor so why don\u2019t you drop to the ground and give me ten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you break a twenty?\u201d a few of the others laughed at his joke but punch to his gut brought silence to the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like it when people challenge me, it allows me a chance to show I am in charge,\u201d Ajax lifted the young man by his hair. \u201cYou are all here because you are all pieces of shit. I expect you will fight me on this but you will fail because you are weak. You wouldn\u2019t be here if you weren\u2019t. Luckily for you, your families pay me very well to turn pieces of shit into something useful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hit us, that\u2019s a crime,\u201d Marie spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have made a terrible mistake,\u201d he yanked her head back his hot breath filled her lungs. \u201cMarie is no longer a part of civilization, you aren\u2019t even human anymore. See that beautiful lake over there. A boy drowned there years ago and his body was never found. There have been many bodies that were never found over the years and yours can easily join them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence reigned over the rest of them as the wicked smile formed on his face. He had them where he wanted them for the moment. It would change as they found the courage again but they would be crushed to dust.

He turned to the room and saw the usual set of losers these places brought in, the dick had been right about that. Most of the kids were drug addicts or petty criminals out to teach Mommy and Daddy a lesson for some attention. They weren\u2019t real criminals like him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis family was like an armor around him, he should be facing ten to twenty. Instead, he was at the summer camp from hell for the time being. He would make sure Ajax got his in the end but he would have to be careful. The man was a sadist who wouldn\u2019t control his temper so for the time being he would play good little boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo think it is true?\u201d Max, a scrawny shrimp who would probably be swinging from the rafters in a weak or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon?\u201d Matthew looked at him trying to determine if there was any value to getting to know this boy who was likely not strong enough for the real world much less the monster Ajax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat he was saying about the boy drowning in the lake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis place was a summer camp for years, I would be shocked if a dozen people haven\u2019t drowned over the years. People are always doing stupid things that result in death. The truth is he doesn\u2019t have the balls to kill a kid, pick on them or abuse them sure but not take their lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure, we have had some campers go missing,\u201d Nick chimed into the newcomers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop trying to scare the fresh meat,\u201d Matthew looked at the crew-cut kid and smirked. He had bought the shit the asshole was selling. He turned back to Max. \u201cListen, kid, people leave these places all the time some graduate, a few escapes, and several select the express checkout method.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am telling you Ajax killed kids.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do better than that. Tell them a true story about this place, like about Jason Voorhees. Now there is a real boogeyman.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention that shit! Ajax doesn\u2019t like to hear that name!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t. A pussy like him couldn\u2019t measure up to a real killer so instead, he tries to steal the thunder of someone else. Go back to your corner and pray your balls to descend before you hit forty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just wait you will get yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI intend to, don\u2019t worry when I get some pussy I will describe it to you because you know you are never going to see one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt good to be in control again but he was tired of playing in the minor leagues. He needed to get out of here. So he needed to . . . </span></div></div>",

She focused on the hate for her stepmother to burn away her sadness. The woman who had sent her here because she was afraid Maria would tell her father what a monster she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Sergeant Branson,\u201d a young man not much older than the girls announced himself. Several girls shriek as they rushed to cover themselves from his leering eyes. \u201cYou have ten minutes to be ready. A ten-mile hike in the woods to relieve you of your excess energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out of here!\u201d one of the ladies protested the man not leaving the room with a tossed comb. He laughed as he batted it from the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEight minutes until the twenty-mile hike!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCries of protest were met with a tapping of his watch as he exited the room. Marie rushed to obey the request. Throwing on the bright yellow jumpsuits they had been given. It had large numbers on it to further dehumanize them. Was she only 113 from now on?\u201d It wasn\u2019t even sized properly hanging loosely on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group gathered outside in a chaotic mass as the girls muttered murderous intentions against their guide who wore a nasty looking grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurely even ladies as stupid as you can manage a line,\u201d he lifted a prod from his belt and pressed a button igniting a hideous sound as the electricity arced ready for a victim. With a little pushing and shoving the twelve people formed a line. \u201cMuch better. I knew you could do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie started to relax as she told herself this was just a normal walk in the forest with just a little more cursing and swearing. The beauty of nature surrounded them and you could almost forget you were in a prison camp. A squirrel chittered at them before scurrying up a tree, concern started to fill her as the sun faded from the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t be heading back?\u201d Marie asked Branson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shook his head, \u201cWelcome to Hodder\u2019s Lodge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBranson waved towards a large building on the crest of a hill just ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are getting a real history lesson, today ladies,\u201d he unlocked the door. Dusty left a film on the place as they entered. \u201cBack in the 1800s old man, Hodder thought he had found the perfect place for a hunting lodge. Turns out he was wrong, lost all of his money and ended up killing his wife and kids. Ajax thought it would be nice to name his school after someone with a similar temperament to him. I don\u2019t suggest any of you screwing up this school he has going results might be similar. Have a good night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to the second floor and slammed a door shut not inviting any further discussion. The group was left with no food or water and the chill of the night was coming on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie wondered what she should do.</span></div></div>",

She hated the darkness but a shiver propelled her forward into the seemingly endless void. Better to face the danger out there than to slowly freeze to death. To say she was pleased when she heard several of the others follow her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright bitches, let us get this over with,\u201d a goth girl called Meg shoved her way out. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I could convince us to start a fire here and roast the balls off of the asshole inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the girls laugh but none made an attempt at piling wood around the place. Maria for her part could find no way to laugh at the demise of someone. Most of the girls were sticking close to the trail grabbing small branches but she knew they wouldn\u2019t last long. Gathering her courage she used it to shove forward to find some logs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of the others giggling and laughing as they worked seemed far away. As if they a television in the background. It was the forest that was all too real. In the distant, she caught a glimpse a tall shadowy figure. She leaned closer attempting to squint her eyes to better see it. Tree branch, it is just a tree branch she told herself as something grabbed hold of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shriek froze everyone. Most fled for the safety of the lodge but laughter came from Meg who was holding Maria\u2019s arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a regular scream queen!\u201d Meg helped her gather the logs. \u201cHurry up, my tits are about to shatter from the cold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded as she peered back to a shadowy spot in the woods but the figure was no longer there. She tried to tell herself it wasn\u2019t the right spot or it had just been a tree branch in the dark but a large part of her wouldn\u2019t believe it. It was a man out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should we do to entertain ourselves?\u201d Lucy asked as she poked at the small fire they had started. \u201cBecause I have some definite ideas . . .\u201d</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t dare risk yelling at them because they were getting close to the camp and they would have to watch for guards if they were to get there friend out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to be able to turn on the flashlights again,\u201d Lucas muttered as they came to the fence line of the main camp. His pulse increased as he saw all of the defenses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbwire lined the top of the fence and there was even guard towers in each of corners. Spotlights scanned the bushes and trees but the haphazard manner suggested it was more boredom than effort. For a heartbeat, he froze as the light halted over their little group but it moved on. He was certain it had seen them but no alarm was raised so there was still hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving quickly he raced up to the fence and used his bolt cutters to start cutting the fencing. It was behind one of the buildings near a bush so it wasn\u2019t likely to be spotted right away. A branch nearby snapped causing him to abandon his project as he rushed back to the cover of the bushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that!?!\u201d he hissed to the others. Duke held up a broken branch and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust testing to see how alert you were,\u201d he chuckled. Lucas struck him in the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it,\u201d Zack stepped in between them. \u201cThey totally saw us in the tower and they don\u2019t care. The asshole in charge likely stocks the towers with the kids. We can totally coast from here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, his head was replaced with a sledgehammer splattering the group with blood. There was no time for mourning or even a well-placed scream as the hand of the hockey-masked killer wrapped his hand around Zack\u2019s throat choking off any protest. Lucas rushed forward but was slapped aside as if he was a pesky fly dropping him in a lump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could barely make out his friend\u2019s struggle as the blur started to fade from his vision but soon things became clear. Jason was lifting Duke high above his head bringing him down with tremendous force against the trunk of a tree. No gymnast in the world could match the angle of that snapped spine. The killer dropped his forcibly folded friend with his insides spilling out on the ground where the flesh had split. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas scrambled to his feet as deadly intentions were turned to him by the masked figure. Jason cocked his head as if debating what method of death best fit his next target. A hard swallow was all the time he needed to decide to get out of here. His feet were moving before he realized where he was going. It dawned on him he was . . .</span></div></div>",

She was determined to prove her father had been right about the existence of the paranormal. Tina Shepard had stonewalled her, it was unfair considering she was responsible for the death of her father. Unfortunately, the lawsuit she had failed but Mary wouldn\u2019t let that stop her, she had come up with a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken years to accomplish what she had wanted but it was all finally in place. Dr. Crews had gathered some of the most promising psychics and paranormal researchers in the world. Father\u2019s Institute, as well as the life insurance, had given her this chance as well as her book profits. She had chosen Crystal Lake for all of the strange phenomenon that had happened over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina had been at her most powerful here, did this place have a ley line that could have supplied her with the energy she had needed to accomplish those amazing things. The psychic had quieted down about what had actually happened after the wild ravings of the first reports to the police but Dr. Crews was certain they held the most truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been most curious about the story of the killer returning from the grave. There were plenty of stories of ghosts out there but the stories she had compiled were far different. The spoke of a corporeal being who despite numerous claim of death kept returning. If it was possible for one person to return from the grave than it should be possible for another. The world would be hers if she could pull away from the secret, though most people wouldn\u2019t want to come back as a homicidal, rotting, corpse it was a place to start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are your thoughts on Jason Voorhees?\u201d She asked her head of security Dexter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA dead kid is an easy person to blame murders on when people are foolish enough to believe it,\u201d he was a man who needed to be doing something, he paced the room waiting for her to be released. If she didn\u2019t let him go soon he wore a hole through to the first floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo a bunch of different people went on murder sprees according to your \u201crational\u201d mind.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t need much reason to do evil things. I find it much more \u201crational\u201d than a man coming back from the dead to kill people. To my understanding, there have only been a couple of others to do that and they were in the bible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo precedence has been set.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really want to hang your hat on that? As I recall Jesus and Lazarus were one time performances and I don\u2019t recall them doing any killing sprees.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps after this weekend you will be a believer, I have brought in some of the greatest psychics . . .\u201d</span></div></div>",

A baggy dark sweater and sweat pants were just the first layer against touching any part of the world. Amazing things could be revealed to her with a simple touch. Lost pasts and forgotten memories were revealed but at a cost as they slammed into her mind. Far too often it was the dark and depressing things showing themselves to her affairs, abuses, and murder. How many times had she died? How many times could you die before you were no longer alive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why was she here in this place of death? Life costs money so she would use her curse to survive. It would be a long time before she would have to work again with the money she was given for a week's work. She could go back to her home where she never had to touch something another had felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you remove the mask?\u201d Dr. Crews requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInvoluntarily Addison\u2019s gloved hand reached up to touch the mask which was her latest armor against the world. A feather had struck her face sending her into convulsions as it revealed a serial killer. The man liked to mix pleasure with pain, her hands clasped over her ears as she heard the hideous laughter gave. She felt as he dragged a feather over her peeled away skin. Somehow she managed to stifle a scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is for my protection,\u201d Addison responded, her voice was barely a whisper as she struggled to stop herself from hyperventilating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will give you an additional thousand dollars,\u201d the doctor eyed her closely but she didn\u2019t know for what. Perhaps she enjoyed making others go against their desires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor how long and where?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust when you are in front of me and only when we are indoors so you don\u2019t have to worry about an experience like the Bird Man happening.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddison hated herself for selling herself like some whore on a street corner but it was money she could use to escape reality. She pulled off her mask causing her burgundy hair to tumble out. Even without the assistance of makeup, her face held the beauty of a fawn with eyes full of fear of the world around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like you to demonstrate your power for me,\u201d the doctor laid out several items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddison eyed the plastic covered packages as if they were poison, she was certain none of them would be harmless. One of them contained a scrap of blue fabric, it looked like it might be from a sweater.

Anyone who read about the case in any detail saw the pale blue clothing on the headless form of Pamela Voorhees. Addison swallowed hard as she brought the plastic bag close to her. If she could handle the worst of it, the madness of Jason\u2019s mother, she could handle the rest. Jason was likely a child-like mind that didn\u2019t understand that what he was doing was wrong. She suspected the hair was from a victim, she didn\u2019t want to feel the death of an innocent but she had felt them many times before so it would be nothing new. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eerily pale hand was revealed as she pulled it free of the glove. It shook as it approached the object knowing the consequences of what awaited it. The young psychic tried to focus on the money she would have soon but it was no good. Visions of death and mayhem whispered to her even before she touched it. Addison finally plunged past her block and touched it causing her body to convulse as the visions took control of her body from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy couldn\u2019t the Christy\u2019s understand how dangerous this place was? She wondered as she lit the kitchen on fire. More children would die if she didn\u2019t stop them. Pamela was safely in the woods by the time anyone noticed the fire. Flames would soon destroy all of that expensive equipment if they couldn\u2019t protect that how could they hope to defend something as precious as a child?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughter of the group could be heard as they prepared for dinner. They still hadn\u2019t gotten the message so it looked like she would have to send them another. The cook was out smoking and not watching the stew so she slid inside to add a special ingredient. There would a lineup at every bathroom and sink this night, she smiled as she poured the liquid in before casually leaving as if she had never been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddison struggled against the mind of the madwoman as the terrible visions kept trying to force there was in. She pushed them down and she could see the withered face of Pamela\u2019s corpse staring at her. It was unwilling to give up on life. Pamela was banging on the wall between life and death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy boy needs me!\u201d she begged as the light of reality started to burn her way into nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrool leaked from her mouth as she became aware of the world, especially the stare of Dr. Crews. Wiping her lips she scrambled to put her glove back on and return to the chair as if nothing had happened to her but she could feel the burn of embarrassment on her cheeks. She was a circus monkey who had just performed her trick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a bad performance but what did you see?\u201d Dr. Crews interrogated her. </span></div></div>",

This basic fact can be found everywhere online. How did you earn an amazing reputation if this is the best you can pull off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot alive as in walking around as we do. She is still here and aware, the psychotic woman won\u2019t move on without her boy. Pamela is looking for a way back into this world. With all of this psychic energy in the air, she might be able to find a way back in. We have to make sure to block her out from this place, cut off this event if we have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Crews examined the psychic as if she was a frog to be dissected. Piece by piece taking her apart until she found what she wanted, the truth. The young woman before her actually believed this. It would be interesting if it was true but no one had reported seeing the spirit of Pamela in all of the years since her death. No, wait, that wasn\u2019t true there was one woman who had said she saw Pamela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe believed her name was Ginny and she had reported seeing a corpse coming out of the water to attack her. It was chalked up to a hallucination induced by stress but it could be the sort of evidence she was looking for. If Pamela was trying to connect to the world of the living she would be a prime source to get evidence from. There really was only one way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think she would be more receptive to a medium, a spirit board, or some other method?\u201d Dr. Crews asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you insane!?!\u201d Addison screamed. \u201cAny of those would draw her out. The medium might even give her exactly what she wants. She is dangerous. The kills from her son have likely started to make her stronger. Pamela could harm or kill someone if she gets too powerful. Heaven only knows what will happen if they are reunited in this world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have taken precautions against both Jason and any otherworldly things.

This was a chance for her to prove to the world what her parents had known all along, she was special. Amulets and crystals covered her arms, legs, and her neck in noisy concert which announced her arrival from a long way off. Her crew of cohorts joined her outside of the vehicle slower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can feel them,\u201d Sienna bubbled. \u201cThe spirits are everywhere and they want to talk. We are going to do a lot of good here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as some of that good goes to the bank accounts,\u201d her brother Clive grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you always concern yourself with such earthly concerns? We are putting such good karma into the world the universe shall surely provide for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snorted, \u201cThe universe has certainly provided a lot for us, debt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough you two,\u201d Gretchen interceded. \u201cThis job is paying us enough we can cut out a lot of the red and she has even said we could do filming for our show.

If his luck hadn\u2019t run south on him he would be sipping on a warm brandy by the fire but the cards said it wasn\u2019t to be. He was certain the dealers had cheated him, they likely got paid a bounty for each person they drew every last cent. Still, he had to keep up appearances if he wanted to get back on his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were plenty of people willing to give him loans which he would have to pay back at large interest. Lawrence only needed enough money to get him through to next month when he had a couple of celebrities will to pay the premium for his services. So he had called up the \u201cgood\u201d doctor to accept her generous offer. It was dangerous because he knew the stories of Jason were real but he could keep ahead of the deadly simpleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out with his gift he found the location of Jason became clear to him. Jason watched from across the dark waters as a blond woman stripped naked in the moonlight. He moved into the cool water and started his approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBet you can\u2019t catch me!\u201d Emily called her boyfriend Brett as she dove into the water.

Brett winced with each hesitant step he took. He knew if he didn\u2019t go in the water she would make him pay for it in other ways. Just as he was about halfway in his girlfriend splashed him with the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it or I\u2019ll put you over my knee!\u201d Brett growled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPromises, promises!\u201d She dove under the water.</span></div></div>",

Once again it was likely he would have to depend on charm and parlor tricks to get him through. He had moved objects before. At least he thought he had but as time expanded between events he grew less certain. His family had a long line of famed psychics in history and he was the only one who had shown any signs of the \u201cgift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take him long to discover it wasn\u2019t one he could easily command and failure was not allowed. Tristen wondered how many of his ancestors were really charlatans like him. Thankfully in the days of the internet learning to be a fake was easy. There were many who would say it was essential to be a fake on the internet. The abuse had stopped and praise had started when he had mastered the tricks of the fraud trade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come with me,\u201d he hinted at his sister Fay as they got out of the car. \u201cI can use the bathroom all by my self even.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about you,\u201d Fay double-checked her makeup in the mirror. \u201cI have to think of the future of our family.

If they aren\u2019t bright enough to see you for a fraud they don\u2019t deserve to know.\u201d Years of abuse laced her words with hate. \u201cAt least you can still bring in money to the family. Go talk to the head and I will go talk to the others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister loosened a button to reveal a healthy amount of cleavage before stalking off to hunt prey.

They bounced around as the suspension tried to compensate but it could only do so much. The skeletons of the cabins could be seen in the distance like a graveyard of better times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we can do this in one trip, do you want the shovels or the body,\u201d the light of the trunk illuminated a blue tarp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShovel, why don\u2019t we just bury it behind the tree over there, why must we go into the middle of the woods,\u201d his partner whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear my daughter whines less when I tell she is grounded.

The woods were enclosing upon them, the light was fading from the world, and he was hearing something in the woods near them. He stopped and the footsteps he heard would cease as well.

Jason hand wrapped around the sizzling charcoal as he yanked it from the grip of the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!

Marcus scrambled to move despite the daze of his head hitting the ground but the palm of the dead man hit his chest. It was bad enough to have one Jason but now there were three or four of the monster depending on the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t, stop,\u201d it came as a whimpering sob as the deadly figure drew his arm back, he couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. He was being staked to the ground like some sort of fucking vampire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood spurted up from the deathblow as if Jason was drilling for blood. For a moment it seemed like there would be an endless supply of it but the organ pumping it quickly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp! Somebody help me!\u201d the cry for help from the girl was distant but he could hear it as if it was a dinner bell. But he knew there was someone else in the woods, the partner to the man he just killed. </span></div></div>",

He would tell him off later, yeah later. For the moment he dug the hole mumbling and cursing his partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, Angelo felt his blood pressure lower as Marcus\u2019s voice vanished into the woods. He needed to get the asshole in the woods more because there was nothing out here. At least nothing dangerous. Squirrels were noisy creatures running through branches or the underbrush even more than a deer. A coyote announced itself but it was hardly the stuff to produce nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crack drew his attention to the masked figure. Someone was playing games in the woods tonight wearing a hockey mask like the killer of legend. The man held the pieces of the branch he broke like a pair of spears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice costume buddy but your night is over,\u201d Angelo lifted his gun and pulled the trigger. The slug lodged into the mask but Jason remained upright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason flung the first spear in response striking the man in the gut. A second and third shot followed but they were wild as the man crumpled in pain. The remaining branch speared through the man\u2019s forearm pinning it to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you! You motherfucking son of a bitch! I am going to take this stick and shove it . . .\u201d His rant was cut off by foot being placed on his throat. Angelo felt the pressure growing as Jason pressed down slowly. He tried to shift the massive undead from his body but there was breaking free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he blacked out relief came as the pressure vanished. As he sputtered and coughed he the descending foot of Jason Voorhees. Instinctively he thrust his free hand in the way but it only joined his face in being smeared across the forest floor.  </span></div></div>",

He thanked the heavens for Jason and the dark work he did in the woods. Growing up he had seen the parade of vehicles taken to rot away in an impound yard and decided he could do better by them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHard work and being willing to take some risk was the name of the game for getting ahead in the world. Buddy made sure he studied vehicle identification numbers or VIN and how to remove them. At the start, he didn\u2019t even have a tow truck. The young man had to hotwire some of the cars because he certainly didn\u2019t want to go in the woods looking for bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready my darling daughter?\u201d His daughter hadn\u2019t been sure what she had wanted to do so he had brought her into the family business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do we have to get up so early?\u201d dark glasses hid the face of Kyra. A waft of booze was still lingering on her from a night of heavy drinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the time of least activity. Like you, Jason is not a morning person so this is the safest time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuddy wondered if the police knew what he was up to. They had to have noticed the number of vehicles they were finding had diminished. He suspected they had less crap to deal with and they didn\u2019t care how it happened. If they had no evidence of the missing people in their town they could just send the people down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what will you do if you see Jason?\u201d Kyra touched the shotgun he had mounted in the truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave, I have no interest in being a dead hero and I don\u2019t want you to be on either.\u201d Buddy turned down the first of many roads into the woods. Hunting cares was a bit like fishing. You had to drop a lot of hooks into the water if you wanted to catch anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be easy to forget how dangerous this was. Rays of golden light magically lit up the forest. Birds chirped and sang at a glorious new day. Why shouldn\u2019t they be happy, an undead killer wasn\u2019t stalking them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you paying me?\u201d Kyra demanded as she played on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love the mercenary spirit,\u201d Buddy smiled. \u201cYou truly are my child. Tell you what, I will let you decide. I can pay you by the day or give you 10% of what I make from sales.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat back and rocked as she thought. Buddy turned down another drive being careful to not talk. He didn\u2019t want to sway her. You learned things better if you learned the lesson on your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercentage,\u201d Kyra spoke with hesitation afraid of the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood choice, you are thinking of the future,\u201d he gave her a little hug. \u201cLooks like you might have hit the jackpot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brand new Cadillac came into view with no one in sight. He pulled up carefully for a hookup and got out of the car. Buddy took a quick look around but he didn\u2019t hear or see anything human and he certainly wasn\u2019t going to call out to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am going to hook up. You be ready to haul ass out of here,\u201d his daughter nodded.</span></div></div>",

As tough a front as she put up she knew the score if she met the legend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body as there was a bang on the hood as she had turned her head to see a single eyeball staring back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shriek caused Buddy to jerk his head up slamming into hard steel. His vision was blurred as he dragged himself from underneath the vehicle. Fresh blood started to well done in one eye forcing him to keep it shut. He knew it was his daughter would was screaming and he needed to do something to save her even if he had to face down with Jason himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his astonishment, there was a raven munching on the ocular juices of a human eyeball on the hood of his truck. Buddy started to laugh in relief as he wiped awe the blood and headed back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t fucking funny,\u201d Kyra screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know but I am just glad you are okay,\u201d Buddy gave her a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll hurry up so we can get out of here. I think we have had enough excitement for one day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman turned back to the raven who seemed to look satisfied with himself. Her glare made no difference to the animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out of here you filthy creature!\u201d she banged on the windshield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just cawed in response as if say \u201cNice Try.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry little buddy it is time for us to go,\u201d Buddy hopped into the vehicle. The raven seemed to understand the man\u2019s words and flew off into a tree to observe their departure. \u201cIf you ever have any problems whatsoever starting the vehicle you never take out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded as they rumbled away down the road. Kyra\u2019s heart only slowed when they finally hit the asphalt of a proper road. It was as if they were passing across a marker of Jason\u2019s territory. The dollar signs started to float into her head when they finally arrived back at the shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to go back to business as usual. He only checked the roads once a week. There was little reason to do otherwise. </span></div></div>",

Not after some delinquent teenagers and certainly not after the monster of these woods. His pace quickened as he gave the woods a wide berth just in case it was something larger than a squirrel. Another fifty feet and he would be inside the gate but that would mean he wouldn\u2019t be able to take another drink for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis flashlight caught nothing but fallen branches and leaves stirring on the ground from the wind. Hank leaned back to take a large swallow, bracing for the impact it would have. As his eyes came down the cold stare of Jason Voorhees waited patiently for him. The rusted machete slammed home causing the man to release a bloody mixture of blood and bile on his attacker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason paused only paused a moment at the forboding McLoughlin Medical Research building. Barbwire fencing surrounded it and floodlights burned away any shadows. The only windows in the place were tiny slats more in line for a medieval castle than a modern structure. Entry was gained through heavy metal doors giving an impregnable feel to it. He intended to put it to the test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. McLoughlin watched over the head of the security\u2019s shoulder to observe where the missing guard was. They eventually found the video feed of the man being dragged off into the woods or rather his corpse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to call the police,\u201d Luther, the head of security announced as he reached for the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you feel you must,\u201d the doctor was scribbling notes. \u201cI hardly think the death of a drunk is worth the hassle of talking to the police.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuther scanned the man\u2019s face to see if he was joking but as always the man\u2019s face was devoid of expression as if the whole world bored him. It was true the man was a drunk but he didn\u2019t deserve to die forgotten with no grave over his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeople will ask questions about him eventually,\u201d he tried to push his boss to agree. \u201cThey will have more questions if they find out we hid this from them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man paused before responding, \u201cYou should . . .\u201d</span></div></div>",

A deformed child who could nothing against the mob of bullies but things were different now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the darkness, projectiles fell like a destructive rain upon the facility. Cameras exploded with sparks as they ceased to function. Floodlights burst to shroud things in darkness until only one remained. Eyes tried to pierce the night as a dozen people went to the small windows. He waited until they were straining to the utmost before stepping out into the floodlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear swelled in his audience as they took in his appearance. Jason held a machete in his hand of rotted flesh. His overalls were stained with the blood of dozens of victims layering over each other in a mosaic of death. Even his mask bore scars of his dark work. Cuts scarred the mask and the markings of the bullet left a large break in the top of the mask. All markings of the many people who had come for him and failed. They had reason to be, his machete sliced the air to the final light allowing the darkness to swallow him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDread swelled in the workers but dark joy-filled Jason as he entered his element. The gate was locked but it was barely a delay for him with superhuman strength. Metal complained loudly as it rattled and shook as burst open announcing the approach of the killer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stalked forward he debated where to head first. Jason could enter the building and start ending the intruders right away. The second idea was to go to the parking lot because when people were frightened they tried to leave and he didn\u2019t want anyone to escape. The third option was to go for the power which would eliminate the lights inside the building causing fear and panic which he loved. </span></div></div>",

Videos could be doctored. \u201cYou know my reputation, I suggest you send out some of your people to check out my story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the murder? Will this mean police troubles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was a drunk, no one will miss him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can spare a few men to see if there is anything to your claim. Be warned that I do not take being jerked around lightly. Have evidence there is something of value for them to examine when they get there and I am not talking about this B-grade slasher film you have made. I want them to have physical proof of a dead man walking in the woods. If you can have the test subject captured so we don\u2019t have to hunt him down, I could see my way to paying you a bonus.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the doctor got to respond further the line went dead and he didn\u2019t think it was because of a bad connection. It left him a lot to ponder about how he was supposed to prove Jason was stalking the woods around Crystal Lake. Footprints would be easy and he could show them the body of the security guard to prove the man was dead. The doctor suspected the colonel\u2019s men would require more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you and your men to capture Jason,\u201d Dr. Samuel McLoughlin turned to Luther who held a doubtful look to the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do? Strap down a couple of horny teenagers to a pit trap!?!\u201d Luther responded. \u201cIf you want to sell him to the military, you catch him. If you pay me and my men a bonus we might go get you some evidence but capturing a monster is not in our job description.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA killer with a machete is stalking the woods. That leaves this place insecure, security guard.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure boss, I will assemble my crack team to get him. Who do you want me to take with me? The lothario who spends half his time on the phone with his harem and the other half trying to screw one of them. Perhaps the young lady who spends her time reading books instead of watching the monitors. Not one of my people is some trained military, police department, or secretly trained assassin.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis drew a growl from his boss who didn\u2019t like being mock but the man did have a point. These were not the sort to put there lives on the line for him. He had a gold mine in front of him but he didn\u2019t have a good way to extract it. For the moment he might have to settle. </span></div></div>",

He had to have this person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strength was beyond human and the scars and markings on the body indicated it resist damage that would be lethal to any man on earth. As the head of the biological department, he realized this was worth several fortunes to the right buyer but he was more interested in the good it would do the country and mankind. This could save the lives of soldiers and eventually unlock the secrets of eternal life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared there was intelligence as the man had laid in wait to ambush the man though he would have to be careful to make sure psychosis was not a side effect of the transformation.

Dr. Holmes decided he should set up tests to check the intelligence of the subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCapture would be ideal but for the moment he could test the intelligence and skill of his target.

Each of these options offers serious threats to the masked killer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere familiar, Camp Sunnydays, a summer camp built over the graveyard of many attempts to bring joy and happiness in this place of darkness and misery. Rebecca Morris is the owner and on the face of things, she is a sweet and bubbly person. Secretly she is in charge of a cult that seeks to pervert the dark energies of this place for her own purposes. The kids are a mix of underprivileged children and orphans who will not be missed but Jason just might but a machete through her plans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old world threat, a vampire has taken control of the community of Forest Green. Even the mastery over Crystal Lake is not beneath his notice but there is already one who claims to be master of those shores, Jason. With an array of monsters and people at his, the vampire is no easy pushover and he will tolerate no rival to his power. Will his centuries of knowledge and unearthly power put him into the ground or perhaps chain him to eternal servitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal Lake has been turned into a wildlife reserve. Milton Hamilton, a famous billionaire has bought the property and stocked it with exotic and dangerous prey from around the world. He has even held hunts of serial killers before but the awakening of Jason provides a new challenge. People from around the world are brought in, each paying a hefty fee for the chance to take Jason\u2019s head as a trophy. Who is a predator and who is prey can quickly change and Jason demands blood if you want to play a game of death with him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntire graveyards have been filled by the legendary killer and this leaves many mourning families in his wake. They are aware of how difficult he is to kill and an organization has been formed to stop his rampage permanently. Some of them bring the latest in science and technology to bear against him. Others seek paths through more mystical and spiritual means viewing him as a supernatural being perhaps removing his attachments to this world or a ritual could stop him. Another group will utilize more mundane methods to end the slaying by trying to trap him forever. All of them and more will have there chance to take a shot at Jason but the notorious slayer of men will not be sitting idly by. When there is killing to be done Jason gets down to business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there is always the option of something else. An open door to put your own marker on the legend of Jason\u2019s Crystal Lake. Will it be a zombie apocalypse or a mutant plague he faces when he leaves his home? Perhaps it will be something entirely different from your own imagination and crafting. What dangers will the killer of so many fights face? </span></div></div>",

Couldn\u2019t have the little lambs know they were being fattened for the slaughter. Not-to-be-Named-One demanded a lot in exchange for his boons but they were ready to pay the price. They weren\u2019t the first group to perform the ritual and they wouldn\u2019t be the last one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her work, Trina headed to the small shower. Tossing her bloody clothes in the bin, Amanda was really good at getting out blood but this might even be too much. Thirteen markers had been laid, good enough for the first circle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water was warmed by the sun but certainly not enough. Trina shivered as she wiped away the stickiness. A bang at the door announced the arrival of an intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that you Brad?\u201d thank God it wasn\u2019t one of the kids. Trina could see whoever it was through the crack at the top of the doorway. They were wearing some sort of mask but if they thought she was going to be frightened like some schoolgirl they had another thing coming. \u201cReady or not here I come!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrina but on the flimsy robe and jerked the door open and held her knife to Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice costume Brad but unless you want your dick mounted on my wall I suggest you back off. Brad!?!\u201d she had been certain at first but the hole in the middle of the man told her it might not be Brad. Trina could see the forest behind the hulk in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith practiced skill, she plunged the knife into the heart of Jason. There was no groan of pain or seepage of blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack off, I have a connection to The Lurker at the Threshold! I shall have you punished foul thing.\u201d Trina demands sounded almost like a plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took the knife from his body as the woman backed into the wall. Her eyes darted around for escape from the place or another defense but there was none to be had. Trina grabbed the forearm of the dead man as it plunged into her chest. The effect was far more detrimental on her than it had been on Jason. Her body slumped leaving Jason alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe marched into the woods and spotted the defacement of one of his trees. The symbol filled him with rage. Jason wrapped over the bloodstained marking and tore it from the tree. His heel ground away any recognizability in the wood. He didn\u2019t understand what was happening, it was different from trespassers in his woods, it felt like they were trying to take the woods from him and make them their own. </span></div></div>",

When he was alive he had been a baker, hardly the stuff of blue-blooded status but the title might remind people to tread lightly around him. At 5\u2019 7\u201d he was hardly imposing despite being able to tear a bodybuilder apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun had just faded over the horizon as he stepped outside. This was his favorite time, he could almost feel the sun-kissed warmth upon the land. He had loved to step outside to watch the sunrise as his bread baked in the oven fill the air with their enticing aromas. These days he had to take pleasure from different things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mansion was no Gothic castle but it had central heating and air conditioning. What he needed as he extended his power was a daytime guardian. The local boogeyman Jason Voorhees would do nicely. Baxter turned on his night vision and saw the world light up as his eyes glowed red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, someone might see,\u201d Simon pleaded. The man was good with money but he was a sniveling whiner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no one around if there were I would see them,\u201d Baxter dismissed the warning. The glow of life could easily be discerned. From the mouse crawling across the forest floor to the watchful owl high in the branches, all of them were visible to him. The only human life was far from here and was nestled in for the night, none of them liked to live this close to dreaded Crystal Lake and he had given them a reason to fear the night. \u201cI am going to take a look for this dead man who walks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was painful shifting to the form of a bat. You were compressing down on yourself forcing your bones and flesh to contort in ways your body was much better. The change into the wolf was much easier but the mist was the best. When you became mist you were letting go it felt like a drug high but you had to be careful with it. Time could easily pass too quickly as you lost hold on the concept of it and you would be caught out in the sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment the bat was what he needed for a large survey of the land. He fluttered into the night looking for Jason. His life sight had failed to find Jason but he suspected it was because the man was a walking corpse as cold as the air around him. A swearing man was walking close to the edge of the woods. Not far behind him was a something moving in the woods as silent as the air on a day without a breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaxter envied Jason and his skill in the woods. A creature of the night he might be but not one of the wilderness. Jason moved as if he was a ghost, his long strides avoided every fallen branch and not a leaf rustled to announced his presence. Only as he drew close to the man did the killer make noise. He loudly snapped a thick branch. Was it to create fear in his target? Or was it a child\u2019s game to give his opponent a chance to escape? The vampire couldn\u2019t be certain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human froze in place, \u201cIf there is someone out there I am not in the fucking moody for people playing Jason! My tire went flat and it matches the spare and I am in no mood for games! But I still have the tire iron to show you a good time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with his threat the man continued on his journey. </span></div></div>",

I will be generous and let you pick the first direction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the one, of us Jason who targets? They won\u2019t have any chance at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch is the way the wind blows. One moment you are on a tropical island sipping the fines alcohol Mr. Hamilton\u2019s money can buy and the next you are being hunted by Jason fucking Voorhees.

He instantly started scrambling away into the relative safety of the woods. \u201cGood choice.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawson whistle as he jogged into the woods suspicious of the paths nearby.

A part of him didn\u2019t believe this was real. It could just be a sick joke by Milton Hamilton as payback before he was sent to the police. He wouldn\u2019t be killed for a little hacking. It wasn\u2019t like he had actually killed anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jaguar watched the human as he drew closer. It tensed as it readied to pounce on the unaware target. It had learned to hate humans from many years of abuse in a circus. This kill would not be for food but for something it wanted more. The nearly two hundred pound animal landed with grace upon the back of the man digging claws in deeply to hold on for the ride to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cry of pain escaped the man as wet incisors of death closed around the back of the neck to end the life. It leaped back as someone stepped from the woods. The jungle cat roared, lips curled to show the dangerous teeth within but no reaction came for the masked figure. He smell strange to the animal he did not have blood flowing through his veins yet he still moved. As it examined the strange being closer it sensed something unnatural and dangerous about him and gave a hiss in protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank God!

He wasn\u2019t certain which would be worth the mauling of the cat or the psycho in the hockey mask. Louis turned to bolt in an attempt to choose neither but the hatchet of Jason was faster. It nearly cleaved the man\u2019s neck from his body and left a wedge for his life to run out from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were still others in the woods. Things had been altered in ways he didn\u2019t like. He threw the hatchet destroying a nearby camera but these things could be corrected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned back to the jungle cat trying to decide what to do next. It had calmed down after the death of the man sensing a kindred spirit who had no love for man. The jaguar warily watched him ready to pouch or flee. </span></div></div>",
