You are the lab's chief scientist and you have been working on a complex and slightly bizarre project. You were trying to build a device that could do a near instantaneous psychological and physical examination of a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other people in the Lab include: Jake Corton, a 29 year old scientist who is working on an alternate energy source; Rachel Bonn, a 22 year old university student working at the lab on an 18 month internship; Carl Crank, the 40 year old lab manager who had been a close friend of your Father; Janet Pearl, 31 years old and the lab's accountant and financial advisor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a quiet February morning today and you were enjoying your drive to work. Turning into a snow bound parking lot you turn off your car. You then get out of your car and survey the other cars in the lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Vandenburg?\" you mutter to yourself, refferring to the bitchy investor Janet had managed to hook late last year, \"Why must you come in to ruin such a wonderful morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pass by Mrs. Vandenburg's Porshe you spot Hillary, Jake's younger sister, locking her bike to the rack adjacent to the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No school today?\" you ask the cheery teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not today Tim!\" replies Hillary, she comes by to hang out and help her older brother with his research from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk into the building you feel a blast of warm air hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Janet!\" you say as you pass by her office and into the laboratory component of the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim! We need to talk about last quarter's finances!\" shouts out Janet as the door to the laboratory closes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Dr. Thorn,\" says Rachel, holding a clipboard up to her bosom, \"I have the data from the circuit checking I did yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, don't call me Dr. Thorn,\" you say, taking the clipboard from Hillary, \"I don't have a PhD! Call me Tim or, if you must use a title, use Mr. Thorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Mr. Thorn,\" replies Rachel, moving over to her station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim! Later could you help me read over the data from last week's test run?\" asks Jake from across the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Jake!\" you reply, waving in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Morning people!\" comes the booming voice of Carl Crank, \"Ready to push the edge of what is known?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always Mr. Crank!\" replies Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit down at your desk you read over the report Rachel had handed you. From what it said, there was a flaw in one of the connections on the power distribution node. You start to work at fixing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lunch time you think you've made real progress. As everyone in the laboratory heads out for lunch you see that Mrs.Vandenburg is shouting at Janet about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch you go into the lab, only to come face to face with an angry Mrs Vandenburg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Thorn!\" hisses the annoying lady, \"I do hope you are nearing completion of your little project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Research takes time Ma'am,\" you reply, trying to push past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I demand that you provide a demonstration of what it can do at this time!\" insists Mrs. Vandenburg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not ready for that level of testing Ma'am,\" you reply cooly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you rather I withdrew my funding for your little black hole facility?\" she retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Tim!\" pleads Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" you say reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Vandenburg finally steps aside allowing you access to the device you had been working on. You and Rachel set to work connecting up its various components and placing it in its case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou connect its power supply and engage the switch. You then feel a small jolt travel up your arm shortly before the device catches fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" you blurt out, putting down the device so that Jake can hit it with a fire extinguisher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" says Mrs Vandenburg, turning and leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run out after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That only happened because you forced us to do a full blown test run before we were ready!\" you shout at your investor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it didn't work,\" replied Alexandra cooly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a week and a half!\" you demand, \"We have a duplicate model that we should be able to get functioning by then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" replies Mrs. Vandenburg, \"But if it doesn't work then, then I am withdrawing my funding for your little black hole enterprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Vandenburg then storm out the front entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim?\" you hear Janet say weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell did you ever bring her into this?\" you demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We needed the money Tim! She had it!\" was the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find us another damned investor!\" you order before returning to the laboratory to help clean up after the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Tim,\" was Janet's whispered response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">17 days later</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was feeling rather happy about how things had gone over the past week and a half. He and Rachel had managed to get the replacement device not only up to working condition but also to fit into a smaller and more portable case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake had brought along both his sister and his daughter for the demonstration and Mrs. Vandenburg was there as well, urgently waiting to leave as she had an important business meeting to be going to in half an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see this demonstration of yours,\" demanded Mrs Vandenburg, her hand resting on her hip, clearly not expecting much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the device down on a table. It is made up of a small box like object, a little screen and controls as well as a pair of antennae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The device needs a controller and a test subject who will be scanned,\" you announce, \"For the purposes of this demo I'll be the controller. Any one who wants to be our first subject, please stand on the other side of the device from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone moves into position and you activate the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What power does the device have?</b></span></div></div>",

Managing to stay upright despite the high heels you are now wearing, you look at the faded reflection of your new body in the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first part of your new body that you examine is your head. Your new hair is black and is done up in a tight French Twist. Your face is rounder than your old one. Alexandra's nose is slightly upturned and is lined to either side by Navy Blue eyes. Above the eyes are carfully plucked eyebrows. Your new lips have on them some dark magenta lipstick. You run a feminine hand along your new Jawline, from Alexandra's pointed chin up to her pierced ear. From what you see and feel, you notice the distinct lack of any obvious imperfections in your smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving your attention downwards you see that you are now dressed in a Black suit jacket with matching, knee length skirt. Beneath the suit jacket you can make out a deep green, almost black itself, silk, strapless tank top. Your new feet are at the end of long, straight legs and are wearing a pair of black stilettos. Examining your thin yet strong hands you notice Mrs. Vandenburg's wedding band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are starting to find the reflection in the glass a bit strange, not only because you aren't used to having the reflection of your strong willed investor but also that you aren't used to see her slouching like you now are. Straightening your posture you try and hold your new body as you'd seen Mrs. Vandenburg do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this!?\" you hear your old voice exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and stiffly walk towards a very frightened and confused looking Tim Thorn. You are stopped by Janet part way to your target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a good time Mrs. Vandenburg,\" whispered Janet, her hand against your new shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou re-adjust your posture and focus your gaze on your old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done?\" whimpered Mrs. Vandenburg from behind your old eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea how this happened Mrs. Vandenburg but from what I can tell, we've exchanged bodies,\" your reply in the most officious air you can, your new voice greatly helping in that effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet withdraws her arm and tips her head, her normally calm face twisted in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim?\" asks Janet, worry showing through the confusion in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Janet, its me,\" you reply, smiling at Janet with one of your lopsided, toothy grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sue you over this!\" snapped your old body, her hand pushing down at what you assume is Alexandra's new, erect penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know when she calms down!\" you tell Janet before glaring at your old body and stepping through the doors and into the lobby of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the lobby you decide to...</span></div></div>",

That's a bridge too far. You need time to adjust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling her assistant, you explain that you aren't feeling well and want more time to review the lab's finances. \"Please reschedule us two days from now,\" you say, marveling at how authoritative your borrowed voice sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you climb into her Cadillac, trying not to notice either Mrs. Vanderburg's dark glaring at you or Rachel's deeply bemused face. You've never been in such a nice car before and it should've been a more enjoyable drive, but you have a hard time handling the gas and brakes in these stilettos. \"How do women do this?\" You ask aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you're at Mrs. Vanderburg's apartment building, and a valet takes you keys from you at the pull-in. \"Same spot as usual, m'am?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly,\" you respond, and then belatedly realize you are meant to tip him. Without seeing the denomination, you pull out the first bill you can find in your purse and hand it to him. Apparently, it's more than the right amount, because his face lights up and he says, \"Thank you, m'am!\" before pulling the car into this building's parking garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He called me m'am,\" you think. \"Another thing to get used to, but... I kind of like the sound of it.\" You've never been treated all that respectfully before. It's a nice change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandra's apartment is the penthouse suite at the top of the building, and you get a little nervous as the elevator number keeps climbing. Floor 25, 30, 35... But when the door slides open at the 42nd floor and you unlock the apartment door, you're taken aback by what you see. This space is incredible! The open living room stretches for most of the floor, with a fancy kitchen at one end and tastefully decorated sofas and bookshelves on another. But more impressive is the view. Two walls are floor-to-ceiling glass, and you can see a huge part of the city from here. It's <i>amazing</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip off your heels, which your feet are most thankful for, and walk gingerly around the apartment, exploring every detail. From the crystal wine classes to the smooth kitchen counters to the designer armchair sitting just below a Picasso painting, this entire place reeks of wealth. And for the moment it is yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's still early in the day, but you're feeling a little overwhelmed and have the sudden urge for a drink. You pick a bottle from the wine rack - \"Malbec, aged 25 years. Must be good, right?\" - and pour a generous amount into one of those crystal glasses. Then you situate yourself onto the sofa and have a drink to the view. One glass turns to a second, and before long you've had half the bottle and are feeling a strange mixture of bewilderment, nervousness, and outright giddiness. You are Alexandra Vanderburg. How on earth did this happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay across the couch, taken in awe by the thought. Her business clothes fold awkwardly around you. \"Perhaps I should get out of these before I ruin them,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's a wedding gown!  Then this must be her husband.  Oh Crap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man puts his coat away and walks toward you.  he gets closer and closer and....  Too close!  His arms surround you and he plants his lips on yours!  You want to shove him away but somehow your traitorous new body refuses.  You realize the kiss is... not bad?  Your new boobs feel very nice as they are smashed against his hard firm chest.  His hands lower to your wide rear end and he gives you a gentle squeeze.  You were strangely beginning to enjoy it when he lets go.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heads to the kitchen and makes you both a superb dinner.  You get the smaller steak but it is more than enough to fill you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to put the dishes in the sink only to feel his big strong arms wrap around you from behind, untill both hands begin to grope your new melons. That made you weak in the knees!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifts you up in the air as if you barely weighed anything and heads into another room.  A room with a... king sized bed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were feeling strange feelings of attraction towards him but he and you were both male.  Only looking down at your new body you realized you were now all woman!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your boots crunch in the February morning snow as you follow Janet back into the laboratory. Rachel takes a bit longer to cool off, grumbling under her breath as she returns inside a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about... what happened back there, Miss Pearl,\" You apologise awkwardly, feeling the need to explain yourself about hugging Rachel. \"I felt I just needed a shoulder to cry on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the one who should be sorry, Tim. You were right, we never should have solicited Vandenburg for funding.\" Janet replies. \"But I think I can buy us some time. She can't withdraw her money immediately. I've read the venture capital agreement, and I'm certain I can delay the process for a week. Maybe two weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might give us enough time to fix the machine,\" You finish her proposal.  \"Gosh, I sure hope you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do whatever I can.\" She nods determinedly, pushing her glasses up the bridge of her nose. \"In fact, I've received interest from a few other investors about a potential buyout to help keep the lab afloat. No commitments yet, but I'm certain we might have a backup in case that bitch does pull the plug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how wonderful!!\" Your mood brightens considerably, clapping your hands together even though you bristle at Janet's vulgar language. \"But you mustn't call her bad names like that, Miss Pearl. After all, she just wants to protect her investment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet gives you a strange look as you leave her office and head for the testing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it,\" Carl rubs his chin, reading over the latest inspection of the device. Handing the report to you, he paces the room like he usually does when he's trying to solve a puzzle. \"No malfunctions, no burnt circuits, no frayed wires... no indication that anything went wrong with the experiment. By all accounts, that device should have worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel any different, Dr. Crank...\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? What about Rachel? Have you noticed anything different about her?\" Carl asked frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seemed pretty upset about Miss Vandenburg threatening to pull our funding.\" You suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too right! She can't hold our funding hostage just because of a few snags in development. Can't squeeze blood from a stone with that woman.\" Carl grumbles. \"Look Tim, I want you and Rachel to finish assembling a second prototype using these schematics. I'll work on diagnosing whatever problem might have caused this and see about fixing the original.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" You smile, going over to Rachel's work station and telling her the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Rachel spend the next few hours taking apart the device and running tests individually on each component. Rachel looks impatient, observing while you carefully run a laser over the central motherboard. You gently tell her to be patient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, noon arrives and you and Rachel open your packed lunches in the break room. Due to the lab's shoestring budget, the room has only a small refrigerator, water cooler, and plastic table where you and Rachel sit. You press your legs together in the chair in a very ladylike fashion, while Rachel slouches in her seat with her legs spread far apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Miss Bonn?\" You pipe up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Tim?\" She barks, looking down at her kale salad sullenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might sound like a strange question,\" You say cautiously, \"But do you mind if we trade lunches for today please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to ask the same thing,\" Agrees Rachel, passing you her salad in exchange for your leftover steak. \"After what's happened today I could go for something meaty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace, \"Eugh, please take it.\" Rachel heats your dish in the microwave before tearing into it ravenously, even though she had told you on several occasions that she was a vegetarian. Digging in to her salad, you continue, \"So, you're going back to class this afternoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel finishes her bite and replies, \"Yeah... some bloody seminar where we sit in a circle and talk about Russian literature. It satisfies the humanities credit I need for my degree. I used to think it was interesting, but I guess the novelty wore off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind flits to your (rather limited) knowledge of literature. The way authors can paint a landscape, create rich and complicated characters, and make you feel things you never could before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it sounds nice to me.\" You sigh, tilting your head. \"Not that I've read very much, mind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not as important as preserving this lab.\" Rachel leaned back, folding her arms. \"If I could get out of class, I would. But the professor likes to give pop quizzes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tosses her rubbish away and hangs up her lab coat. Underneath she's wearing a short-sleeved pink blouse cut off at the midriff with her bellybutton piercing showing. That's in addition to her black miniskirt, tan stockings, and ballet flats. What a cute outfit, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing you staring at her, Rachel blushes. Trying to pull her skirt down a bit, she mutters, \"I don't know why I dressed myself like this today. Damien and I are going out later tonight to celebrate six months of being together. But I could have changed after class...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it looks nice on you.\" You smile. \"And congratulations on six months! Damien must be a pretty lucky guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel frowns, \"Y-yeah, I guess so. Hey... never mind. See ya later, Tim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun tonight! And see you tomorrow, Miss Bonn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scoffs. \"What have I said before? Don't call me Miss Bonn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh as she gathers her purse and leaves. She's worked as an intern at your laboratory now for 18 months, and every time she brightens up the room. You're relieved to see she's finally dishing out some of the banter and asserting herself more. Visibly appearing more confident and headstrong even in the face of a setback like what happened this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose story do we follow next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
