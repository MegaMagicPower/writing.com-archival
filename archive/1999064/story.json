            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hanging the calendar back on her wall, Azu stood back and stared for a moment, deep in thought how to start the brand new month in the best way possible.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... September...\" she sighed thoughtfully. \"I wonder what could happen this month, and how I could improve on last month.\"<br>\r\nShe looked over at the pile of empty fizzy drink bottles in the corner of her room, remembering her decision at the beginning of August to consume less fizzy drinks.<br>\r\n\"Huh, maybe my willpower isn't up to much after all,\" she pondered. \"I guess I could just play it by ear this month and see what happens,\" she mused defeatedly, sitting back down in her computer chair and basking in the glow of the screen for a few moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gazed at the image on her screen: a busty, powerful, attractive young woman from a comic book, used as her desktop background. Azu had always wanted to be more influential to other people and to receive more attention, but her average looks and somewhat shy personality hadn't gotten her very far throughout school, and even after finishing school. She had admired guys and girls from her school before, wishing she could become closer to them and even fantasizing about some, but to this day and to her dismay, she remained an inexperienced virgin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an intrusive beep brought her thinking to an end. The screen of her mobile phone lit up at the other side of the room, indicating a text message. Wearily, she rose from her seat to check it, assuming it was probably her mother noticing her bedroom light still on and telling her to go to bed already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations!\", the title of the spam-esque text read. \"You are the lucky member of the FreakyFetish forum site who has been chosen to test out our new beta app. BodyMod! Please use the app as you wish, usage data will automatically be sent to us for review on how to improve the app. However, please note that the app currently only works on women. Click here to download it and for more details!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu was ready to hit delete before even finishing the first sentence, however she noticed it mentioned her subscription to her favourite forum site, making it seem more legitimate. Out of pure curiosity and boredom, she tapped the link provided with her thumb, and a notification came up on screen: \"Now downloading 'BodyMod: Beta'\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what this could possibly be about,\" she muttered under her breath, watching the progress bar reach 100%. \"Probably some flash game where you can live out your fetishes, like I've played a million times before.\" She tapped the icon for the app, bringing up a rather plain, mostly text-based screen.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to BodyMod!\", it read, in large bold lettering. \"We've already finished building your physical and mental profile, so all you need to do is select one of the presets below and you'll be on your way to becoming what you've always dreamed of! Please note, the transformations may take several days.\" Even more confused than before, Azu, swiped the screen down, revealing the options mentioned above.\"Is this thing supposed to actually change me in real life?\" she pondered. \"That's rich. Oh well, let's just have a look before I delete this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option 1: The Predator! <br>\r\nHave you ever wanted to be more persuasive... physically? Ever wanted to teach that jerk a lesson the hard way? Do you hate your small, skinny, weak physique? Worry no more, because with this option, you'll be able to forcefully be anyone's object of affection, or even anyone's source of pure terror and pain depending on how you decide to use your newfound power...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option 2: The Weapon of Mass Consumption!<br>\r\nEver had a day where you just wanted to sit around and snack on things? Ever actually done that? It's fun, right? What if you could do that, but anything you could fit in your mouth is a delicious snack, and anything bigger is a meal? Not only this, but your appetite would never run out, and you could decide how much weight you put on, if any? If this sounds like fun, this option is for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option 3: The Goddess of Beauty!<br>\r\nDo you look at swimsuit models and envy their curvy bodies? Do you look at makeup models and wish your face was as pretty as theirs? Wish no more, because with this option, you can choose your desired body type and figure, and make yourself as attractive as you like with literally no limit! Ever wanted to watch people kill each other just to be able to have a glimpse of you? Now you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option 4; The Mastermind!<br>\r\nIt's not all about appearance, right? Imagine if you were so sharp, you could solve any problem before it even existed, or convince anyone to do anything you wish? Ever wanted to manipulate space and time with merely your mind? Within this option lies infinite potential, and unprecedented power...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stared at the screen with wide eyes for a few moments, wondering what the hell just happened.<br>\r\n\"...The fuck was that?\" she mumbled to herself, noticing the screen on the phone had changed from before.<br>\r\n\"You've chosen Choice 1: The Predator!\", it read in bold lettering. \"Depending on your body type, you may or may not notice changes right away. Make sure you check back regularly to see any new updates, and to see your progress so far. Have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That's it?\" Azu said aloud, turning her phone off and putting it on her desk. \"I was kinda hoping for even just a stupid game to pass the time, but oh well.\" <br>\r\nShe sat down on the side of her bed, noticing a strange feeling of fullness within every part of her body. Unable to put her finger on it, she focused on the feeling for a while, trying to figure out what was going on. It wasn't like the feeling of fullness one experiences after eating too much, but instead a rather pleasing sensation of comfort and... satisfaction. It was especially strong in her arms, legs and chest, but was noticeable everywhere else too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at this new, unexplained feeling, Azu laid down on her bed, not even bothering to change clothes or pull the cover over herself. <br>\r\n\"I wonder if this is related to that app\", she thought to herself. \"If I feel this great in the morning, I'm gonna check it again for sure!\"<br>\r\nAzu couldn't shake the feeling that it was all in her mind, however, and that this feeling was a result of wishful thinking, hoping the app would actually work. With a mixture of happy, cynical and slightly excited thoughts swirling in her head, she closed her eyes and let the relaxation take over, falling into a deep sleep in almost no time at all...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the first time in as long as she could remember, Azu woke to the sound of her alarm the next morning feeling completely conscious. Wide-eyed almost instantly, she suddenly remembered the events of last night. The pleasant feeling she fell asleep to was still just as present. To put it simply: Azu felt alive.<br>\r\nUsually, Azu would prefer to lie in bed for a short while before getting up, but this morning she had no such desire.<br>\r\n\"Maybe this app really is the real deal...?\" she pondered, as if her train of thought from last night was unbroken. Somewhat excitedly, she pulled her phone out from under her pillow, where she left it overnight to charge and to wake her up in the mornings. She instantly noticed a new notification from the app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New update! Tap here to continue your progress\", the notification read.<br>\r\nAzu had \"tapped here\" before she'd even finished reading the text on the screen. The app quickly sprung to life, as if it was as excited as she was. <br>\r\n\"Congratulations, you've already made progress since downloading BodyMod!\", the new start screen read. \"If you haven't taken a look in the mirror yet today, we invite you to do so now.\"<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, Azu spun on her heel to look into the full-length mirror mounted on the wall behind her, threw her shirt across the room, and pulled down her trousers.<br>\r\nHer jaw nearly dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone was the almost lanky form of Azu's body, looking slim but at the same time weak, fragile and unhealthy. Her ribcage was no longer even slightly visible. In place of these features that had haunted Azu for years were things much more pleasing to her eye.<br>\r\nHer stomach now looked firm and slightly toned, with <i>just a hint</i> of a crease in her skin, slightly showing her never-seen-before abs. Her torso had more shape, her waist appearing slightly narrower and her hips slightly wider. Moving down, her once stick-like legs now had noticeably thicker thighs with hints at the muscle beneath the skin, but still with an overall slim appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Azu was most stunned by, however was her arms. Before, her skinny arms looked frail, as if she could barely lift a couple of kilos, but now they looked strong. Certainly not bodybuilder-level strong, or even athlete-level strong, but there was definitely more bulge around her upper arms, and upon flexing them, Azu noticed them bulge ever so slightly more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, Azu could not help but stand in front of the mirror, staring dumbly at herself with an open mouth. She looked stronger, she looked healthier, she looked bigger. She looked sexier, and she loved it.<br>\r\nWith millions of possibilities flying through her head, Azu quickly went back into the app, and pressed \"Continue\" underneath the text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is only the beginning of what BodyMod can do for you\", the text read. \"In fact, there are already more customisation options for you to choose from. To continue, please scroll down and make your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too cool...\" Azu said aloud, her voice and hands shaking with excitement. Scrolling down as instructed, she realised she had a huge grin plastered on her face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option 1: Hidden Power!<br>\r\nThis option will allow you to continue to gain strength, with very little or no change to your current appearance. Surprise everyone by making them watch that skinny girl they know lift a car above her head with one arm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Female Power!<br>\r\nThis option allows you to continue to gain muscle mass and strength as you just have, while retaining a desirable, curvy, feminine appearance. You'll be the perfect combination of beautiful and powerful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Limitless Power!<br>\r\nThis option removes any limits or restrictions, and allows you to gain as much muscle as you like. You'll eventually appear large, chunky, intimidating, and bulging with muscle, and your physical strength will be unlimited in potential for improvement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease note: changes may take some time to take effect.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, to her disappointment, there was no sudden sensation like last time, instead only a new screen that popped up.<br>\r\n\"Your progress\", the screen was titled. Scrolling down, Azu noticed some more information below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Your basic stats before and after BodyMod</b></u><br>\r\n<b>Before</b><br>\r\nHeight: 5'6<br>\r\nWeight: 98 lbs<br>\r\nYou can lift: 50 lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>After</b><br>\r\nHeight: 5'6<br>\r\nWeight: 120 lbs<br>\r\nYou can lift: 100 lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>If you would ever like to see how well you're doing, check this page again! Also keep an eye out for fine-tuning customisation options.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to crush the phone in her palm with excitement, Azu silently closed the app. She'd always dreamed about being strong, powerful, and intimidating, and it was starting to look as though this app could fulfil her dream. Every night, she'd check the Freaky Fetish Forum site to see if anyone had posted any new content depicting massive, muscular women displaying acts of strength and power. But who needs those images and stories when you can just look in the mirror?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I've already gained that much weight? I can't believe this is actually working...\" Azu mumbled aloud, her voice still shaking. Picking up her shirt and trousers from the floor, she got dressed again, noticing they were slightly tighter fitting than usual. <br>\r\nA quick poke of her head around her door indicated that nobody else was currently home, so Azu walked straight into the bathroom, stripped down again, and stood on the scales, just to be sure.<br>\r\n\"121 lbs?\" she pondered, not knowing whether to be confused or delighted. \"Either these scales are a little off, or I've already 'progressed' some more.\"<br>\r\nWhipping her phone out of her pocket once again, a quick check confirmed her suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Height: 5'6<br>\r\nWeight: 121 lbs<br>\r\nYou can lift: 104 lbs</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the proof Azu needed. She could apparently lift more than twice the weight she could this time yesterday evening, and the number was ever-so-slowly increasing. Thoughts quickly began to fill her head about how she could be the she-hulk she'd always dreamed of in almost no time at all. The mere thought of such a thing was getting her excited.<br>\r\nUnsure what exactly to do with herself now she had this newfound excitement building up, Azu...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing that came to Azu's mind was her best friend since kindergarten: Anita. She already had plans to meet up with Anita today, which she'd totally forgotten until now thanks to the sudden appearance of the app in her life. Now that she already had a noticeably fuller figure, Azu was positively brimming with excitement to see if Anita would notice or be envious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I might finally be able to have a body as nice as Anita's!\" Azu said to herself excitedly. Still standing on the bathroom scales, she flexed both arms in a classic bodybuilder's pose while looking in the mirror, noticing the sleeves of her t-shirt tightening ever so slightly around her arms as she did so. Unfortunately the growth was not fast enough for Azu to notice while she took a few moments to stare into the mirror, but that made it all the more exciting to her to check up on the app every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping off the scales, Azu unlocked her phone and dialed Anita's number, trying to control her breathing so she wouldn't sound too excited to her friend. Just a few moments passed before Anita picked up, as if she was awaiting the call.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Azu! What's up?\", the cheery voice on the other end of the phone chirped.<br>\r\n\"Hi, Neet!\" Azu replied, trying to sound calm and casual by using her friend's affectionate nickname. \"Just checking if you're still cool with meeting at the mall in about an hour? I've gotta shower first, but I'm down if you are.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, silly! I'd never keep you waiting!\" Anita laughed. \"I'll be waiting by the main entrance, probably with a coffee. See you in a while, honey!\" <br>\r\nAzu quickly said goodbye before hanging up and tossing the phone to one side. She had decided that a quick shower was in order, just in case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">one rushed shower later...</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished blow-drying her hair, Azu looked in the mirror one last time before putting her t-shirt back on. She couldn't notice any difference visually since she woke up, but the feeling of satisfaction from before was still very much there. She couldn't help but smile and hum to herself as she pulled the shirt over her head and the trousers up her legs. \"Was I always this positive and happy?\" she thought to herself as she hurried downstairs to put her shoes on. \"Maybe all I needed to do was tone up a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Azu, the bus station was situated just across the street from her, so she didn't have to wait for long before one showed up. <br>\r\nAzu looked at her phone with a mixture of excitement and nervousness. The time was 10:55am, and she had agreed to meet Anita at 11. \"Only a few more minutes until the bus arrives at the mall,\" she thought to herself, trying to control her shaking. She looked around at the other people on the bus. No one seemed to be looking at her. <br>\r\n\"Phew, I guess I don't look too suspicious,\" she concluded silently. \"But I think I'll check the app one last time before I arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands trembling with anticipation, Azu unlocked her phone and opened the app. There were no new notifications from it as there were before, but something may have changed anyway, she thought. <br>\r\nOnce the app had loaded, she tapped the \"Stats\" button to confirm her suspicions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Height: 5'7<br>\r\nWeight: 123 lbs<br>\r\nYou can lift: 112 lbs</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu closed the app straight away to avoid any nosey bus-goers catching a glimpse. A shiver of excitement flowed through her body, and she had to fight the urge to laugh.<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it,\" she thought to herself. \"I've changed even more just since I left the house!\"<br>\r\nShe pocketed her phone just in time for the bus to pull up outside the mall's main entrance. She looked out the window to see Anita waiting there as promised, holding an iced coffee and looking down at her phone patiently.<br>\r\nAzu stood up from her seat a few moments before the bus stopped completely, still noticing her normally loose fitting clothes being on the tighter side now. \"Hopefully I won't have to buy new clothes by the end of today,\" she pondered.<br>\r\nAzu reached for the handrail on the steps of the bus, noting how much more excited she was than usual to meet up with Anita. As she stepped off, she waved to get the attention of her friend and called her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neet!\" she shouted cheerfully. \"How's the coffee?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment she heard the voice of her friend, Anita looked up from her phone. Her eyes suddenly widened to the size of dinner plates when she saw Azu strolling casually towards her.<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, Azu!?\" she yelped excitedly. Oblivious to the fact she'd just dropped her almost empty coffee, she bounded over to Azu, stopping inches away from her and staring into her eyes with awe. \"You look so different!\" she continued at the same loud volume, causing Azu to flinch a little.<br>\r\n\"Good to see you too, Neet!\" Azu replied sarcastically. \"I'm glad you've missed me over the last few days.\"<br>\r\nAnita blinked in disbelief several times, still staring as if she hadn't heard what her friend had just said. \"Have you been working out?\"<br>\r\n\"No, nothing like that,\" Azu replied dismissively, trying desperately to keep her cool. <i>\"Holy shit, is this tiny difference really so noticeable!?\"</i> she thought to herself. <br>\r\n\"I've been on a bit of a diet lately, but nothing too extreme,\" she continued.<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it...\" Anita gasped, almost in a daze, her behaviour over the top as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu stepped back from her friend for a moment. Amidst all the ruckus they were causing, a few people were looking suspiciously in their direction. <br>\r\n<i>\"Shit, don't want to be the center of attention too much\"</i>, she decided in her head. This wasn't the only thing bugging her, however. She wasn't sure if it was the excitement of meeting her friend or the changes slowly taking place, but her shirt was starting to feel on the uncomfortable side of tight. Looking down, the t-shirt was especially tight around her chest and her upper arms. Thankfully, being a t-shirt, her lower arms were allowed room to breathe for now. Azu couldn't help but admire how much meatier her arms looked than yesterday, even if it was't the most dramatic change in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Azu wasn't the only one admiring this, as moments later Anita reached out to tentatively touch her upper arm. <br>\r\n\"Wow...\" she sighed, with a sparkle in her eyes. \"Are you sure you haven't been working out, Azu?\" she probed.<br>\r\n\"Haha, nope, not any more than usual!\" Azu replied with a nervous chuckle. \"I guess eating a little better makes a big difference!\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm.....\" Anita stepped back for a moment, clearly not entirely convinced. \"Well, it could be that.\" she concluded, sounding almost resigned. \"But whatever it is, you need new clothes! Your jeans are super tight fitting now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer interest piqued, Azu looked down at her legs to confirm Anita's comments. She was right; her legs now appeared slightly longer than she remembered, and thicker too. <br>\r\n<i>\"In fact...\"</i><br>\r\nAzu took a few thoughtful steps forward, noticing an unusual sensation she hadn't felt before. <i>Her thighs rubbing together.</i><br>\r\n<i>Oh my god, Anita is right! They're touching now!</i> she squeed internally. Had the growth process suddenly sped up a little? Or had more time passed than it seemed? Azu was dying to take a look at her phone to check her stats, but she didn't want Anita to see the app... at least not just yet. She loved the feeling of power that was slowly increasing by the hour, and wasn't ready to share it with anyone else yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I guess you're right,\" Azu replied, trying her best to sound shocked. \"Well, any excuse for clothes shopping is a good one, right?\"<br>\r\n\"You know me too well!\" Anita squealed, clapping her hands excitedly. \"Let's go!\"</span></div></div>",

Her mind immediately went to the app, thinking it could be a notification or some similar thing. She could feel the excitement rising in her chest.<br>\r\n\"Azu, are you alright?\" Anita asked, in a quieter tone of voice. Azu noticed she was staring at her intently with a tilted head.<br>\r\n<i>Crap, I must have look suspicious,</i> Azu thought to herself. <br>\r\n\"U-um, yeah, I'm fine!\" she forced out, with an awkward chuckle. \"I just need to, uh, use the bathroom first.\" She could feel beads of sweat forming on her forehead as she tried to act naturally towards her friend.<br>\r\nAnita stared into Azu's eyes for a few moments, unblinking and with the intensity of freezing cold daggers. She'd always had a habit of doing this, and it was as endearing to Azu as it was slightly unnerving.<br>\r\n\"Alright, no prob. I'll wait here!\" Anita suddenly chirped, reverting back to her usual grin and standing up straight.<br>\r\nAzu breathed a silent sigh of relief, nodding to her friend in quick acknowledgement as she turned to make her way to the bathrooms, hurrying to give the impression of urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming the cubicle door behind her and locking it frantically, Azu whipped her phone out from her back pocket. Her heart was racing in anticipation as she leaned against the cubicle wall and unlocked the phone. Sure enough, the vibration was from the app creating a notification.<br>\r\nHer finger trembling and her breathing heavy, Azu tapped the notification without even bothering to read it. The app loaded up fairly quickly, and the information Azu was dying to see came up on screen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Height: 5'8<br>\r\nWeight: 131 lbs<br>\r\nYou can lift: 145 lbs</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Azu stuttered under her breath. She held out her arms, noticing the fabric of the t-shirt starting to stretch a little over her upper arms. Her lower arms were also starting to look less like noodles and noticeably meatier. Azu wasn't sure, but she could almost swear her hands even looked a little less dainty than the day before.<br>\r\n<i>This is happening faster than I thought,</i> Azu thought to herself, her head spinning a little. <i>What if someone notices?</i><br>\r\nBut at the same time, Azu couldn't help but love the feeling of power growing in her with every passing minute.<br>\r\nLooking down at her phone again, Azu noticed the stats had already increased a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Height: 5'8<br>\r\nWeight: 132 lbs<br>\r\nYou can lift: 146 lbs</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond this, there was a new area below the stats that Azu hadn't noticed in her daze. She quickly scrolled down to see what it was.<br>\r\n\"Feeling impatient?\" The new text probed. \"We've just added a new feature that you might like. If you're not happy with your current rate of improvement, you can give yourself a little boost by hitting the button below! You can do this as many times and as often as you like, but we recommend using it sparingly to avoid drawing attention. Moreover, this feature is still in beta, and we have not fully tested the results of excessive use yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aforementioned button was a fairly plain white rectangle with the word \"Boost!\" in the center. Azu stared at the button with tunnel-vision, mulling it over in her head.<br>\r\n<i>I'd love to be bigger...</i> she pondered, <i>however I don't want to arouse any more suspicion from Anita or anyone else that I may have already done.</i><br>\r\nHer finger hovered hesitantly above the screen, as she tried to decide what course of action to take...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her head spinning from excitement and anticipation, Azu decided to let her desires take over for once. <i>Think now, act later,</i> she thought to herself. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and planted her finger on the screen at the point it had just been hovering over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely a moment passed before Azu began to notice the difference. The instant her finger made contact with the screen, she felt a chill starting at her fingertip and spreading through her whole body like a shiver, similar to when she first activated the app. This time, however, a dull ache enveloped her entire body too, making it slightly less pleasant than before. This feeling was amplified by the sensation of Azu's clothes beginning to tighten more and more against her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, I don't know if I like this feeling,</i> Azu pondered, her eyes still tightly squeezed shut. However, to her relief, the sensation ended as abruptly as it had started a short time later.<br>\r\nAs excited as she was nervous and apprehensive, Azu slowly opened her eyes and straightened her back. Right away, she noticed the coat hook on the back of the cubicle door was somewhat lower than before. Her heart paused in her chest for a moment.<br>\r\nAzu held out her arms quickly as through trying to grab someone invisible before her. There was a small rip in the end of the sleeve on her right arm, and through the straining fabric she could see sharp definition and mass she had never seen before. <br>\r\nBreathless, Azu turned her gaze to her torso, immediately noticing her shirt hugging her meatier midriff much more tightly than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...\" Azu exhaled deeply, trying to calm herself down a little. \"Maybe I should get a closer look.\"<br>\r\nAzu calmly unlocked the cubicle door and stepped outside, noticing no one else in the bathroom. Her eyes widened instantly at the sight in the mirror immediately opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu's shirt had come up at the hem, exposing a little of her midriff. She could clearly see creases that weren't there before, hinting at the beginnings of an impressive six-pack below the fabric. <br>\r\nLower down, Azu noticed the bottoms of her jeans had similarly come some way up her leg, around halfway up her shin. Her calves and especially her thighs looked chunkier, harder, and well defined than ever before. The denim of her jeans looked as though it was stretched to almost its limit around her new, wider hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hot flush of disbelief and excitement spread through Azu's entire body. She leaned against the cubicle door behind her for support as she reached into her back pocket to pull out her phone. <i>I have to see the app, just so I know I'm not dreaming,</i> she decided silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe app opened near instantly as if it was as excited as Azu to see the results. On the screen for Azu's instant gratification was the information she wanted to see:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Height: 6'0<br>\r\nWeight: 180 lbs<br>\r\nYou can lift: 220 lbs</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu felt as if the world had stopped around her as she read the results. At the mere push of a button, she was now among the tallest and strongest women she knew. This kind of control and power was unprecedented in Azu's life.<br>\r\nSwallowing hard and scrolling down, Azu noticed some additional options below the results in a new menu. These included \"Change rate of growth\", \"Customize growth\", the \"Boost!\" button from before, and various other things. Whoever was behind this app was certainly dedicated to it, Azu thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... what do I do now!?\" Azu grumbled to herself, still alone in the bathroom. Reality had suddenly hit her. There's no way Anita wouldn't notice the difference if Azu went back to her now. She faced several choices in her head: Go back to Anita and own up, sneak out of the bathrooms and avoid her, or hide in here for the time being?</span></div></div>",

Azu quickly realized that with the clothing stores on the opposite side of the mall that she would never be able to get a new set of clothes much less a new wardrobe before she broke free from her old clothes and was naked. So that ruled against trying to sneak out of the mall. It also meant that she could not spend the day with Anita anymore. So the only logical conclusion was to stay in the bathroom stall for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu then decided if she was not going anywhere for awhile that she should look at the new options from the bodymod app. First she texted Anita \"Sorry girl feeling sick and throwing up. Catch you later.\" Seconds later she got the reply of \"Oh so sorry feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu laughed at this. \"Oh I do feel better Anita.\" Just as Azu went to put her phone away her clothes finally lost the battle to cover her body and Azu looked at the bodymod app again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight- 6 foot 7<br>\r\nWeight- 245 LBS<br>\r\nYou can lift- 325 LBS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu looked at the screen again in wonder. Azu had never imagined this was possible. Now though rather then enjoying her body she was locked in bathroom stall. Azu sighed and looked back at the bodymod app and saw some of the other features the customize growth, boost option she had already used, and the change rate of growth. Azu quickly realized the change rate of growth had to be done if she had any prayer of getting home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu picked that option and saw she could stop getting taller and putting on weight but could continue to get stronger. Those options were in the center of each bar. With that Azu moved the height and weight bars to the far left and the strength bar to the right. Azu then hit apply. After a minute she looked at the bodymod app again and gasped:<br>\r\nHeight: 6 foot 8<br>\r\nWeight: 250 LBS<br>\r\nYou can lift 750 LBS no 780, no 800.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu muttered to herself \"How strong can I get?\" With that she looked at some new options to play with<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only option that caught Azu's attention was 'Option 2', another failing last month resolution it seemed tempting to allow herself to indulge in the foods and drinks that she would attempt to avoid. With a sarcastic laugh, Azu pushes 'Option 2' causing the app to load. Above the loading bar, the words 'Azu Body Syncing' faded in and out, giving Azu an uneasy feeling. When the app finished loading a detailed polygon mesh of human female appeared with Azu's name and weight(119 pounds) above it and button labeled 'Fat Settings' at the bottom of the screen. She on presses on settings, a menu pops up over the polygon mesh with multiple items. Among the menu items, there was a setting that controlled how much weight you would gain, Azu presses it and immediately sets it to zero pounds. As Azu looks through the app more and more she begins to fascinate with it, but soon she felt foolish getting interested in the strange app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u201cIf only this thing really worked for real,\u201d mumbled Azu in a low voice while rolling her eyes.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitant, Azu wanted to test the app but didn\u2019t want to seem superstitious, she felt a weird vibe from her phone. After little thought, Azu got over her hesitation and pondered how to test it. Her thoughts were interrupted when she heard her mother\u2019s footstep coming down the hall. Azu\u2019s mother had recently started snacking at midnight then complain about how fat she was getting the next day, which annoyed Azu. Azu huffed, hearing her mother in the kitchen looking for food then back to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u201cAnd tomorrow we\u2019ll hear all about how fat she is, when she isn\u2019t really fat at all, it\u2019s like she wants to be fat,\u201d Azu thought.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu got an awful idea. At the bottom of the menu, there was an item that allows new profiles to be added. Azu decides to add her mother and test the app on her. Azu enters her mother\u2019s name and a loading bar appears with the word \u2018Sandy Body Syncing\u2019 fading in and out. When the loading was complete a polygon mesh of a chubby woman with Azu\u2019s mother name and weight(163) appeared. Azu goes to the menu for her mother\u2019s body and presses the weight gain control item.

As Azu gets into her routine sleep position she wonders what would happen if the app did work. The idea kept racing through Azu\u2019s mind till she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Azu\u2019s Parent\u2019s Bedroom: Sunday, 7:00 am<br>\r\nAzu\u2019s father, Dai and her mother Sandy were sound asleep in bed until their alarm clock went off, disturbing their slumber. Sandy was the first to wake and the first to notice what has happened to her body. Sandy sits up and lets out a loud gasp, waking Dai.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n\u201cWhat the matter,?\u201d ask Dai fully awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m huge!\u201d answered Sandy slightly panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah! I thought it would take more time for you to plump up like this,\u201d said Dai comforting his wife with belly rubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew when we got into feederism I would gain weight, but this is ridiculous,\u201d said Sandy pushing on her fatten thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you have been eating more lately, maybe it\u2019s finally caught up to ya,\u201d said Dai trying to defuse the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but you\u2019re right about one thing I look good fat,\u201d said Sandy calming down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood enough to eat,\u201d said Dai leaning in for a kiss.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat started out as simply \u2018good morning kiss\u2019 soon turned into passion. Dai explored Sandy new body, feeling every soft part of her body. Sandy enjoyed the feel of her husband sinking deep into her doughy body. The two were interlocked and inseparable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo months ago Dai and Sandy wanted to spice up their marriage by indulging in a new kink. Dai introduced feederism to Sandy, a fetish she was unfamiliar with but quickly gain interest in. Sandy love the idea of stuffing herself silly, eating whatever she wanted and after gaining 10 pounds last month she became hooked. With every pound, Sandy would feel more and more exquisite. But the couple did face a complication, despite Sandy\u2019s age(44) she still had a fast metabolism making it somewhat difficult to gain weight. Sandy had tried numerous methods to gain from calories heavy shakes, to snacking between meals and most recently midnight feasts. So waking up fatter was a treat for both Dai and Sandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Azu\u2019s Room: Sunday, 9:30 am<br>\r\nBy this time Azu had completed her morning routine and was fully clothed. As Azu walks out of her room she grabs her phone and places it in her pocket, forgetting about the app. Azu heads to the kitchen and makes herself a sandwich, as she prepares her meal her mother calls to her from the next room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u201cAzu is that you,\u201d asked Sandy yelling from the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Mom,\u201d answered Azu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s about time you got up, can\u2019t sleep your life away,\u201d said Sandy in a playful tune.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu rolls her eyes at her mother\u2019s comment and doesn\u2019t reply. While Azu was eating her sandwich she could hear heavy breathing. As the sound of the heavy breathing came closer Azu began to hear loud footsteps. Before Azu could investigate the noises the source, Sandy, of the sounds comes through the doorway. Sandy stands in the doorway wearing nothing but a bra and panties under a blue translucent nightgown. Eyes widen in shock, Azu stares at her mother who was almost 100 pounds heavier than yesterday. Azu looks her mother up and down noticing how tight her outfit was, her mother\u2019s underwear sunk deep in her fat rolls while the nightgown that once loosely hung past her mother\u2019s knees were now being sketched by her fatten hips and bulging belly. Sandy notices Azu\u2019s expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u201cI know, I know I\u2019m a bit underdressed but this was the only thing that would fit me; your father is getting me new clothes as we speak,\u201d said Sandy looking down at her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHAT\u2019S Not the problem! You got FAT!\u201d yelled Azu in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!

Azu realized what has happened and pulls out her phone. She immediately goes to the app, looking at her mother\u2019s profile. She was shocked to find that her mother had <b>gained 90 pounds</b> since last night. 10:00 am, now it was <b>100 pounds</b>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu became confess, wondering what to do next.

She's a 19 year old with fairly average looks and intelligence, and while she has a small circle of friends, she likes to spend a lot of time alone indulging in her favourite video games, comic books, and anime series. One ordinary day, Azu receives an email inviting her to be the first beta tester of a brand new mobile app called BodyMod, based on random selection of users on a fetish forum she visits. This app allows her to set modifications for her own body or mind, and do the same to other people. However, as the app is in beta, it is currently only functional on women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's the basic outline of the story, so...<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">Guidelines and Rules</font></b><br>\r\n-This is not a giantess story. I have other giantess interactives if that's what you're interested in. I just want to try something new.<br>\r\n-That said, a small amount of growth is permitted, but to accompany other body changes, and also let's keep it mini-GTS level, so around 15 - 20 feet tall at the very most.<br>\r\n-Muscle growth and body part growth is permitted.<br>\r\n-Weight gain is permitted.<br>\r\n-Vore is permitted, but since there are no giantesses or shrinking, it's more like cannibalism. If you'd like to describe it in graphic detail, go ahead.<br>\r\n-Sex is permitted, but not with minors. You can write about minors if you wish, but keep them out of situations where they're making sexual contact with others for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n-Futanari is permitted. If you don't know what this is, just Google it.<br>\r\n-Peeing is allowed (not my favourite, but I'll allow it) however scat is not, at least for now.<br>\r\n-Mind control is permitted.<br>\r\n-Feature absorption is permitted (for example, Azu being able to suck out other peoples muscle or intelligence, etc)<br>\r\n-The BodyMod app can only affect females.<br>\r\n-You may not kill Azu, but you can add and kill off other characters as you please, as long as you're following the rules.<br>\r\n-Basically, this story is about Azu enhancing her body/mind in any way she sees fit, and the bodies/minds of others too, using the BodyMod app. <br>\r\n-Please keep a female dominance theme throughout the story. <br>\r\n-I personally prefer slow growth/change, so I'm going to be writing mostly this. You can write fast growth/change if you want, but if possible please also add the option for a slow growth alternative.<br>\r\n-Any chapter not within these guidelines will be either edited or deleted, so please bear them in mind so that you don't end up wasting your time with a chapter I'll end up deleting anyway.<br>\r\n-Other than that, feel free to add and message me with any questions or suggestions about the story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">Characters</font></b><br>\r\n<b>Azu Queens</b>: See above for main description. She's 19 years old, 5'6 in height, on the skinny side, with brown eyes and light brown hair. Usually seen in a t-shirt and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Miki Queens</b>: Azu's younger sister. 10 years old, she's annoying and bratty to Azu, but sweet and innocent towards her kind-hearted parents so that she gets what she wants. She has light blonde hair that is usually tied in pigtails, usually wears a dress, and is 4'8 in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sandy Queens</b>: Azu's mother. She is 44 years old, 5'7 in height, and a little chubby. She's very kind and usually buys Azu and Miki what they want so that they're happy, but as a result is somewhat of a pushover, especially when it comes to Miki. She's out of the house a lot, busy working as an IT systems manager in a large company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dai Queens</b>: Azu's father. He's 43 years old and 5'11 in height, with a fairly normal build and appearance. He wears glasses and has brown hair, and while he is kindly and caring like his wife, he is also the voice of reason in the family and is not afraid to discipline Miki from time to time when she goes overboard. He invented a new type of computer database in his 30s, earning him a large amount of money, so he is currently retired and spends his time at home or partaking in hobbies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Anita Myers</b>: 19 years old and 5'7 tall, she's Azu's best friend and they hang out a lot to play video games and go to conventions. She is very bubbly and acts spontaneously, and also dresses unusually in mismatching colours or garments. She's very pretty, however, with feminine features, long black hair and a nice body, causing Azu to secretly fantasize about her sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Luke Waterman</b>: 19 years old and 5'3 tall. He is good friends with Azu and Anita, but has a very youthful appearance for his age and is somewhat feminine in appearance, with long-ish dark brown hair. He spends a lot of time crossdressing as a hobby, resulting in Azu and Anita fawning over him because of his ability to look good in female clothing despite being male. He attends conventions with them like this sometimes, not always entirely of his own will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dimitri Aleksandrov</b>: 20 years old, and 6'1 in height. He used to live in Russia, but moved at age 14. Handsome and masculine in appearance, both Azu and Anita are very interested in him. He looks a lot more intimidating than he actually is, and spends his spare time reading books and being unwittingly followed by Azu and Anita. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all of the main characters, but feel free to add more as you see fit. I may also add more to this list from time to time. Have fun with the story!</td>",
