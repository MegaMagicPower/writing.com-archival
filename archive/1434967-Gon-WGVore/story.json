Gon didn't think he'd be able to get out of his situation any time soon or he'd just be attack by the shark again, but he liked the situation he was in right now.  He saw the a school of octopi nearby and figured his previous meal that was still wiggling within him was probably one that strayed away.  He figured the best thing he could now was reunite the group in his stomach.  He directed the shark to the closest one and catches it in the shark's mouth and just like before he gulped it down.<br>\r\nAfter that the octipi had begun swimming away out of fear of being eaten, but this proved futile.  Gon just saw this as more practice for him as he snagged one after another in his stomach.  After a dozen or so Gon didn't see anymore, save for the large one that was probably calm that it wasn't a target of the shark.  Gon's stomach had grown quite large.  It caused the shark's mouth to open wider as it was starting to have trouble restraining Gon.  Gon looked up at the giant octopus.  It looked tastey, but he already felt a little stuffed.  He wasn't sure if he'd be able to eat it even if he was starving.  Gon could always save him for later and go after something else or he could tangle with the octopus now if he wanted to.</span></div></div>",

He moves in front of the wild boar and starts pushing him into the Wolf's maw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolf opens his mouth to accommodate the wild boar's huge gut.  As Gon pushes the wild boar, his belly starts to vanish in the Wolf's maw.  The Wolf gets half of the wild boar's belly in his mouth.  The rest of the wild boar's belly finally enters the Wolf's maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon stops helping the Wolf as the Wolf gets to the wild boar's front legs.  He tries to lift his head a few times to swallow the rest of the wild boar.  On the fourth try he manages to lift his head up toward the sky, and with that gravity starts pulling the wild boar down to the Wolf's massive stomach.  The wild boar's head slides into the Wolf's ravenous maw, and then his legs follow after.  A few more massive gulps and the Wolf's belly has swelled out to appalling proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally with that done Gon's eyes rake over the Wolf particularly his huge furry gut with the wild boar in it.  Gon notices that the wild boar is struggling for dear life as he sees the Wolf's sagging belly sway.  He then hears his stomach start to growl.  He grinned as the huge-bellied Wolf realized that he had no chance of escape.  Gon licked his lips as he approached the Wolf and his delicious, huge paunch...</span></div></div>",
