She wasn't rich, but she certainly didn't need to fill any orders anytime soon after that recent one she just filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, she was fetching supplies for a dress she's making for herself. Her old dresses lost their appeal to her, so she decided to make a new one, as she was bored of her older ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, however, Rarity fell over, bumping right into a pony. She recovered, catching sight of the pony. It was quite a pudgy unicorn, levitating fries with her. Rarity's supplies fell all over the place. She levitated them back up, but felt disgusted by the pony's size. \"Oh, so sorry,\" said the unicorn. \"Please forgive me for that.\" Rarity decided to lay it down gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm fine dear, but...\" Rarity stopped herself, trying to think of how to word her sentence. \"But what,\" asked the pudgy pony before Rarity. \"But you seem a little... Unhealthy,\" said Rarity. The pudgy pony looked a little offended, but tried not to show it. \"Un...Healthy,\" asked the unicorn. \"Well, yes deary. Just saying, it would be a little nice if you maybe lost some weight? I mean, it's no wonder I bumped into you, really,\" explained Rarity. Little did she know, that last sentence was a little offensive, the unicorn pointed her horn at Rarity. It glowed a little bit, during her point. That's when she trotted away with her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity wondered what all that was about, but shrugged it off as she went home. Once she readied her supplies she felt...</span></div></div>",

She decided to eat something, as she hasn't really had lunch yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity looked into the fridge, bring out a bunch of food. She brought out eggs, daisies, bread, and butter. She planned on making a daisy sandwich, not knowing why she brought out the eggs. It was almost instinct to bring out more food than normal. She shrugged it off, about to put the eggs away, but then her stomach pains grew further, forcing her to just eat and not cook or make food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity brought the food she had brought out to the table, even the eggs, then dug in. At first she ate with slowly, with manners. However, as the unicorn ate, she ate faster, more furiously, and more slob-like. Eventually, when she was finished, there were nothing by crumbs and debris all over her. She gave a loud burp, which knocked her back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! What happened to me,\" screamed Rarity. She hoped nopony saw her. She quickly cleaned up the kitchen, then went upstairs to clean herself up. Little did Rarity know though, she had grown a little chubbier. It wasn't much, but it was a little noticeable. Rarity then wondered what she should do.</span></div></div>",

Rarity was feeling tired, and felt like she didn't want to do anything but sleep her life away. She thought for a moment. She should finish the dress and get it over with, but then again, the dress was for her, not for money. Besides, she had been working all day. It would be nice to relax a little bit. Rarity shrugged, as she thought a little beauty sleep wouldn't hurt. She went to her made bed, and jump right on, which was quite odd, as Rarity usually kept the bed nice and neat, and always went to sleep slowly and calmly. Right now however, she felt EXTREMELY tired. As tired as somepony who hasn't slept in days, even!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity yawned uncontrollably again, sleeping for a long time. Believe it or not, she woke up the next day! And she fell asleep early in the afternoon! Rarity noticed this, and was shocked.

But just then the supplies fell. Rarity clenched her stomach. She started groaning, feeling so much pressure. When suddenly it happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPRRRRRRRTT!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity released a very loud and unladylike fart. She blushed a massive beat red. \"Excuse me...\" said Rarity. \"Oh, good thing no one was around to see or here it.\" Rarity said to herself.

The ice cream? Dairy does sometimes have this effect. I wonder if-'<br>\r\nSuddenly, her thoughts fell away. Deep, primal instincts took hold. The pony known as Rarity ceased to exist. In her place stood a beautiful, if chubby, unicorn with the mental capacity of a young foal. As her very mind was cleared, her ass unclenched, and released her farts and other waste upon the innocent pile of sewing supplies. She didn't even remember what they were for. The relief, however, was heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy,\" She mumbled, her voice inarticulate and about a pitch lower than usual. Suddenly, her ears perked up. She heard a noise!

Monosyllabic responses, dilated pupils, and, no offense, you look a little chubbier than usual. This isn't just a sleeping disorder, Rarity. You seem to be under the effects of a spell!\"<br>\r\n\"So?\" Rarity replied, not sure what she meant. \"Could you just give me, like, an energy spell or something?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that would be fighting the symptoms, not the disease... Or spell, in this case. You appear to be under the effects of a metamorphosis spell, unlike any I've ever seen before. Nevertheless, I'm sure a simple counterspell will get you back to your normal state.<br>\r\n\"Well, okay, I guess,\" Rarity said absentmindedly, \"But what's it all mean?\"<br>\r\n\"You've been cursed, Rarity.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, buck,\" She muttered, stretching out in the seat, \"Can you fix it? It's, like, nearly lunchtime.\"<br>\r\nTwilight blinked, not used to her friend acting like this. \"Right, well, just wait there. I left my book of counterspells in the lab. I won't be a minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity slumped in her seat. \"So boored!\" She moaned, picking up a book to read. \"Now is the winter of our disconte... Discon... Dis... Argh! Too hard,\" She groaned, tossing it away carelessly.<br>\r\nThere weren't any magazines around, and all the books were too hard for her. Glancing at the doorway to the lab, she wondered if Twilight would ever come back. The clock on the wall was analog, and who could read that? \"Ugh, I wish this place would get blown up by some kaiju-sized goat-taur dude.\"</span></div></div>",

The spell.\" She had almost forgotten why she was here in the first place. Thank goodness all Twilight had to do was zap her and everything would be back to normal. Or so she thought.

In fact, her entire body was enormous in this fantasy. She would've questioned it, but it was so nice to be so big! Her ass jiggled as she released a huge fart, filling the room with a near-toxic stench. It was even nicer than Prench perfume to her. Hearing a noise, she turned around and saw an unknown pony. \"Hey-o! Wanna make out?\" She said, pursing her plump lips seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--End daydream--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a voice broke her from her idle reverie.<br>\r\n\"Hello?

She trotted through Ponyville, saying hello to everypony she met... Until she got tired of it. After all, why say hello to ponies she's never even met?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she neared the bridge into the park, a twinge of annoyance rose up. Some stallion was just sitting there in the middle of the road, not doing anything! Just sitting there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of the way, you dumb bucker!\" Rarity shouted. The pony ahead of her turned and scowled, but moved aside to let the rude mare pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" She muttered sarcastically. The stallion just glared as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering the twisting paths in the park, Rarity quickly grew exhausted. Her white hooves always seemed to attract dirt, but she wasn't in the mood to moan about it. Wiping the sweat from her forehead, she headed for the nearest bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched out across the bench, making sure nopony could sit next to her. \"Find your own bench!\" She shouted at a pony who was staring. Wiping her dirt-caked hooves across the seat, she thought of what to do next. A spicy smell drifted to her nose from a nearby taco stand, causing her stomach to growl, but that cheap, greasy food never agreed with her stomach. On the other hand, Sugarcube Corner wasn't too far away, but that might be too much of a walk. And she was awfully tired.</span></div></div>",

She ducked into an alleyway, and although she would never do such a thing normally, unclenched her cheeks, and let out one of the loudest farts that the young pony had ever heard.  *PFFFFFTTTFTFTTFT*  The smell was practically unbearable, with a very definitive oniony-tinge.  \"I don't know what I ate...\" Rarity said to herself, \"But I absolutely must remove it from my diet.  I've never felt less lady-like...\" as she walked off back to her home, the pressure in her gut building already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to walk, and let out another smelly fart, she found her mind wondering if it really was such a bad thing to let some rip...but quickly pushed the thought from her head.

The remnants of her ghastly workout attire were in the trash, where they well belonged, and she just wanted to relax. Her intestines had different ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Why can't my rear just behave itself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched out, feeling her joints crack and pop.

With a sigh, Rarity set down her bags and prepared to get to work. For just one moment, she felt a tightness in her anus, which she, by now used to the routine, forced out with nary a second thought. Perhaps some pink frills would go nicely with that old blue dress--<br>\r\n*plap*<br>\r\nRarity turned and gasped at the unexpected release.

'Perhaps.. Urk! I was a little rude to that pony earlier. Next time I... Aahh! See her, I'll have to make it up to her. Perhaps a visit to Sugarcube Corner for a cupcake... Or five...' She relaxed, daydreaming of a feast of wonderful junk food, enjoying the wonderful taut feeling in her expanding--<br>\r\nShe shook her head even as a massive fart shook her rear. Whatever had gotten into her today, she wondered. The stench of feces filled the bathroom, unnoticed by the mare still squatting uncomfortably over the toilet bowl. Subconsciously, she inhaled deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her anal toilet bombardment was finished, she got up on wobbly legs and faced the bowl, which was quite full of her liquid fecal matter.<br>\r\n'Must be punishment for that extra scoop of ice cream last night,' she thought, almost turning to leave before remembering to flush. Luckily, her scat all went down in one go and didn't come back up again. Feeling quite content with herself, she trotted towards the door, new dress designs flowing through her head, when she felt something else... Back there.<br>\r\nTurning her rear to face the mirror, she found her white crack stained dark, and small flecks of fecal matter scattered across her petite bottom. Gasping in horror, she looked towards the toilet--<br>\r\n-- To find only an empty roll sitting placidly on the holder.<br>\r\nShe flung open the cupboard below the sink, only to find it empty save for a bottle of drain cleaner and a few boxes of soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the counter by the sink, Rarity saw two things: a book of songs written by her dear sister Sweetie Belle, and a pearl white hair towel with the words 'My Faithful Student' embossed in gold, which had been forgotten by Twilight during a sleepover at the boutique. Using either of these would be breaking the trust of the pony to whom these things belonged, and she briefly considered simply continuing about her day with the mess still present, but if any of her friends saw her, it'd surely be a one-way ticket to the mental ward of Ponyville Hospital.<br>\r\nDoes she...</span></div></div>",

She wastes no time in spooning out the small cup and licking the container clean, a small stain of pink painting her chin as she feels her instincts take over. In her mind, what mattered was not whether she caught anypony's attention, nor whether she kept clean, but whether she got her fill - and right now, she couldn't be farther from full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls out more yogurt, but within a minute cleans it out without even using her spoon, licking it clean and swallowing every last bit of the dairy as she lets out a soft belch. \"Oof,\" she grunts as she recovers from the belch, the act of release uncouth, yet....oddly satisfying to her. She sits on her flanks in front of the open fridge, placing a hoof on her belly as her mind seems to return to her. While she was originally quite lithe and light on her hooves, now she has a small pouch of bellyfat, almost imperceptible while sitting but capable of sagging a few millimeters or jiggling in sudden movements. Her cheeks don't feel quite as well-sculpted as before, her jaw padded slightly in a way that makes it a bit slower to open and close her mouth. Her flanks, while still not 'fat' per se, are definitely thicker, fuller than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a mare of stature and beauty, Rarity takes notice of these slight changes, feeling almost pathetic for indulging enough to gain these few pounds. Had two pudding-cups of yogurt really done this much to her? How could it be so? Suddenly she remembers the fat unicorn she had encountered in her rushing, face feeling somewhat pale as she feels her self-confidence shrinking. \"I...I-I don't understand...what did her spell do? Does every calorie I eat simply become fat now? I....I need to do something about this. I don't know what, but I'd best do s-something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this moment of lucidity, Rarity notes a new feeling:</span></div></div>",

The yogurt was not quite satisfying for her hunger, but in this moment, she shouldn't seek to fill up wholly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands back up on all fours before, without warning, her tail lifts and lets loose a soft sputtering gust of flatus. To her utter dismay, the scent of gas lingers around her as she closes her fridge! This effect on her is ab....abhorra....argh, <b>humiliating</b>! Just the moment she had to take to come up with a word makes her feel insecure and helpless as she starts her moderate trot out of her tailoring shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of her plush midsection shaking, and the sudden, somewhat noisy spurts of gas, force her self-consciousness through the roof, but eventually she reaches her fellow elemental friend's library, the Golden Oaks. She rapidly knocks her hoof at the door, a lump gathering in her throat as she awaits Twilight's response. Thankfully she doesn't have to wait long before the door opens. \"Oh!

Before she can stop herself, she sits on her plush haunches and hugs Twilight around the neck tightly. \"T-thank you darling, you are too kind...I'm just a complete mess today.\" As she walks inside the library, she lets out a soft fart that once again lingers behind her, trailing in the interior. She tries not to make a scene of it, tail tucked between her legs as she enters the study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight locks the door behind the two mares as she gets out a stethoscope and a few other monitoring tools, quickly getting to work on measurements. A minute passes before Twilight hums to herself, scrawling notes in a notebook before closing it. \"Despite the gain, you seem to be okay so far. Before I ask for symptoms and cross-reference...\" Her horn flickers before a kettle of tea, two cups, and a small plate of sugar cookies are brought in via teleportation. \"There you go.\" She sets everything on her nightstand before sitting on her bed with a spellbook in magical tow, gesturing for Rarity to sit by her. \"So, start from the beginning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Rarity finishes explaining her mental blockage and gas, Rarity has chomped down each cookie, crumbs settled on her chest as she licks her lips and chin clean.

On the other side is Rarity's workspace, somewhat cluttered given the nature of the job. As soon as the rift is opened, Rarity picks up her blueprints, taking her time to read the obnoxiously fancy writing she used for them. With a clear head and less frustration, she understands better, pulling out a new cut of her satin, slowly and carefully cutting everything out. Rarity smiles to the rift, thankful for Twilight's spying as she manages to get by more easily than earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours pass without any problems, and Rarity makes her personal dress - scrapping the corset for obvious reasons and instead opting to use stretchier fabric for her belly. Despite her experience, Rarity does have some sweat on her brow, wiping it off as she stands. Two quiet noises are heard as she does: the faint squeak of a dainty toot, and the more ominous gurgling of a hungry belly. \"Uhm, say, Twilight, would you have any dietary recommendations? I should be okay as long as I don't make a mess, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds pass before Twilight replies, \"Like I said, you can't prevent gaining weight, so just don't scarf it down or make a mess and the weight gained could be lost after the fact.\" As she says this, the rift shrinks slightly, due to the intensity of creating a rift in general. \"Ah, is it okay if I leave you be for the night? My horn aches from the spell..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity frowns slightly, but understands, hopimg she can exercise some self control. \"Alright dear, get your rest then. I think I'll follow closely behind you too. Goodnight, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the rift disappears, Rarity jogs her way downstairs, going to the kitchen just as before but hesitating. What could she eat? There are leftover daisy sandwiches from a picnic that week; a hefty carton of neopolitan ice cream in her freezer; or a few other options in her pantry.</span></div></div>",

She turns on her television, checking for soap operas and getting to the most recent episode of her favorite one before popping the lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, Rarity is a sniffling, whimpering mess, the drama of the program too much for her to handle as she spoons another mouthful of pink ice cream. \"Oh Glamour, why do your talents go so unnoticed among your f-friends?

The streaks of mascara stain her cheeks, eyes practically glued shut, and the pink color is nigh-unwashable from her snout. There's a pang of pity in Twilight, but...something else as well. She gently clears her throat, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response Rarity snorts softly, raising a leg and gassing her covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity...?\" the nerdy mare asks, not getting a reply. \"R-Rarity, wake up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idunwann'...\" Rarity sniffles slightly, hugging the ice cream carton to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity...you did it again...\" she states, in a more scathing tone and a slighy raised volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity slowly stretches in bed, then rubs her eyes of mascara and tears, eyes slightly pink. \"W-what did I do...?\" As her crusted eyes manage to open her screams could be heard across the entire town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity sits in her shower, loudly sobbing to herself as she tries to wash the pink from her snout to no avail.

I can help, really! Can we at least talk at the door?\" Twilight frowns softly. A swelling in her chest reminds her that something is off about her feelings toward the gluttonous unicorn, but Twi fails to pick up on the reason, wanting to be there for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I want to be al - hic! - alone, T-Twilight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight unlocks the door with her magic, silently starting to open the door.

Here, I have a few rules set:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Anything slob-related could happen to Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. She cannot like the transformation. At least not at first. She can be convinced to like it or hypnotized into liking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Keep Rarity and every other pony in character. Rule 2 applies to this, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Rarity is the first pony who will gain. You can have other ponies gain if there's a good reason for it, but Rarity shall be the main focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. OCs are not aloud. Sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. No blood and gore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Scat is allowed but try not to overdo it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. No sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Swearing is allowed but don't overdo it. Basically, don't curse every five seconds or two words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. No death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's about it. Other than that, have fun everypony! ^_^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: Please add on to this. It's no fun having an interactive if you're the only one in it. Please try to add something when you view this, rather then check it out and leave? Thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT 2: Just for the record, Rarity is my favorite pony.
