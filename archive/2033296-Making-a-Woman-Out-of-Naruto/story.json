With a trained hand that had dealt with such an infernal contraption for the longest time, he slammed down on it, bringing silence to the room once more. Slowly, the boy sat up in his bed, stretching his limbs out and yawning in the morning sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scowled a bit after a moment and heaved a mild \"Blech!\" sound, sticking his tongue out in disgust. He suffered the occasional bout of disgusting morning taste just like everyone else, but for some reason, it was really bad today. <i>'Better go brush my teeth immediately then'</i>, he thought, pulling off his walrus-shaped sleeping cap and stumbling across the apartment to his bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto went through his morning ritual as he always did. He pulled out some toothpaste, picked up his toothbrush, applied one to the other, looked up into the mirror, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toothbrush fell into the sink with a clatter. Whatever sleep remained in his eyes was now long gone; the boy, if he could even be called that anymore, was now wide awake as he stared in utter shock at the face that looked back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Naruto see?</span></div></div>",

I can't go outside looking like this!\" Rushing from the bathroom, the now blonde girl opened the door to her bedroom, momentarily letting go of her pajama bottoms. This proved to be a mistake as mid step into the room they fell to Naruto\u2019s ankles, causing her to trip and tumble to the floor face first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing the forming lump on her nose, she got and made her way over to the closet, all the while using one hand to hold her pajama bottoms up having learned from her previous mistake. Naruto rummaged through the closet throwing clothes over her shoulder left and right. Finally a cry of \u201cA-ha!\u201d left her lips as she pulled back from the closet holding an old pair of black pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had outgrown them a few years back, but had decided not throw them out. \u2018Looks like it has paid off. These should fit perfectly.\u2019 She thought. And indeed they did. While on normal, boy, Naruto they wouldn\u2019t have fit. With girl Naruto\u2019s slimmer frame they fit snugly. Although they were a little short, stopping a few inches above her ankles. The pants would have to do for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to clean up the pile of clothes Naruto had thrown out of the closet later. She walked out into the living room and sat down on the sofa. \u2018Now that I\u2019ve calmed down.\u2019 She thought. \u2018I need to figure out what I\u2019m going to do now.\u2019 Anymore thought on the subject though was interrupted by a knocking coming from the door. \u201cHuh?

The sound of Hinata's voice coming from him only made him shake as his fear started to turn into panic. Raising a shaking creamy-white skinned hand, Naruto touched his new face hoping that this was just some genjustu or a weird dream and he'd wake up. He however found that the skin of his cheek was just as soft and supple as it looked. Not willing to believe what his sense of touch was telling him just yet, he brought Hinata's hand up and ran his fingers through the short blond hair. It was so soft. <i>'Hinata doesn't have blond hair,'</i> He thought. <i>'Does this mean that this is really me?!? Or is it some freaky nightmare?!?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's breathing started to grow heavy as his panic grew. He tried to think of something that he could do to prove that he hadn't suddenly woken up in a body that looked remarkable like a blond haired version of Hinata, while still dressed in his PJ's. First he tried to release any jutsu on himself, thinking that maybe he had activated his <u>'Sexy jutsu'</u> and changed it so he turned into Hinata. It was a bit of a stretch to believe he had done such a thing while sleeping but, then again he had woken up to some weird things in his short life. Sadly when he tried to release it nothing happened. He quickly remembered something about pain and breaking free of illusions; the fact that any dream he had gotten hurt in he quickly woke up from only made the idea of pain all the more reasonable to him. It wasn't long till he found himself, or is it herself now, with a bleeding lip from where the teeth broke the skin and no change to his feminine appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling desperation settling in, Naruto stared wide eyed at his mirror which continued to show a reflection of a blond haired Hinata with a small trickle of blood coming from where her lip had been bitten. <i>'Oh Kami... What do I do now?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought soon came to his panicked mind. With it he could at least prove that he wasn't somehow in Hinata's body; the seal that held Kyuubi. <i>'Hinata doesn't have the seal, so I just need to see it to prove that I'm not inside Hinata's body.'</i> Another thought soon struck him however. <i>'Wait! What if it's not there? Will that mean that Kyuubi somehow got loose? Or did Hinata and I switch bodies and places? Would this mean that she is waking up at home in my body?!? And the seal is on my body so it shouldn't be able to just jump to a new body even if I somehow switched with her, right? And what about the hair color, how did that change?'</i> His thoughts kept spiraling out of control  creating worst possibilities with each second until in a moment of shear panic he ripped off his pajama shirt, leaving his upper female body bare and naked to the cool morning air of his apartment and channeled chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared into his mirror for what seemed like an eternity but, no seal faded into existence on his/her stomach. Terror gripped his heart, not even noticing the obvious difference between his male body and his Hinata body even as they sat there on display. Naruto stood there shaking slightly in shock and terror and though he mind didn't quite register it, his body shivered from the chill of the air enveloping it. <i>'Is the fox free now? Or is it still sealed in my boy body and now Hinata has to deal with it?!?'</i> These thoughts disturbed Naruto greatly as Hinata might be a bit weird in his opinion but, she was still very kind to him. He did not want her having to deal with the fox. <i>'I need to see the old man.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis destination in mind he made to turn only to suddenly realize that he was looking at the reflection of a half nude girl his age. Despite knowing it was wrong to do he couldn't help but, stare at the girl's rather developed body. <i>'How the hell does she hide these things under that baggy jacket?!? Their Huge!'</i> He thought to himself as he stupidly reached up and cupped one of the breasts in his feminine hand. Once he started he just couldn't stop himself as the other hand did the same to his other breast and he started absentmindedly fondling his new assets. They where quite soft, yet there was a firmness to them that he hadn't expected. It surprised him to realize that the Hyuuga girl was nearly as big as the Kunoichi and civilians who where nearly twice said girls age. <i>'What is she suppose to do with all of this?'</i> He wondered as he continued to mold the supple flesh in his hands; hands that just couldn't quite hold all of the marshmallowy soft mounds.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto stared fearfully at the reflection in the mirror that showed the young Hyuga heiress staring back at him. \"W-what is this?\" He whispered in his new soft and clearly feminine voice. The sound of Hinata's voice coming from him only made him shake as his fear started to turn into panic. Raising a shaking creamy-white skinned hand, Naruto touched his new face hoping that this was just some genjustu or a weird dream and he'd wake up. He however found that the skin of his cheek was just as soft and supple as it looked. Not willing to believe what his sense of touch was telling him just yet, he brought Hinata's hand up and ran his fingers through the short dark blue, almost night-black hair. It was so soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's breathing started to grow heavy as his panic grew. He tried to think of something that he could do to prove that he hadn't suddenly woken up in Hinata's body while dressed in his PJ's in his apartment. First he tried to release any jutsu on himself, thinking that maybe he had activated his <u>'Sexy jutsu'</u> and changed it so he turned into Hinata. It was a bit of a stretch to believe he had done such a thing while sleeping but, then again he was a rather restless sleeper and had once woken up nearly a mile from his teams\u2019 campsite due to his constant movement. Sadly when he tried to release it nothing happened. Next he tried using pain to wake himself up because this clearly had to be a dream or something. No dice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling desperation settling in, Naruto stared wide eyed at his reflection showing Hinata with a small trickle of blood coming from where he had bitten his/her lip. There was now only one thing that Naruto could think of to prove that he wasn't in Hinata's body; the seal that held Kyubi. <i>'Hinata doesn't have the seal, so I just need to see it to prove that I'm not inside Hinata's body.'</i> Another thought soon struck him however. <i>'Wait! What if it's not there? Will that mean that Kyubi somehow got loose? Or did Hinata and I switch bodies and places? But the seal is on my body so it shouldn't be able to just jump to a new body even if I somehow switched with her.'</i> His thoughts kept spiraling like this and creating worst possibilities with each second until in a moment of shear panic he ripped off his pajama shirt, leaving his upper female body bare and channeled chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief flooded him as he saw the seal appear over his belly before he stopped channeling his chakra and allowed the seal to fade from view. Only now did he take notice of something important. He was in a girl body and had ripped off the only piece of clothing covering his upper body. This of course meant that Naruto got a good look at what Hinata hid under her baggy jacket. Gaping stupidly at the sight before him he raised his hands and dumbly cupped the girls\u2019 breasts. <i>'How the hell did she keep these things hidden for so long?!? Their Huge!'</i> He thought to himself as he dumbly fondled his new assets. Although there were plenty of women that where bigger than the young Hyuga girl, they just so happened to be nearly twice said girls age so being bigger was to be expected. Among Hinata's age group however, she was clearly the most developed of all. In another year or two the girl would be likely be entering the double D category and may even give Tsunade a run for her money some years down the line if she kept growing like this.</span></div></div>",

Let me out dattebayo!\" Naruto screamed in Hinata's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eye twitched, Tsunade did not appreciate being called an old lady by some two-bit imposter. Feeling a bit spiteful Tsunade dropped the tied up fake in a manner that had them land on their face . <b>*THUD*</b> \"Ouch!\" Tsunade smiled at the small bit of payback feeling much better, at least until the fake opened her mouth again. \"Damn it Baa-chan! What the hell was that for?!? I'll have you know that Hinata's body isn't nearly as durable as my own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving enough of the fakes mouth, Tsunade force her to sit up and move her hand as if she was going to flick the Hinata copies forehead. \"I'm known to have the strength of a hundred men, want to see what a single flick can do to that melon you call a head?\" She saw the fear in the fakes eyes and thought that they could start getting some answers, she did not expect the fakes eyes to suddenly harden nor did she expect what came out of their mouth. \"I know very well what happened last time you flicked me with your finger Baa-chan. You sent me flying but, I got back up and tried to use a Rasengan on you.\" If Tsunade wasn't surprised before then she sure as hell was now. Only four people and one pig knew about that. Feeling an odd sense of dread, Tsunade forced open the fakes jacket causing her to yell. \"The Hell Baa-chan?!?\" Tsunade paid her no mind as she was too focused on the jewel hanging from the necklace around the fakes neck. It was the same one she had given Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-narut-to?!?\" The fake just gave a miserable pout, which due to it being Hinata's face just made her look like a kick puppy. \"It's me Baa-chan. I don't know how or why but, it's me.\" Tsunade just stared in shock for a moment before turning to the sound of something hitting the ground. Seems Hinata fainted from the shock of having attacked her crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is just great. . .\" Tsunade muttered as she rubbed her forehead before picking up Hinata and placing her in a seat next to Naruto's. \"I'll need sake after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think I feel?\" Naruto asked as he turned towards the unconscious Hinata. <i>'Huh, I never realized how cute she was. . .'</i> He/She blushed at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, can you explain how this happened?\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed as he took his own seat. \"I really don't know Baa-chan! I just woke up this way.\" He then put on a serious face. \"The fox is still there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. . .\" Tsunade started as she. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade placed a hand on top of Ninata's head and one on top of the real Hinata's head. She ignored the confused and questioning look that the boy turned girl gave her. Tsunade's hands glowed with a green aura as she checked and compared Naruto's female body to Hinata's natural one. What she found was both disturbing and fascinating. There where some areas of Naruto's genetic structure that where not identical to Hinata's. However, even as she watched it most of the genetics were slowly changing to match Hinata's. There were one or two key markers that didn't seem to be changing but, Tsunade didn't want to simply believe that those key markers were safe from changing at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her hands she sighed. \"Well brat, I'm sad to say that I've never seen something like this and have no idea how to reverse it, or if it even can be. You may just have to get use to living as Hinata's double.\" She saw the look of horror on Naruto's face. \"It's not that bad brat. Your at least changing into someone your own age. You could have turned into someone of my age for all we know.\" Naruto went pale at hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we need to figure out what to do about you. We can't go having two Hinata's walking around with out some kind of explanation and no we can't just tell everyone that you are Naruto.\" Naruto was quite for a time before looking up at her. \"Baa-chan? Could you maybe untie me?\" It wasn't loud like Tsunade was use to. Naruto seemed so subdued but, then again he'd just been told that the life he knew was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter untying Ninata they sat in silence for a time. \"So, what are we going to do Baa-chan?\" Tsunade noticed that Naruto didn't seem to mind that Hinata had shifted around a bit and was now resting her head against Naruto's shoulder. \"Well brat, the best thing that I can think of is making up some excuse about a jutsu going wrong and forcefully separating her Yin and Yang chakra. We could use this as an excuse to keep the two of you together so Hinata can keep an eye on you and your changes.\" Not seeing any negative reactions to this she continued. \"Also, we will need to give you a different name as calling you Naruto will only cause questions to pop up and calling you Hinata will only cause confusion. As such too all others you will refer to yourself as Ninata. Now we just need to wake Hinata and tell her that she is moving in with you for an undisclosed amount of time.\" Silently, Tsunade hoped that when the shock wore off Naruto, now named Ninata, wouldn't suffer some kind of break down.</span></div></div>",

Ninata rubbed the back of her head in a very Naruto like fashion. \u201cWell n-no I haven\u2019t. B-but it can\u2019t be that different from how I normally washed right?\u201d Ninata really hoped that it wasn\u2019t all that different as she wouldn\u2019t want to damage her new body. There was also the fear that he might do something perverse and seeing as how he was technically inside of Hinata\u2019s body that would translate to doing perverse things to her. Ninata did not want Hinata to think that he was just some two-bit pervert inside a copy of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata in the meantime, was debating with herself whether or not she should offer to join her and teach Ninata how to bath. It\u2019s not like she wasn\u2019t going to see Hinata\u2019s body anyway right? Pushing past her embarrassment and with a not so small blush on her face she spoke up. \u201cI-I c-c-ould-d joi-in you if you w-want-t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata looked at her in surprise at first wondering when the shy girl had turned into such a pervert. Then however, she remembered that she was wearing Hinata\u2019s body so there couldn\u2019t be such perverse reasons, right? <i>\u2018I bet she just wants to make sure I don\u2019t do something I shouldn\u2019t when cleaning myself.\u2019</i> Ninata thought. <i>\u2018There is still the fact that I have the brain of a boy and find girl\u2019s attractive though. What if I say or do something perverted to Hinata while she\u2019s trying to help me? Can I really trust myself to not try something while we are so close and all wet?\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure. . .\" Ninata got out, completely nervous with a nod of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Ok, let's go.\" Hinata said as the two headed for the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wash heated up, the two striped down their clothes, both blushing at each others similar bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Wow, me and Hinata-chan really do have the same bodies. . .and we both are cute looking.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Naruto-kun. . .I mean, Ninata-chan. . .you blushing. . .could it be you. . .?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. . .we better get in.\" Ninata started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah. . .\" Hinata replied as they headed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata blushed, glancing shyly at Hinata's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow... I... she... we have a really, uh... really nice body... </i>the boy turned girl thought, gulping and trying very hard not to stare at Hinata's remarkably well-developed breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is that really what I look like...?</i> thought Hinata to herself, furtively using her byakugan to exam Naruto... no... <i>Ninata's</i> body. <i>I never thought I could be so... pretty... It's so different from looking into a mirror.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo identical, female bodies slowly slid themselves down into the hot, steaming water of the bath, each trying hard NOT to be caught all but outright ogling the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hinata-chan's got such round boobs...</i> Ninata thought, blushing a little redder as she eyed the surprisingly full and supple organs in question. While maybe far from the biggest, the Hyuuga's bosom was certainly something to speak of, considering how young they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata licked her lips, which felt perversely dry despite the overall humidity of the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ninata-kun's behind is so... big...</i> thought Hinata shyly. <i>Is my butt really that big...? Even with how hard I've been training, it's still so fat, and bouncy, and ugly...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face fell a little. Yet, even in spite of herself, her usual shyness lessened by the fact that Ninata was physically identical to herself, Hinata managed to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninata...\" she said softly. \"Does... does my butt look big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's jaw dropped.

After a moment she started to give the question some real thought. She knew from her past experiences as Naruto that girls could be tricky when it came to questions about their bodies. She\u2019d seen plenty of guys asked this very question by their girlfriends and no matter if they said yes, no or something else they always seemed to get it wrong and make their girlfriend upset.<i> 'Is Hinata\u2019s butt big? I really don\u2019t know. I mean its bigger then my was but, I\u2019ve never had a girl butt to really compare to outside of my <u>\u2018Sexy Jutsu\u2019</u> form and that is of a clearly older girl then we are.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ninata was thinking on the best answer Hinata was taking her crushes silence as a yes. <i>\u2018She just doesn\u2019t want to say it out loud cause it would hurt my feelings.\u2019</i> She hated herself right now. She hated having such a big ugly butt. Hinata wouldn\u2019t be all that surprised is Naruto hated being stuck as such an ugly person as herself. She wanted nothing more than to leave, find some dark corner and cry. She only just noticed the sound of Ninata standing up. <i>\u2018Likely to leave rather then have to spend more time looking at me.\u2019</i> She thought feeling miserable and depressed. She was however, broken from her self-destructive thoughts by Ninata speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it. Why are you worried that this is big?\u201d Looking up Hinata went wide eyed as she got an eyeful of Ninata. The boy turned girl was currently had her side to her, giving Hinata a good side profile of her body. That wasn\u2019t what caught her attention though. That went to the sight of Ninata\u2019s hands firmly clamped on to her own butt and fondling it while Ninata had a confused expression on her face. She watched in silence as Ninata gave her rump a small smack, causing it to jiggle gently right before Hinata\u2019s eyes. It was sort of odd how she found the sight enjoyable and had the urge to grab and feel Ninata\u2019s butt with her own hands. \u201cYour butt seems perfectly fine to me Hinata. If this is what having a big butt is like then please don\u2019t change it.\u201d Ninata said this with a satisfied smile as she gave her butt another gentle smack. Suddenly however, she became overly conscious of how this may look to Hinata and quickly sank back down into the water while trying to hide her burning red face behind her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata continued to stare at the clearly embarrassed girl, a mix of emotions swirling inside of her. First was shock at what she had seen her own body do. Next, was joy at the knowledge that Ninata liked her butt, big or not. Last was arousal, Hinata for the life of her could not stop thinking about how much she wanted to press her skin onto Ninata\u2019s, to feel her hands run across the creamy white skin and feel that fullness of her chest and backside in her own hands. Ninata however, was more embarrassed then she could ever remember being. <i>\u2018I can\u2019t believe I did that\u2026 Now Hinata-chan is going to think I\u2019m just some sick perv. Well, if I\u2019m going to dig a whole, then I might as well go the whole way.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hinata?\u201d The girl in question snapped her attention to a surprising sight. Ninata had sounded so embarrassed and from her posture it was clear to Hinata that she was also fearful of something. Most likely it had something to do with what she was going to say next. \u201cI may not like the fact that I suddenly changed from a boy to a girl.\u201d Ninata raised her head just enough for Hinata to see two lavender pools glance at her before looking away in the perfect image of cute and embarrassed. \u201cOut of all the girls I could have turned into though, I\u2019m glad it was you. After all, if I\u2019m going to be a girl I might as well be the cutest one, right?\u201d Ninata force herself to give a big smile while saying this so she didn\u2019t see Hinata turn a bright red at how she had just been complemented and called cute.</span></div></div>",

I'm so glad to hear you say that... that you think I'm cute...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling a little pinkish in the cheeks, she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and... I'm so happy...\" Hinata continued quietly, inching forward a little in the tub. \"So happy that you like...\" she gulped. \"...l-like my b-butt...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was bright red, saying this, yet Ninata could still see the very warm, very genuine smile on the other girl's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata blinked, flabbergasted at this. Her own cheeks went a shocking, deep scarlet. Wha-whaaa? I... I thought she was mad... Doesn't she think I'm a pervert for doing something like that...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but, Hinata...\" Ninata said quietly, anxiously. \"I know I'm a girl now, but... I'm a guy, too. I mean, not, like, down there...\" She saw Hinata's gaze wander almost automatically below her belt, and gulped. The water, hot as it was, was also nonetheless quite transparent through the steam, and the other girl could see everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if this WAS Hinata's body, it still made Ninata feel weird. Except it was a good weird. Or would it be a bad weird, here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she knew, generally speaking, what the feeling was, or came from. It was the same feeling she used to get while, ah, studying those skin rags she (or rather he, back then) had been able to swipe from the convenience store. Except that SHE was the one being studied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping nervously, Ninata soldiered on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, what I mean is... I still think like a guy, right? I don't, um, like boys, if you understand...\" she said awkwardly. \"Er, well... I like girls,\" she said. \"And while I've seen a lot of that in some magazines, um, I don't see how... eh... aren't you worried?\" she said lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled warmly at Ninata. Her crush-turned-doppelganger's obvious nervousness was, somehow, alleviating Hinata's own usual shyness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I ever be worried?\" she asked calmly, confidently. She leaned forward in the water, planting a hand on the floor of the tub, right between Ninata's legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were very, very close right now. Their faces were only inches apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, I'm a guy...\" she said slowly. \"I like girls... We're... um... both sitting naked in a bath tub...\" Her blush deepened, if that were physically possible. \"Aren't you worried... that I might... well, try something...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's eyes glistened in the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not worried about that,\" she whispered, bringing her lips nearly right up to Ninata's ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's eyes were practically bugging out of her head now. Was this how it was for girls when they got, uh, turned on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh... why not...?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata was feeling so much better now after Ninata had confessed to thinking she was cute and that her butt was perfect, well she hadn\u2019t said those exact words but, Hinata had gotten the meaning. After a thank you kiss of all things, Hinata had suggested that they get started with learning how to clean Ninata\u2019s girl body. Embarrassed as all hell and still a little shell-shocked Ninata still did as Hinata asked and sat between her legs while facing away. This was something that Hinata was very grateful for as it kept Ninata from seeing her face turn bright red when she felt the girls butt press against her front. Things where still a little awkward however, due to Ninata\u2019s bathtub not being all that big nor all that high. So the twin girls where left in a tub whose water level only reached just above their bellybuttons. \u201cS-so what first Hin-nata?\u201d asked Ninata her small stutters were picked up on by Hinata but she ignored them, not wishing to embarrass her any farther then she already was. \u201cFirst, w-we ne-eed to get you w-w-et.\u201d <i>\u2018Kami-sama why does making her wet have to sound so naughty and so appealing at the same time?!?\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata and Ninata were able to make good progress from there but, they both could feel a sense of anticipation building. The fact that Hinata was getting a little too into running her soap covered hands over Ninata\u2019s body and the fact that Ninata was fighting back small moans of pleasure likely wasn\u2019t helping in keeping their bath clean. Hinata was having the most trouble as her thoughts were getting hazy from lust and arousal as she ran her hands over Ninata\u2019s skin. She had already helped Ninata clean her legs and arms and had even done her back but, now she was just finishing up Ninata\u2019s stomach while the girl leaned against her. The look of barely restrained pleasure on Ninata\u2019s face had been the thing to do her in and now she had the perfect angle and reason to help wash Ninata\u2019s chest. Bringing her soapy hands to Ninata\u2019s breast she felt her breathing grow heavy and rapid as she fondled more than washed her crushes bosom. They felt so soft to her and Hinata couldn\u2019t help herself as she gently played with them while pressing her own against Ninata\u2019s back. Hinata\u2019s eyes rested on Ninata\u2019s vulnerable neck and before she could even think she had started leaving a trail of hot kisses across Ninata\u2019s jaw line, leading towards that neck that was just begging her to mark the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata gasped and sat shock still as she felt something brush against her lower folds. It took her a moment to realize that it was Hinata\u2019s finger running up and down the slit, teasing her. A loud moan escaped her as Hinata kissed and suckled her neck and played with her breast. <i>\u2018If this isn\u2019t heaven then I don\u2019t know what is.\u2019</i> Thought the girl as she willingly submitted to Hinata\u2019s touches. She went wide eyed and stopped breathing for a moment as she felt Hinata slowly insert some of her finger before pulling back out. The girl seemed to not wish to enter to quickly as her finger went back to running up and down her folds a few more times before entering again. This time a little deeper and Ninata could feel her muscles attempt to clamp down on that finger and drag it deeper. <i>\u2018She\u2019s driving me insane!\u2019</i> she thought as her hips bucked in response to Hinata\u2019s probing fingers leaving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt herself smirk as she felt Ninata buck her hips in a silent demand for attention. She planted another hot kiss on Ninata\u2019s neck and nibbled on it causing the girl to moan loudly in want for more.</span></div></div>",

At that moment, she pulled her in for a heated kiss and then started to nibble on her lower lip while fondling her breasts with one hand and her privates with the other, causing Hinata to moan into the kiss. Pulling back for a moment Ninata continued, \"Let us always be together. . .as lovers!\" Not wishing to waste more time Ninata went right back to kissing those soft inviting lips of her new lover. Hinata moaned in agreement, not at all bothered by the idea or the fact that she had lost control over her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's tongue proved to be quite the intrepid explorer, judging by the way it mapped a course down Hinata's neck, from the soft, cute line of her jaw down to her pale collarbone. But Hinata's hands however were also quite adventurous, patting Ninata down here and there, stroking the rounding, creamy curves of her blossoming young body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata marveled at the feeling of those buttocks, those cheeks of what Ninata had called a perfect butt. They were so soft, and pliable, and the innocently lewd squeaks and whimpers the act of fondling them elicited from the other girl were also quite enjoyable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling bold, Hinata lightly smacked Ninata full, supple butt cheeks. With her Byakugan, she could see the way the rounded mounds of kissable girl-flesh rippled and jiggled with the impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed beet red, feeling distinctly hot at that spectacle. Licking her lips, she let out a delighted squeal as Ninata suddenly pressed her soft, warm lips so tightly and wonderfully against one of her nipples. She felt the girl shamelessly kissing and licking the stiffening, sensitive nubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata was sucking on Hinata's breast, passionately fondling the other with one hand, and tentatively petting the Hyuuga's blossom with the remaining one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You taste so sweet, Hinata-chan...\" Ninata somehow managed to say through a mouthful of remarkably generous breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, and then she moaned, feeling Ninata lightly scrape her teeth over the edges of her areola as she continued to suckle her sensitive breasts. \"Oh Ninata-chan, I love you so much!\" She hugged the copy of her, pressing her in between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata stopped sucking as she looked at Hinata, who had a loving smile on her face. \"I love you too Hinata-chan!\" She went up and kissed her as the two moaned, breasts pressing against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two tongues went into a frenzy as they licked each other as they both move a hand to each others parts. They separated from the kiss as they leaned their heads in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we?\" Ninata started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Hinata answered as the two then fingered each other, both moaning from the pleasure.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinatas' instincts were demanding the shy girl to make her new lover scream in pleasure and that was just what she planned to do. To this end she stopped... No pumping of her finger into that warm velvet tunnel... No kisses or nibbles on that wonderfully vulnerable neck... And no massaging those large sensitive mounds on her chest. Suffice to say the response was immediate. Ninata started whimpering pitifully while bucking her hips as best she could to get Hinata's finger to continue its previous motions. Hinata almost felt her heart break at the pleading look her lover gave her as she started kissing Hinata, trying to get her to continue, while also silently asking why she had stopped. Hinata preserved however and slowly pulled away from her lover who was now making little noises of distress, clearly thinking that Hinata was leaving or that she had done something to drive her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith swiftness born only from her training as a ninja, the Kunoichi repositioned herself so they were pressing front to front. Pushing her way between Ninata's legs, her double was quick to wrap her arms around the girl and holding her close as she rained small kisses on to Hinata's cheek. It made her feel bad to know that such a simple action had left Ninata so fearful that she was suddenly going to leave her here. Still she wanted the panting and moaning her back and captured Ninata's lips in a heated kiss. She did not stop there however as Ninata soon found Hinata's adventurous hands stroking the creamy curves of her young supple body. The girl moaned loudly into Hinata's mouth when she felt those soft hands reach down and grasp her full round bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata couldn't help but, marvel at the feeling of those soft round cheeks as they filled her hands, only to try and escape through the spaces between her finger. It was like those cheeks were trying to envelop her hands and Kami-sama did she love it! Fondling that soft, round perfectly pliable buttocks caused her lover to loose innocent lewd squeaks and whimpers that only made the act all the more enticing. It also had the added benefit of making it child's play to thrust her tongue into the open moaning mouth, allowing the appendage to explore every nook and cranny of her lovers young innocent mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her love was occupied by her hands and tongue, Hinata used her amazing flexibility to her advantage by unplugging the tub with her foot. She tried her hardest to not get distracted by her lovers own assault of tongue and hands while she waited for the water level to drain to near nothing. A quick flash of her Byakugan and Hinata was able to pop the plug back in place to prevent the small level of hot warm from escaping. <i>'Perfect.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more Hinata slowly pulled away but this time she left her hands to slide over Ninata's thighs, hooking her fingers in the area just under her knees. Hinata found the questioning look Ninata gave so cute and it made her want to pull the girl close and smother her with love. She didn't need to wait long as once she had put enough distance between her and Ninata, Hinata gave a hard yank, pulling the girl forward with a startled yelp as the water allowed Ninata to slide forward with ease. Looking down at her shocked lover Hinata couldn't help but, grin at seeing the girl laying upon the bathtubs incline. Deciding she had already wasted enough time Hinata positioned herself over Ninata and claimed her lips in a soul shearing kiss. Reacting more on instinct then anything else, Ninata wrapped her arms around Hinata and moaned into the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Hinata truly enjoyed the feeling of her lovers arms around her and the delightful sensations from mashing their breasts against each other, Hinata had something else planned for her love. Wiggling free, she started trailing kisses along her jawbone down to the collarbone were she gave the girl a small nip. Hearing her love gasp Hinata quickly continued down to just between the soft mountains of her bosom. She licked her lips in delight just before latching on to one of those perky mounds. She heard the delighted squeal Ninata made as she suckled her breasts, shamelessly kissing and licking the stiffening, sensitive nubs on top. The other breast was not left out however, as Hinata made sure to reach out and fondle that wonderful twin to the one in her mouth with her hand. Ninata gave something between a squeak and a moan as Hinata gently scraped her teeth purposely over the edges of the girls areola. Hinata also noted how her lover instinctively wrapped her legs around her. Soon Hinata switched and popped the other breast in to her mouth leaving the one she had just vacated to her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a time Hinata felt it was time to move along and began her journey of kisses once more, leaving Ninata whimpering at the loss of attention to her breasts. As she grew closer to her goal Hinata could feel the heat emanating from her lovers blossom grow with ever inch she crossed. Pushing the legs wrapped her open she reached the area just over that tempting heat. Feeling a little mischievous Hinata laid a kiss on Ninata's inner thigh, then another and another leading closer to her end goal. But just as she reached the folds of her lover that where clearly leaking in anticipation Hinata skipped over it and moved to the other thigh. Ninata nearly felt like crying at how cruel Hinata was being and whimper and moaned her lovers name all but, begging for the girl to stop tormenting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring she had stalled long enough Hinata laid a gentle kiss on the lower lips.</span></div></div>",

After being teased by Hinata and left wanting for so long, the Hyuuga finally went in full force. It was so fast, so strong, and so constant, that she couldn\u2019t even comprehend what was going on. She tried to glance down to see what Hinata was doing to her, but all she could see was her double\u2019s dark wet mane bob up and down from where it was buried between the boy-turned-girl\u2019s legs. Her loins had seemingly caught on fire and they were only getting hotter and burning with more intensity by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKami!\u201d she gasped in a small voice. This felt SO good! If this is what being a girl felt like, then Ninata didn\u2019t want to ever change back. \u201cHinata, I\u2026I\u2026OH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Hinata heard a word that Ninata had said, she made no sign of it. She only continued to work her magic. Ninata loved every second of it, but now she had a new problem; what was she supposed to do now? She was bucking her hips instinctively, moving them in and out to match Hinata\u2019s movements, but it did little to stop the rising pressure within her. Ninata almost wanted to let it all out, but she wasn\u2019t so sure if that\u2019s what she was supposed to do. She almost wanted to ask her twin, but the question could not escape her lips. She could only gasp and scream in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting to be too much. Ninata had held out for as long as she could, but now she felt like she was ready to burst any second now. \u201cHinata,\u201d she moaned. Hinata did not answer. \u201cHinata,\u201d she repeated, to silence once again. \u201cHINATA! I-I-I\u2019m gonna-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late. It came out of her like a tidal wave, bursting from the confines of her vagina in waves of pure liquid warmth. Her hips buckled and gyrated with every gushing torrent, and with each one that came out, it was all Ninata could do to keep herself from shrieking out loud. She tried to cover her mouth to muffle her voice, but it didn\u2019t work; she still moaned, gasped, and squealed as every orgasm left her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata lied still in the tub, breathing heavily. She hadn\u2019t moved very far at all, but it still felt like she had run a marathon. And judging by the wetness she could feel on her face, she realized she was crying. But she wasn\u2019t sad. She felt spent, but she felt really good, better than she ever had in her whole life. But she didn\u2019t fully understand just what had\u2026happened to her. She didn\u2019t screw up, did she? She didn\u2019t do something to make Hinata mad, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question was answered when Hinata\u2019s face finally met her own. There wasn\u2019t a trace of anger or annoyance on the Hyuuga girl\u2019s face. She was smiling warmly and lovingly into Ninata\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was it, Ninata-chan?\u201d she asked, wiping Ninata\u2019s tears away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata drew in a long breath. \u201cThat was\u2026breathtaking. You were amazing, Hinata-chan.\u201d She pulled her double\u2019s face in closer to deliver a kiss on the lips. \u201cSo what now?\u201d she asked, feeling her strength start to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d Hinata said slyly. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d</span></div></div>",

However, neither of them felt like getting dressed just yet, and since they both felt drained after making love for\u2026they didn\u2019t even know how long\u2026they both simply settled for lying down on the bed completely naked. Hinata and Ninata lied side by side, basking in each other\u2019s naked warmth and smilingly lovingly into their respective silvery eyes.

No longer able to tolerate the close proximity to her lover with so little contact, she wrapped her arms around Hinata\u2019s form and pulled her closer, giving her a little peck on the lips and crushing their breasts together. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what we just did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither can I,\u201d Hinata whispered, staring deeply into those lovely silver eyes. Ninata\u2019s silver eyes. Her own silver eyes. \u201cI dreamed of it\u2026maybe not like this\u2026but I would gladly do it again with you\u2026a thousand times.\u201d Exhaustion began to catch up to the Hyuuga girl as her eyes began drifting off to sleep, still wearing a smile of contentment that Ninata had never once seen on her face before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, when Naruto had woken up to see he had transformed into Hinata, he had been frightened. And when Tsunade later reported that the effect was likely permanent, he was devastated. But now, as she laid here, her arms wrapped up in Hinata\u2019s loving embrace, she began to realize that maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. Being a girl was surprisingly more\u2026enjoyable than she originally thought. And it helped her get to know Hinata better, and experience something so\u2026wonderful with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Hinata\u2019s angelic face, which was very much her own now, Ninata kissed her once more before drifting off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

And she was staring at Ninata with quirked eyebrow and a perplexed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I come at a bad time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata was about to say she most certainly did, when she felt a sudden breeze blow across her skin. Looking down, she realized why: that in her haste to answer the door, she had forgotten to put something on. She was naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeeep!\u201d she screamed, nearly jumping into the air and desperately covering herself with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade would\u2019ve suppressed an amused chuckle if Ninata\u2019s scream hadn\u2019t awoken and alarmed a certain Hyuuga heiress, who came running into the room worried and just as naked, her large and still developing breasts bouncing all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinata-chan?\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat is it? I heard-\u201d she stopped when she saw the Hokage standing at the doorway now looking completely surprised. Her entire body turned beet red before she scurried out of the room. Ninata promptly followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like she probably shouldn\u2019t just sit here at the door, Tsunade let herself in and shut it behind her. And then just to be safe, she closed all nearby curtains If there were any peeping toms, it was likely too late for the girl and boy-turned-girl, but still, she needed to at least ensure that there was some measure of secrecy kept in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata and Ninata eventually returned, now fully dressed, and just as red as they had been when they went in. Hinata was back in the clothes she had worn that morning, while Ninata had hastily thrown on some of her old boy clothes. They were a little too big and baggy for her though, she was having a bit of trouble keeping them from falling off, and they in no way suited her new, Hinata-esque form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said the Hokage as she tried to maintain a straight face. No matter how ridiculous the situation was, she had to be professional. \u201cWould anyone mind telling me what I just walked into here? Or do I really not want to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Hinatas blushed even more deeply, but seemed hesitant to answer. Tsunade sighed. This situation was already complicated, but she decided it might be best to drop it for now. \u201cForget it. We need to discuss our next plan of action. Since for the time being, we can\u2019t have anyone know you are Naruto, then it won\u2019t do to have you both living in his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve made arrangements for a new residence on the other side of town for you two to live in. You\u2019re to move there by tomorrow night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow night!\u201d shouted Ninata. It was comical to see what looked like the prim and proper Hinata act all bratty and incredulous. \u201cI can\u2019t pack up and move all my stuff by then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have someone move it for you swiftly and efficiently. People we can trust,\u201d said Tsunade. \u201cThough you should still pack some things up, just so the process can go a little faster. Second, I\u2019ll need to see you at the hospital tomorrow morning. Both of you. We\u2019ll need to examine you closely and regularly so we can better understand the nature of your transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd third\u2026Ninata, are you fit for duty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, granny!\u201d said Ninata indignantly. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, actually,\u201d said Hinata, \u201cNinata-chan is unable to perform the Shadow Clone technique. When I asked her to do it to prove that she was Naruto-kun, she, well, she couldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d said Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-it\u2019s nothing!\u201d said Ninata. \u201cI\u2019m just getting used to Hinata-chan\u2019s body is all!\u201d Hinata blushed at the unintended innuendo. \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps you will, but until then, you\u2019re officially off-duty now. Actually, since \u2018Hyuuga Ninata\u2019 is not in the Leaf\u2019s ninja registry, you\u2019re not even officially a ninja now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you\u2019re firing me?\u201d Had Naruto been speaking, he probably would have looked comically surprised. But now that he had Hinata\u2019s body and face, she looked positively wounded. It made Tsunade feel a pang more sympathy for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s for your own good,\u201d said the Hokage. \u201cWe can\u2019t have you risking your life if you can\u2019t fight back and defend yourself. We\u2019ll have you examined and hopefully we can figure out for a way you can access your old abilities, but until then, you\u2019re basically back to square one. I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s how things have to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata groaned and looked down at the floor. \u201cHinata, you\u2019re still on duty, though we\u2019re now going to treat this situation as a new mission for you. As far as anyone in the village is concerned, Ninata is a\u2026scientific curiosity for us. A result of your Yin Jutsu forming a physical double with its own independent personality. So it\u2019s your duty to stay and watch over her. Therefore, you\u2019re freed up of any real missions in the near future, though you\u2019re still expected to continue training under your instructor. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, Hokage,\u201d said Hinata with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. You have the rest of the evening off. I\u2019d recommend you start packing up for tomorrow.\u201d She then heard a loud groaning sound, though it didn\u2019t come from anybody\u2019s mouth. \u201cAnd maybe get something to eat as well. You\u2019re growing girls.\u201d Both girls looked a little sheepish at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait,\u201d said Ninata. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell the pervert\u2026about earlier? Right?\u201d She began to blush furiously, while her born-female counterpart shot her a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a word,\u201d said Tsunade. Truth is, she didn\u2019t need them to ask her. Kami knows Jiraiya was already going to go ape-shit when he found out Naruto had not only transformed into a girl, but into the Hyuuga heiress herself. He didn\u2019t need to know about\u2026what she suspected two girls were now doing with each other. The last thing he needed was more inspiration for his literary trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done she left. As the Hokage trekked back home, she couldn\u2019t help but rub her forehead in frustration. This whole mess was going to be a massive headache. Things were only going to get worse once House Hyuuga caught wind of it, and they would. And now that it looked like Hinata and Ninata had just been getting\u2026involved with one another\u2026damn it, she really needed a drink. Tsunade knew she would have to have a long and serious conversation with them about this real soon. But right now, she just wanted to get blissfully drunk.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tsunade did have a point on one thing. The two Hinata look-alikes really needed to eat something. Hinata hadn\u2019t eaten since breakfast. Ninata hadn\u2019t eaten anything at all. And checking her meager pantry and fridge, she saw that she was fresh out of ramen, milk, and food in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, nuts,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI was going to buy more food today, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, it\u2019s okay, Ninata,\u201d said Hinata. \u201cWe could go grocery shopping right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata looked a little torn, but when she winced again at her empty stomach, she relented. \u201cYeah, I\u2026I guess we could.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside they went. It was dark out now, but the streetlights provided them with all the light they would need. And while Konoha wasn\u2019t quite empty yet, it was still sparsely populated so that not too many people would catch sight of the two Hinatas wandering around. Even so, Ninata had elected to wear a hood over her head to at least hide her blue hair and ivory face a little bit, though there wasn\u2019t much to be done about her new silver-lavender eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, the girl that used to be Naruto couldn\u2019t help but slip her hand into Hinata\u2019s unconsciously. Hinata had to suppress a gasp at the motion. <i>Naruto-chan\u2019s actually holding my hand!</i> She tightened her grip on the smooth hand that was so much like her own before her fright would cause her to pull away by reflex. She wanted to experience this sensation of being so close to her beloved, especially after she spent so many years dreaming about it, but being too insecure to pursue it. And besides, it\u2019d be kind of silly to be shy about this sort of touch at this point. She had seen Ninata naked. She had been seen naked herself. The two had bathed together, touched each in many ways, kissed one another, and spent a good part of the day\u2026being intimate, which was more than could be said about most girls her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat point made Hinata feel a surge of cheeky pride that she wasn\u2019t sure she had ever expressed. All the girls in her class had fantasized over their crushes for the longest time, with said crush almost always being Sasuke. But <i>she</i> alone had actually managed to live out a fantasy with her own crush now years before any of them would, taking Ninata\u2019s virginity and losing her own at the same time! Oh, she wondered how they would react? Just how furious would they be if they ever found out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was one thing that troubled her. She didn\u2019t mind that Naruto was now a girl who looked exactly like her. She had accepted and embraced that change in him. But what would everyone else think if they found out about it? Would they find this kind of relationship odd, or even disgusting? In a way, Ninata could be considered her twin sister, and Hinata knew that kind of thing would be deemed unacceptable. And with that in mind, what did Tsunade think? She saw the two of them naked in the apartment; did she now know what they had been doing? And what would her father think if he found out? So many troubling questions ran through her mind. Even though she finally had what she desired for so long, it seemed like just about anything could take it away from her. She tightened her grip on Ninata\u2019s hand even more.</span></div></div>",

Crap, she was supposed to keep this a secret for the time being. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be Naruto and she wasn't supposed to be familiar with Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Hinata,\u201d Sakura said, walking by them without really paying attention. She then stopped to acknowledge Hinata much more directly. The look-alikes subtly let go of their hands, hoping that the pink-haired girl hadn\u2019t caught sight of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, uh, have you seen Naruto anywhere?\u201d Sakura asked. Both twins inwardly sighed in relief. It seemed like she hadn\u2019t noticed Ninata just yet. \u201cI stopped by his house a few minutes ago, but he wasn\u2019t home. I need to talk to him about something important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, no, I haven\u2019t seen him at all today,\u201d said Hinata a little nervously. She was a never a good liar around other Hyuugas, but she hoped Sakura wouldn\u2019t pick up on her body language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Sakura with a suspicious eyebrow. \u201cAre you sure? I know you tend to watch him when he\u2019s out training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed, and Ninata shot her a questioning look from beneath her hood. Hinata watched her? How long had this been going on? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I, uh, haven\u2019t,\" Hinata said, feeling somewhat ashamed seemed to be aware of some of her 'hobbies.' Was she really that bad at hiding it? \"I\u2019ve been busy all day.\u201d Which technically wasn\u2019t a lie. She hadn\u2019t really seen \u2018Naruto\u2019 at all. And she most certainly had been \u2018busy\u2019 all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Sakura said relenting. \u201cSo, who\u2019s your friend here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hinata and Ninata froze. Neither of them were exactly ready to say what exactly happened. Heck, neither of them knew what exactly they were supposed to say. Tsunade hadn\u2019t gone into too much depth with the cover story. And while they could just spin another lie, sooner or later, everyone would have to know about Hinata\u2019s doppelganger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is\u2026Ninata,\u201d said Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinata, huh?\u201d said Sakura, peering into the boy-turned-girl\u2019s hood. \u201cA relative of yours? Huh, you two look a lot like each other. Actually, I\u2019d say you look like twins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, actually,\u201d Ninata said, not quite knowing what she should say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou even sound the same!\u201d Sakura exclaimed. \u201cNow, no offense intended or anything, but that\u2019s kind of creepy. Wait, you\u2019re not running around with some <i>bunshin</i>, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2026well, is my twin in a way,\u201d said Hinata with resignation. \u201cSomething happened. A jutsu went wrong and, well\u2026they think my Yin and Yang charka got separated, and it manifested into\u2026her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour WHAT?!\u201d said Sakura. \u201cHow could that happen? <i>Can</i> that even happen? I\u2019ve never heard of anything like that before. Are you kidding me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI,\u201d Ninata tried to get a word in, but Sakura pulled her hood down to get a look at her full head. She looked visibly shocked when she saw that it was a mirror match for Hinata\u2019s. Seemingly without even realizing it, she reached her hands forward and pinched Ninata\u2019s cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly cow, you really are her exact double! And you\u2019re real, flesh and blood! This is really weird!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCourse I\u2019m real!\u201d said Ninata indignantly. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked at her suspiciously, and Ninata was starting to think that maybe she shouldn\u2019t have said anything. Sakura was smart after all; if anyone could realize who Ninata really was, it was her.</span></div></div>",

Hinata\u2019s touch brought a warm smile and a slight blush to her face. \u201cBut you\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata\u2019s smile mirrored her double\u2019s. Even if the face before her was her own, the boy she always loved was still in there, and still able to bounce back as always. Ninata leaned forward and gave her a peck on the lips. With a blush spreading across her face, Hinata gave one of her own. Then the two gave each other a much deeper open-mouthed kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally caught herself, Hinata broke away, saying: \u201cWe, um, should get on to the store. S-somebody might see us.\u201d</span></div></div>",

And that caused her nipples to suddenly feel a lot more stiff and sensitive, which only made the way her boobs rubbed against her clothing even more awkward. And worse, it was making her feel even more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sensed something was amiss with her. \u201cNinata-chan, is something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said Ninata. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026still not used to a few things with this body.\u201d She had to stop herself from reaching for her bouncing boobs. \u201cI\u2026I can feel my\u2026my breasts rubbing against my shirt. And my nipples feel like they\u2019re frozen and even bigger than before, and I don\u2019t know how to stop it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed at how candid Ninata was being, but she was immediately sympathetic. She felt similar sensations when her breasts had started growing in. \u201cI\u2026suppose I could give you a bra. That m-might help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sure hope so,\u201d said Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed furiously, but nodded. She knew what to do. \u201cLet\u2019s go hide in that alley over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d asked Ninata as they made their way in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to give you my bra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d Ninata nearly coughed once she realized just what Hinata had meant. \u201cYou\u2019re giving me the one you\u2019re wearing right now?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I-I can handle it,\u201d the Hyuuga heiress said. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026I\u2019ve gone bra-less before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata didn\u2019t want to force Hinata into something so awkward, but before she could speak, Hinata had already reached up into her shirt, unclasped the undergarment, and slid down the straps until it was in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata had no choice but to pick it up once Hinata offered it to her. She could only hold the white garment out in front of her in wonder as her face turned red. \u201cUm\u2026I don\u2019t know how to\u2026put this on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, it was Hinata\u2019s turn to blush. \u201cI\u2026I see. Okay then, I\u2019ll help you. Take off your shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata looked at her with wide silver eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-take off your shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust\u2026do it real fast,\u201d said Hinata. \u201cSo no one sees us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Without much ado, Ninata pulled the hem of her shirt upward. Her generous breasts spilled out, as creamy and smooth as they always were, save for the rosy nipples that stood erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata couldn\u2019t hold back her smile. Ninata looked so cute being bashful, and she was delighted to see her breasts again. I could just look at them forever. But she would do no such thing\u2026not yet anyway. Right now, her girlfriend needed help. \u201cTurn around and spread your arms out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata complied. Hinata took her bra and pressed the cups right into Ninata\u2019s breasts, cupping them firmly with her graceful little fingers. Sure enough, they fit perfectly, as Ninata\u2019s boobs were exactly the same as her own. While she normally would have gone on from there, she couldn\u2019t help but give them a playful squeeze as well, which elicited a squeak from Ninata\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi-Hinata-chan,\u201d she gasped with surprise and just a little bit of enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry, sorry,\u201d Hinata giggled. \u201cCouldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d She was starting to feel aroused herself. Maybe once this little trip was over, she and Ninata could go for another round of lovemaking\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she couldn\u2019t think like that now. She needed to get her bra on Ninata quickly before somebody caught them. She wrapped the band around her girlfriend\u2019s torso, closed the clasp together, and pulled the straps over her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll done,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata took a few steps forward. And then jumped up and down. While her bosoms still held a generous bounce, the bra held them in place. It was\u2026an improvement. \u201cIt feels much better,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you, Hinata-chan! You\u2019re the best!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Ninata-chan,\u201d said Hinata with a shy smile. Despite the awkwardness of the situation, she felt really good. She made Ninata happy. She was called the best. And she got to look at and touch her boobs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the duo continued on to the store to buy food, now she had to deal with the fact she now had no bra to wear. And her own nipples were feeling awfully hard as well\u2026</span></div></div>",

The girls shopped at the grocer, ate a generous dinner that mostly consisted of cup ramen, packed a bunch of Ninata\u2019s things up for moving day, and went to bed. Ninata had been a little hesitant, as she wasn\u2019t sure her old pajamas would fit on her small frame anymore, and didn\u2019t know quite what else she was going to wear to bed. Hinata gave her an answer when she simply took off all of her own clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sleep naked,\u201d she said matter of factly. Ninata could only stare open-mouthed as Hinata walked completely bare to her bed, the firm mounds of her creamy butt jiggling oh-so-slightly with every step. She laid down on her side, giving her lover a complete, full-frontal view of herself. Creamy flesh, beautiful and heaving bosoms that just wouldn't stop rippling, and gentle curves that showed off a body that was well on its way to maturing into a lovely and graceful woman who still held within her a terrible strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight made Ninata\u2019s mouth water with anticipation. Since Hinata didn\u2019t have any qualms about sharing a bed in the nude, the girl who used to be Naruto supposed it was okay if she climbed in that way as well. Ninata eagerly took off her shirt and pants, which was easy as they already felt quite loose on her body, and threw them haphazardly away without any sense of grace. But when she was down to her bra she realized she had another problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Hinata-chan? A little help?\u201d she said with a sheepish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata only giggled as she sat up, knowing exactly what was troubling her twin. She leaned forward, pressing her nude form into Ninata, and wrapped her arms around her. She worked her fingers around the strap, undoing it in one fluid motion, and peeled the garment off one cup at a time to expose Ninata\u2019s bountiful breasts once more. Hinata couldn\u2019t help but smile lustfully at the sight of them. It was all she could do to not touch them with her hands, fondle them, squeeze them, and feel the generous mounds of girl flesh ripple into her palms and between her fingers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>(This chapter was originally written by FireDragon14)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an early morning in Konoha. So early that the sun was only just starting to peek over the horizon. One would think that everyone would still be sleeping peacefully in their beds and this would be true for most people. One young girl however was still awake in bed, staring at the tired but, peacefully dreaming face of her twin. Last night had been an amazing and enlightening escapade of horny teenage loving. The memories alone left a blush on the young Hinata's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had learned quite a bit about both herself and Ninata. The biggest thing being that as much as their bodies looked and seemed identical, there were small differences that even she hadn't noticed till she went over the memories afterwards. It only became apparent to her because of her, admittedly odd, fascination with Ninata's succulent rear end. She loved how responsive Ninata was when her butt was fondled but, oddly when Ninata did the same to her the response wasn't as great. Oh it was still there, yes. However, Ninata seemed more enraptured with her breasts and Hinata had to admit that her breasts had always been a weak spot for her. It was as if their bodies were made with the others interests in mind. Thing parts that one loved about the other caused the greatest response in that partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that their bodies were so identical yet, had near unnoticeable differences made Hinata think and wonder, 'What if our cover story has more truth to it then we first thought?' It some twisted sense. Hinata had felt an irresistible pull towards Ninata since she first meet her. It was just a feeling of wanting to be close. Hinata also felt this odd urge deep inside of herself that practically demanded intimate contact. With her Byakugan she had also seen that their chakra wasn't identical, yet when close it seemed to act like a magnet. One side was drawn to the other and vise versa. Now many might find this discovery worrying, but not her. She felt thrilled on some level as she knew this meant that no matter what they would want to always be together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as said that wasn't the only discovery she had made while they enjoyed each other. Ninata had at one point tried to use the 'Transformation Jutsu'. Her hope had been to appear as her old male self for a short time. Curious as to why her lover had thought she'd like a illusion Hinata questioned Ninata and had learned something truly amazing. Naruto's transformations had never been illusions! When Ninata had still been Naruto, all of his changes with the jutsu had been real physical changes; a TRUE transformation! Such a thing was thought impossible but, Naruto had done it on a daily basis. This also led to another idea in the darker parts of Hinata's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't mind that Naruto was now Ninata, nor did it bother her that Hinata was on a genetics level, her nearly perfect twin sister. In fact the only thing that bothered her at all now was that she would need to give up her dream of having a child with her love grow inside her womb and make her a mother. This knowledge of Naruto's transformations however, meant that if she could learn to recreate the effect, then she could still give birth to a child of their own. Though it would mean she would have to be the father as it appeared that any attempt to return to her male self simply left Ninata in her 'Sexy Jutsu' form, also know as Naruko. Oddly she was fine with that. The idea of one day impregnating Ninata with her child turned her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were problems with that dream however. Such as how much chakra a true transformation seemed to take. One full change had left Ninata horribly tired. Hinata however, theorized that it was from it being a full body change rather then just changing select parts. Another problem was that Hinata had little idea of how the male organ worked on a medical level. So if she ever wanted to try this she'd first need to do some studying on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gave a small sigh and mentally shook her head, clearing her thought up. Those sort of things could come later. Right now she was more worried about not enjoying her time snuggled up to her sexy girlfriend. Pulling the sleeping Ninata in a bit closer, Hinata placed a gentle kiss upon Ninata's forehead before letting herself relax. They still needed to pack all of the things that could connect Ninata to Naruto once they woke back up and would possibly have to destroy most of it. This would mean a loss of those large and bulky orange jumpsuits that Naruto use to wear. Hinata figured it would be a good idea to get Ninata some real clothes. 'Maybe something that is easy for me to remove,' she thought at the end with a perverted smile pulling at her lips. With that Hinata fell into a blissful sleep full of dreams of her and Ninata as they lived a happy life together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome hours later they both awaken and...</span></div></div>",

One moment, she had been on the beach with her girlfriend. The sun was shining, the sea was calming, and all was at peace. There was no Sound to war against, no stupid demon foxes to haunt her every step, or people that wanted her dead and gone. It was just her and Hinata, without a care in the world or a stitch of clothing. Why did this always have to happen? Couldn\u2019t Konoha just let her sleep in and enjoy some time with her Hinata-chan? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least it wasn\u2019t dark this time, which allowed for the boy-turned-girl to reach her door without banging into anything. She swung it open to glare at the intruders, who appeared to be Tsunade and several masked ninjas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaddaya\u2019 want?\u201d she asked grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering, the ninjas all exchanged nervous glances while Tsunade smacked her forehead. \u201cOh, for the love of-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot liking this, Ninata was about ready to give them the riot act, when she felt a breeze caress every inch of her skin once more. She looked down and blushed for the umpteenth time. She was naked. AGAIN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d she screamed covering herself with her hands. She regretted her outburst immediately once she heard the pitter-patter of Hinata\u2019s bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinata-chan, what is it?\u201d she cried, nakedly rushing outside the bedroom before her twin could say anything. \u201cI heard-\u201d then she saw the Hokage and her entourage standing at the doorway. \u201cNinataaaaaaa!\u201d she squealed half in embarrassment and half in annoyance as she covered herself up and retreated back to the bedroom. Ninata promptly followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, did we come at a bad time, Hokage?\u201d one of the ninjas asked. Tsunade couldn\u2019t answer. Her face was buried in her hands and she wasn\u2019t so sure if she wanted to punch someone\u2019s lights out or just burst out laughing at the whole thing. Two days in a row! Was the simple act of putting clothes on in the morning really that foreign a concept to those kids now?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis better not be a recurring thing,\u201d she muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata and Ninata came out fully dressed, but still as red as ever. Hinata was trying to desperately avoid eye contact with anyone, while Ninata looked a tad miffed, but was too flustered to flap her gums again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d said Tsunade, pulling her hands away and trying to bring some amount of dignity and professionalism back to the situation. \u201cI assume you both know why we are here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata looked like she wanted to bark some sarcastic retort, but the more polite Hinata spoke first. \u201cYou\u2019re here to pick up Ninata-chan\u2019s things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are,\u201d Tsunade said, referring to her entourage. \u201cI\u2019m here to escort you both to the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right,\u201d Ninata murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I <i>have</i> been eating my vegetables like I\u2019ve been told to, thank you very much, so you don\u2019t need to lecture me on good nutrition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what it was about-oh, forget it,\u201d said the Hokage. It wasn\u2019t even lunchtime, and she was already feeling the pangs of another headache.</span></div></div>",

Though I\u2019d probably consider getting a more flattering change of clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata would have liked to reduce him to a charred skeleton with the glare she shot in his direction. Unfortunately for her, being in Hinata\u2019s body, the effect ended up looking more adorable than outright menacing to everyone in the room, if the muffled chuckling of Jiraiya and Hinata was anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough,\u201d said Tsunade, rubbing her temple and trying to kill the smile that threatened to split her own face in two. \u201cIt\u2019s too early in the morning for all of this. Can we all be professionals for once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk, Granny,\u201d Ninata muttered. \"With all the cleavage you like to show off, sometimes I wonder if you gambled away all your shirts!\u201d If she looked anything like the little blond-haired brat, or at least spoke in his voice, Tsunade would not have hesitated to backhand him with her pinky finger. But since Ninata now looked and sounded just like the fragile little Hyuuga girl, she couldn\u2019t quite find it in herself to smack her around. Not yet anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeast you still got that smart mouth on you,\u201d said Jiraiya. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s just get this show on the road before somebody professionally kills somebody else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sages led the Hinata twins to a private examination room where no one would be able to hear them. Tsunade ran another check on the girls, just to compare their genes and see how Ninata\u2019s transformation was going. \u201cWell, for what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s progressed,\u201d she said in a resigned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Ninata. \u201cI already looked like Hinata yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did,\u201d said the Hokage. \u201cBut your change wasn\u2019t really complete. Many of your genes were still mutating to match those of Hinata\u2019s. So, to boil it down to simple terms, while you could say that you were 99.99% Hinata yesterday, today you\u2019re 99.999% her. Pretty much all the important parts were covered by the time you woke up yesterday. All that\u2019s been mutating since then are largely microscopic and vestigial parts. Admittedly, there do appear to be some specs of your genome that are largely unchanged from yesterday. But how long that will be the case remains to be seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata fidgeted. \u201cUm, what exactly is the nature of Ninata-chan\u2019s\u2026condition?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019m still trying to figure out,\u201d said Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I first heard the news,\u201d said Jiraiya in an oddly serious tone, \u201cI figured that maybe Naruto was under the effect of a very powerful jutsu. But now that I\u2019ve come to see the results, I can see that\u2019s not the case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust how is this any different from a regular jutsu?\u201d asked Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any traces of chakra involved,\u201d the old man explained. \u201cWhether a transformation is simply illusory, like the elementary one you learn in the academy, or genuine, which is exceedingly rare and more difficult to pull off, it always requires a constant flow of chakra to maintain. Putting you under the glass here, we can see that's not the case at all. Not to mention both types are pretty fickle and prone to fading when subjected to excessive force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if it was something like that, I would\u2019ve reverted when Granny dropped me on the floor yesterday. Or when Hinata-chan knocked me out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked away shamefully. \u201cUm, I\u2019m sorry about that. I, I just really thought\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata looked apologetically at her. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, stroking her arm affectionately. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. I probably would\u2019ve done the same if I was in your shoes.\u201d She flashed a wide toothy grin that was very reminiscent of the old Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Ninata gently spoke to Hinata belied a level of closeness Tsunade was not so sure the kid had ever showed to anyone. She needed to put a stamp on this right away, before it gave Jiraiya any ideas. \u201cIn short, Ninata, this is something completely new and unprecedented. Something has happened that\u2019s caused you to physically change on a genetic and molecular level, which goes beyond our level of understanding. I\u2019ve already told you this, but it's looking less and less likely that we'll be able to reverse what's happened to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Ninata. Oddly enough, she didn\u2019t seem despondent or disappointed this time. \u201cI figured I\u2019d be like this from now on. It just means I\u2019ll have to be the second Hokage woman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s one way of looking at it,\u201d said Tsunade, trying to hide her smile. At least Naruto\u2019s spirit was as strong as ever. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019ll still need to observe you. Hopefully, we can eventually understand how and why this happened before it strikes anyone else. If it does. So on that note, I\u2019ll need a few samples from both of you for comparison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next thirty minutes, the Hokage had taken blood samples, skin samples, and hair samples from each of the Hinata twins. \u201cWe may need to do this and run some tests on the two of you every couple of weeks or so, so make sure you have some free time in your calendars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that it?\u201d said Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor you, it is. We still need to discuss some things for Ninata in private.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded, and promptly left the room. Now it was just Ninata, Tsunade, and Jiraiya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, brat,\u201d said the old man. \u201cI understand that you\u2019re having trouble managing your chakra and performing jutsus. So we\u2019re going to have to examine your coils up close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill I be ever able to do jutsus again?\u201d asked Ninata eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d said Jiraiya. \u201cFirst, I\u2019m going to have to ask you to take off your clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d cried Ninata. \u201cNo way! I\u2019m not exposing myself to a pervert like you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKid, Tsunade and I need to do a full examination of the way chakra is being distributed around your body. And clothes kind of get in the way of that. Now, I suppose we could ask your girlfriend out there to look at them for us,\u201d at this, Ninata blushed in alarm, which triggered a raised eyebrow and a mischievous grin from the white-haired man. \u201cBut since we also need to take a close look at the seal for you-know-who, it might make things a little uncomfortable for all of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata was blushing furiously. \u201cBut, but,\u201d she stammered, before looking up at Tsunade for support. \u201cGranny\u2026uh, I mean Hokage-sama\u2026you\u2019re not just going to stand there and let him leer at me, are you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed. \u201cSorry, Ninata, but for once he\u2019s correct. I'm a medic and he's an expert on seals. We both need to give you a thorough medical examination to see what exactly the problems are. If we don\u2019t, then you may never be able to use advanced jutsus ever again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was Naruto, she expected to see him pout, cross his arms, and sulk like an angry little child. But in the body of Hinata, she instead just seemed to stare down at the floor with a red face that looked conflicted while a steady murmur left her lips. Tsunade would be lying if she said she didn\u2019t sympathize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya sighed in what seemed to be a rare case of understanding. For a moment, it seemed like the foppish dirty old man had disappeared. \u201cWhatever you think of me, kid, I\u2019m doing this for your own good. I\u2019m not here to ogle you. Yes, I enjoy the mystical, wily ways of the fairer sex, as you know\u2026but I\u2019m no molester. I\u2019m just here to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Ninata huffed, and she went through the painstaking process of removing her clothing again. She stripped down to her underwear, which consisted of a pair of her old boyish boxers and the bra Hinata had lent her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you\u2019re already adjusting,\u201d Jiraiya said with a chuckle. \"You could use some more ladylike underwear, but at least you're giving your new girls some support.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just can\u2019t get used to them bouncing around!\u201d Ninata shouted, before clamping a hand on her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep talking, brat,\u201d said Jiraiya. \u201cYou do a good job embarrassing yourself more than I ever could.\u201d The amused grin on his face disappeared as he examined Ninata\u2019s body. \u201cTry molding some chakra. You don\u2019t need to do anything in particular with it, just mold it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata complied. She molded as much chakra as she could muster. She gathered it in her stomach, feeling it condense somewhat like a ball, which was a pretty elemental exercise. However, after maintaining it for only a few seconds, she felt the energy suddenly dissipate as a wave of exhaustion came over her. The Hinata look-alike nearly doubled over and fell to her knees, panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026wrong\u2026with me?\u201d she gasped.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After lifting Ninata onto the examination table, Tsunade checked around her body, pressing her fingers onto the young girl\u2019s forehead, shoulders, and abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say the big issue is that you\u2019re still handling your chakra as if you were still Naruto,\u201d she said. \u201cBack when you were a boy, you had an excessive amount of chakra at your disposal, which gave you plenty to work with and throw around without much thought. But now, you have a more average stock on hand, likely similar to what Hinata has. You have less to work with, and the amounts you\u2019re typically used to handling are impeding your abilities and tiring you out fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay,\" said Ninata, rubbing her head. \u201cSo what do I have to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in short, you have to improve your chakra control. Learn to conserve and be as efficient with it as possible. Or in other words, treat it like just about all ninjas have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata\u2019s face dropped in gloom. \u201cAw, I\u2019ve never been good at that stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, kid, it might not be so bad,\u201d said Jiraiya. \u201cNormally, it would probably be prudent to send you back to the academy so you could learn the basics for real this time. But you now have something that could accelerate your progress by leaps and bounds: the Byakugan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe funky Hyuuga eyes?\u201d Ninata said, perking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You\u2019ll have to ask your friend outside for the details, but from what I understand, they can see all things related to chakra, as well as give you a direct look at your own coils. That is, in fact, the basis of the Hyuuga clan\u2019s fighting style. If you\u2019re having a hard time controlling your chakra just on feeling alone, then maybe looking at it while you're pumping it through your system will help. See when you're using too much or too little. In a way, a Hyuuga is probably the best kind of person you could have changed into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d said Ninata excitedly. \u201cSo I just use the Byakugan, improve my chakra control, and I can get back on the road to becoming Hokage!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite,\u201d said Tsunade. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about your chakra control that needs work. You\u2019ll also have to refine your fighting style. Even if you can perfect your control, your old tricks won\u2019t be viable anymore. You can't really throw shadow clones around like you used to, until you can at least build up your chakra reserves again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata sulked, letting out a disappointed groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, kid,\u201d said Jiraiya. \u201c It's chakra-intensive for you now. You\u2019re just going to have to save your favorite move for more desperate situations. Which brings us to possibly the other issue, that, if addressed, might be able to mitigate it somewhat. Namely the way the Kyubi's seal appears to be acting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nearly panicked. \u201cIs the fox is getting out?\u201d she said in hushed whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, kid, the fox isn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d said Jiraiya. \u201cThe issue is that the seal is now misaligned with your new feminine coils.\u201d He took a moment to chuckle at how lewd that sounded, earning him a dirty look from both Ninata and Tsunade. Hey, he couldn\u2019t help it. It sounded naughty. \u201cAnyway, that makes it impossible for you to borrow its chakra as usual, and if left untended, it may impede the flow of chakra throughout your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do I have to do about that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll we need to do is\u2026redraw it a little,\u201d said Jiraiya. He suddenly took hold of Ninata\u2019s shoulder with an iron-like grip. \u201cHold still, brat. This may\u2026oh, who am I kidding? This will hurt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d But before Ninata could react or even brace herself, the toad sage slammed his palm right into her abdomen. The wind immediately flew out of her lungs, but rather than roll backwards as she expected, she stayed in place, seemingly glued to Jiraiya\u2019s hand as chakra sparked and wove its way through her. Finally, after a few seconds that honestly felt like an eternity, it ended, and the boy-turned-girl slumped down onto the examination table like a rag doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026bastard,\u201d she panted. \u201cWhen I\u2026get up\u2026I\u2019m gonna\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya huffed. \"That's gratitude for you. I was honestly hoping that turning into that Hyuuga girl would have made you respect your elders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata pushed herself up, glaring daggers at the old man. \u201cWhat did that do? I don\u2019t feel any improvement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t, dummy\u201d said the old pervert. \u201cYou\u2019ve only lived your whole life with the seal giving you access to the Kyubi's chakra. I've just brought things back to normal for you. Now that this seal has been adjusted to match your new body,\u201d he said, tapping Ninata\u2019s bare stomach, much to the girl\u2019s chagrin, \u201cyou should be able to tap into it again. Just in case you get into serious trouble of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Tsunade with a sense of satisfaction. \u201cI think we\u2019ve done all we can right now. My men should be almost done moving your stuff to your new place, so you're free to go for the time being.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata nearly fainted when she heard Ninata say that, though she was able to catch herself. It would have been very embarrassing and silly if she had too, especially since she spent the past two nights in the arms of her lover completely naked. Even so, she never once imagined that Naruto, in whatever form he came in, would ask her out. She always dreamed of it though. But then, everything concerning \u201chim\u201d had been turning upside-down lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor that matter, the born Hyuuga didn\u2019t think her double would be ready to go get some new clothes so soon. Her understanding of boys was that nothing drove them into a terrored frenzy more than the prospect of being forced to buy clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, while she may not have hated it like most boys supposedly did, Hinata wasn\u2019t really one for clothes shopping either. She was not a fashion-conscious girl like her peers had been. She didn\u2019t put on flashy and colorful dresses like Sakura, and she never bothered dressing in anything that showed off her\u2026assets before. While she was no stranger to the fancy kimono or occasional yukata, she typically only wore those for special situations, like traditional Hyuuga gatherings or village-wide festivals. Hinata\u2019s casual wardrobe consisted mostly of plain-colored and practical clothes. She never stood out in them, but they kept her mobile, ready to fight at a moment\u2019s notice, and made sure her\u2026assets wouldn\u2019t bounce around so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that didn\u2019t need to be the case for her girlfriend. While Hinata would help Ninata find plenty of practical clothes that would keep her in fighting shape when she finally got to resume her ninja career, she was starting to find herself looking forward to dressing her up into something more provocative than either of them were used to. Like slinky dresses that would show off her legs or her cleavage (or both), with spaghetti straps that could be slipped off with a small flick of her finger. Dolling Ninata up in perhaps a more traditional kimono could be appealing too, and Hinata had to wipe away the trickle of drool that was creeping out of the corner of her mouth. And then there would be underwear; lots and lots sexy underwear. Lacy bras, silken panties, garter belts, stockings, and thongs that would show off the shapely globes of her rump and leave them completely bare\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Hinata? Are you still there?\u201d said Ninata, waving her hand in front of Hinata\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Hinata squeaked, getting out of her reverie, but unable to keep the perverse little grin from fading away. \u201cI\u2019d love to help you get new clothes. And go on a date with you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata blinked. Huh, it looked like Hinata hadn\u2019t fainted as she feared. That was something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question remaining was, where would they go first?</span></div></div>",

While a Hyuuga was certainly not too unusual to see in Konoha, seeing what appeared to be two that looked exactly the same most definitely was. It was a bit disconcerting for Ninata, but she had to admit, it was an improvement over what she usually dealt with back when she was Naruto. The looks people shot her weren\u2019t angry or spiteful, just a bit shocked and curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped off first at a store that typically sold ninja wares and accessories for field work. It had things like belts, pouches for kunai, backpacks, camouflage clothing, protective armor, and generally durable clothes that suited the outdoors. Hinata would have liked to start by getting Ninata some sexy clothing, but she knew she had to get her priorities straight. Ninata needed something functional to wear while she trained. The fun stuff could come later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the Hyuuga\u2019s silver eyes caught sight of the section of meshed clothes, she realized form and function didn\u2019t always have to be mutually exclusive. She tugged on her twin\u2019s arm to pull her closer to the alluring garbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, you think these will be good?\u201d Ninata asked, looking at them a little hesitantly. They were designed to absorb strikes from blunt attacks as well as thrown kunai and shuriken without hindering a shinobi\u2019s mobility. They were also often tight and form-fitting, which made wearing more conventional clothes over them a possibility. That didn\u2019t stop some of the more\u2026gifted kunoichi from just wearing the mesh with little to nothing on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hinata as she started to grab several of the garbs, smiling widely all the way. To Ninata, it just seemed to be the same shy smile the Hyuuga often wore, but it belied the sense of devilish mischief the blunette was really feeling. \u201cLet\u2019s see how these fit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dragged them both into a fitting room in the back where she began the process of slipping off Ninata\u2019s old boyish clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata was really confused by this. She could have sworn that changing in these rooms was supposed to be private. But then, she supposed Hinata just wanted to help. The former boy did need help putting on a bra, after all. Maybe there was some special process to dressing in mesh as well, though Ninata couldn\u2019t imagine what it was. And besides, it\u2019s not like there was any real reason to act shy. Hinata had already seen her naked plenty of times now. So she said nothing as the born-Hyuuga girl pulled the shirt past her shoulders and unhooked the bra from her back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the air hit her breasts hard as they tumbled out freely. While they were becoming a common sight for Ninata, it was still a foreign feeling to have them out and about like this. Hell, the fact that she even had breasts now was still boggling her mind. This was also the second time they had been exposed outside her home, which just made things feel even naughtier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh-oh. There was a sudden stiffening sensation now on both of her mounds. Her nipples had gone hard just by a mere thought. <i>Bad Ninata! Stop thinking dirty thoughts in public!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Hinata seemed to catch onto what was going on when she took the opportunity to grab both boobs and squeeze them tightly. \u201cNot here, Ninata,\u201d she playfully scolded. \u201cPeople might hear us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata was blushing furiously now. \u201cI-I d-didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d She didn\u2019t want her double to know just how much this was turning her on, but she knew her efforts were in vain. Her feminine body was betraying her and the telltale signs of arousal were building up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but if you insist,\u201d Hinata whispered, massaging her lover\u2019s breasts some more and kissing her way down Ninata\u2019s neck. All of a sudden, she dropped down to her knees and in one swift motion, yanked Ninata\u2019s bottoms down, pants, boxers, and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what are you doing?\u201d said Ninata as Hinata fussed with the clothes some more, silently urging her lover to step out of them. She did so without further protest, leaving herself completely naked, but no less confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m doing?\u201d said Hinata as she rose up, looking Ninata in the eye with a husky expression and wrapping her arms around her, with one stroking the curves of her bare back, and the other roaming down to her butt, giving the soft flesh a nice sumptuous squeeze. Ninata just about jumped at her double\u2019s touch and emitted a startled squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn\u2019t, though Ninata as she fought to keep her heat down. <i>Not here of all places. Not</i> Hinata <i>of all people!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m getting you ready to try your new clothes!\u201d Hinata chirped, her expression suddenly snapping into a more innocent looking smile. She then pulled away and turned back to the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata didn\u2019t know whether she should be relieved or disappointed. While she wasn\u2019t so sure she was ready to have\u2026an intimate encounter with her girlfriend in such a public place, now she had to contend with the fact that she was naked, feeling really horny right now, and likely wouldn\u2019t get any time to relieve herself anytime soon. <i>Hinata you play dirty!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata rose up with a mesh shirt in hand. \u201cLet\u2019s see how this fits on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Ninata, shouldn\u2019t I have a\u2026bra on for that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t need it. These kind of clothes are made for keeping us supported. Provided they\u2019re the right size.\u201d She kept her smile, but a small blush did creep across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, okay. If you say so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made no further argument as Hinata slipped the garment onto her. It stretched easily across her breasts, down her stomach, and clung tightly to her like a second skin. It still felt odd feeling her nipples poking into it. She just hoped they weren\u2019t noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Ninata was impressed by how well it fit onto her frame. Back when she was a boy, the few times she went clothes shopping, she had to try several things on at once before she got something right. \u201cWow, Hinata! How did you know this would fit me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata giggled. \u201cWe do have the same bodies, Ninata-chan. Whatever I know fits me fits you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right,\u201d Ninata said, giggling herself. She hoped the shared laugh would cool her down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Hinata pulled out a pair of mesh leggings. \u201cI take it I\u2019m not supposed to wear anything under that either?\u201d the boy-turned-girl asked, feeling her arousal pick up again. <i>Damn it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as necessary.\u201d But when she glanced at the boxers on the floor, she added: \u201cBut those just won\u2019t do at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, Hinata pushed her twin onto a sitting position on the bench before she got down onto her knees with the pants on hand. Her position put her nearly at eye-level with Ninata\u2019s bare vagina, where she could already detect the telltale signs of sexual wanting without the need of her Byakugan. Once again, the born-Hyuuga was feeling tempted to tease her lover again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted one of Ninata\u2019s feet up to make slipping on the mesh pants easier. The effect also caused her legs to spread just a little more, which in turn caused those lower lips to part even more slightly. She pulled the pant leg over Ninata\u2019s foot until it was secure, before doing the same to the other, so that the pants were now hanging off her. But not once did Hinata\u2019s eyes ever leave her lover\u2019s crotch, the perfect slit that it formed, or the hint of pink that was just starting to peak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was on autopilot as she rose each pant leg up Ninata\u2019s smooth and creamy thighs. As she did so, she moved her face closer and closer to her lover\u2019s beckoning sex. When the pants were hiked up as far as they could go, she had pulled her face so close to it that she could nearly lick it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Ninata was equal parts confused, alarmed, and horny. She thought it was odd that Hinata insisted that she put on the leggings on for her, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. It felt\u2026both kind of nice and kind of hot to have the normally shy blunette dress her up like this. But as the girl seemed to move her head more and more between her legs, Ninata knew something was definitely up. She may have been unfamiliar with how women put some of their clothes on, but she was quite certain this was not part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she felt it, warm, wet, and boneless. Hinata\u2019s tongue was stroking the left side of her\u2026the side left of her slit. It was light, gentle, and delicate, like she imagined how a sumi-e painter would put his brush to canvas. But it did little to calm her nerves, which had kicked into high gear now. She kept looking around nervously, fearful that someone might come in and see the two of them in the act. As Hinata\u2019s tongue strokes edged closer to her lips, Ninata had to clasp a hand on her lips to muffle any moans that might come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of all, she really wanted to tell Hinata to stop, that they really couldn\u2019t be doing this right here. But it felt soooooooo good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Hinata stopped, and pulled her tongue back. Ninata nearly sighed in relief. It looked like she was going to be given a break\u2026and then she could feel Hinata begin to lap up her other side!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nearly felt herself contort. <i>Damn it, Hinata! Y-you\u2019re gonna, you\u2019re gonna\u2019 get us in trouble. If you\u2026if you don\u2019t stop, I-I\u2019m gonna\u2026I\u2019m gonna-!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLick by lick, Hinata\u2019s tongue danced closer to her twin\u2019s vagina, which was really starting to feel damp at this point. Ninata shut her eyes, knowing full well what was about to come. She waited\u2026and waited\u2026and waited\u2026until she felt-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thankfully, the rest of the time spent in the store had gone by a bit more normally. When she had finished trying on the mesh clothes, Hinata then fetch some more conventional clothes, like coats, vests, shorts, and other things that would make Ninata look more respectable when out in the field, though still alluring to Hinata\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata currently had a full mesh \u201cundersuit\u201d on, with a shirt that would have otherwise left her stomach exposed and a pair of pants that didn\u2019t extend past her knees. Over it, she wore a grey vest that was zipped up at the front and had plenty of pockets for carrying various essentials, as well as a matching pair of shorts that covered the mesh underneath. In short, she managed to look capable and feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata silently bemoaned the fact that they didn\u2019t have anything that came in orange. Just a bunch of various greens, blues, grays, browns, and blacks. But still, despite not having anything in her favorite color, the new garbs felt comfortable. It felt nice for once to have something on that fit her like a glove, and she was starting to understand why some women, like that creepy Anko lady, often wore these meshed items. She could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow if only her feelings of sexual hunger would just go away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Hinata-chan?\u201d Ninata asked as she followed Hinata through the streets, struggling to keep the bags of clothing in her grip. \u201cOur house isn\u2019t this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Hinata. \u201cWe need to get you some more clothes first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we just got clothes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean casual clothes. You can\u2019t always be dressed for a mission, Ninata-chan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? Ninja should always be prepared! Like what if Orochimaru launches another attack? I can\u2019t just fight him and the Sound in a strapless dress!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone needs clothes for different occasions,\u201d said Hinata as she desperately tried to keep that sexy and distracting image out of her head. \u201cEven a Hokage needs to wear her ceremonial robes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s true but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd sometimes, it\u2019s important to wear a disguise. So that nobody knows you\u2019re a ninja.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata sighed. \u201cOkay, okay. That\u2019s true too. But I\u2019m not-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd,\u201d said Hinata pulling herself a little closer so that she could whisper into her double\u2019s ear, \u201cI want you to look good for our date tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata blushed. Oh, right, the date that she promised. From what she had seen, people did like to look nice for their dates, so she supposed she couldn\u2019t argue with Hinata about that. She didn\u2019t want to disappoint her after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Hinata added, her voice dropping down to an even lower whisper as she looked cautiously around her. \u201cWe still need to get you underwear as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nearly tripped on a rock. Oh yeah. There was that too. Of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stepped into boutique that specialized in selling civilian clothes for women. Hinata wasted no time examining the various dresses, skirts, tights, trousers, and blouses. Ninata didn\u2019t know a thing about women\u2019s fashion, so she took this as a rare opportunity to keep quiet and let her girlfriend do the rest. Though whenever Hinata found something she liked, she would toss it into Ninata\u2019s arms. Holding the growing pile of clothes on top of the bags of ninja garbs was quickly becoming a tiresome affair. Worse, the pile was getting so tall that Ninata was having a hard time seeing ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sure would be nice to know how to use the Byakugan right now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they stopped off in the fitting room. Ninata was relieved to finally drop all the stuff down. Her arms were getting really tired. Honestly, she must have been holding more clothes for the past five minutes than she ever owned in her entire life. Knowing what was coming up, she began the laborious process of removing her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata drank in the sight with a small wistful sigh. Her Ninata-chan was a lovely sight. The creamy skin that felt like silk in her hands, the firm taught muscles that quivered and stiffened in her grasp, the delicate-looking nape of her neck that demanded attention, the lustrous mounds of pliable female flesh on her chest and bottom that jiggled and trembled with every slight movement\u2026for most anyone who liked girls, it had to be an alluring sight\u2026and then Hinata would have to remind herself that this was exactly how she looked, and that Ninata most likely thought the same things she did whenever she looked at her as in turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ninata-chan\u2026I\u2019d keep you naked forever if I could.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026Hinata? As\u2026as much as I l-like the atten\u2026attention, I-I think we should get to the clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata suddenly realized what she was doing; she was hugging Ninata tightly from behind, molding her whole clothed body into her twin\u2019s nude form, nuzzling her neck lovingly, and rubbing her hands along Ninata\u2019s bare stomach. One had been traveling upward straight to her double\u2019s breasts, while the other was going a little lower. And despite Ninata\u2019s protests, the former boy was still leaning into her form, soaking it in, taking deep breaths of anticipation, and warming up all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata jumped back. She had done that without even realizing it! She had never been this lustful or perverted before, not while Ninata was Naruto. Sure, she always had her fantasies, and she was not above\u2026satisfying herself whenever she could. But ever since Naruto underwent this change, she was becoming more and more forward. And for the first time since it all began, she was starting to realize that. It was somewhat frightening how fast it was happening\u2026but then, wasn\u2019t this what she always wanted? To finally be able to change and become a brave, strong ninja in her own right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, this is what I\u2019ve always wanted. And now that I\u2019ve started, I can\u2019t go back.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelving her shame, the Hyuuga looked over at the pile of garments that she had carried in herself. The ones that she had saved for last. The ones that caused her mouth to break into yet another mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ninata-chan. But you\u2019re right. We should get started. With this.\u201d Ninata turned around and her silver eyes widened as she saw her double hold up a delicious pair of lacy black panties in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one thought could run through the naked Ninata\u2019s head. <i>Here we go again.</i> She just hoped she would be able to get through this fitting routine with some amount of dignity intact. But as her loins tingled and her nipples hardened, she realized that was only going to become a more and more remote possibility.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They walked the streets of Konoha in a somewhat uneasy silence, carrying Ninata\u2019s new wardrobe. The girl who used to be Naruto was looking quite flustered in particular. \u201cYou realize that we probably won\u2019t be able to show our faces in there again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was blushing too. \u201cUm\u2026I\u2019m sorry Ninata-chan. I guess I got a little carried away. I didn\u2019t know you would have\u2026that strong a reaction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t hold it in!\u201d Ninata nearly wailed before clamping a hand on her mouth just in case anyone heard. \u201cYou drove me absolutely crazy in the ninja store. And then when you started\u2026doing that in the other place, it was too much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, um,\u201d Hinata replied, doing her best to press fingers together as always did, while holding the bags. \u201cI\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t notice anything. That perfume I bought was really strong. It had to have masked the smell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey probably know. Everyone does. I bet the cashier heard everything,\u201d Ninata whimpered, looking sadly down at a bag of her new clothes. \u201cI just got these and already most of them need to be washed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued on until they reached their new home. Ninata didn\u2019t know quite what to feel about that. Sure, her old apartment wasn\u2019t the most prime piece of real estate in the village, but it had provided the roof over her head (his head?) for as long as she could remember. It was familiar and comfortable. How would her new place be? Would it be better? Worse? Would it have a safer neighborhood? Would the roof leak on them? Would the fridge light actually turn on? Did they even have a fridge? Did it come with a washing machine where she could wash the\u2026girl juice off her new clothes, or would she have to continue going to the laundromat? She didn\u2019t know what kind of strings Tsunade had to pull to secure this new place on short notice, but she sure hoped the Hokage hadn\u2019t gone too cheap on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to feel a little hopeful as they neared the complex. The neighborhood didn\u2019t seem too bad. It wasn\u2019t upscale or anything, but it certainly did feel a bit more clean than her old place. She just hoped there were some ramen shops nearby. Not that Ninata would ever give up on Icharaku\u2019s of course, but since it was now farther away, it would be nice to have a place where she could run out and grab a quick bite to eat quickly and on short notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t much to say about the apartment complex from the outside. It seemed to be a little smaller than Ninata\u2019s old place, only two stories tall, and it appeared that she would now be living on the ground floor. She was a little disappointed by that. High places were fun after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, when the two girls entered the apartment, she could already see that was small potatoes. The place was definitely bigger and more spacious, good enough for two growing girls. It was a bit more old-fashioned, looking much like the Hyuuga compound\u2019s interior, with tatami flooring and sliding doors, but that had its charms. Ninata thought she could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, Tsunade had delivered on her promise to move all of Ninata\u2019s stuff here. There were boxes of her old stuff all piled up, as well as some pieces of furniture, like the table and chairs from her old kitchenette. Though Ninata couldn\u2019t help but scowl at the realization that they hadn\u2019t brought her bed along. Okay, sure, it came with the old apartment so it technically belonged to the landlord there, but still!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Ninata-chan, there are futons in the closet.\u201d Hinata had noted her twin\u2019s concern and slid open a door to reveal the soft mattresses and quilts that would serve as their new beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Well okay.\u201d Ninata didn\u2019t know what to think about that. As a ninja, she wasn\u2019t so fussy about where and how she slept, but she had been enjoying her nightly activities with Hinata-chan. She just hoped they could still enjoy them this way. Otherwise, she might have to get a new bed\u2026and she wasn\u2019t so sure she was ready to see Gama-chan get so emaciated after buying one. This latest shopping trip had already thinned out her poor little froggy wallet considerably, even though Hinata had agreed to pay for half of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, looks like this is going to be our new home then,\u201d said Ninata. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d said Hinata with a small smile. \u201cI think we could get used to this.\u201d She gave Ninata a small hug and a peck on the lips. Ninata blushed, wondering if Hinata was about to get amorous again, or if she was expecting a return for the \u201cfavor\u201d she had recently given the former boy right now. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get my own clothes, as well as get changed. See you in an hour?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d said Ninata, not knowing if she should be relieved or disappointed. \u201cSee you soon, Hinata-chan.\u201d And she went and returned her own kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata departed, Ninata took a look at the bags of her new clothes. Well, if there was one thing that the\u2026wild rendezvous in the dressing room had yielded, it\u2019s that it would make it easier for her to decide what things to wear for her date tonight. She would just have to pick something that was clean.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ninata decided to try on the black dress. It was as tight a fit as it looked, and its dark fabric clashed strongly with her pale skin, which shined brilliantly through the slits cut into the sides. It felt very odd to be on her. Not in an unpleasant way, but she honestly didn\u2019t feel like she was wearing anything at all. And if something happened to either of these straps on her shoulders\u2026she didn\u2019t want to think about it. It would be very embarrassing, especially since it didn\u2019t seem like a bra would go well with it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she tried the heels. They were much less comfortable and felt like a bit of a squeeze for her dainty feet. It\u2019s not that they were too small, it\u2019s that her feet weren\u2019t used to being encased in anything like them. Worse, they screwed up the way she could walk. Ninata had to spend a long time, had to be at least 30 minutes, just walking around experimentally. Turned out her usual gait just wouldn\u2019t work with high heels on. Her steps had to be lighter, her stride had to be shorter, and her feet had to lightly hit the ground heel first. She couldn\u2019t even run properly in these things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, why would anyone ever want to wear these?\u201d she said. Their only saving grace was that they helped Ninata feel a little taller than usual. It sucked to be the shortest kid in class, and while she knew her new Hinata-esque body was taller, it was only by a couple of centimeters. She supposed being a little bit bigger had to count for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, taking a close look at her high heels, Ninata couldn\u2019t help but get a few interesting ideas out of them. \u201cI bet if I sharpened them, then I could throw them at people and take out someone\u2019s eye. No one would ever see it coming!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a brilliant idea. She\u2019d have to write that down later and maybe get a few more heels that she could properly weaponize. <i>Watch out, bad guys! Uzumaki Ninata the high heel killer is on the loose!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr would it be Hyuuga Ninata?\u201d she asked herself. She supposed it would; she couldn\u2019t really call herself Uzumaki anymore. Damn it, this whole change-into-Hinata business could get really confusing at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well. Now that she was properly dressed in something fancy and had familiarized herself with the heels, all that was left to do was wait for Hinata to return.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She didn\u2019t have to wait long. Hinata had arrived in a few short minutes, carrying a few suitcases that likely contained some of her belongings. When she set them down on the floor, Ninata got a look at how she had made herself up. She was wearing a blue dress that matched the color of her hair. The skirt was long in the back, easily extending down to her ankles, but notably shorter at the front to show off her creamy legs. It was strapless, leaving her shoulders bare, but was still low enough to present an ample amount of cleavage. To top it all off, Hinata\u2019s lips were fuller and glossier than usual, a sign that she had applied makeup. The effect made her look older, more daring, and even more alluring<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that betrayed the effect was the furious blush on her face. She was clearly not used to going out in public like this much. Not that Ninata minded; she looked too adorable for words. Adorable and sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look good, Hinata-chan,\u201d she said, stepping close and hoping her words would at least put the ailing Hyuuga at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to work, as Hinata\u2019s flustered frown smoothly turned into a smile. \u201cTh-thank you, Ninata-chan. I like your choice of dress t-too.\u201d At this wrapped her arms around Ninata and ran her hands along her double\u2019s back, tracing the edges where the fabric was cut to expose her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Ninata\u2019s turn to blush. She was feeling equally odd in her own dress. She had never done anything like this before, for obvious reasons, and had no idea how she looked in this thing, or if it was even appropriate. But Hinata had chosen it for her and the born-Hyuuga was definitely enjoying it, so she supposed it would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two locked their hands together and took a deep breath. They each exchanged a shy smile to one another and stepped out into the evening air. It was a shock to both of them to feel the breeze blow onto their exposed skin, and to be out and about in Konoha looking all dolled up as they were, but neither were willing to let a little awkwardness get in the way of a romantic outing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can\u2019t believe it, thought Hinata excitedly. <i>My very first date with Ninata-chan! I never thought I\u2019d ever get to experience this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ninata\u2019s thoughts were running a mile a minute. <i>My first date with a girl\u2026damn it, I don\u2019t know what to do! Man, now I wish I read more of those kissy-kissy romance stories I never liked. I sure hope I don\u2019t screw this up.</i> But when she glanced at Hinata, and saw how happy she looked, she felt a surge of her old confidence spark up. <i>I <b>won\u2019t</b> screw this up! I\u2019m Uzumaki, er, Hyuuga Ninata! And I\u2019ll be the best dater ever!</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately, only a few steps out the door, Ninata realized that she would have a long road ahead of her on that front. Her foot somehow got lodged in the grass, but her body hadn\u2019t quite realized that yet. Before she knew it, she was falling face-first to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, a flash of dark blue indicated that Hinata was quick to the catch. Ninata didn\u2019t have to fall far, and her landing was much notably softer than it could have been. For two very good reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mmm, Hinata-chan feels so much better than I recall</i>, Ninata thought with a relieved smile. <i>She\u2019s so strong and gentle and dependable and warm and\u2026and\u2026uh-oh.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up into Hinata\u2019s concerned eyes from her position right between the Hyuuga\u2019s soft, supple breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinata-chan? Are you okay?\u201d she asked, not really noticing the predicament they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I\u2019m fine!\u201d Ninata said, jumping back to a standing position. Her cheeks were red, as if they had been burned by the contact with Hinata\u2019s lovely lady mounds, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel a pang of disappointment to leave them so soon. \u201cJust, um, still getting used to walking around in these things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata trailed down Ninata\u2019s form to her feet on the ground. She couldn\u2019t help but giggle at the sight. \u201cHm, hm, Ninata-chan, your heel sunk in the grass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the trip went by uneventfully. Hinata had coached Ninata on the fine art of walking in high heels over different terrains every step of the way. While the boy-turned-girl was thankful for it, she was already forming plans on how to deal with the accursed things in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When I become Hokage, I\u2019m going to outlaw all high heels in the Land of Fire. No woman will be forced to wear them again, and I\u2019ll be treated as a hero! Yes, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata let Hinata lead the way. They eventually settled at a restaurant called Akinara\u2019s, a relatively upscale-looking place that had all the workings of playing the romantic angle: dim candlelight, soft traditional music in the background, and a faint smell of tea leaves throughout and sake in the back. It was the type of establishment that would think itself too rich for Naruto\u2019s business. Back when she was younger and male, Ninata had been tossed out of places like this regularly, even when he clearly had money to pay for food. While it probably would have been odd to let an unattended kid eat in alone, they didn\u2019t have to be such jerks about it. Of course, that had all happened before Naruto had ever learned of the damn demon fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata shook her head. That was all in the past. She couldn\u2019t let bitterness cloud her mind, right when she was trying to have a nice time with her new girlfriend. Besides, the people here didn\u2019t seem to mind her presence. Like most everyone else in Konoha so far, they just looked more surprised and confused at her than anything. Though she didn\u2019t know if it was the presence of the identical Hyuuga twins, the way they held their hands, or how pretty they both looked. Ninata had to blush at that last thought, as well as constantly check to see if her dress was still covering her. Ever since she put this slinky thing on, she had been worried that it might slip off and she wouldn\u2019t notice until it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tug on her arm interrupted brought her back to reality. \u201cOur table\u2019s ready,\u201d said Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took their seats and placed their orders. While waiting for the food to arrive, Ninata couldn\u2019t help but feel a little fidgety. It was nice to take some time to relax after such an eventful (and arousing) day but she still didn\u2019t know quite what to make of this situation. Sitting in a fancy restaurant and being treated with respect was one thing, and being on a date was another. Right now, neither she nor Hinata had anything to do but sip their water and look at once another. She felt like she should do something to kill the time, but what could that possibly be? Could she try talking? What could Hinata possibly want to talk about? She had never felt closer to the lavender-eyed beauty that she had turned into, but there was still plenty more to learn about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny\u2026back when Ninata was Naruto, he had been trying so hard to get Sakura to go out on a date with him. But now that she thought about it, she had no idea what exactly he could have done if the pinkette had ever said \u201cyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong, Ninata-chan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata snapped her gaze back to Hinata, who was looking at her with concern in her eyes. \u201cUm, n-no, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said, putting her index fingers together in a very Hinata-esque manner. Hinata didn\u2019t look convinced. Ninata sighed, slumping her shoulders in defeat. \u201cOkay, okay. I just never did anything like this before, alright? And I know, I just know I\u2019ll probably scr-ah, make a mistake somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hinata only giggled. <i>Ninata-chan\u2019s so cute when she\u2019s nervous</i>, she thought inwardly. Outwardly, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ninata-chan. I\u2026don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing here either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata continued to laugh quietly, her twin was finding it hard to keep her own amusement bottled up. Before she knew it, she was about ready to let out a loud guffaw that would have echoed across Akinara\u2019s. Luckily, she placed a hand over her mouth, muffling it to a far more ladylike chuckle. <i>I really am just taking this too seriously.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they finished up and the tension died down, a small question began to nag at the back of Ninata\u2019s mind. \u201cSo, Hinata-chan\u2026you\u2026had feelings for me for a long time, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught Hinata off guard. The alarmed expression on her face looked much like the one Naruto had seen her put on seconds before she would bolt from his presence. \u201cUm, well, I\u2026yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow come\u2026you never told me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a simple question, the answer of which Ninata was merely curious about. But when Hinata broke eye contact with her and looked to the side guiltily, the former boy felt alarmed. Ever since she had undergone this transformation, Hinata had been oddly chipper and full of confidence in herself. And when she wasn\u2019t that, she was very\u2026sultry. But now, she was looking like her old self: deflated, unsure, and sad. Ninata didn\u2019t want that. She didn\u2019t want to see her twin and her lover looking like this. And she didn\u2019t want to be the one to hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could usher out an apology, Hinata said: \u201cI\u2026didn\u2019t think you would\u2026accept me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAccept you?\u201d said Ninata, taken aback. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, now that she took a moment to think about it, she began to wonder why herself. Back when she was Naruto, he always thought of Hinata as \u201cthat dark, weird freaky girl who always turned away.\u201d She weirded him out, but otherwise never stood out in a crowd to him, even when her exotic eyes were taken into account. It wasn\u2019t until the Chuunin exams that he started to actually pay attention to her. Thinking about how little he used to think of this wondrous girl before her right now made Ninata feel a little guilty herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy father considered me a failure,\u201d Hinata continued. \u201cI was an unworthy heir for the Main House. The Branch House considered me only as someone to serve at best. And Neiji-niisan\u2026\u201d She bit her lip as particularly painful memories began to surface. \u201cI\u2026just couldn\u2019t\u2026please anyone\u2026no matter what I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut when I saw you\u2026I still felt unworthy. You had it worse than me. My problems were all at home. But you had to deal with the hatred from everyone, Ninata-chan. From every adult, everywhere you went. But you were better than me. You never gave up, no matter how much the odds were stacked against you. I still don\u2019t know how you did it. If I were you,\u201d she broke into a small smile, noting the irony in that statement, \u201cI think I would have broken a long time ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHinata,\u201d said her twin, not quite knowing what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I had to get stronger,\u201d the Hyuuga continued. \u201cI had to become more like you. So that I could become someone\u2026you could like. Someone\u2026you respect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped, shutting her eyes to quell the flow of tears that threatened to spill from them. She didn\u2019t want to get emotional right here. Now was supposed to be a time of happiness with the one she loved, not the sadness of the past. But had she just ruined it? Would things be awkward between she and Ninata just because she dared to spill her heart out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question was answered when Ninata said in a reassuring voice: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes, Hinata was greeted with the sight of her own face smiling lovingly at her while extending a welcoming hand across the table. \u201cI already told you,\u201d Ninata said, \u201cI like people like you.\u201d Sighing wistfully in relief, the born-Hyuuga reached her hand forward to entwine her delicate fingers around her twin\u2019s. They felt so warm and gentle, as they always had whenever they caressed her bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food eventually came, and the two girls took the time to enjoy their meal and learn more about one another, talking about happier and more pleasant things.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No matter how much things had changed for her, it was good to know for young Ninata that Ichiraku still served the best ramen around. Even though she had a full dinner in her stomach, her mouth watered when she picked up the alluring scent of the old man\u2019s cooking. She supposed it wouldn\u2019t hurt to treat herself to some pork ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don\u2019t overeat, Ninata-chan,\u201d Hinata told her. \u201cDon\u2019t want you falling asleep early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata knew what that meant. So one bowl of pork ramen it would be. It was probably just as well; Hinata\u2019s smaller body likely didn\u2019t have nearly as big of an appetite as Naruto\u2019s. And she wouldn\u2019t want to get herself fat anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh, I guess I am starting to think more like a girl</i>, thought Ninata as she slurped up her noodles. She cast a glance over at her girlfriend, who was happily munching on a cinnamon bun. <i>Might have to ask her if she does anything to keep her weight down.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto?\u201d a voice asked from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nearly choked on her noodles and fell off the stool. <i>Who said that? Did somebody find me out? Am I changing back? What?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinata-chan?\u201d Hinata gasped, leaping down to check on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d the mysterious voice said with a sigh. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata helped Ninata back onto her feet, which wasn\u2019t easy because of those vile heels, they looked up to see who the intruder was. It was Sakura, looking a little embarrassed to cause a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Hinata asked in a somewhat guarded manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, nothing,\u201d the pinkette sighed again, taking a seat. \u201cI was just hoping a certain <i>someone</i> would be here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, who?\u201d Ninata asked innocently, playing dumb. Recalling the last time she saw her old teammate, she had a good idea on who Sakura was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026stupid idiot!\u201d said Sakura, clenching her fists on the counter. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for him all day. I\u2019ve gone everywhere he could possibly be. To our old training fields, to the shops where he could be buying weapons, and even <i>this</i> place! And for once, I haven\u2019t seen so much of a thread of his stupid orange jacket!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata had to bite her lip hard just to keep herself from saying: \u201cMy jacket\u2019s not stupid!\u201d Sitting back down on her stool, she clamped down hard on her remaining noodles. Hopefully, they would keep her distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI even checked his apartment,\u201d Sakura continued in a notably softer, sadder tone. \u201cAnd would you believe that it\u2019s completely empty now? Lights out, furniture gone, and available for rent. It\u2019s like he fell off the face of the earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, did you try asking his sensei about it?\u201d said Hinata cautiously. She mentally smacked herself once the words left her mouth. <i>I really should sound a little more surprised by that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, can\u2019t ever find Kakashi-sensei when I need him either,\u201d Sakura said glumly, not picking up on Hinata\u2019s oddly calm demeanor. \u201cI did ask the Hokage though. She said he was leaving to go training with her old associate, Jiraiya. Indefinitely. So they put all his stuff in storage and cancelled the lease on his place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, why did you come here?\u201d asked Hinata. She couldn\u2019t help but feel a little suspicious of Sakura\u2019s motives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve come here five times already. This is Naruto\u2019s favorite place to eat, after all. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, he was still around here somewhere, getting one more bowl for the road. But I guess not. If he\u2019s not here now, then he\u2019s long gone now.\u201d Sakura now looked genuinely hurt. \u201cStupid jerk didn\u2019t even have the decency to say goodbye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, why are you trying to find him?\u201d said Ninata curiously. If she had been Naruto, he would have jumped for joy at the prospect of Sakura looking for him for once. But experience had taught her that that would never be the case. And even if it was, she had Hinata now, who was a much better girlfriend anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d said Sakura, casting a glance over at the former boy. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much either of you know\u2026in fact, I don\u2019t know how much <i>you</i> in particular know.\u201d Her earlier depression seemed to have disappeared for the moment. In its place was a tone of interest and fascination. \u201cDo you, like, have all of Hinata\u2019s memories, or do you only recall the time when you were, uh, \u2018born?\u2019 I\u2019m sorry if that sounds weird to you, but I\u2019m still trying to get around the whole chakra split thing you two have going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hinata and Ninata paused and exchanged troubled glances. How were they supposed to answer that question? They hadn't quite hashed out all the details of their cover story, and there would be holes in whatever lie they spun. What could they say?</span></div></div>",

Except when it comes to my training. She\u2019s still completely inexperienced with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata didn\u2019t know what to say about that. <i>Oh great, does this mean that I need to know all the nitty-gritty details of Hinata\u2019s life and the customs of her house? Oh man, how many more lies do we need to spin to keep this story going?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, that\u2019s odd,\u201d said Sakura. \u201cWell, anyway, it happened a couple of days ago. I went to go see Sasuke at the hospital. He was being even moodier than usual. More hostile. And he picked a fight with Naruto. They fought on the roof. But it wasn\u2019t some friendly spar, or one of their usual spats. They really looked like\u2026like they wanted to kill each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Hinata asked as Sakura took a moment to wipe the oncoming tears from her eyes. Surely, there had to be a mistake; Naruto would never want to hurt any of his fellow Leaf nin, even if Sasuke was his rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf-if Kakashi-sensei hadn\u2019t arrived,\u201d Sakura continued, \u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know what would have happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura,\u201d Ninata whispered in an apologetic tone before snapping her mouth shut. She knew that incident had upset her teammate. And while at the time, she (or he) had simply told the pinkette that it was between he and Sasuke, she was now thinking Sakura honestly deserved an explanation. But she could say nothing about that right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething happened between them, but I don\u2019t know what,\u201d Sakura blurted out. \u201cThey\u2019re keeping me in the dark. Kakashi-sensei wouldn\u2019t tell me anything. But I know Naruto would\u2026I know he would be honest with me. Eventually He would tell me everything, even if he\u2019d embellish it to make him look bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I would not!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t even get that!\u201d Sakura looked like she wanted to either cry or punch something. \u201cI can\u2019t even get an explanation, because he\u2019s gone and disappeared in the wind. Just like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d said Hinata sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Sakura in a softer tone. \u201cIt\u2019s been stressful for me. I shouldn\u2019t have dumped it on you two. I know you have your own problems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata wasn\u2019t going to let this go by, though. Sakura was seeking her for help, and while she couldn\u2019t quite give it as it she was, she could at least try to do something. \u201cWell, if Sasuke\u2019s still around, you could maybe speak to <i>him</i>. Maybe you can get through to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s a good idea. He doesn\u2019t want me around in the best of times. And he doesn\u2019t talk much as it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to at least try. Maybe he\u2019ll open up to you if you\u2019re persistent enough. Maybe he\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s eating him. Or maybe it\u2019ll get him out of his funk. You never know. And you never will if you don\u2019t just get out and try.\u201d She looked directly at the pinkette and flashed her big trademark toothy grin. Though it likely looked very silly on Hinata\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura didn\u2019t say anything for a while. Then she nodded, with a small smile. <i>That sounds a lot like something Naruto would say.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cI will go talk to him. Don\u2019t have any other choice now, and I can\u2019t dance around this issue forever.\u201d As she got up, she turned to Hinata and added: \u201cYou should try listening to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been,\" said Hinata said with a cryptic smile of her own. \"Longer than you realize.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to help her?\u201d asked Hinata as the two girls split ways with Sakura and began the walk back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in too good of a mood to have to deal with Sasuke right now,\u201d Ninata muttered. \u201cHe might just say or do something that\u2019ll make me want to punch his face in again.\u201d Looking down at her lithe Hyuuga body, with its comparatively miniscule amount of chakra (that she was used to anyway), the little black dress, and those <b>insufferable</b> high heels, she added: \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to put up much of a fight in this. I\u2019d have a better time fighting naked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata giggled at the thought. That made for a sexy image, seeing her Ninata fighting Sasuke or various other ninjas in nothing but her bare skin. Running on the ground, flipping in the air, somersaulting every which way without a thing on to cover her. Boobs jiggling and bouncing, sweat running down her curves, and all her bare muscles flexing beneath her creamy skin\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe born-Hyuuga coughed. Now was not the time for that. She had to wait until they got home first. \u201cSo, uh, what did happen between you and Sasuke-kun?\u201d she asked, hoping to get her mind out of the gutter for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that I\u2019m not so sure I\u2019m supposed to say,\u201d said Ninata. \u201cBut\u2026ah screw it! Let\u2019s just say he had a run-in with his older brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean\u2026Itachi?\u201d Hinata whispered with a tinge of horror. While she didn\u2019t know the man personally, there was not a soul in Konoha who was unaware of what he did. His crimes may not have been on par with Orochimaru\u2019s, but the sheer brutality that he was single-handedly capable of committing was nothing short of terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now that she thought about it, she remembered how hushed Kurenai-sensei was being over the past week. She apparently had a near-death encounter with a powerful ninja. Could it have been-?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, the very same,\u201d Ninata said in a cautious whisper, checking around to make sure no one was eavesdropping.. \u201cFor all the time that I\u2019ve known him, Sasuke\u2019s had it in for him, and let\u2019s just say their reunion didn\u2019t go down very well. And ever since, he\u2019s been acting like a bigger jerk than usual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura said you two were trying to kill each other,\u201d said Hinata. \u201cIs that\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No!\u201d said Ninata with clear alarm. \u201cI would never do...it was just\u2026ugh!\u201d She didn\u2019t know what to say. That fight had definitely gone a little overboard, she\u2019d admit that. Sasuke started it, of course; he whipped out his Chidori technique, so she brought out her Rasengan in turn. But how could she explain that without looking like a sputtering little kid who was caught with her hand in the cookie jar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSasuke is just getting really crazy is all,\u201d she explained once she collected her thoughts. \u201cHe started to resort to some deadly attacks, so I had to fight that much harder. But\u2026yeah, it wasn\u2019t a friendly spar. I\u2019m not proud of it at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Hinata. There was perhaps more that she would want to ask, but that would have to wait. It was clear that Ninata wasn\u2019t too comfortable talking about it, and it was not a safe subject to speak of here in the streets. It would have to wait. Besides, she didn\u2019t want this to be a night of uncomfortable conversation. This was a night of celebration. It was their first night dating. And it was going to be the first night spent in their new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We\u2019re moving into a house together. We\u2019ll be living together under the same roof. It\u2019s almost like\u2026we\u2019re getting married!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Hinata had not had over a decade of Hyuuga reticence drilled into her, she most definitely would have SQUEED! right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked on, with only the click-clacks of their heels interrupting the peaceful silence that enveloped them. Ninata had been learning fast how to walk in them, but it didn\u2019t escape Hinata\u2019s notice that she still wasn\u2019t very comfortable in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, since I\u2019m going to her out of those anyway\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinata-chan,\u201d she said, \u201cif you want, you can take your heels off. I\u2019ll carry them for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, Hinata?\u201d said the former boy, looking at her somewhat skeptically. Walking barefoot the rest of the way home would have been a godsend, but she didn\u2019t want to come off as rude; Hinata had picked these shoes out and chosen them for her after all. When she nodded, Ninata quickly bent down and pulled her dainty little feet out. She sighed in pleasure as she wiggled her toes, enjoying the feel of them out in the cool night air. \u201cOh, that\u2019s nice. Thanks, Hinata, you\u2019re the best!\u201d she said, giving her girlfriend a grateful kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was already feeling warm from the evening she had been having, but that little action really began to stoke her fires. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Ninata-chan,\u201d she said, putting the heels into her purse and grinning devilishly again. Which looked no different from her usual sweet and angelic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow more comfortable on her two feet, Ninata walked with a greater bounce to her step, which gave an added bounce to other parts of her body. Hinata used this opportunity to silently slip behind her double. With a deft hand and a graceful flip, she slipped the straps that held Ninata\u2019s dress off her shoulders. Now the only thing holding it in place was the way it tightly clung to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm? What\u2019s so funny?\u201d Ninata asked as she glanced behind her once Hinata began giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-nothing, Ninata-chan,\u201d said Hinata innocently. Shrugging, Ninata turned back to look ahead. Their apartment building was coming into sight. The time was now. After making sure the coast was clear with her Byakugan, the born-Hyuuga stealthily sidled up to her twin with ladylike grace, slowly navigated the dress straps off of Ninata\u2019s arms in such a way that they never made contact with her skin, and then began the process of pulling the dress down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Ninata\u2019s nipples been fully erect, slipping the dress off would have been a most difficult task. Thankfully they weren\u2019t, so the fabric slipped off her breasts like water. Hinata had to bite her lip from giggling out loud. She could almost feel the cool air on her own breasts as she saw Ninata\u2019s bounce openly once they were freed from the oppressive black cloth. She expected Ninata to react to the new feeling immediately, but amazingly, it seemed like her own twin hadn\u2019t noticed a thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You\u2019re so silly, Ninata-chan.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling even more adventurous, Hinata pulled the fabric down even lower, marveling as more and more of Ninata\u2019s ivory flesh appeared. She didn\u2019t know what was harder; pulling this trick off so quietly without missing a beat in her step, or resisting the urge to embrace her twin from behind and press her lips over every inch of exposed skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing herself and taking a deep breath, she slipped more of the dress down, bunching the silky cloth into a bundle that was low enough she could just begin to make out the top of Ninata\u2019s delicious derriere\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Hinata-chan? Can you open the door? The keys are in your purse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Hinata was caught by surprise. So engaged was she with her task of publicly stripping Ninata, she had failed to notice that they were standing right at the door of their apartment. She nearly fell right into her twin, and would have likely fallen to the floor if her hands hadn\u2019t swiftly grasped two fairly large and very pliable handholds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHinata-chan! Are you alright?\u201d Ninata asked with clear alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn\u2019t answer. She was completely lost with the feeling of Ninata\u2019s bare skin on her face, and her naked breasts in her hands. The cool air had done its job in stiffening her double\u2019s nipples, which prodded into her palms tantalizingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo good,\u201d she cooed, lightly kissing the flesh of Ninata\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata sighed in relief. It seemed like Hinata was fine. <i>Who would have known a girl\u2019s breasts could save a life!</i> She mentally beamed, delighted that Hinata\u2019s timely grab of her boobs had saved the day (and it felt nice to be touched there to boot). But when she looked down, it suddenly dawned on the boy-turned-girl: her dress had somehow slipped off her shoulders. She feared this would happen, and now she was practically naked outside the apartment!</span></div></div>",

Bad!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHinata, can you please open the door? Like, right now?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm, okay, Ninata-chan,\u201d Hinata said, squeezing her love\u2019s breasts even harder to pull herself back to her full height. She almost felt disappointed to let them go, but immediately perked up knowing that this night was only beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata suppressed another giggle as her double scurried into the apartment, hands clutching her breasts and red all over. <i>Ninata-chan\u2019s so cute when she\u2019s embarrassed. And naked.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNobody saw me, right?\u201d Ninata asked as Hinata slid the door shut. \u201cNobody\u2019s reporting me for indecent exposure, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNobody was around, Ninata-chan\u201d said Hinata innocently, hoping her twin wouldn\u2019t ask how she knew. \u201cNobody saw you. Your secrets are safe with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata relaxed at her words, but she still seemed flustered. \u201cI had no idea how hard it would be to be a girl. I already know that they\u2019re subjected to unrealistic standards of beauty, still face prejudice in many parts of the world, workplace, and military, have to put up with their menstrual cycles every month\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blinked, completely forgetting about her earlier sense of humor and arousal. She honestly did not know what to say to that, and never expected to hear those kinds of words come from Ninata of all people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026and are usually relegated to weak damsel in distress roles in fiction. But I never knew how hard just wearing their clothes would be! I must be the worst girl ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ninata-chan,\u201d said Hinata, snuggling behind Ninata to wrap her arms around her. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled inwardly as she felt Ninata tense muscles relax in her embrace. It was such a silly thing for the poor girl to be upset about (and especially since it wasn\u2019t even her fault), and Hinata had to choke back her laughs, but it was nice to know she could provide this sort of comfort to her longtime crush. \u201cBesides,\u201d she added with a twinkle of mischief, \u201cI like you better with no clothes on anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, the blunette took hold of the dress that was bundled around Ninata\u2019s waist, and pulled it all the way down her slender legs. Ninata murmured in slight surprise, but made no motions to resist, simply allowing it to slide down the rest of her form until it was a pile at her feet, which she promptly stepped out of. Now completely nude, the girl who used to be Naruto awkwardly turned around, wrapping her arms around her chest, just under her boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, uh, what now?\u201d she asked, knowing what was coming, but not knowing where to start. Hinata responded by wrapping her arms around her twin, giggling flightily as her fingers enshrouded themselves along the curves of Ninata\u2019s supple rear end. Ninata had to bite her lip to keep herself from showing just how much she enjoyed her twin\u2019s touch. Squeezing her cheeks lightly, Hinata pulled the girl closer to her, until they were touching one another, stomach to stomach, nose to nose, and breast to breast. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata kissed her on the forehead. Then on the cheeks. Then on the lips. And then on the lips again, slower. Ninata had come to learn what that meant, and she opened her mouth to invite her lover inside. They melted into one another, enjoying the sensation of their nearly identical bodies feeling one another top to bottom. Hinata\u2019s hands never left Ninata\u2019s butt; they ran up and down the soft curves, pinching and squeezing the supple flesh gently. The served to further stoke Ninata\u2019s fire, who wrapped her arms around Hinata towards the middle of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the only thing Ninata wanted was to be close to Hinata. She pulled her lavender-eyed beauty closer to her. Their breasts pressed more tightly together and their legs intertwined. Ninata even began to rub her groin along her twin\u2019s bare leg, just to enjoy the sensation of their full bodied contact. But it was not enough. Hinata\u2019s dress was in the way. She wanted to feel her lover\u2019s bare skin on her own, she wanted her hardened nipples to prod into Hinata\u2019s wondrous bosoms, and her clit to rub alongside Hinata\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands roamed round Hinata\u2019s back, hoping to find the zipper on her dress that would allow her to take it off. However, she didn\u2019t have much time. Hinata had ended the kiss and began to pull back, tongue receding back into her mouth and the rest of her body following. Ninata just about wanted to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait just a moment, my Ninata-chan,\u201d Hinata whispered, running a hand down her lover\u2019s bare side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata wanted to simply pounce on her right then and there, but she held back, with a reluctant nod. <i>You better not take long</i>, she mentally wailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata stood awkwardly, one arm draped across her chest but below her breasts to grasp the other, which hung limply. She had to fight the urge to run her hands up every inch of her naked body. To caress her sides, pinch her nipples, squeeze her cheeks, and thrust her finger straight into the sensitive mound between her legs\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, not now. I must resist!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn\u2019t. She had to simply wait. So she watched on as Hinata prepared their bedding. She pulled out a futon mattress from the closet, laid it flat onto the floor, covered it first with a clean white sheet, then a thicker grey blanket, and topped it off with a fairly sizeable pillow. She did the whole thing silently, gracefully, and with a happy smile on her face. Had she been wearing a kimono and wearing the right makeup, Hinata would have been the picture perfect representation of a Fire Nation geisha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, Hinata sat down sideways on the futon, still maintaining the image of traditional Hyuuga lady, with a gentle smile that quietly welcomed Ninata to join her. Despite being considerably closer to the floor, it was larger than Ninata\u2019s old bed, and looked a thousand times more comfy. It was all the former boy could do to nearly jump in, but she restrained once again, opting instead to walk on the tatami floor with as much womanly grace as she could muster. She knelt gently onto the mattress, her nearly white eyes never leaving Hinata\u2019s matching orbs. Hinata responded by once again reaching forward, reaching around Ninata\u2019s bare for to grip her back, and pull her in for another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata finally found the zipper on the back of Hinata\u2019s dress and pulled it down, savoring the low zipping sound announcing her girlfriend\u2019s impending nakedness. After being touched, groped, caressed, fingered, and seen in various states of undress by Hinata all day, it was going to be a refreshing change of pace to finally do the same to her. She stroked her hands over the contours of Hinata\u2019s back, up the valley of her spine to the shifting muscles in her shoulder blades. Gripping the top of the Hyuuga\u2019s dress, she pulled down on it lightly. She didn\u2019t need to exert much force; Hinata\u2019s breasts popped out quickly enough, as if they were drowning and desperate for air. Pulling back from the kiss to give them a good glance, she was enthralled by how far her pretty pink nipples had stiffened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We could poke somebody\u2019s eyes out with these things</i>, she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat so funny, Ninata-chan?\u201d asked Hinata with a quirked eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, nothing. Just admiring our goods,\u201d Ninata replied. Lowering her head, she laid a kiss down on Hinata\u2019s collarbone and worked her way down, pulling the dress down her double\u2019s body every step of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata simply leaned back and let Ninata do her thing. She had only been transformed for two days now, but she was already showing remarkable skill on how best to pleasure a woman. Oh, it was only natural of course; Hinata had been giving her \u201clessons\u201d at every possible opportunity, and their nearly identical bodies meant it was easy to replicate them on Hinata. But it still gave her a sense of pride. A good student was often a reflection of the quality of the teacher. Perhaps she could make a good jounin or academy instructor when she got older. Or maybe she could provide instruction for\u2026other things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, father never approve of that. Just as he would likely never approve of this. But he was no longer here. He had all but just about disinherited her. She no longer had to live with him, abide by his rules, or meet his standards. Her father\u2026could go fuck himself for all she cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It\u2019s been doing wonders for me</i>, she thought giddily as she felt Ninata\u2019s lips on her right breast. She quickly stowed those dark thoughts away. Now was not the time for brooding on the past. Hinata had never been so spiteful before, and it was a tad frightening. But she had never felt more confident than ever before this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Focus on the moment, that\u2019s all that matters. Especially since it feels\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d she gasped when she felt Ninata\u2019s warm tongue grace her nipple, shortly before engulfing the whole thing in her lips. \u201cSo good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stroked Ninata\u2019s head with her hands, running her fingers through that beautiful dark hair, silently letting her know that she was doing everything right and that she should keep going. She shuddered happily as she felt her nub get pulled further into Ninata\u2019s mouth, squeezing tightly between her teeth while being firmly massaged by her wet tongue. It sent small shocks of electricity through Hinata\u2019s being, causing goosebumps to rise on her skin, and a distinct dampness to start building up between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Ninata,\u201d she cooed, pressing Ninata\u2019s head deeper into her breast with her right hand and lowering her left one to her girlfriend\u2019s succulent bare behind. She enveloped one pliant cheek in it, brushing the baby-smooth flesh with her fingers before giving it a nice firm squeeze, a reward to her lover for a job well done. Judging by the small, cat-like murmur her double made with Hinata\u2019s nipple still in her mouth, she knew it worked, and gave it another pinch for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata finally released Hinata\u2019s nub and pulled back. She made a motion to go for the other one, but Hinata stopped her with a shake of her head. Her juices were stirring and a sheen of sweat was coming in to soak her skin. And while her dress was doing little to cover her, simply clinging to her waist while her wondrous bosoms bounced free and her bare legs spread out to expose the sensitive treasure within, it was starting to feel tight and confining. Hinata wanted nothing more than to rip it off and be just as naked as Ninata, to be a completely true twin once again. She pulled the dress from the hem up and tossed it to the side like an unwanted piece of garbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow completely nude, Hinata crawled to her lover with a look of intense hunger in her pearlescent eyes, telling her lover that she was now free to continue her work without any fear of interruption.</span></div></div>",

Ninata put her hands together in the familiar seal of the tiger. \u201cUm, are you sure that\u2019s a good idea? Using techniques right now?\u201d She didn\u2019t want Ninata to tire herself out as she had the previous times she attempted to perform ninjutsu in her new body.

Turning around, Hinata was shocked to see\u2026her own face staring lustfully at her. It took a few seconds for her to register what had happened. \u201cNinata-chan, you did it,\u201d she said happily. \u201cYou made a Shadow Clone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata looked up to see her handiwork, and grinned victoriously as she saw her gorgeous clone in all her naked glory. Yeah, it had taken a bit out of her just to make one, she didn\u2019t have the chakra reserves she used to when she was Naruto, but she could do it. She could now perform proper jutsus again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHinata-chan,\u201d the clone whispered in a sultry tone, moving to embrace Hinata. Hinata cast a questioning glance to Ninata as if to ask if this was okay. Ninata gave her an approving nod. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026catch up with you two later,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded and gently let her down before turning her attention to the clone. The two hugged one another and kissed before the clone licked her lips deliciously as she stared at Hinata\u2019s unsuckled breast. Ninata simply watched the proceedings as she took a breather. It wasn\u2019t fair; she had to be winded while her clone was still active enough to have fun. But it was a definite improvement over yesterday. She didn\u2019t feel faint or exhausted as she did before. She just a needed a minute or two to collect herself after expending that much chakra. And thankfully, she was already starting to feel the heat die down in her lungs and the strength return to her limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was good, because she could feel her heat rise again as she watched Hinata and the clone. Her girlfriend was sitting on her knees with her back to her, moaning in a hushed voice as the clone sucked on her nipple. Her muscles rippled and twitched as spasms of pleasure wracked her form. The globes of her butt jiggled oh-so-slightly with each full-bodied tremor her twin experienced, and they would periodically clench. It was a very surreal image for Ninata to see not one but two exact copies of her new feminine self behave in such an erotic manner. And it made her mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow finished with the breast, the Ninata clone began to journey downward, leaving a trail of kisses along Hinata\u2019s chest, her abdomen, around her navel, and down her thighs. Knowing what was coming up, Hinata moved to a sitting position, planting her butt on the fluffy futon and spreading her legs in anticipation. Ninata took this as her chance to embrace Hinata from behind, groping a breast in each of her hands. They were wet with perspiration and saliva, the nubs of her nipples felt almost like needles in her palms, and they were all hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinata,\u201d said Hinata as she leaned into her twin\u2019s form, relishing the feeling of her breasts cushioning her neck. \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way I\u2019d let her have all the fun,\u201d giggled Ninata as she massaged Hinata\u2019s sumptuous mounds of womanly flesh, squeezing them rhythmically, loving the feeling of them seeming to rise and fall in her grasp and marveling at how well-developed they were. <i>Man, how could Hinata keep these hidden from everyone for so long?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone\u2019s face was now buried between Hinata\u2019s thighs. Hinata was moaning happily, rocking her hips frontward and back. Reaching an arm back behind Ninata\u2019s neck, she pulled her double in for another kiss, which the latter was only to happy to return. In the past Hinata had\u2026a few fantasies of Naruto using his clones to pleasure her like this. But she never imagined about how amazing it would feel in reality, to effectively have Ninata\u2019s tongue in both her mouth and her pussy at the same time, all while her breasts were worked on as well! She had nearly orgasmed after the treatment her boobs were given previously, but with this, she didn\u2019t think she could last much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And this is just with one clone!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Ninatas seemed to be synched. The original increased the rate at which her tongue lapped against Hinata\u2019s own, while the clone sped up her movements within her womanhood. And the breast massage increased in intensity as well. Hinata moaned within the confines of Ninata\u2019s lips and bucked her hips at an even faster rate than before. Her loins tingled with burning intensity. Any moment now, and they would burst. But she had to hold fast. The longer she held off, the harder her twin lovers would work their magic. The harder they worked, the greater the climax would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, it was too much for the Hyuuga to bear. She violently pulled back from Ninata\u2019s lips and screamed bloody murder. Her body shook, her breasts jiggled, her hips quaked, and liquid fire erupted from her form like a new year\u2019s fireworks show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it did not slow her down as she expected it would. It did not tire her out. No, it fueled Hinata with an even greater need, an even greater hunger. Pulling the clone from where she knelt on the futon, the Hyuuga looked back and forth at both she and the original with a nearly feral expression, deciding where she should go from here. And as she did so, the clone and her progenitor, amidst the great amount of arousal they had experienced bringing Hinata to climax, wondered if perhaps they had just created a monster.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To call her a monster was pretty appropriate. All signs of rational thought had vanished from Hinata\u2019s head. All that ran through her mind was an insatiable lust like no other. After giving her two naked twins a few glances, Hinata just about pounced on them. She squeezed their breasts and whatever other flesh she could grab a hold of with her two hands and exchanged deep kisses from one girl to the other in rapid succession. It happened so fast, nobody in the room could comprehend it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Hinata had sandwiched herself between the two Ninatas. Her legs were entwined with that of the clone\u2019s in a scissoring formation, where they thrust their hips together and rubbed their clits against each other. And her tongue was busy ravishing the wet pink folds of Ninata\u2019s pussy as she held the girl steady, one hand gripping each cheek of her buttocks as tightly as a vice. Or was it the other way around? Was she tribbing Ninata and eating out the clone? She lost track, she didn\u2019t know, and she didn\u2019t care. All that mattered was that she got the satisfaction she so desperately craved. And judging by the moans her Ninatas were making and the wetness they were producing, she knew she was doing a very thorough job satisfying them in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t been going at it for very long when she could feel another orgasm start to build up from deep in her loins. Concentrating on the tongue bath for the Ninata in front of her was proving difficult as Hinata was feeling an ever greater need to scream. So she pushed herself up to free her lips, pressing her face against that Ninata\u2019s stomach and let her labored moans bellow freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Ah! AH! AHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came again, feeling the warmth literally spill out of her. An oncoming pressure of wetness followed, indicating her trib partner had just orgasmed as well. For a moment, the bucking movements of their hips slowed down, and Hinata just took this moment to wallow in the afterglow. It only lasted for a few seconds, and before she knew it, she was back to it. Disentangling herself from the Ninata behind her, Hinata pushed herself up to a sitting position to get more eye to eye with the Ninata in front of her, wrapping her legs around her waist so that their pussies could meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that. I haven\u2019t forgotten about you,\u201d she said with a smile that was half kind and half lecherous. Without waiting for the Ninata before her to answer, she thrust her hips forward, once, twice, thrice, grinding her clitoris into her twin\u2019s (triplet\u2019s?) womanhood. The Ninata was already incredibly wet from Hinata\u2019s earlier tongue work, so much so that every movement they made emitted a moist squelching sound. She would not last much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHinata!\u201d the Ninata just about shouted, shooting her head skyward as the impending climax descended upon her. \u201cI-I-I\u2026oh, oh, OH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata bit her lip in anticipation of the next orgasm she was about to inflict. In fact, just thinking about it was doing much to light her fire even further; she wouldn\u2019t have been if she came again. But instead of feeling the telltale spray of womanly love, the Hyuuga instead felt a sudden gust of air and then the soft, cottony, and damp folds of the futon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter experiencing her first orgasm in between Hinata\u2019s legs, Ninata had been content to just lay back for a moment to get her bearings. Unlike Hinata, who seemed to recover from her climaxes in no time at all (and seemed to be especially speedy tonight), the former boy needed a little time to rest. She didn\u2019t know exactly why this was, but she figured it was probably because she was still new to being a girl and hadn\u2019t quite\u2026trained orgasming yet. It was okay; Hinata was willing to give her a break, and had just turned her full attention to Ninata\u2019s clone. For the moment, she was content to watch her two exact copies go at it, and had even involuntarily slipped her hand down to stroke her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Hinata reduce her clone to a sweaty, quivering wreck was really hot. She could almost feel every movement the two girls made against one another, and increased the strokes she applied to her pussy with them, letting the electric sensations build up. Who would have thought that being a girl could be such an <i>awesome</i> experience? The clitoris was an amazing organ whose only apparent purpose was to make a girl feel good. Women were so lucky on this front, and Ninata couldn\u2019t help but feel honored for being transformed so that she could experience it for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, nothing could prepare her for what happened next. One moment, Hinata was tribbing her clone, holding her tightly against her body. The next, there was a puff of smoke and Hinata\u2019s naked body was sprawled on the mattress. But that was all she could imagine when a flood of sensations suddenly entered her mind. And her body soon followed as a blazing fire erupted into her very being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was baffled. What was she doing here? What happened to her Ninata? Where did she-?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blunette mentally slapped herself. It was just a clone. Of course it would dissipate upon experiencing an orgasm. Hinata pouted at that realization. She was about ready to feel one herself, and the clone had to disappear on her at the worst possible time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her uncharacteristic grumpiness soon vanished when she heard the screams of her Ninata behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Kami! Oh Kami! This is too much! I can\u2019t, I-AHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata stared in shock at the love of her life. Ninata was flat on her back, red all over, gleaming with sweat, legs spread\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026and climaxing with absolute fury!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHinata!\u201d she shrieked her entire body rippling as the first orgasm ripped out of her. She clutched at one of her breasts and bit her lip as if she were anticipating another blow\u2026and another blow came in the form of a second orgasm that erupted out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata could only watch in amazement as her lover trembled and shook in what had to be complete bliss. It looked as though she was having sex with an invisible assailant. But a quick flash of her Byakugan had indicated that there was nobody in the room, nor were there any jutsus in effect in their immediate vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata drew in a sharp breath of air, arched her back upwards nearly a full foot over the futon, and spread her legs even wider. For a moment, she sat there, still, save for a constant shaking in her four limbs, her breath caught somewhere in the middle of her throat\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Only for her third and final orgasm to leave her in a gentle cascade. Her entire body slowly slumped down to the mattress with a gentle thump. When it was done, she simply lied there, drawing slow laborious breaths into her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinata?\u201d Hinata asked with concern in her voice. She got no answer. \u201cNinata?\u201d she repeated, crawling to the side of her lover to see what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata was warm to the touch, her skin was still flushed, tears were in her eyes, and she was panting heavily from exhaustion, but she seemed fine. Still Hinata couldn\u2019t help but be worried. \u201cNinata-chan? Are you all right?\u201d she whispered, cradling her love\u2019s head in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata finally opened her lovely lavender eyes and stared up at Hinata with a tired smile on her face. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cJust\u2026didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026a thing with my shadow clones. I absorb all their memories when they vanish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou absorb\u2026wait, so that means-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Everything she felt\u2026my clone that is\u2026everything she felt, I felt. Once she vanished. In the span of one second, I took in everything she experienced. I felt your hands, your tongue, your kisses. It was like we made love again\u2026all in the span\u2026of one\u2026second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had to take a moment to fully comprehend that. \u201cUm, was it\u2026good?\u201d she asked a little nervously. She loved the idea of being pleasured by multiple Ninatas all at once, and she could not help but drool at the prospect of having sex with an entire room full of them. But if it\u2026hurt her in any way\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndescribable!\u201d Ninata gasped. \u201cLike nothing I ever felt before. I\u2019ll have to make even more clones, just to see how that would feel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled, relieved. \u201cI would like that. You were amazing, Ninata-chan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs were you,\u201d said Ninata. The born Hyuuga gently lowered herself to lie down by her lover\u2019s side. Smiling into one another\u2019s identical eyes, the twins embraced and pulled their bodies closer. They rubbed their noses together and exchanged small playful kisses, cooing and giggling cutely in the warmth that radiated from their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, Hinata-chan,\u201d Ninata whispered as sleep began to overtake her. Her eyelids drooped, her body became limp, and there in Hinata\u2019s arms she fell asleep with a peaceful smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too, my Ninata-chan\u201d said Hinata, planting a kiss on her forehead. Despite the strange twist of events that made all of this possible, the lavender-eyed girl could not be happier. She was together with the love of her life, they had a new home together, and there was a bright future to look forward to. For the first time in her short life, she was truly content.</span></div></div>",

So after the two girls helped themselves to a quick breakfast and a shower (albeit one with a lot of groping and kissing from Hinata), the two put on their ninja attire and set out to train together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than use the training grounds, the duo had decided to do their training relatively deep inside the forests. There were lots of trees to run up, a river to swim in and walk on, and the whole place was very secluded and tranquil. It was unlikely that anyone would come to interrupt the two. That would be especially useful if they suddenly found themselves interested in <i>another</i> kind of physically-strenuous activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! Ninata had to keep her mind out of the gutter. And hopefully, Hinata was doing the same. There was one thing she was curious about that she knew only born-Hyuuga girl could help her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, since they said that I\u2019m now a near-perfect copy of you, it should be possible for me to do the Byakugan, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gave her a simple curt nod. \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata beamed. \u201cThen do you think you can teach me how to do it? Being able to see real well seems like it would be really useful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can try,\u201d said Hinata. Ninata just about cheered. Finally, that Sasuke bastard wouldn\u2019t be the only one on Team 7 to have some fancy-pants super eye technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat cross-legged across from each other on the forest floor. Hinata showed Ninata the proper seals and explained the way the chakra needed to be molded in and around the eyes. While the ability could indeed be activated without the use of hand seals, doing so required a more precise level of chakra control, and it was customary for beginners to use the seals until they became better trained with the technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, here it goes,\u201d said Ninata.

First, there was the sudden twitching, throbbing feeling all around her eyes as chakra and blood pumped into them at a faster rate than normal. And then there was the complete overload on her senses. She could see Hinata before her, the river to her left, the trees behind her, and the canopy above her head, all at the same time. She picked up all sorts of minute details in the leafy forest floor, such as the number of seeds that were buried under the leaves, the dead body of a rat that was rotting in some nearby bushes, and the distinct pattern of tail feathers from a bird that was flying overhead. And of course, for an instant, she managed to see Hinata naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have liked to take some time to enjoy the view, but the whole thing was really making her brain hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nearly panicked. \u201cCancel it! Cancel it!\u201d she cried, rushing to Ninata\u2019s side. The boy-turned-girl didn\u2019t need to be told twice to do that. She released the technique. Immediately, the panoramic vision and minute details all faded away, and she now only saw what was in front of her. The throbbing sensation around her eyes ceased as the veins stopped bulging and retracted back into her face. And Hinata appeared to be dressed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you all right, Ninata-chan?\u201d Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so. That was just crazy. I could see everything all at once. And it was making me dizzy. Do you normally feel like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed with relief and nodded. \u201cYes, that is normal. Most Hyuugas can go into shock when they first use the Byakugan. It takes practice, but you eventually get used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata sat up rubbing her head. \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. I was afraid I did it wrong again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hinata shook her head and smiled. \u201cNo, Ninata-chan. You did it perfectly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe born-Hyuuga cast a glance toward the river, which was looking more and more enticing by the minute. \u201cUm, there is something that I\u2019ve been working on lately that maybe you could do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d said a perky Ninata. \u201cLike a new jutsu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething like that,\u201d said Hinata. \u201cDo you know how to water-walk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCourse I do!\u201d Ninata marched over to the water to demonstrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Ninata-chan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata stopped. \u201cWhat is it?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the thing is,\u201d Hinata said, blushing a little, but maintaining a smile that carried a hint of impish glee, \u201cyou might know how to do it as Naruto-kun, but in my body, you might need some practice to readjust yourself. Otherwise you\u2019ll just fall in the water and get yourself wet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata paused. \u201cI guess that\u2019s a good point. So what do you suggest I\u2026do\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was already going through the process of removing her clothes right in front of her lover and twin. She peeled off her shirt, took off her sandals, pulled her pants down, slipped off her panties, and unhooked her bra, letting her big, beautiful breasts spill out again. Soon enough, she was completely nude, and her clothes were all folded up into a pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhenever I train around water,\u201d said Hinata, sauntering over to Ninata with an exaggerated sway in her hips, \u201cI typically do it\u2026like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026suppose that makes sense,\u2019 said Ninata, blushing at the sight. Hinata's breasts almost seemed to look bigger than usual, and they jiggled with an even greater force than she was used to. She hadn\u2019t expected this training exercise to get so\u2026amorous so fast. She was starting to wonder if Hinata had some ulterior motives. But no, she could never picture her girlfriend being so deceptive. And even if she was, Ninata had nothing to complain about. She had been feeling the heat as well, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata brushed nakedly past her, running a dainty hand upon her butt as she passed and giving it a playful squeeze. Her face locked eyes with Ninata's own, so closely that their lips nearly touched. Ninata's breath caught in her throat, and she parted her lips to welcome Hinata into them. But just as quickly as Hinata had arrived, she was gone. Ninata almost groaned in disappointment, but she soon forgot about it as she watched Hinata continue on to the river. Gracefully, she stepped upon the water and without missing a beat, walked atop its surface as if it was the most natural thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo splashes were left in Hinata's wake as she walked across the water. She left only slight ripples with every contact her bare toes left upon its surface. The river's current was gentle, easy, and did nothing to slow her gait. There was little to distract Ninata from the Hyuga's enchanting figure in all its naked glory. Her creamy skin almost seemed to glow in the shadows of the forest. Each pliable cheek of her buttocks quivered and shook ever so slightly with every graceful step she made. And from where she stood, Ninata could just make out a hint of red peering from the noticeable curve of Hinata's left breast. And just to make the sight even more enchanting, the Hyuga cast a perfect reflection of herself on the surface of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Ninata didn't know better, she would have sworn that she was looking at a nymph of legend in her natural habitat. When she was neatly in the center of the river, Hinata began to turn around. Her legs stayed rooted to the spot so as to not hide her butt from view, but she gave Ninata a greater view of her breast with its erect nipple at the same time. It swayed side to side with the motion, only slightly, but enough to nearly mesmerize the former Uzumaki. She only broke out of her trance when she looked up to meet Hinata's soulful lavender eyes and kind smile silently calling for her to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too much. Everything that was lovely about Hinata was in view. Her graceful legs, her wide yet toned butt, her bountiful breasts, her hardened nipples, her lovely eyes, her bountiful breasts (again), and her loving nurturing smile. And she was doing <i>absolutely nothing</i> to hide her figure as all girls would naturally do. It was doing everything to set off Ninata's raging feminine hormones. She couldn't get her clothing off fast enough, and nearly tripped over herself doing so. Every filthy garment she removed was tossed aside as if it were useless trash, because at the moment, that's exactly what they felt like. Once she was fully nude and free from the constricting things, Ninata just about rushed to the angel beckoning to her, scampering over the dry leaves, fallen sticks, squishy clay...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And fell straight into the water with a most unwieldy splash!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata giggled as she watched Ninata's head poke out of the water, dripping wet with her dark hair plastered to her skin. She just knew she wouldn't be able to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll, uh, try that again,\" said Ninata sheepishly, climbing back up to the shore. Hinata savored in the sight; watching the water run down her girlfriend's body, along her curves, and between her succulent cheeks was enough to make her feel a little wet herself. She had to resist the urge to reach for her pussy. If Hinata started to do <i>that</i> now, then chances were good she'd end up just like Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata, meanwhile, had put her attention off of Hinata and back to the water. \"Okay, girl, you know how to do this, you've done it before,\" she said, focusing the chakra down to the soles of her feet. Just a little at a time at a steady flow, just like before. She put one foot down onto the river, exerted the chakra out, not as a torrent, but as a trickle, and pushed downward. And her foot held firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I got it,\" she said, taking a step with her other foot. She now had both her feet planted on the river's surface. Her stance was shaky, and her feet seemed to bob up and down uneasily, but she was standing on the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you could do it, Ninata-chan,\" said Hinata. Then she added in a husky tone: \"Now come to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nearly lost her footing at the sound of her voice, but she managed to stay firm with a quick propulsion of chakra. <i>Concentrate, Ninata. Do that too much, and you'll sink again.</i> She took a shaky step forward, and then another one, and each time her stance grew more steady. She wasn't struggling to maintain her balance, nor was she bobbing up and down nearly as much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow and easy,\" she whispered, and tried to commit the current feeling of her chakra flow to memory. This is what controlling one's chakra was all about. If she wanted to resume her career as a ninja in Hinata's body, then this was how she would have to do things. <i>And if I use the Byakugan, then I can see how much I'm using.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was risky. If she attempted it, she would likely fall into the water again from the shock. But Ninata figured that quick glimpse would hopefully be enough to give her an idea at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could execute the signs with her hands, she felt the telltale electric tingles in her womanhood as something cool seemed to reach in and brush it as gently as a feather. She nearly jumped and sank into the water again. What could be doing that? She felt another cool caress brush past her leg. Looking down, she got her answer: a tendril of water reaching out from the river and splashing itself on her naked skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were more splashes ahead of her. Looking up, Ninata was greeted to a most wondrous sight. Hinata was no longer standing on the water beckoning to her. She was twirling on it. Spinning and dancing on its surface as if she had been doing it for years. Her limbs moved with a fluidity that matched the water all around them, gracefully snaking in wide circles around her. Her perfect hair flowed with her as though it was an organic extension of her very being, with not one strand moving out of place. Her breasts jiggled, her nipples stood erect as crystalline beads of water clung to them, her buttocks flexed in and out, and her legs spread thin and wide at rhythmic beats, giving Ninata multiple views of her precious pink treasure from numerous angles. But even that spectacle of titillation did nothing to diminish the raw beauty she was bearing witness to. Especially since droplets of water were spiraling in the air all around Hinata like shimmering stars in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She has to be a nymph. There's just no other way a human, even a ninja could do that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Ninata found herself too focused on Hinata to focus on her own predicament. She didn't even manage one half-step forward before she felt straight into the water again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Damn it!\" Ninata groaned when her head broke the surface again. With her graceful steps and florid twirls, her girlfriend made it look so easy. But Ninata was struggling just to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does everything have to be so...ooooh.\" Ninata broke off from her tirade when Hinata stepped over her. Looking up, she got an eyeful up her pretty little pussy. Ninata had seen more than her share of them in all those naughty magazines she would often peruse when researching her world famous Ninja Centerfold technique. But she had really been liking Hinata's as of late. It was hairless and smooth, just like the rest of her flesh, and formed a perfect slit that cut between her legs. No sign of her pink velvety folds would show through, until she willed it with careful splaying of her legs, or through the deft motions of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's pussy was the best one in the world. Which made Ninata even more thrilled to be turned into her, for Hinata's womanhood was her own womanhood as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you can do it, Ninata-chan,\" said Hinata, not knowing how much Ninata was enjoying the view. Or not caring. Or most likely, knowing and wanting her to enjoy it. \"I didn't think I could do it at first either, but...\" She trailed off, taking a moment to bend down and reach for Ninata. \"Take my arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nodded and took a firm grip on them. With nary a grunt, the born-Hyuga hoisted her up out of the water. When the former boy was out from the waist-up, she took the initiative to fold her legs up onto the surface and started pumping chakra down them. \"Thanks,\" she said, pushing herself up while she held onto Hinata's form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Ninata-chan,\" she purred, shivering at the close contact of Ninata's naked skin upon her own. Stomach to stomach, breast to breast, nipple to nipple. She didn't think she would ever get over the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um...what was that?\" asked Ninata, her face turning red. She had been wanting to feel Hinata ever since she stripped down, but now that she finally had her, she didn't quite know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I've been working on. Practicing for many weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been coming to this spot for quite some time now. At first, it was simply to hone her level of chakra control. But later, as Hinata experimented with the water and realized she could manipulate it, she wanted to do something new with her family's latent abilities, something never done before. And of course, she always practiced in the nude. For practical reasons, of course; getting soaked was a natural part of the learning process, and it wouldn't do to trudge back home in wet clothing after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even back then, she had to admit that it felt really sexy too. Being out in nature with not a stitch to cover her felt incredibly liberating. And a small part of Hinata always fantasized on the possibility that Naruto would stumble upon her, dancing on the water naked as the day she was born. But now, the powers that be had decided to do her one better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it some kind of secret Hyuga technique?\" Ninata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shook her head. \"No. But it does utilize our unique bloodline.\" She leaned forward, touching her forehead with her twin's. \"If you want, I can maybe teach it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah!\" Ninata said bouncing on the balls of her feet (and in her chest). \"I'm always down for learning new ninja stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata giggled. Ninata was too adorable for words when she got excited. If Hinata was like that normally, maybe she would have caught Naruto's attention a long time ago. \"Okay, but we need to take it slowly, starting with the basics. First and foremost, you need to get used to using your Byakugan.\" Hinata pulled her identical-looking love closer to her, running her hands tightly over her waist to grip her perfectly pliable posterior, shivering as she felt the flesh melt into her palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Hinata-chan? Wh-what are you d-doing?\" asked Ninata a little confused while trying and failing to suppress her own delighted shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holding you. Just in case you fall again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. Smart idea.\" Ninata bit her lip to steel herself from the pleasurable sensations she got from feeling Hinata's delicate fingers on her butt and formed her hands into the familiar seals for her new bloodline ability. She felt the throbbing in her temples again, and then the dizziness as her brain became overloaded with the sight of nearly everything around her all at once. Her head became heavy, as did the rest of her body, and her feet began to slip into the water...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah crap, not again.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Focus on me, Ninata-chan!\" said Hinata as she began to strain under her girlfriend's sinking weight. \"Don't focus on the world around you, just look at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata groaned as the dizzying waves rippled through her form, but she complied, looking straight into her double's pearlescent eyes and focusing on them with laser-guided precision. Despite the near spherical range of vision she possessed, the former Uzumaki found that it was similar to when she focused on something with just her regular eyes; focusing didn't quite blind her, but it did cause the world around her to blur and smudge while the image of Hinata crystallized. There was still a lot to take in, but without so much imagery overloading her mind, it at least made things tolerable. Already, she felt much less dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, now...try and get back on your...feet,\" Hinata groaned, struggling to keep Ninata afloat. Her fingers were sinking deep into the soft flesh of the former boy's now very girly butt, and Ninata was finding it really distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Get your mind out of the gutter, Ninata! Ignore Hinata-chan's fingers...her wonderful, tantalizing, magical fingers...and get back to water walking.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shut her eyes tightly, hoping it would help her concentrate. With both her dizzying vision and her growing arousal, Ninata doubted she'd be able to stand on the water again. It seemed to work and put a little less stress on her mental facilities, leaving her with enough willpower to mold her chakra back into her soles. In a few seconds, she could feel the water grow firm under her feet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed as the weight of her girlfriend's body lifted off of her. \"You're doing it, Ninata-chan. You can open your eyes. Remember, ignore everything around you and focus on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Ninata as her eyelids rose, immediately solidifying the sight of Hinata's lovely face. \"I'm doing it. I'm on the water, and my Byakugan is active. Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn your focus inward, onto yourself. Into the chakra you are molding through your legs right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nodded. Slowly, ever so slowly, she turned her focus away from the beautiful face before her and down to her legs, trying not to put too much attention onto Hinata's nude body. Or her own for that matter. It was a very odd feeling to say the least. With normal eyes, such an action would have required moving both her head and her eyeballs. When the Byakugan was active, neither of those were necessary. The Hyugas' bloodline ability effectively gave her an infinite range of peripheral vision, so shifting her attention from one thing to another was somewhat akin to focusing on a nearby object after looking into the distance, even if it was from another direction or angle entirely. It was very weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was nothing compared to the sight of her chakra working its way through her coils. Every ninja had a near intimate connection with their own chakra, but no one ever really got to see it in action while it worked its magic through the body. No one, that is, except for the Hyuga clan. It was like a flame that burned brightly in the dark, but at the same time, it pumped and flowed throughout the body as blood did in the veins. And if one paid special attention, they could see the way the chakra moved naturally in the air, in the elements, and in all natural things. Ninata quickly realized that her new vision had effectively opened up a whole other world for her to explore, a world that she had always known about but never once gave any serious thought. And for reasons nobody could even fathom, she was now one of the very few who could be a part of it. It was truly mind-boggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see how much chakra you're using?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Ninata replied with a curt nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you <i>feel</i> how much chakra you're using?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...think so,\" said Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feeling is indicative of how much chakra you must channel to stay afloat. You need to commit that feeling to memory and maintain it, along with that level of chakra, at all times.\" Ninata suddenly felt Hinata pull her close again, very gently, with a featherlike touch. \"Dance with me, Ninata-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-dance with you?\" Ninata asked, focusing on Hinata again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded, suppressing another giggle. In her experience, even the most kindly-looking people would take on a hardened and formidable appearance while the Byakugan was active. Even her timid self cut an intimidating figure. But for Ninata, the bulging veins did little to hide how cute she looked when she wore a confused expression. \"Yes,\" she replied. \"Dance with me. Try and control your chakra while practicing more elaborate footwork and keep your Byakugan active. This is the first step to learning my new technique. And in honing your own skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay,\" said Ninata, wrapping her arms around Hinata's neck like most women did in those slow dances. She silently wondered why her twin was so ready to assume the man's position; shouldn't it be the other way around? They were both girls, but Ninata had at least been born as a boy. But she decided to stay quiet for now; it wasn't really that big a deal. \"But I warn you, I've, uh, never danced before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just follow my lead,\" said Hinata with a smile. She was looking forward to this. Not only was she going to dance with her love for the first time ever, but for once, she would be the teacher for her dear Ninata's ninja training. And when all of this was over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, they both knew what would happen then.</span></div></div>",

Nor would she be winning any dance-offs in the near future. Her virginal dancing, chakra control, and Byakugan skills combined made it hard for the normally energetic ninja to stay concentrated, and both her and Hinata's mutual nakedness wasn't helping. The way their breasts pressed into one another was heavenly, as were Hinata's gentle caresses on the small of her back and the soft mounds of her buttocks. Ninata lost count of the number of times she stumbled, tripped over her double's feet, or nearly fell into the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut overall, she would have to say that she was pleased with herself. Despite her difficulties, she was able to maintain her footing. She also learned how to better deal with her newly-enhanced vision, shifting her focus to and through different objects, areas, and angles with relative ease, and could even look all around the near 360-degree dome around her for a few minutes before getting a headache. Ninata knew she was improving her skills as a ninja in this new body, and that was a win in her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet despite her less than stellar dancing, Ninata had to admit it was actually kind of fun. While she had trouble staying at Hinata's pace, sometimes going too fast or moving too slow, the former boy couldn't help but feel a mild thrill whenever she was unexpectedly twirled in a circle or dipped. More than that, Ninata loved to peer at Hinata's face. The born-Hyuga couldn't have looked happier if she tried; not once did she display any annoyance or impatience with her twin's mistakes. She wore a dreamy smile the whole time, giggling adorably at Ninata's mishaps as she silently corrected her and continued on as though nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kami, she's gorgeous</i>, Ninata thought with a blush. <i>How come I never noticed it until a few days ago?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata couldn't help herself. Maybe it was how Hinata's precious grinning lips were calling to her. Or maybe it was her growing arousal. But she was feeling oddly daring for the first time in her Hinata-esque body. Daring enough to plant a kiss on her girlfriend's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a deep and passionate one like what they had shared countless times over the past few days. It was just a little peck, nothing more. But it was enough to catch the original Hyuga by surprise. Hinata's eyes widened, and with startled squeak, she fell into the water, dragging her twin with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both surfaced at the same time, one wearing nothing but a confused expression, and the other laughing good-heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, heh, got you!\" Ninata said, letting her Byakugan drop as she saw Hinata stare blankly ahead of her, her normally pristine hair sopping wet, clinging to her head, and covering half her face in an undignified manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't last long though. Hinata's expression soon changed into a coy grin she seldom ever put on that said: \"Oh, it is <i>so</i> on!\" She closed the distance over to her girlfriend, hugged her tightly in the water, and kissed her on the lips in turn. Ninata welcomed her embrace and opened her lips to allow her girlfriend's tongue to explore her mouth. They lashed their tongues against one another with wild abandon, wetly pushing, pulling, and rolling-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-And then Hinata broke off, spinning her whole body around in the water and swimming back to shore, casting a sultry grin under hooded eyes at Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata-chan, you play dirty!\" said Ninata before following her, splashing water up into the air recklessly. Her tits were hard and her loins were burning hot; she demanded pleasure now and would not put it off any longer than necessary. Thankfully, she did not need to wait long; Ninata hadn't even gotten fully back onto her feet before she was tackled and pinned to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I've got <i>you</i>,\" Hinata said, planting another deep kiss onto the former boy's lips. Ninata made no attempts to resist. She was content to lay prone on the ground, forced into place by Hinata's surprisingly strong grip while returning her kiss, savoring the touch of their hardened nipples brushing up against one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Hinata pulled away, released Ninata's wrists, and put herself into a sitting position, straddling her love's form with their sexes pressed up against one another. Slowly, Hinata began to buck her hips into and against Ninata, grinding her swollen clit into her twin's beckoning lips. Ninata soon followed suit, pressing her own clitoris into Hinata's, shuddering as electricity violently sparked through every damp pore of her pink flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnward they went, thrusting their hips faster, tighter, and harder against each other with every beat of their hearts, soft moans accompanied only by the sounds of equally soft squelching flesh. Upon seeing her lover's large, heaving bosoms bounce and jiggle above her with every gyration she made, it was all Ninata could do to resist reaching up and grabbing them in her dainty hands. Firmly, she squeezed and massaged them, running her fingers over the wet, slippery surface of feminine flesh. She purred happily, marveling at how soft Hinata's breasts were in her grip...and how hard her little pink nips were by contrast. Hinata moaned even louder, grew even wetter between her legs, and tossed her head back as her pleasure steadily built up thanks to Ninata's loving caresses.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately, it did not last long. For without warning, Hinata suddenly ceased her movement and leaped off of her lover's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata just about wanted to cry. Or pound the earth in frustration. \"Hinataaaaaaaa,\" she whined, pushing herself up to see just what the blunette's game was this time. She wasn't in the mood for teasing now. Her pussy was positively dripping and throbbing hard for attention, and if it was not sated soon, she just might lose her mind. However, her annoyance quickly changed to curiosity when she caught Hinata's mildly panicked expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh,\" said the born-Hyuga, putting a finger to her lips. \"I heard something. Voices.\" She activated her Byakugan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw nuts,\" Ninata groaned in a low voice. \"Don't tell me someone's been peeping on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata just shook her head. \"No, they're too far away, and moving fast. There are four of them at least, and they're ninjas. I don't know if they're Leaf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninjas, huh?\" said Ninata, putting on a serious face. She stood up and began to scamper to the nearest tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Ninata-chan!\" Hinata cried, going after her and putting a hand on her shoulder. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they're ninjas like you say, then we should check to make sure they're friendlies and not spies. Or worse, Sound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but you're...we're still naked!\" said Hinata, blushing all over furiously. For the first time since Ninata underwent her transformation, the born-Hyuga was now acting more like her old timid self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right!\" said Ninata with a nervous chuckle as she glanced down at her nude body. \"But if you say they're moving fast, then we might just lose them if we go get dressed. Our clothes are on the other side of the river, y'know.\" At this she shrugged off Hinata's hand and darted up the closest tree trunk in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Ninata-chan!\" called Hinata, following after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" said Ninata once she perched on a branch. \"I promise, I won't do anything reckless. We'll just see who they are, and if they're not Leaf, we'll head back and report it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata really didn't want to do this. If anyone saw her and Ninata-chan naked in the woods like this, she'd just about die. But she realized that her crush did have some sound logic. As ninjas of the Leaf, it was their duty to be alert for any possible threats to the village's security, regardless of their compromising position. If they wanted to identify the interlopers, they would need to act fast. And that meant they'd have to go in the buff.</span></div></div>",

Now let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether they leaped gracefully from tree branch to tree branch, following the mysterious ninjas as swiftly as possible. Ninata was focused and determined as ever, regardless of her nudity, but Hinata was beet-red all over. She had a feeling this was going to become a disaster for the both of them, she just knew it. Though she had to admit, it did feel kind of nice to feel the air rush across her every inch of exposed flesh and into the sensitive folds of her sex every time she took to the air. But...but that wouldn't make up for the humiliation she was sure to feel once someone saw her like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they landed on another tree branch, Hinata suddenly picked up on another group of ninjas converging on their position.

A little dog tucked away in a hooded coat yipped. And two very naked Hyuga twins stared back in abject shock and frozen horror. Hinata had just about turned into a statue on the spot, while Ninata's previously cocksure attitude evaporated like a sigh in the wind. She was no longer the proud, loyal, dutiful, and awesome (albeit still officially off-the-registry) ninja of the Leaf. She was now a very naked teenage girl who was quite aware that <i>everything</i> about her was on display. Not to complete strangers, but to people she was very familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten blinked silently, unable to process what she was seeing. Chouji turned around courteously, hoping nobody had seen his bleeding nose. Ino's eyes darted back and forth at the pair, her expression completely unreadable. Shikamaru stood stock-still, his utter bewilderment unbefitting of his normally grumpy demeanor. And as for Kiba...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi-Hinata?!\" the hooded boy exclaimed as he clutched at his bleeding nose and attempted to look away, but couldn't find it in himself to avert his eyes. \"Why are you naked? WHY ARE THERE TWO OF YOU?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a cacophony of voices speaking over one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, uh, well, uh, you see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We, ah, could try taking another route.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arf! Arf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop looking at her...at them...you perverts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnn...mmeehhh...mmmrrrhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just training is all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this normal? Does your cousin do anything like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they clones, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone paused to stare at Ino, who had been the one to say that last bit. \"What?\" she said. \"I'm a girl. I'm allowed to ask things like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what the hell is going on here?\" roared Kiba furiously, taking off his jacket and rushing over to one of the nude twins to cover her up. Unfortunately, the girl he had approached had been Ninata. And while she would have been thankful to have some dignity, one whiff of the coat was enough to change her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, keep that thing away from me!\" she said stepping back and wrinkling her nose in disgust. \"Smells like wet dog!\" Ninata may have been embarrassed, but if she had to choose between going naked or wearing something that Kiba's puppy had likely marked as its territory, she'd rather just go naked every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Kiba. He knew his demure teammate well, and he knew she would never raise that kind of tone with him or anyone else. \"You're not Hinata.\" He dropped his jacket and grabbed a kunai strapped to his leg. \"Who the hell are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm Hinata,\" Hinata whimpered from where she was crouching, hugging her knees to her chest to cover herself. \"Th-that's Ninata-chan, my...chakra clone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kiba asked, taking a moment to stare at her in surprise, before slapping himself for looking at her. At least she had calmed him down and prevented a fight from breaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard about this from Sakura,\" said Ino. \"She told me that Hinata's yin-yang chakra split and she's been hanging out with this clone of hers ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sparked another avalanche of rapid-fire comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Really? How is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never heard of anything like that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not important!\" exclaimed an exasperated Shikamaru, who finally regained control of his senses and was back to his usually annoyed self. \"This isn't what we've come here for, and every second we waste time here, Sasuke's getting further and further away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata blinked. That brought her full attention to the present and away from her nakedness, at least for the moment. \"Sasuke? What's happened to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound ninjas kidnapped him apparently,\" said the Chuunin, closing his eyes so he wouldn't get distracted by the two identical nude girls before him. He would have looked quite authoritative doing so, provided one ignored the small trickle of blood coming out of his nostril. \"We've been assigned to retrieve him before they get away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those must be the ninjas we saw!\" said Ninata. \"Maybe we can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we can?\" said Hinata, looking up at Ninata as though she had gone mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you can?\" Shikamaru asked nervously. He hadn't expected the naked girl to want to jump to his aid like that. \"In your...current states?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have the Byakugan!\" said Ninata. \"You know that can come in handy for tracking someone down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata knew she had promised Hinata that they wouldn't do anything reckless. But that was before she found out that the whole mess involved Sasuke. Lately, the Uchiha may have been acting like an even bigger jackass than usual, but she couldn't just let him of all people be dragged away by Konoha's greatest enemy. Even if he got on her nerves, she would never turn her back on her friend, clothing or no clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer girlfriend, however, was not feeling the same way. \"N-Ninata-chan, we-we can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed and rubbed his temple. This situation just got more complicated. The Hinata clone did have a good point. Circumstances forced him to form this team on such incredibly short notice, and while he knew a Hyuga would have been immensely useful for it, he hadn't been able to track any down, like Neiji, in time. Having two on the team would be a huge boon, as would the extra bodies he'd have on hand. Even if they had to be...naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Hinata, Ninata, if either or both of you want to join us, I won't refuse. We could use all the help we can get. But you gotta' make your decision fast, because we're short on time.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Why am I doing this? Why did I <b>ever</b> agree to do this?!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was silent, as all good ninja had to be. But inside, she was screaming like a banshee. Here she was, leaping from tree to tree alongside her girlfriend and five of her fellow Genin (and one puppy dog), naked as the day she was born. She had never been more embarrassed before in her life; every inch of her normally pristine skin was as red as a tomato. Every moment that passed, every step she took, and every leap she made brought her farther and farther away from her clothes, which were still folded up on some riverbank who-knows-how-many miles away. In some strange way, just thinking about it made her feel even more naked, if that was even possible. The only cover she had were the arms she had crossed over her breasts. To call it awkward would be to understate it; Hinata could still feel her sensitive mounds ripple against the flesh of her bare limbs, and her ever hardening nipples press ever deeper into them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Shikamaru had the decency to put her in the back, alongside Ninata. \"So you can keep an eye out for possible ambushes,\" he had explained. \"Not to prevent you from distracting us or something,\" he added, blanching when he realized he probably shouldn't have said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven under her wide Byakugan-enhanced vision, Hinata couldn't help but steal a glance at Ninata. Like Hinata, she was running through the forest butt naked. But unlike her twin, she didn't seem to be the least bit phased by her nudity. There was nary a blush on her face and her skin was just as pale and dreamy as it had always been. She didn't bother covering her breasts either; she was content to let them bounce and jiggle as she sprinted like the wind. And her expression was locked into a mask of serious determination. There wasn't a speck of humiliation to be found anywhere on her. The fact that Ninata's own Byakugan was active only made her look even steelier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually a very sexy visual, and Hinata knew that she had been fantasizing about seeing her Ninata do something very similar just last night. <i>BUT WHY DO I HAVE TO BE NAKED TOO?</i> she silently wailed. <i>AND HOW IS SHE ABLE TO ACT LIKE THIS IS NORMAL? IT'S NOT FAIR!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just unfair, it was plain galling. Ninata had been so embarrassed when she realized she had been stripped nearly naked in public last night (or rather, that her dress had \"mysteriously slipped off\" as she so thought), when nobody had been around to see her. But now, five people, three of whom were guys, just saw all that she had to offer, and she was fine with that? How could that be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Hinata remembered why they were even in this mess in the first place. <i>Sasuke.</i> While Ninata and Sasuke were clearly not on good terms right now, even she wouldn't back down from saving the Uchiha when he was in trouble. Her duty came first, regardless if she was feeling angry at the black-haired boy, or embarrassed about her nakedness. That was certainly an admirable quality, and it only made Ninata more beautiful to the born-Hyuga. She could only hope to follow her example. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip, Hinata pulled her arms away from her chest, liberating her luscious orbs from their confinement and letting them bounce freely in the air as nature intended them to. It was odd and no less embarrassing to feel herself jiggle so much like this, but it was a first step. Hinata could not afford to be embarrassed, she was on a mission. Anything could happen at any moment now, and she needed her hands to be free and ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Hinata noticed Ninata wince and the bulging veins on her face faded as her Byakugan deactivated. And it was then when the realist part of Hinata's mind took hold. As admirable as Ninata's spirit was, as much as Hinata loved and respected her, and as much as it pained her to even consider it...she didn't think her girlfriend was ready for a mission of this caliber yet. The girl who used to be Naruto had only just learned how to use her bloodline ability. She had only just learned how to start molding her chakra somewhat efficiently through her coils. And while Ninata had most certainly experienced a lot of strenuous physical activity in her new girly body, that...wasn't exactly the kind of experience that would help her against a skilled enemy ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can only hope she'll be all right.</i> Casting a soulful look at her love, which she hoped Ninata would notice, Hinata could only quietly beg. \"Please, Ninata-chan, don't do anything reckless.\"</span></div></div>",

She couldn't suppress a shudder as her bare skin made contact with her love's, but she didn't have time to enjoy it. A loud <i><b>thunk</b></i> went off just barely a meter above her, and Hinata saw what appeared to be some kind of arrow bury itself in the trunk of the tree they were perched on. If she hadn't acted when she did, Ninata would have lost her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the only thing she had to worry about, because she saw something else on the arrow: an explosive tag. \"BOMB!\" she yelled. With no time to waste, she hugged Ninata's form closer to her own, crushing their bare breasts together, and rolled off the branch, taking her twin with her. As the air rushed over her every bare inch of skin, she breathed a silent sigh of relief when she saw the rest of the squad follow suit, leaping and rolling off the branch in multiple directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it only lasted a few seconds before the explosion went off. Hinata's spherical vision went white and she promptly lost all control of her fall once the resulting shockwave hit her, sending her spinning helplessly to the ground. She tried to keep a firm grip on her Ninata, but the girl just seemed to slip away from her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And she was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninata!\" Hinata cried, blindly flailing her arms around, hoping against hope that she would at least touch the flesh of her beloved again. All she felt was air. Panic overcame the girl. Where was her twin? Where had Ninata gone? Why couldn't she <i>see</i> anything? Suddenly, the fact that the Hyuga was falling from a lethal height no longer concerned her. All she could think about was her Ninata. Ninata, who had come so close to death mere seconds ago. Ninata, who needed Hinata's intervention to stay alive. Ninata, who was once again thrust into danger, outside of Hinata's grasp, outside of her near-limitless vision...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face suddenly collided into...something somewhat squishy and apparently made of velvet, and a silken voice yelped out in shock above her. Hinata still couldn't see anything, but she could feel that something was holding aloft in the air. And wherever her face was, it was somewhere warm, wet and oddly familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata instantly beamed. She could recognize this wonderful musty scent anywhere. It was Ninata's pussy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata bit her lip to suppress a groan of pain. Dang, even as a girl, a slam to the crotch really hurt! Wasn't the most painful one she ever experienced, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it was worth it. Hinata was safe for the time being and no longer falling to her death. That was all that mattered. It hadn't been easy; grabbing a tree branch with her hands and catching Hinata's head between her thighs while spinning uncontrollably in the air required a stroke of masterful acrobatic skill that Ninata was absolutely sure she wouldn't be able to replicate. If only someone had recorded the moment on camera. Then she could relive it as many times as she liked...no, no, scratch that, that would have been terrible. She and Hinata were hanging stark naked on a tree and her girlfriend's face was currently buried in Ninata's vagina. Bragging rights would not have offset the humiliation they would both have undoubtedly felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotcha,' Hinata,\" she said through clenched teeth. Her arms were really straining to hold the both of them up and in a few seconds, they would most certainly give out. \"We're about, eerrggghhh...15 to 20 meters above ground. Do you...do you think you can control your fall from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmfff-hmmffff!\" Hinata mumbled, clearly incapable of speaking clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata suppressed a shudder. However slight Hinata's movement was, it was still enough to excite her. \"I'll take that as a yes.\" And with that, she let go of the branch and spread her legs out, releasing Hinata from the grip of her thighs. Without the uncontrollable spin from the blast, the twins were able to fall straight down with their eyes focused on their surroundings. The branches were much too small at this height for either of them to land safely on, but they were still able to use what was available to slow their fall down by quickly gripping each branch, twig and leaf they passed by with a small burst of chakra. They hit the ground with only minor scratches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata wasted no time pushing herself up and running to her twin. \"Ninata-chan, are you alright?\" she gasped, helping the former boy stand up on her feet. Adrenaline was still pumping through her veins, and she would not rest until she knew her love was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Ninata between deep breaths. \"I'll live. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Hinata said with a hushed whisper and a curt nod. She wanted so badly to hug her double after that little tumble, but she knew that there were far more pressing matters to attend to. They weren't out of danger yet. \"We...we should try to find the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" answered Ninata. She clasped her hands together to activate her Byakugan again, when all of a sudden...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...A drop of something fell down from the trees above them. It was small, but to Ninata's white eyes, which were sharp even without the Byakugan active, it was unmistakably blood. Likely from someone's nose. Somebody was watching them and quietly enjoying the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata reached for her side to grab a kunai, only to mentally slap herself. She was naked; she didn't <i>have</i> any kunai to throw! Luckily, a quick glance to the ground provided her with a reasonable substitute: a plain old rock. In once swift fluid motion, the transformed Hyuga grabbed and hurled it right in the general direction she saw the blood fall from. A cry of \"OW!\" and sudden crash of something big hitting the ground meant her aim was straight and true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot!\" said a guttural voice that sounded like two stones scraping against one another. \"We're supposed to kill them, not leer at them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, nobody said that we were being chased by two naked girls,\" said another similar-sounding voice. Ninata and Hinata both exchanged a troubled glance. From what they saw, only one person had fallen. \"Especially two naked twin Hyuga girls. You know how I feel about them. And besides, Ukon, your nose is bleeding too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and get to it, Sakon,\" said the first voice, which clearly belonged to Ukon. \"They'll be coming any minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a grumble, and from out of the bushes rose a lone ninja. He was tall, with a slender and womanlike frame that was apparent even under the light brown tunic he wore. What little could be seen of his face under the unruly mop of pallid hair was even more feminine. His features were delicate and his painted lips were thick and pouty. If Ninata hadn't heard him speak, she would have thought he was a woman. An intimidating one as well, though that image was marred slightly by the trickle of blood running down his nose. He wore no forehead protector, but the large violet rope tied around his waist told the Hyuga twins everything they needed to know about him: he was a Sound-nin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata assumed a battle ready stance, clenching her hands into fists, an action that caused her breasts to notably bounce. \"Where is Sasuke?\" she barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sound-nin didn't answer right away. The one visible eye on his face followed the jiggling motions of the girl's boobs lustfully. Something seemed to knock him from the back of his head, which caused him to snap back to reality. \"Oh, uh, i-is that what this is about?\" he said, stumbling over his words to try and restore some dignity and menace to his tone. \"Don't worry. He is perfectly safe. If anything he is much safer than you, your friends, and even your dear sister here.\" He turned his gaze over to Hinata and licked his lips perversely at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare look at her like that!\" growled Ninata. Anyone who eyed her girlfriend like a piece of meat would pay dearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I'm sure what we are currently thinking of would be a much better fate than what we would otherwise have to do to her. And you. But you know what? My brother and I would be more than happy to let you two lovelies go. Provided you both gave us a little something in return. Something we are sure you will enjoy.\" He lashed his tongue out lecherously at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata picked up on the subtle twitch of her hot-tempered girlfriend and the deepening scowl on her usually beautiful and gentle face. Her twin was ready to see blood. \"Ninata-chan, don't,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of her girlfriend's voice calmed the former boy down somewhat, but her fury was still burning. \"No way,\" she snarled. \"I'd rather fuck a Northern Cloud Porcupine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, that's too bad,\" said the Sound-nin. \"We most certainly would have liked it to be consensual. But if you want to play hard-to-get,\" a slippery wet sound of meat being cut suddenly oozed its way through the air around them, \"have it your way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next shocked both Hinata and Ninata. From the Sound-nin's back, another person seemed to grow out like an oversized tumor. The girls activated their shared bloodline ability and both of them had to suppress a horrified and disgusted gasp at what they saw. Two sets of chakra boiled together within the man. What they thought had been an individual the whole time was in fact two separate people fused together like conjoined twins. And the second one was finally making himself known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second ninja finally finished crawling out of the first and split off from him like a dividing amoeba. He turned to face the two Hyuga girls with an equally bloody nose and lecherous grin. \"It isn't fair to gang up on one person,\" he said. \"So I figured I should come and help even things out for my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take the noisy one, Ukon\" said the first ninja as he pointed at Ninata. \"I like it when they fight back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then, I'll take the quiet one, Sakon,\" said the second ninja, Ukon. \"I'll see how deep her waters run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sound twins were on the Hyuga twins in an instant. Hinata had barely enough time to parry the punch that came her way. Ukon's blows may have lacked finesse and skill, but they were still fast and furious. One punch would have been enough to send the little teen sprawling, and without any clothing or armor on to protect her, she likely would have suffered severe bruising or even a broken bone. She had to do everything she could to make sure that didn't happen. So she blocked, parried, and pivoted around every punch he made, backing away to keep some sort of distance between them. It was almost enough to ignore the constant jiggling of her breasts or the movement of air she felt within her lower lips each time she so much as took a step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Be patient, Hinata. Just wait for the opportune moment. Then go right for the heart.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, things were not going nearly as well for Ninata. She just barely avoided blocking Sakon's first punch. It didn't do any damage that she could see, but it shoved her arms right into her boobs, which was distracting and a little painful, and it already knocked her backward clumsily. He followed up with another punch aimed at her bare stomach, which she only just barely blocked as well. But it was a particularly hard jab, one that Ninata's now slender and graceful arms were not trained to handle. The former boy bit her lip to keep the groan of pain from coming out, but it was a vain effort as the Sound-nin immediately followed up with punch right into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn it!</i> Ninata mentally cursed as she hit the ground, crying out from the smarting pain on her forehead where she had been hit as well as from the exposed tree root she landed on. <i>I keep forgetting. Hinata-chan's body isn't built for this kind of fighting!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to her active Byakugan, she didn't need to look up to see that Sakon was about ready to descend upon her. Ignoring the pain coursing through her, Ninata rolled out of the way. The attack was strong; the vibrations it left in the ground shook her to her very core, and from her sphere of vision, she could see that it kicked a lot of earth up and left a small crater in the ground. The former Uzumaki shuddered at the thought of what kind of damage that punch would have done had it actually connected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How's Hinata faring?</i> she quickly shifted her focus to her lover. Luckily, it looked like her double was doing a lot better than she was. Hinata was still on her feet, matching Ukon's kicks and punches blow for blow, her open-palmed hands a blur of blue chakra, and the globes on both her chest and her rear swaying and jiggling beautifully as they always did. If Hinata was embarrassed by her nakedness at all, she was doing a good job hiding it. She was clearly on the defensive, but still in control of the situation, at least for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She can do it. She just needs to strike that creep once, and it'll all be over. For now, I just need to focus on this guy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakon made another leap at Ninata, and Ninata responded by rolling out of his way again. With the shock of pain starting to recede from her form, she was able to leap back to her feet. Her legs were shaky and her head was still throbbing with what would likely be an ugly bruise later, but she was still in the fight. She crossed her fingers into the familiar sign of the Tiger and got ready to unleash a wave of Shadow Clones upon her enemy. However, she stopped just as she began to mold her chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she been Naruto, it would have been second nature. But now that she had become a near-perfect copy of Hinata, down to having a severely depleted reserve of chakra, Ninata just couldn't use her old tricks anymore. She couldn't produce as many clones as she could in the past, she'd tire herself out in an instant, and it was unlikely she'd be able to recover before this Sound monster dealt with them. What could she do? She couldn't fight like her old male self in Hinata's body. But she didn't know the first thing about how to fight like a real Hyuga either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What do I do? What do I do?</i></span></div></div>",

Taking a deep breath, she lunged for the nearest tree and ran up it, pumping chakra straight to the soles of her bare feet the whole way. She silently thanked Hinata for the water-walking lesson; without it, the former boy doubted she'd be able to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she was nearly shaken off when a sharp tremor ran its way up the trunk. The freaky twin had just pounded the tree with a clenched fist and blew a sizeable hole through the wood. Concentrating her spherical vision on him, Ninata swore that his every visible inch of skin had suddenly become covered by ugly black worm-like marks. She had no idea what they were about, but they couldn't have been good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't escape from me, bitch!\" Sakon growled before letting loose a hurricane of kicks and punches on the tree. The whole plant trembled and shook, and Ninata realize that she was going to need more than just her chakra-enhanced feet to stay on. Fortunately, she managed to gain enough distance and height to reach some branches. With a quick burst of chakra to her feet, she propelled herself off the trunk and onto a nearby branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but wince when she landed. Hinata's feet were just not meant to deal with such terrain. It'd be a while before she rebuilt her calluses, assuming Hinata would let her. <i>I hope she doesn't mind.</i> But that was a problem for another time. She had to think of some way to deal with this Sound freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't stand a chance against him hand to hand like this, and chances are he'd still whoop me if I was my old self.. But I can't just use Shadow Clones against him. What can I do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it hit her. <i>Of course! I may not be able to use Shadow Clone...but maybe, in this new body, I can...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakon was on his way. She could see him making the vertical run up the tree. That gave Ninata a few seconds. Hopefully, that would be all she'd need. Focusing inward on her coils, she began to mold her chakra, carefully putting in just the right amount. Only as much as she needed. No more, no less.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakon was sorely disappointed with the Hyuga girl. Her moxie was just a front; she was nothing but a cowardly little wench whose only talent was running. He wished he had gone for the other chick; she didn't look much tougher, but she at least appeared to be giving Ukon a decent fight, for whatever that was worth. Sakon was certain that if he had taken her on, the fight would have been over by now, but at least it would have given him a chance to skillfully bruise her up before he got ready for some more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he was stuck having to exhaust himself playing tag. Damn it, he was too old for that kind of game. The only games that Sakon liked to play were the ones that involved spilling a lot of blood. Preferably, someone else's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith chakra-enhanced footwork, he dashed up the tree, vaulting onto the branch the Hyuga fled to with a graceful somersault. He looked around. She was nowhere to be seen, but Sakon wasn't fooled. The little nudist didn't have enough time to cover any sort of distance. The most she could hope for was a quick spot among the leaves to duck behind. Sakon would find her. It was only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small rustle to the left told him as much. Smirking with shark-like glee, Sakon got ready to pounce...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Only for a cloud of utterly gorgeous and butt-naked Hyuga girls to sprout from the trees all around him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakon's eyes nearly bugged out of his head as the blood quickly drained out of his brain and shot out of his nose. <i>S-so many...so much naked female flesh...I-I can't...</i>. Words failed him. Rational thought failed him. Sakon could only stare in wonderment as the girls descended upon him, screaming bloody murder the whole time, their nipples hard, their breasts jiggling freely in the air, and their legs spread out, giving him a wide view of so many pink, hairless, dripping wet pussies at once. He didn't even have enough time to bat them away, and he wasn't so sure he really wanted to. He could certainly think of worse ways to die than by a crowd of naked girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of boobs blanketed Sakon's vision and he prepared himself for the end...but instead of feeling the warm, soft, fleshy goodness of feminine beauty upon his face, all the Sound-nin could experience was a whiff of air as the clone harmlessly dissipated on contact in a puff of smoke. It was followed by several others. \"What is this, freaking <i>Bunshin</i>?\" he said, recovering himself. With a swipe of his hand, the twin ninja banished three more clones, cutting through them all without groping a single breast or butt cheek. \"You had better do better than tha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't get to finish that sentence. Because among those illusions, one clone of physical matter moved in, delivered a solid punch to Sakon's back, and immediately followed up with a sweeping kick to his legs. There wasn't a lot of strength to either blow, but having caught him off-guard, they were enough to rob the Sound-nin of his footing and send him flailing back down to the forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==============================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata sighed in relief as she watched the scene unfold from her hiding place. She honestly couldn't believe it actually worked. The simple Clone technique, the bane of her existence, the thorn in her side, the one <i>fucking</i> jutsu she could never ever EVER do, the same one that kept her stuck in the Academy time and time again...had finally been cast successfully for the first time ever! With her hands and with her chakra! And it was all thanks to her wonderful Hyuga eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan had been quite ingenious if she did say so herself. Now that she was able to see the chakra coursing through her body, Ninata could pinpoint just how much she was using. Her problems with the elementary <i>Bunshin no Jutsu</i> came from the fact that her old male self exerted way too much chakra from his overstocked reserves. He couldn't help it, he just had so much on hand that it was always just about ready to burst out of his coils, he had no idea how to carefully mold such quantities with his young childish body, and nobody could really show him how to. But that was no longer a problem thanks to her diminished reserves and godlike vision. It was truly a blessing in disguise. Now Ninata could see just how much chakra she was using and could cast that infernal jutsu without any problems, all the while leaving plenty left over to make a Shadow Clone. And the whole thing worked beautifully; the regular clones distracted the girly man with their fantastic sexiness and gave the lone physical clone the opportunity to send him packing. If luck was with Ninata, the fall itself would kill him, or at least render him inert for the rest of the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it was still a physically-intensive task for the former boy. Making all those clones honestly felt like a punch to the gut for her. Her lungs were on fire, her side ached with an intense cramp, and her heart was beating in her chest like a hammer. Ninata really hoped she had taken that freak out with her plan, because she didn't think she'd be able to pull it off again. It was all she could do just to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata shook her head, hoping to banish the sleep from her eyes. \"Can't...do that yet,\" she gasped, pushing herself up. \"Have to...find...nata-chan.\" The naked girl stumbled on her feet to the trunk of the tree and leaned her form against it, wincing slightly as the rough bark bit into her sensitive skin. Dropping down to the forest floor in her current state was downright suicidal, so she would have to wait to recover her energy for a minute or so. She just hoped Hinata would be able to handle herself during that time.</span></div></div>",

Fighting against an enemy who wanted to kill you and possibly do something <i>else</i> would do that for anyone, and the fact that she had nothing on to protect her body didn't help.  But what really set the girl on edge was Ninata. They had been split up early on, unable to help one another, and she could see that her girlfriend needed all the help she could get. Her transformed crush was struggling just to avoid being crushed by the clearly older and more skillful Sound-nin. It took every ounce of willpower on Hinata's part to not break off from her own opponent to go help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe that's what I should have done</i>, she had told herself, that usual doubtful voice in her head resurfacing after it had seemingly faded away a few days ago. She shook the thought away. Hinata knew she couldn't let the ninja she was facing have an opening. If he incapacitated her in any way, then providing any sort of help to Ninata would be impossible. If Shino was here with all his logic and pragmatism, that's what'd he tell her. But it wasn't just that. Hinata didn't know how to describe it, but something about this man called Ukon was off. Something about the way his hands felt every time they made contact with her body, however briefly, made her skin crawl. She didn't know what it was, but the Hyuga really, really, <b>really</b> didn't want to feel his touch any more than necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Ninata split and ran for the trees, putting more distance between her and Hinata, the born-Hyuga's heart had just about gone into her throat. If she was that far away, and Sakon was able to finally land a bone-crushing hand on her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I have to end this now!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata thrust an open-palmed hand straight at Ukon's chest. It was a reckless move, one that would leave her open to a counterattack if he caught on, but she had to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd judging by his evil grin, he did indeed see it. Ukon ducked under Hinata's outstretched arm like water and threw a punch straight for her solar plexus. In the moment he did so, hideous black marks suddenly oozed across his skin like fiery worms. In that instance, it seemed like his whole arm drew more momentum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Hinata caught on to the Sound-nin's attack, and not just through her vision. She could feel the rush of air on her bare stomach and on the underside of her boobs, the sensation of something too hard and fast for the naked eye to detect making its way toward her person. With a pivot of her foot, she pirouetted out of the way like a masterful dancer, feeling the air whip around the circumference of her whole body as Ukon's fist sailed past her. Hinata bit back the relief sigh that threatened to escape from her throat. If she had been wearing her jacket, heck, if she had been wearing anything at all, then she would not have detected that attack coming as early as she did. <i>Maybe there's something to fighting naked after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she was not going to seriously consider that. She needed to focus on the matter at hand, as much as it galled her to be so far from Ninata. Luckily, it looked like she finally had her opening; Ukon's back was practically to her. Already molding as much chakra as she could muster, the naked girl threw a palm directly at his exposed flank...</span></div></div>",

What happened next, Hinata would never forget. An unearthly red aura covered the ninja, seemingly turning all of his flesh into lava until nary a speck of pale could be seen. And before she knew it, his features had twisted and changed, becoming angular and monstrous. What now laid before her barely resembled a human. With vermillion flesh, yellow eyes backed by vicious black sclera, gleaming fangs, and a single horn jutting out of his forehead, Ukon now looked more like an Oni of legend. A very vicious and angry Oni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing that had once been Ukon launched itself at Hinata with an inhuman battle cry and even more inhuman speed. Hinata got ready to roll out of the way, but even the increased sensitivity that her naked body afforded her was not enough; in a flash, she was on her back, her sizable chest heaving in pain from where the monster had struck her, and that unpleasant feeling of the Sound-nin's touch on her body could be felt all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer only assurance was that, from what she could see, Ninata was starting to come back and she appeared to be fine.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ninata took her time retracing her steps back to her girlfriend. Sliding down the tree had been a hazardous affair with her exhaustion, but she was able to do it. She wished that she could activate her Byakugan just so that she could see where Sakon had fallen, and hopefully make sure he was truly out of the fight, but she just didn't have the energy or the chakra reserves for it. Maybe she would after she caught her breath, but it most certainly would not be now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the sight that greeted her once Hinata came into view was not a pleasant one. The other Sound freak leaped with starling speed and accuracy and had the born-Hyuga girl on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Ninata whispered in the smallest voice she ever spoke in, her heart nearly skipping a beat. It couldn't be happening; her Hinata-chan couldn't be losing, not now. \"No!\" she howled, louder this time as she began to pick up speed, her exhaustion forgotten about as a sudden surge of adrenaline began to course through her veins. The wind flew past her body and chilled her naked skin, but she didn't care. The feeling of roots, rocks and thorns stabbed into the soles of her feet, but she didn't care. Her large breasts bounced uncomfortably with every step she took, but she didn't care. Hinata was in danger, and Ninata would be damned if she just stood by and let anything happen to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RRRRAAAAHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have enough time to finish that thought before an unearthly force slammed into her from the side. The world spun into a blur as she rolled over the leafy ground before coming to a stop alongside a surfacing tree root. She was face down on the ground and something was pressing into her back, squishing her breasts painfully into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a nasty trick you pulled,\" said a deep and demonic voice that made Ninata shiver. \"But it's the end for you now, little slut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what...who...are you?\" Ninata stammered as she tried to push herself up, even as her body commanded her to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing above stomped on her back in response, kicking her form back to the earth and grinding its heel into her spine. Ninata whimpered painfully. \"Oh, you don't remember me?\" he said mockingly. \"And I thought we were getting along so well. It's me. Sakon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. He wasn't dead yet. Her ploy hadn't worked. \"L-let me...go!\" Ninata panted, trying once more to get to her feet, but her body just wouldn't respond, not with her exhaustion and the inhuman strength holding her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be like that. I was thinking we should get more...intimately acquainted right about now,\" he said, punctuating his statement with a loud slurping sound as his tongue ran around his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what...do you...\" Ninata's stopped as the implication behind his words sunk in. Her blood ran cold. And then she heard the distinctive sound of cloth slipping off a body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no. No, no, no, no, no!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked girl's mind went into complete overdrive. She looked back and forth for something, anything she could reach for. A rock, a stick, a stray kunai, anything she could use as a weapon. Finding nothing, she elected instead to push herself upright again. Weight or no weight, she couldn't let this go on any further. Luckily, the mass of the Sound-nin shifted as he took his foot off her to change position, giving her a chance to move her arms. Unfortunately, he didn't leave her with enough time to get away before he seized both her limbs and pulled them painfully up behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata tried to thrash, tried to struggle, but her body just...would not...MOVE! Why couldn't she move? Was she really that weak in Hinata's body? Was Sakon really that strong? Was she just that exhausted? Deprived of all other options, the girl did the only thing she could think of: scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLLP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit crying!\" said Sakon, lifting her form up a bit just so he could slam it into the ground. Ninata's scream faded into a moan as her whole world turned blurry and her head began ringing loudly. But she could still hear the demonic voice of Sakon as he whispered directly into her ear. \"Just lay down and enjoy this. I guarantee, you'll feel like a virgin again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began to well up in Ninata's lavender eyes. It was coming, that monster's horrible spiny member, it was coming to pierce that most sacred treasure of her feminine body. And there was nothing she could do about it. She couldn't...she couldn't...she couldn't even think anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUkon normally considered himself a rational man. He didn't revel in playing with his food like his irresponsible brother always did; he just wanted them dead and done with. Unfortunately, everything about this particular enemy was ruining that for him. While he was not so easily seduced by the provocative ways many kunoichi liked to present themselves, it was a whole other story to face such a pretty young one in the buff. Oh, how desperately he wanted to fuse with her large and surprisingly mature bosoms, especially as they danced and jiggled with her graceful movements. But alas, he could not. He knew very well what the Hyugas were capable of doing with those poetically fluid movements of theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombat wasn't normally Ukon's forte, but he figured the Hyuga girl would go down soon enough. She was small, young, and clearly inexperienced in the ways of mortal combat. Even someone like he should have been able to dispatch her with no problems. Unfortunately, after a few moments into the fight, he quickly realized he had not only underestimated her, but she also clearly had the one thing Ukon knew he didn't: patience. Worse, her brazen nakedness and his rapidly growing tiredness were only eroding it faster, and that kidney shot she just gave him pretty much killed what little he had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Ukon was no longer thinking straight when he immediately activated his Cursed Seal and tackled her. Internal organs be damned, the only thing he wanted now was to see this little whore suffer! He drew in a deep breath, stifled the pained groan that his ailing side threatened to birth, sat up to straddle her form, and got ready to begin the process of invading her body cell by cell and molecule by molecule. He'd start with her delicious breasts, screwing his hands straight into them. Then he'd move on to her pelvis, joining it with his own and giving himself a taste of Heaven as he sent her straight to Hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll save her pretty little face for last. I want to see her scream!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the girl was not going to take this face down. Just as Ukon was getting ready to swoop down on her, the Hyuga's face twisted into a fierce and most unladylike grimace, and she threw another openhanded punch that hit straight and true!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The force of the blow was enough to send the mutated Sound-nin flying off the girl's prone form. Not because the blow itself was strong, oh no, but because it felt like a bomb had gone off inside of him! The little bitch hit the exact same side she had struck previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" he groaned, clutching his flank as if he was trying desperately to keep his innards in place, even though he knew there was nothing he could do. Ukon had no way to confirm it, but he was quite certain that his kidney was now a mess of gore inside of him. <i>Guess her waters </i>do<i> run deep.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked Hyuga, however, did not give him a verbal response. She merely kicked herself up onto her feet with one fluid motion, wincing only slightly from the pain she was quite clearly feeling in her breasts. She glared furiously at the Sound-nin before her, looking very much like a feral beast with her clenched teeth and the throbbing veins pulsing in and around her eyes. Her nudity only added to the image now; it no longer made her appear sexy and nubile, but savage and animalistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was charging at him again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUkon did the only thing he could think of: he rolled away. \"Stay away from me!\" he cried throwing a few kunai her way. She dodged effortlessly without so much as a misstep. It was disgraceful, and the normal tone of Ukon's voice indicated that he had reverted to his human form without realizing it. But he couldn't help it. He couldn't fight her, not like this. He had to get away, as far away as he could, back to the warm, safe confines of his brother's flesh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nii-san...I have to find nii-san!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLLP!\" screamed a soft feminine voice in the distance. It was only then when the Hyuga girl suddenly paused, her furious scowl suddenly flickering to an expression of fear. That was his opportunity; Ukon aimed a high kick at the girl's face with as much power as he could muster. He hit her in the jaw, sent her face skyward, and used the moment to flee in the direction of the scream. His flank burned with pain, and in his grip, he could distinctly feel something sloshing around disgustingly in there, but he bit it back. Pain was temporary. He could handle it. He had to. And when he got back into his brother, everything...everything would be all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was dark. Everything was blurry. Everything <b>hurt</b>. And all Ninata could do was sit there and wait for...it to come. To pierce her. To invade her. Or maybe it was already there, thrusting, digging and stabbing into her sensitive flesh against her will. Maybe the blow to her head had mercifully knocked her unconscious or numbed her whole body, freeing her from the degradation she was being subjected to. She supposed she should be thankful for that. About the only thing she could feel anymore were the warm rivulets of water running down her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut truth be told, she didn't think she had any more tears left to shed. Even if she did, there was no point to crying anymore. She frankly didn't deserve to cry. She didn't deserve to do <i>anything</i>. It's not like she could anyway. She couldn't fight a single Sound-nin. She couldn't help her comrades-in-arms. She couldn't save her friend, Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should've listened to Hinata-chan. I shouldn't have ever come here. I...sh-shouldn't even be...</i></span></div></div>",

Something ancient. Something...primal. <i>No</i>, she mentally whispered as she opened her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>I will not let it end this way!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Ninata burst. Not into flames, but into burning red chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAGGGHHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hit Sakon like an angry bull and burned him like a raging inferno. One second, he was about ready to claim his prize, the sharp spike of his cock hard, throbbing, and ready to penetrate the pink cunt of the Hyuga slut beneath him. The next, he was blown onto his back by an unseen force and howling in pain as heat scorched into his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUUUUUUUUUUU-!\" he screamed, his hand going straight to his flaring crotch, which had taken the worst of it. \"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU TO ME?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up to stare at the Hyuga girl. An aura of fiery crimson chakra surrounded her form, and it burned with an unholy anger older than time. If she was aware of its presence, she made no sign of it. She merely pushed herself up onto her feet, the exhaustion she had been clearly displaying just moments ago completely gone. For a moment she stood straight, the muscles in her slender form stiffening, and her firm round buttocks briefly clenching tantalizingly. Sakon would have drooled at the sight if he was not feeling the searing burn down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wouldn't have had any time to anyway. For after getting her bearings, the girl whipped around and neatly caved his skull in with a chakra-enhanced fist to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===============================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good, feeling the fox's chakra course its way through her coils. Ninata felt renewed the moment it flared up within her; all of her weariness vanished in an instant, and she was able to finally call upon the strength she needed to shake this...thing calling itself a Sound ninja off of her. When her dainty fist connected with his face, which had gotten a lot uglier since the last time she saw it, she could feel the power behind it. Ninata couldn't help but smile foxily when she heard the satisfying crunch of a nose being broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Take that, you bastard freak of nature!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ninata was far from finished. She was not going to stand back, not after knowing what he had been ready to do to her. She was going to make him <b>pay</b>! She threw another punch straight at Sakon's ribs, knocking him on his back again with a strangled gasp. The sharp demonic features on his face receded until he looked like his old effeminate self again, and he could only stare in utter shock at how the tables had turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was good. Now he'd know what it was like to be helpless and at the utter mercy of an enemy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUkon could not have gotten there fast enough, and when he did, he could only shake his head at the sight of it. It was almost comical in a way; Sakon was sprawled on the ground with his pants around his ankles, and he was being beaten into submission by a little female ninja without a stitch of clothing on her. \"How did you...get yourself...into this mess...nii-san?\" he asked himself, wincing with every syllable he uttered. It hurt to breathe now that the adrenaline high was cooling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he was disturbed by the Hyuga girl Sakon was dealing with. The flaming red chakra enveloping her was not something somebody her age and level of experience should be capable of doing. There was only one thing he could think of that could allow her to pull that off, but he refused to accept it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's just not possible. We would have known about it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUkon shook his head. It wouldn't do him or his brother any good thinking about it. The only important thing was that both he and Sakon were in bad shape and they desperately needed to get back together ASAP. And if he was going to do that, then he would have to deal with this kunoichi first. Her back was to him; knocking her aside would be easy. But merging with her was another possibility. It'd be a risky move, but if he succeeded, then they'd be down one enemy right then and there. And with her gone...they could deal with the <i>other </i>monster together...</span></div></div>",

And with that, he got his answer. <i>That chakra's too dangerous. I can't take the risk fusing with her.</i> As satisfying as it would have been to watch and feel the naked girl die within him, the urge to get back inside his brother was much stronger. With a sharp squeeze of his ailing side, the Sound ninja took two long strides and kicked the fiery Hyuga with all his might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flew off Sakon with a startled cry, but whatever pain she experienced rapidly evaporated as she rolled through the air and landed on all four limbs like a cat. Ukon didn't wait to see what she would do next; he simply knelt down onto his brother's form and let their bodies melt together. He sighed in relief and satisfaction as he felt Sakon's chakra and flesh intermingle with his own; both were already starting to work their magic, soothing the agony raging throughout his body. It was better than any massage he had ever been given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really...need to...watch yourself...getting...beaten by a...girl like that,\" Ukon whispered between labored breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one...to talk,\" Sakon shot back, his face an ugly mess of bruises and welts. \"What the...hell...happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hit...organ,\" Ukon gasped, his voice straining at the words. Just thinking about what the little wench did to him hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll do this together,\" said Sakon as he pushed himself up, feeling invigorated from having Ukon with him again. The throbbing pain in his face was quickly fading away, and the burning sensation on his groin was completely gone. He felt like he could stand up now. \"It's already feeling better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis relief was short-lived when the Hyuga girl, still cloaked in her fiery aura, flew into his face with a clenched fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata dreaded what she would see when she leaped into the bend. Horrifying images of her Ninata-chan being beaten to within an inch of her life, torn to shreds, eaten alive, or raped flooded her mind, so much that she almost couldn't bring herself to continue. And worse, the other Sound-nin, Ukon, had beaten her to the scene. If Ninata had any hope for survival now, it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what she saw instead had to have been the single most beautiful thing she could imagine. Sakon and Ukon had fused together into one being again, their pants (or at least Sakon's) were down, and they were both being thoroughly thrashed! Hinata's girlfriend, still naked as the day she was born, was unleashing upon them a fearsome flurry of kicks and punches that came out so fast, the conjoined twins couldn't hope to escape. What her blows lacked in finesse, they more than made up for in raw power, as every attack she made left yet another mark on the Sound-nins. The only thing that somewhat unnerved the born-Hyuga girl was the storm of chakra burning around Ninata. She made a mental note to ask her about that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene was bizarre. It was farcical. And it was strangely arousing. Ninata had her back to Hinata, giving the latter a full view of the gentle curves and taught muscles in her back, muscles that Hinata didn't even know her own slender body had. But what really took her breath away was the sight of Ninata's wondrous ass. The way the round luscious orbs swayed and jiggled with every punch she threw, and how they parted with every kick she delivered, giving Hinata a full view of her pink pussy lips, was nothing short of tantalizing. And how her creamy flesh glowed red in the flaming aura around her was something else. If their lives weren't currently in the balance, Hinata most likely would have shot her fingers into her own lips and masturbated right there on the spot. The tingling sensation between her legs was making that very tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut pleasure would have to wait. They needed to put these monsters down now. Priming her hands for another jyuuken strike, the blunette charged forward, ready to end this battle in one decisive blow. In this moment, nothing else mattered. Not the air whistling past her ivory skin, nor the rhythmic bouncing of her breasts, or even the soft trail of glistening moisture trickling from her sex. The only thing she cared about was victory.</span></div></div>",

With a panicked cry, he extended a leg from the depths of his brother's body and launched another decisive kick at Ninata. It collided with her ribs and sent her rolling to the ground again. But just like the last time he did that, it did little to slow her down, for she was on her feet in less than a second. But that second was all that was needed, for now that he was free of her violent fury, the battered and bruised Sakon was now able to act. He quickly withdrew a small bomb-like object from his tunic and hurled it to the ground. Instinctively, Hinata stopped where she was and tried to shield her eyes with her hand, but it was too late. There was a flash, a loud bang, and before she knew it, searing white light flooded her enhanced vision. With a cry, she fell down, the veins in her temples retracting as her Byakugan deactivated. She clutched her face as her eyes burned hot, unable to see anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A flashbang. And a powerful one too. I was careless.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata lied prone, rubbing her eyes desperately. Blurry whiteness was all around her, and for a moment, she began to fear that she had gone blind. But as soon as that thought crossed her mind, things began to dim. Shadows returned to her sight and everything sharpened like a film reel brought into focus. It wasn't anything special; just an ordinary flashbang that induced temporary visual irritation over a wider radius than usual. Sitting up, the naked girl looked around. Sakon and Ukon were nowhere to be seen, but thankfully, Ninata was still in sight.</span></div></div>",

Every vein-like passageway in the girl, every Tenketsu point on her skin, every possible area that could hold chakra looked seriously swollen and enflamed, as though a thousand bees had worked their way into her flesh and stung them. \"Ninata-chan, your chakra coils have been severely burned,\" she said in as clinical a tone as she could muster, though an edge of worry still dribbled out. \"They've...undergone a lot of stress, possibly from that...red chakra you were using.\" Now she really wanted to ask about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Ninata snarled, pounding a fist weakly into the ground. \"Can't do...anything right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's alright, it's not permanent, you'll heal,\" said Hinata, pulling her girlfriend up to her knees to hug her reassuringly. She suppressed a shudder when she felt her hard nipple prod into the soft flesh of Ninata's bare boob, though it also made her bite her lip in frustration. Why couldn't she just be back at the riverbank? Why couldn't she and Ninata just lose themselves to the carnal hunger for each other's flesh that they both constantly craved? Why did they have to be here? It wasn't fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just need to...rest a little,\" she continued, shoving her anger off to the side. Letting her emotions and her lust out wouldn't do either of them any good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, we can't. We, we have to find them!\" Ninata weakly pushed herself back so that she could look directly into Hinata's eyes. \"I...I b-broke that f-freak's nose. But...but when the other one merged with...him, it, it...I saw it go back into place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Ninata-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think...they can...uurrghh...heal when they're together. If we don't...find them soon, th-then they'll be...co-completely restored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we need to take this chance to retreat ourselves,\" said Hinata, standing and pulling her twin up with her, draping Ninata's arm across her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" cried Ninata. \"We...we have to fight-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in no position to fight, Ninata-chan,\" said Hinata in a rare and strangely authoritative tone. \"Right now, we need to get as far away from here as we can. Find somewhere to hide, catch our breath, maybe find the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata looked like she was about to argue some more, but Hinata continued. \"Besides, I don't see the Sound-nins anywhere. I don't think they'll be coming back anytime soon. They're demoralized, need to lick their wounds, and as far as they know, we're both still healthy. They won't be coming back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata sighed in resignation and let herself fall limply on her girlfriend. \"A...alright. Good point. We'll do what you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked in silence together on the forest floor, one identical naked girl supporting the weight of the other. Hinata would have normally loved the close skin-on-skin contact, and on some level she <i>was</i> enjoying it. Even under the circumstances they were in, she couldn't resist trailing a hand down to cup the soft flesh of Ninata's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she couldn't help but be concerned. Ninata was slightly feverish and clearly in pain. The way she winced and groaned heavily with each step she took reminded Hinata of how she personally felt whenever she had been forced to work, train or fight with blisters on her palms and feet. While she'd never know what Ninata was exactly experiencing right now, she imagined the poor girl honestly felt like she was rolling around in a bed of hot coals. There weren't going to be any long-term problems for the former boy, Hinata was confident of that...but whether she liked it or not, fighting anymore today was simply out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Hinata's mind couldn't help but go back to the crimson chakra that Ninata had summoned. <i> Where did it come from? Why haven't I heard of anything like that before? Is it due to her transformation? Or was it something else?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Hinata loved Naruto's transformation into Ninata, there were still a plethora of mysteries surrounding its nature. And now that she wasn't in a position to enjoy her twin's body, she now had no choice but to think about it. What had caused the change? Why had the boy turned into her of all people? Why were they so drawn to each other? And what other effects would the transformation have? There were so many questions, and with even the two most knowledgeable ninjas in the village completely stumped, answers would not be coming anytime soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Why...am I so...useless?\" Ninata whispered, interrupting Hinata's train of thought. \"Why...can't I do...anything right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not useless, Ninata-chan,\" said Hinata, drawing her in close for a comforting half-hug. \"You're just not used to my body is all. I know that if you work hard, you'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata wasn't going to hear it though. \"I just...wanted...to save Sasuke. I just wanted...to be useful. But nothing's...gone right today! Nothing! Every time...every time I think I've...made some...progress...something always makes me...weak.\" Her body shivered as though a cold wind had passed over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's words caused Hinata's heart to nearly break in two. She had heard them many times before in her life in that exact voice. But at the same time, something was telling her that Ninata really did not need a shoulder to cry on right now. What she needed was a dose of reality. Experience had taught Hinata that wallowing in self-pity wouldn't get anything done, and now was definitely not the right time for that. Some situations called for a little more bluntness than usual. \"Ninata-chan,\" she said in a gentle but firm tone, \"I know exactly how you're feeling. But you're not ready for this kind of situation. You should...you should that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do know that!\" snapped Ninata, causing Hinata to nearly jump. It was the first time she had ever spoken to Hinata with any sort of anger, and the born Hyuga couldn't help but flinch as if she had been physically slapped. \"But I...can't be expected...to do nothing. Not when...my friend is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a team of ninjas were on it!\" Hinata snapped back through clenched teeth. \"Shikamaru-san and the others had the situation under control! We honestly shouldn't have come here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not like Hinata to use such a sharp tone, especially toward the one she loved, but she was not having the best of days right now. When she had brought Ninata into the woods to train, she had all sorts of lofty expectations in mind. She wanted to help her twin get familiar with her new body, show her some of the new techniques she herself had been working on, swim, dance, have a fun and romantic time together, make passionate love with the splendor of nature all around them...only for it all to be horribly dashed thanks to some unwanted passerbys. And over the course of...oh, she didn't know how much time had passed since then, she had been seen completely naked by her peers, got herself nearly killed multiple times, saw Ninata almost die without being able to do anything about it, and was now being shouted down by the one person she pined her whole life for. Hinata was stressed, frightened, humiliated beyond measure, and her usually bottomless patience was starting to wear as much as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to top it all off, her loins were <i>still</i> tingling with want and arousal. Moisture occasionally dripped out of her nether regions and trickled down her legs while her swollen clit brushed against her labia again and again. It begged her for attention; it wanted to be stroked, pinched, diddled, licked and sucked. And it was driving her crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's...it?\" Ninata hissed, her voice laced with ice. She probably would have shouted if such an action didn't hurt so much. \"We should lie back when our friends...and fellow...ninja...need our help? I expected...urgh...better of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hateful tone and the deathly glare she felt Ninata bore into her struck Hinata like a gentle fist straight to the heart. Where did Ninata get off accusing her of that? What made her think that Hinata didn't care about her fellow Leaf-nin, even if hardly a single one of them was aware she even existed? What the hell did Ninata know? The young Hyuga liked to think she shared the former blonde's endless idealism, but one didn't need the Byakugan to see reality. \"What help can we provide?\" she said in an equally cold tone. \"We're naked, you're injured, and you can barely even do basic jutsu! What could we possibly do for anyone right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! But ninjas...can't just...give up and turn away. Only a...selfish <b>coward</b>...turns her back on her...village...and friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata balled her hands up into fists. <i>So I'm a selfish coward now, is that how you see me?</i> she thought, her teeth grinding loudly in the stillness of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't do this anymore. For what had to be the first time in her life, something in the Hyuga girl snapped. \"So that's how it is?\" Hinata nearly shouted, her eyes welling up instantly. \"I'm a selfish coward because I don't want you die? Because I won't let you throw your life away, just like that?! You want to go out and die pointlessly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't intend on dying-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you will, Ninata-chan! In your current state, you won't stand a chance against any of these Sound ninjas! And I'm doing everything I can to keep that from happening! But none of that means anything to you!\" Screaming and sobbing openly, the blunette dropped both her Byakugan and Ninata into a heap on the ground. \"Fine then! Go out and get killed if that's what you really want! Leave me! Just like everyone else has!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata only looked up at her in shock. If she felt any pain from her fall, she made no sign of it. \"H-Hinata-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always the same!\" wept Hinata, her mind a whirlwind of chaos. \"No matter how much I try, I'm never good enough for anyone! It's just like Neiji-niisan says. Nothing ever changes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Ninata looked like she was the one who had been kicked, though in Hinata's mind, that was likely from the lingering pain in her coils. It's not like a damn thing she ever said would get through the dense girl's skull anyway. \"Go! Die! Fuck Sasuke like every other girl wants to since he's more precious to you than I ever was, even when he treats you like dirt. I don't care anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hinata,\" said Ninata in the smallest voice imaginable, her face crumpling up as though someone had balled it up in their hands like a sheet of paper. \"I...I'm sor-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark shadow descended on them, and before either girl could react, a large humanoid form crashed upon the earth.</span></div></div>",

She knew that voice. She knew that tone. And just hearing it caused a ghostly chill to fall over her. \"Oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to interrupt your little lovers' spat, sweethearts,\" said Sakon as he thrust an arm out and seized the startled Hinata by her neck. \"But my brother and I have a few matters to <i>discuss</i> with you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the small girl up in the air, his lengthy reach keeping the Hyuga out of striking distance from his torso. Hinata gagged helplessly in his grip, her normally soft voice reduced to choking growl as the flow of life-giving oxygen was cut off from her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Ninata cried, reaching her hand out to them from her position on the ground. They were only a few feet away, but with what little strength she could muster in her current state, they might as well have been on the other side of the globe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give her a chance to fight back, niisan,\" said Ukon, positioning his head right next to Sakon so he could look his enemy in the eye before she died. Both of them looked much healthier than before; their wounds had healed nicely, their skin had returned to its healthy shade of ivory, and there appeared to be no amount of discomfort between them. \"Break her neck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Ukon,\" said Sakon as he tightened his grip on the naked Hyuga's throat, savoring the faint wheeze that escaped her dainty lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic overtook Ninata. Her girlfriend was in trouble. She was dying. They were killing her, choking the life out of Hinata. Her large lavender eyes were bulging out of her sockets, her struggles to escape from their grasp were rapidly slowing down. She tried to strike Sakon's arm with her family's trademark jyuuken, but it seemed she couldn't so much as insert a drop of chakra into her fingertips. The taller ninja didn't even flinch at her touch. And there was nothing Ninata could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...nata,\" she wailed in her weak voice, trying to push herself up. No, she couldn't give up, not NOW of all times. She could do this. It wasn't as bad as the last time she was flat on the ground in front of these freaks. She had energy now. She had strength. It just...hurt a lot to use it. But she could handle it. She would do anything for her Hinata-chan. Any pain was worth enduring as long as it meant Hinata was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the more force she put into her muscles, the more the heat in her coils flared up. Getting herself up to a sitting position was like rolling around on a bed of needles. <i>No problem, I'll just call on my lazy-ass tenant again</i>, she thought with a joyless smile. <i>We'll save Hinata together.</i> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But as Ninata looked up at her girlfriend, she sadly realized that there was no way in hell she would ever be able to stop Sakon or even reach him fast enough on even the Kyubi's power. Hinata was going to die. She was going to die resenting Ninata and thinking that the former boy didn't care about her at all. All because Ninata had been stupid enough to think she could actually save Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm sorry Hinata-chan. I'm sorry for being so insensitive. I'm sorry for calling you a selfish coward. I didn't want this to happen, I didn't want to leave you. Please...don't leave me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it happened. A spiraling white tornado seemingly tore through the forest until it careened into the shared stomach of the single-bodied twins with all the force of a charging bull. They squealed in unison as they were sent flying into the nearest tree, leaving a neat Sakon-and-Ukon-shaped crater in its trunk, dropping Hinata neatly next to Ninata. When everything came to a stop, the small vortex stopped spinning, came to rest on the ground, and vanished completely, leaving in its place a little white puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the other side of the girls, less than twenty feet away, stood Inuzuka Kiba, wearing an expression of pure unmitigated hate focused with pinpoint accuracy at the Sound-nins. \"Get away from her, you BITCH!\" he roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=========================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata wasn't able to see what happened next. She heard the sound of rushing air and crunching leaves, followed by the growls and barks of violence, not all of which were human. She was too distracted by her coughing, the crushing sensation she felt in her throat, and her own burning lungs that gasped desperately for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata-chan,\" Ninata murmured as she reached a hand over to the blunette who only a few seconds ago was a hair's breadth away from death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm fine,\" Hinata wheezed in a gravelly tone. \"Just....need to breathe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nodded and let her girlfriend catch her breath, all the while keeping a hand planted on the hunched girl's bare shoulder and trying her best to ignore the fighting happening not too far away. After a few moments, Hinata stopped coughing and her breathing regulated. She rubbed at her windpipe, which still felt soar, but it looked like she wouldn't suffer any lasting damage. With that out of the way, she locked eyes with Ninata's. They had never looked bigger, redder, or more watery before in her life, and her whole face was twisted into an expression of relief mixed with deep remorse. Whatever anger Hinata felt towards her double before was gone in that very moment. She was just thankful to be able to see her love again in any capacity, as heartbreaking as it looked right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could say anything though, Kiba suddenly appeared beside them. \"If you two can get moving, do so now. Shikamaru and the others really need at least one pair of Hyuga eyes,\" he said, looking forward in the distance. Whether he was trying to keep an eye on the Sound twins, or avoid looking at the unclothed Hyuga twins was anybody's guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba-kun,\" said Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go west!\" barked Kiba in a tone that told her not to argue. \"Find Shikamaru. Akamaru and I will handle these guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata and Ninata exchanged troubled glances. \"But, Kiba-kun,\" said Hinata, \"Ninata-chan's injured. She can't move too well in this state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, Kiba reached into a pocket in his coat and threw a pouch, which Hinata only barely caught. She recognized its contents immediately: his family's special brand of soldier pills. \"Give her those. Adrenaline, chakra supplements, pain killers, the works. Just get <b>moving!</b> And for Kami's sake, <b>stay low</b> and avoid the archer!\" He didn't give either girl a chance to respond. Drawing a pair of kunai, he leaped back into the fray alongside Akamaru, who had been keeping the Sound duo held back all that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba,\" said Ninata as she looked on, a note of gratitude and concern in her voice, but he was now too far away to be able to hear her. He tackled the conjoined Sound ninjas along with Akamaru, who had transformed into a carbon copy of his master. Within a few chaotic seconds of fighting, it became impossible to tell who was supposed to be the human and the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, do what he says,\" said Hinata as she handed a pill to Ninata. Hinata didn't particularly like to use these pills. They left one exhausted and utterly drained after a few days, prolonged use could have harmful effects on various parts of the body, and there was always a danger of getting addicted to them. Many a foolish ninja had felt the need to consume similar pills before every fight, and while the drugs ensured they would never fall in battle, they would shorten their lives in other ways. But there was no arguing with the pills' results. They induced rapid chakra and adrenaline production in the body, sharpened the senses, and could do wonders at numbing pain, which in part made them a pretty useful medical tool in a pinch. And that last part was something Ninata really needed right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nodded and swallowed the pill, gagging and retching as it slid down her slender neck. \"Ugh, tastes nasty,\" she muttered, her voice already starting to sound a bit healthier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you walk, Ninata-chan?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata shrugged. \"Still hurt for now. Help me up and let me lean on you for a bit, and we'll see how well this stuff works soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded and did exactly that, pulling her double up, holding her close at the waist with one hand while Ninata slung an arm across her shoulder. She prepared to take a step when a familiar-sounding cry cut the air around her. Hinata stole a glance back. Kiba was being held aloft in Sakon's hand, the Sound-nin scowling at him with a hateful expression as those hideous black marks spread across his skin. He then slammed the boy hard into the ground, shaking the earth furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart stopped. Kiba was hurt, and while she liked to think that her teammate and friend, who was much like the older brother she wished she had, could handle himself in a fight, she didn't know how he would fare against this kind of enemy. The Hyuga suddenly felt a strong urge to set Ninata down somewhere and return to the fight, so she could...help him in some capacity. She knew more about the Sound twins' fighting style than anyone else here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But he told me to find Shikamaru. He told me the others need our eyes, and it sounds like they're in danger.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was stuck. It seemed like everyone needed her help, but she couldn't be everywhere at once. If the Byakugan was absolutely needed, then of course she would use it where applicable. As much as she wanted to just turn back to Konoha, she understood that it was too late for that; both she and Ninata were in deep and couldn't just get away. But now, the urge to help Kiba was absolutely overpowering. She couldn't stomach the thought of having to leave him behind. All of a sudden, she fully understood why Ninata was so desperate to save Sasuke. Sasuke may have been nasty to Naruto, especially recently...but Ninata still considered him to be her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What do I do? What do I do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Ninata, hoping to see if her girlfriend could give her an answer, to see if she could tell her what to do. Ninata simply stared back at her, wearing a look of complete understanding. \"Do what you think is right.\"</span></div></div>",

The pair had been moving at a steady jog across the forest for a while now, following Kiba's advice to stay low, without a single word passing between them. So when the boy-turned-girl spoke, it was a bit startling. \"Um, about what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata looked absolutely miserable. She wasn't bruised in the slightest, which Hinata noted with some curiosity, and she could feel the girl putting more strength into her footsteps, indicating that the soldier pill was doing its work. But with the expression she was wearing, one would be forgiven for thinking she had just been kicked in the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For saying those things,\" said Ninata, who looked like she was going to cry any second now. \"They were wrong and completely uncalled for, and I was stupid for even thinking them. You're not a coward, Hinata-chan, you never were. If you were, you would have just left my stupid, useless ass behind, and maybe you should have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gasped in horror. \"Ninata-chan! You shouldn't think like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But you didn't. And I was dumb for not realizing why. Just like I never realized why you always blushed around me all these years. Here I am, not realizing how much you care even when it's blindingly obvious.\" Ninata tried to laugh, but it ended up sounding more like a choked sob. \"I don't want to leave you! And I don't want you to leave me! Please...don't leave me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata was nearly hysterical. She wept heavily, not loud enough to draw attention, but it was clear that she wouldn't be capable of speech for some time. It made Hinata want to start tearing up as well. She stopped her movement, and turned to face her twin, wrapping her arms around the girl's shaking body. Even though they looked exactly the same, stood at the exact same height, had the exact same weight, and were 'wearing' the exact same 'suit,' Ninata still felt so small to her. \"I'm sorry too, Ninata-chan,\" she said, leaning forward so that their foreheads met. \"I lost my temper when I shouldn't have, and said some hurtful things too. But no matter what, I will <b>never</b> leave you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata tightened her grip into Hinata's bare back, her carefully trimmed fingernails digging hard into the born-Hyuga's soft flesh, but Hinata did not so much as flinch. She merely used it as an opportunity to pull the girl closer to her, savoring her warmth and running a hand through her beautiful midnight hair. <i>I wonder how it will look if it's longer?</i> she idly thought, her mind going to a more peaceful place. <i>We'll just have to see if we get out of here. </i>When<i> we get out of here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I know,\" said Ninata after a moment. Now in a much calmer state of mind, she lifted her head so that she could stare directly into Hinata's large lavender eyes, which mirrored her own. Her lips twitched uncontrollably as if she was trying to think of something to say. Hinata knew that no words were needed; she leaned her face into Ninata's, her lips poised, puckered and ready to meet her twin's.</span></div></div>",

Hinata instinctively activated her Byakugan to see if she could find the intruder. It didn't take long before saw a familiar figure leaning against a tree within some thick vegetation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenten-san!\" Hinata gasped. Leading Ninata by the hand, the two nude girls crouched low and crawled through the bushes where the older kunoichi was sitting. She looked like a mess; she was breathing heavily, one blackened eye was nearly swollen shut, and the buns in her hair had been knocked loose, letting it trail down past her shoulders. She looked utterly drained and exhausted, and just by giving her coils a cursory examination, the Hyuga could tell her chakra reserves were nearly depleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" said Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Tenten said with a strained growl. Then she nodded her head off to the side. \"He's not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hinata twins looked over. Lying face-down in a pool of his own blood was a Sound ninja. He was an enormous brute, taller, fatter and bulkier than even Chouji, with tufts of fiery red hair poking out of his otherwise shaved head. His body looked like a pincushion of kunai, shuriken, and other assorted bladed weapons, with a wakizashi running cleanly through his chest and out his back. Judging by the fact that it had impaled his now still heart, it was evident that he was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Called himself Jir\u014db\u014d, or something like that,\" said Tenten. \"I was actually doing pretty well against him. He couldn't get near me, and all he could throw at me were some predictable earth techniques. Then...this happened.\" She nodded to her thigh, which was bleeding profusely from a strange and familiar-looking white arrow that transpierced it. \"It...came out of nowhere. Stopped me cold. And that gave the bastard the chance to close in on me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be from the archer Kiba mentioned,\" said Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten nodded. \"Yeah. There's an archer somewhere. He shot that one explosive note at us and has probably been sniping at everyone ever since. Haven't been able to see him...whatever he is, he's an even better marksman than I could ever hope to be.\" She winced in pain, though it was unclear if it was from the injury in her leg, to her pride, or the simple memory of getting shot. Neither Hinata nor Ninata could be sure. \"Anyway, Jir\u014db\u014d...he beat me up, ate my chakra...did I tell you he could do that? Absorbs it just by touching you. But I had one last trick for him, as I'm sure you saw. Heh, heh, heh.\" Tenten's chuckle was cold and devoid of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata decided to pay it no mind and took a closer look at the kunoichi's wound.</span></div></div>",

I was afraid of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata and Ninata could only look sadly at the girl who was dying in front of them. Neither of them knew her well, but she was still a fellow Leaf-nin. She deserved better than this. \"Tenten-san,\" said Hinata, \"did you see Shikamaru-san anywhere? Kiba-kun told us we need to find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten shook her head. \"I lost sight of him and the others. You two are the first friendlies I've seen since we all got blown up.\" Her tired expression then broke into an odd smile. \"Heh, and I can see <i>all</i> of you two. Which I guess isn't a bad thing to die seeing, considering how gorgeous you both are.\" Hinata and Ninata blushed at this, and the latter, for seemingly the first time since this whole ordeal began, squeaked and tried to cover her breasts, as if finally realizing that she was, in fact, completely naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say that out loud? Huh...guess we all learned something new today,\" said Tenten, looking almost as shocked as the twins did at her words. \"But anyway,\" she continued, trying to become all business-like again, \"I think I heard some explosions to the west. If Kiba told you to find Shikamaru, then you should probably get going and start there. Don't let me slow you down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata kept her arm over her chest, but her flustered expression faded away to one of concern. \"Is there...really nothing we can do?\"</span></div></div>",

With maybe a few careful gentle fist strikes, I might be able to halt the bleeding. You'll still need to get to a hospital, Tenten-san, but you'll at least have a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, why don't you do it?\" said Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed. \"It would take time Ninata-chan. Time we may not have. Shikamaru-san and the others need us and we don't know how long they can hold out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Ninata just before she took a long and drawn out breath. \"Then in that case...you stay and help Tenten. <i>I'll</i> go find Shikamaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked up at her with a gasp. \"Absolutely not!\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to that pill,\" said Ninata with a steely tone, \"I feel much better now. I can stand up straight.\" She did just that. \"I...I can even run. And I have enough chakra to do the Byakugan a few times. And that's all that Kiba said Shikamaru needs, right? At least one pair of Hyuga eyes? I have a pair of Hyuga eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...Ninata-chan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata-chan, Kiba broke away from Shikamaru and ran through this forest to find us. He's holding those twin freaks at bay for us. He did it because only we can get Shikamaru out of whatever mess he's landed in. One of us needs to find him and lend whatever aid we can, and since Tenten is wounded and can only be saved by you, then it has to be me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's mind was a whirlwind. Ninata's words were surprisingly logical, and her plan would help ensure the safety of as many of their kind as possible. Leaving Tenten to her death was something the Hyuga most certainly didn't want to do; abandoning Kiba and Akamaru while they were still in fighting shape was hard enough as it was. But she couldn't bear the thought of being separated from her Ninata again, not after they both had so many close calls. Lives were in the balance. She had to make another tough choice today, and she had to make it fast.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ninata-chan,\" said Hinata in a voice that sounded as though she was straining under a tremendous weight on her shoulders. \"You have to promise me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise you what?\" said Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise me...you won't fight. Promise me...you won't put yourself in danger. If...if something happened to you...I...I don't think I'd be able to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nodded. \"I won't fight, Hinata-chan. I...I know my limits now. I'm not in top form, I'm in over my head, and I'm...butt naked and vulnerable. I understand. I won't do anything you wouldn't want me to do. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls embraced, crushing their bare breasts, stomachs, groins and lips together. \"I love you,\" said Hinata as she began to pull away, still shuddering from the sensation of feeling the full length of her double's body on her own. She desperately wanted to have it out with Ninata right now, to feel, kiss, lick and love every square inch of her majesty. But that would have to wait for now. Even so, there were still some things Hinata could not resist; before Ninata could say another word, she shot a hand forward, and ran it swiftly down her twin's sex, lovingly stroking her velvety folds and marveling at their wetness. Apparently, Ninata too was in dire need of her touch. \"For luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I love you too,\" Ninata moaned, thrusting her hips forward in pursuit of Hinata's retreating finger and the small string of juice flowing from it, her body silently begging for more of her twin's touch. She promptly returned the favor, giving Hinata's swollen, dripping clit a gentle rub that sent electrifying vibrations all throughout the girl's form. And then she was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed longingly as she watched her love's cream-colored derriere disappear from her view. Back and forth it wiggled, each round cheek swaying tantalizingly with every running step Ninata took before she vanished into the forest. The blunette did not want to see it go; she wanted to grasp and hold it with all her might, and make sure that those gorgeous globes that ran like silk between her fingers, along with the girl they were attached to, never got away from her again. But reality was a cruel mistress, and Hinata had to accept that. So she turned her attention back to Tenten...and blushed furiously, realizing just what an intimate display she and Ninata had given the older girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I really need to control myself!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, d-don't worry about it,\" said Tenten, whose face could have been a mirror for Hinata's. \"Just...you might want to get started right now. It'd be real anti-climatic if I died after all that, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, r-right!\" stuttered Hinata as she knelt down to get a better look at Tenten's leg and hopefully restore some of her dignity. Not that there was any real point to it; after today, she was quite certain nobody would look at her the same way again. \"I'm...going to have to remove your pants, Tenten-san. Or at least your pant leg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, Hinata and dignity were long separated at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, I've got one last knife,\" said Tenten. She handed a curved blade to the naked girl. \"Guess you can enjoy some of my skin now too, heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had no response for that. She simply set about the task of cutting off the fabric around the kunoichi's wound. Taking off her pants. Exposing her skin. Because she was tending to a wounded comrade of course, not because she was going to do anything kinky. Removing the garment normally was not an option while the arrow was in Tenten's leg, and pulling the arrow out would be outright fatal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what Hinata told herself, but as she cut more cloth and saw more and more of Tenten's skin, the Hyuga could not stop her mind from wandering into strange places. Tenten was taller than Hinata and Ninata, and had much longer, more pronounced legs. Hinata had to admit, ignoring the obvious wound and the blood dripping down her thigh, they were quite nice. Strong, firm, but still feminine. Why, she could easily see herself kissing her way up them, feeling the taut muscles on her lips, tasting the fair skin on her tongue, and raking her teeth along the smooth flesh as she worked her way to Tenten's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata mentally slapped herself. What the hell was wrong with her? She couldn't fantasize about other girls; she loved Ninata! And this was not the time to be thinking perverted thoughts! But...Hinata could not help but admire her senior ninja's own sense of beauty, even if it was severely battered for now. It was more mature and boyish than she and Ninata's, but it was still decidedly womanly. Feeling Tenten's flesh as they rolled together in bed, in the grass, or wherever would certainly be a nice change of pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the many strange things that had happened recently in the young Hyuga's life, she couldn't help but muse at how alien her thoughts had become as of late. Before Naruto transformed into Ninata, she never thought about girls this way. But after touching, tasting, and experiencing the flesh of...well, herself, Hinata was quickly realizing how much she was coming to truly enjoy the female body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Have I always been this way? Did Ninata awaken something in me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading her thoughts, Tenten said: \"So...you're, uh, with yourself, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata slightly jumped at her question. \"Wh-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...you're in a relationship with that Ninata, your own twin, correct? That's what it looked like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't know how to answer that. She couldn't really deny it, not after the whole show she put on right in front of the brunette. Hell, they both kissed on the lips, exchanged an 'I love you,' and of course felt each other's pussies. That was as far away from platonic as two people could get. But she didn't quite know how Tenten would take it. \"Yes,\" she finally said, pulling the older girl's sandal off so that she could slide the trouser leg all the way down, having cut off all the material under the arrow. \"She's the one I've been waiting for my whole life.\" Which was completely true, just not in the way she imagined Tenten would think once she heard the whole cover story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not judging you or anything!\" said Tenten. \"I mean, uh, there's nothing wrong with loving a Hyuga. If a Hyuga asked me out to dinner or anything, I'd say yes too. Maybe. I think I may have developed a thing for your family or something, probably because of Neiji. Oh, I, uh, guess I shouldn't be saying things like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It, it's alright,\" said Hinata as she removed the cloth from Tenten's body, exposing her whole leg to the air. The subject of Neiji was uncomfortable for her, but she didn't begrudge Tenten for mentioning him, let alone being attracted to him if she got the gist of what the older girl was implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not,\" said Tenten apologetically. \"Sitting here bleeding to death is making me act stupid and insensitive. Though I guess, coming to grips with your own mortality can make a girl think. Make a girl wonder if she's made the right choices in her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata began to work on the fabric above the arrow, all the while trying not to pay too much attention to the vast expanse of bare leg before her. \"Why?\" she asked. It wasn't normally like her to be this social to a near stranger, but a cursory look at Tenten's most minute movements told her that the brunette really needed someone to talk to now. She was putting on a strong face, but the occasional shifts in the girl's eyes and the slight trembling in her hands indicated that she was terrified. \"Do you...regret what you've done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten shrugged. \"I don't know if I'd call it regret. It's just...I've put all my efforts into trying to be a strong kunoichi like Tsunade. She's always been my idol, and I was really excited when I saw her assume her position as Hokage. I mean, she was right there! I could actually go up and meet her face to face! Talk to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I have to wonder if maybe there are other things I should consider? Other interests to pursue as well? Like, maybe if I should study up on tengenjutsu, which always fascinated me as a kid? Or try my hand at the forge like my grandfather? I always liked the way he folded steel. Am I talking to you, or is my life just flashing before my eyes? Things are getting a little blurry here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you,\" said Hinata. \"You haven't gone anywhere. Just stay awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten sighed in relief. \"That's good. Because I'm starting to think that...life's a little too short to devote yourself to one thing? Have you ever...considered that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, there was no more cloth around the arrow in Tenten's thigh. Hinata had full access to all the skin, and there was nothing to get in the way of the delicate operation she was about to perform. \"Tenten-san,\" she said, \"I'm going to deliver a few gentle fist strikes to your leg now. I'm going to force the arrow closer to your artery, close off the opening in it, and make sure it stays tightly in there so it won't move under any pressure. I won't use a lot of chakra, and I'll only be using my finger for this but...I'm sorry, but it might still hurt a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten nodded in understanding. \"I'm a big girl and I've trained with your cousin. I know how those things feel. Do it.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata gave the girl time to brace herself before she focused chakra into her index finger and jabbed it right into her thigh. To a layman, it looked like she was simply poking the older ninja. But anyone who was even remotely familiar with the Hyuga clan would know what was really happening. In her thrust, Hinata stabbed a small needle of chakra directly into Tenten's body. It wasn't a lot, but it was done with enough force to physically displace not only the brunette's coils, but the innards they surrounded as well. Bone, muscle, tissue, blood vessels, nerves, and everything else that was inside Tenten's body, including the arrow. And the position of that was what Hinata needed to effect. She hoped that with a few careful jabs, she could wedge the shaft of the arrow tighter into Tenten's femoral artery, plug up the rupture, and stop the bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to be careful though. If she used too much chakra and force, then she'd cause further injury to Tenten, and possibly open the wound up even more. However, judging by Tenten's strained grunt and full-bodied jolt, even something as small as a Gentle Finger Poke hurt a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going,\" Tenten whispered hoarsely when she sensed her hesitation. \"I can take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...okay,\" said Hinata, realizing how her patient's behavior could be interpreted out of context. Seeing that the arrow was still not positioned correctly, Hinata unleashed another Gentle Finger Poke into the brunette's thigh. And just like last time, Tenten trembled all over. She did it again and again, with the same results, moving the arrow ever closer to its goal. If Hinata didn't know any better, she would have thought that Tenten was on some level enjoying the little bouts of pain she was receiving, what with how her whole body quaked and her muffled grunts sounded kind of like moans of pleasure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata then decided to try something naughty. Focusing her enhanced vision, she looked straight through the older ninja's clothes, turning them transparent until only her body was visible and everything about her was exposed to Hinata's eyes alone. It was a perk to being a Hyuga; they could literally undress someone with there eyes! There were a few details that gave the game away. For one thing, Tenten's breasts were a little squished together and they didn't jiggle so freely with her spasms since she was still wearing a bra under her shirt. For another, the triangle of dark pubic hair between her legs was flattened under her now invisible panties. But from Hinata's perspective, the older ninja was now just as naked as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Hinata had to admit, despite the many bruises the Sound-nin left on her, Tenten looked good. Maybe not as much as her Ninata-chan, but there was still much to appreciate. Her breasts weren't as large, but they were perky and sizable enough to betray the boyish looks in her face, and Hinata couldn't help but lick her lips as she imagined how her red areolas would taste in her mouth. Her frame was lean and agile to complement her more aerodynamic fighting style, but Tenten's training under Guy had given her a healthy muscle tone as well, with a definite hint of some girl abs under her breasts. They looked especially tight right now, and Hinata was feeling very tempted to run her hands across them. Gazing down even further was the dark forest on her mound. Hinata loved the look of Ninata's smooth pussy, with its perfect poofy lips welcoming her tongue, but she had to admit, running her fingers through a thick bush like Tenten's sounded like it might be fun. And her legs...Kami, they seemed to stretch on forever, and they felt so rigid and strong to the touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata jabbed Tenten again, eliciting another twitch from her. Her back arched up, her breasts thrust high into the air, her already taut muscles tightened even more, and her legs parted oh so slightly, giving the Hyuga a brief glimpse of pink within that black forest. Hinata could only let out a longing sigh. What she would love to do with this pretty ninja if the circumstances allowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would straddle the older girl, sit over Tenten with her form nestled in between her knees and her arms pinned to the ground. The Hyuga would start slow, leaning forward until she squashed breasts into Tenten's, drowning them out with her superior size. As Tenten quivered in anticipation, she would allow her body to melt into the brunette's, lowering her hips until they met, suppressing a giggle as Tenten's pubic hair tickled the bare sensitive flesh of her mound. And then, Hinata would lower her face into the crook of the brunette's neck to nuzzle her. And bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-haired girl would then rub her chest deeper into the black-haired one's, shuddering as their nipples hardened into one another and prodded into the soft, squishy flesh of their breasts. She would rub her whole body in smooth, fluid motions, tracing the slight abdominals in Tenten with her own dainty stomach. Occasionally, she would mash her hips into the older girl's, rubbing their most sensitive spots together, vulva upon vulva. Only once, of course, just to tease her, whet her appetite, and make her beg for more. But there would be nothing Tenten could do about it, for Hinata would have complete control over her. All she would be able to do was moan, cry and thrust her hips upward, hoping Hinata would eventually meet her halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata would continue to do this, rubbing their naked sweaty bodies together, leaving all sorts of love bites on Tenten's neck until she herself could no longer stand it. Now thoroughly dripping wet, she would tighten her grip on Tenten's wrists, beat her crotch with several forceful pelvic thrusts. And then, she would begin to grind, rubbing the folds of her vagina into the open hungry lips of her lover's. Strongly. Forcefully. And she wouldn't stop until she reduced this more experienced kunoichi into a whimpering mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata couldn't stand it any longer. Her pink nipples stood so erect in the air that the slightest breeze chilled them, and her pussy was so wet that even her thighs were soaked from her juices. She...she needed release! Without missing a beat, without taking her mind away from matter of Tenten's fatal injury, Hinata thrust her free hand into her crotch. She rolled her fingers circularly over her swollen clit, each caress, each slight application of pressure firing one spark of ecstasy after another straight through her core. When that was no longer enough, she just about nearly smacked herself, slamming her whole womanhood into her hand, heaving and trembling with every electrifying tingle that ran through her body, and every jiggling sensation that emanated from her breasts. And while she did this, not once did Hinata stop applying her form of impromptu surgery on Tenten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be an impossible task for most people. But thanks to her Byakugan, Hinata was able to focus on everything at once. She could see Tenten's seemingly naked body reacting to her touch, the arrow that was slowly but steadily moving into position within the older girl's leg, the hand Hinata was using to prod it into place one Gentle Poke at a time, and the other hand that was stroking her own core. And it...felt...gooooood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errhh...Hinata?\" said Tenten in a voice that sounded like it was a thousand miles away to the Hyuga's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...ahhhh....TENTEN!\" Hinata cried in response. With one thrust of her finger into Tenten's leg, she jammed the arrow into place, halting the flow of blood from the brunette's body. And with her other hand, she curled her fingers into her flower, unleashing a tide of fluid that would not be stemmed so easily. She gasped and cried out again and again as her core erupted in a geyser of warmth, splashing all over her hand and splattering onto the leaf-covered ground as electrifying vibrations jolted across her body, from the lobes of her ears to the tips of her toes. And then it happened again, one wave after another. Once, twice...she lost count. But each one felt bigger than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it slowed down. The gushing sensations ended, the pulsing flesh enveloping her fingers eased up and released them, and all she could do was hunch over on the forest floor, breathe heavily, and simply bask in the afterglow of her long-awaited orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally recovered, she locked eyes with the simultaneously dazed, flustered and bewildered, but thankfully safe, Tenten. \"Um...I...think you got it,\" she said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Activating the Byakugan was always the most disorienting part. The flood of visual information pouring straight into her brain hurt her head more than a hundred shadow clones dying at once. Even the pain-killing effects of Kiba's soldier pills had their limits. But when you were looking for a needle in a haystack and your tracking skills were nonexistent, Ninata knew she had to use it if she wanted to find Shikamaru and the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been running through the forest for quite some time, staying to the ground away from the Sound archer's sights and keeping her Byakugan active as often as she could. There hadn't been any fighting so far, but she had seen plenty of signs of violence. Trampled vegetation, burned bushes and trees, broken branches, weapons scattered here and there, and the occasional white arrow embedded in a tree. Sadly, she couldn't figure out if they were signs of Tenten's fight with that fat-ass ninja, or whatever enemy Shikamaru was dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" Ninata muttered as she deactivated her bloodline ability, her head and eyes starting to feel soar gain. \"How'm I ever going to find those numb-nuts?\" She ducked into a patch of ferns to provide herself some coverage while she rested, shivering as the plants softly caressed her delicate skin. <i>Man, these things feel so good. Maybe when this is all over, Hinata-chan and I can find a nice fern bed to make love in and...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata gasped as an especially large tingling feeling sparked from the warm depths of her core. Even though nothing had touched it, was like Hinata ran her tongue along the inner walls of her labia and given her clit a small suckle for good measure. Damn, she shouldn't have done that. Thinking about sex was only reminding her that she wasn't getting any, and despite the danger she was in, Ninata was still horny as hell and in wanton need of her twin's touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus, Ninata, FOCUS! Work first, fun later.\" She suppressed any further thoughts on sex, Hinata, and her own nakedness to instead think about her current situation. She was in the woods, her comrades were in trouble, Sound-nin were afoot, there was a sound of an explosion going off in the distance, as well as the soft humming of a flute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait a minute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's them! It has to be!\" she exclaimed, leaping to her feet. Startled, she leaned her head back with a yelp as her creamy breasts bounced upward and nearly smacked her in the face before falling back to their original position on her chest, making a slapping sound as they \"landed.\" If not for the soldier pills, that probably would have hurt a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I gotta' be more careful with these things.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with relief after averting that small crisis, Ninata reactivated her Byakugan, wincing slightly as all angles of the world around her came into view again. She really hoped she'd get used to that eventually as she fully intended on keeping these eyes for the long haul. Thankfully, the shock didn't last long; everything soon blurred into focus, allowing her to get on with her mission. Ninata couldn't see what had made those previous noises yet, meaning she still had a ways to go, but she was at least ready for the unexpected. Her mind now clear of any sexy distractions, the naked girl took off and followed the faint sounds echoing throughout the forest in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange musical notes grew increasingly louder in her ears. They were melodious, pleasant, and being played by someone who clearly took his or her craft very seriously. However, Ninata could not stop to enjoy the song, for it was accompanied by the more chilling sounds of battle. Thunderous footsteps belonging to feet bigger than a normal man, loud inhuman roars of fury and pain, and a massive crash of bodies upon bodies followed by the breaking and splintering of wood. Ninata shuddered. What could possibly make such horrible noises?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whoever it is, I hope they're friendly. And winning.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drew closer, she saw exactly what it was through the trees. Chouji was always a big guy, but right now he was taking his size to a whole new level, standing at what had to be at least twelve feet in height. Unfortunately, he had definitely seen better days. His clothing was ragged and dirty, that stupid underwear-like bandana he usually wore on his head was gone, his face was a mask of blood that leaked out of his mouth, nose, and forehead, and his skin was hideously black-and-blued from all manner of bruises. And worse, his bulk was a ripe target for the mystery archer, for Ninata could see at least three bone-white arrows sticking into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the archer wasn't the only thing the husky ninja had to deal with. For he was grappling with an even more massive ogre-like monstrosity. Naked from the waist up save for the bandages around its wrists and eyes, it was a fearsome mountain of meat and muscle, and it looked like it was taking the Akimichi everything he had to hold it back. Then another similar creature, more fully garbed but with its face hidden behind a tangled mane of hair, came out of nowhere and struck the boy in the head with a club. Chouji released his grip on the first beast with a bellow of pain, which gave the bare-chested hulk its chance to launch a fist right into his gut with bone-crunching force. There was a hideous crack as something in him broke and forced him to his knees. And then a third creature appeared.</span></div></div>",

And Ninata sadly knew there was nothing she could do for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not directly, you can't</i>, she thought, trying to stay optimistic. <i>Just find Shikamaru. If anyone has a plan of action, it's him. And he <b>needs</b> you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white shaft bearing down from the forest's canopy suddenly appeared in Ninata's vision, rocketing at a speed normal human eyes would never have detected. The naked girl rolled to the side, shivering at the rush of air on her exposed skin as it zoomed past her body by mere inches and buried itself deeply into a nearby tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne second. If she had delayed herself by just <i>one second</i>, Ninata would have most definitely been looking like Tenten now. At best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have shuddered at that realization, but she didn't have time to worry. Without missing a beat, Ninata shifted her focus in the direction the arrow came from. There was a rustle of leaves, indicating that someone was on the move up there. Ninata couldn't help but smirk. The archer had just found her, which was not good, but at the same time, she found him as well. <i>Looks like you're not prepared for a</i> Hyuga<i>, are you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about ready to bend the light of the foliage so that she could get a clear look at her would-be assassin when she suddenly detected two more presences. Off to the south, around the perimeter of the clearing where Chouji and the monsters were battling it out, Ninata saw the hunched forms of the people she had been looking for: Ino and Shikamaru.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I thought you were supposed to be a genius,\" muttered Ino as she wrapped one final loop of gauze around Shikamaru's bare torso. \"You know you're not supposed to pull an arrow out like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...was a reflex,\" Shikamaru grunted through strained teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A reflex that could have killed you!\" said Ino, who would have slapped the pineapple-headed boy if he wasn't currently wounded. \"You're lucky it didn't hit any organs or blood vessels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chuunin flinched, though whether it was out of pain from the arrow wound in his side or from the shaking crash and battle cry of Chouji in the distance, she couldn't tell. \"We're gonna' need another plan. I don't think Chouji...I don't think he can hold out much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was placid, but the slight tremble in his voice betrayed the concern for his friend. That wasn't good. If her own leader was losing confidence, Ino didn't think she would be able to hold it in either. \"Don't say that,\" she very nearly hissed. \"This is not how it's going to end. For us, or him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe members of Team 10 had been relatively fortunate. While the explosion sent the rest of the impromptu squad flying into different directions, Ino, Shikamaru and Chouji were able to find each other in very short order, along with the Inuzuka boy. Unfortunately, so had a lone female Sound-nin armed with nothing but a flute. With numbers on their side, the four thought they had the advantage over the young woman. But with a few musical notes, the enemy kunoichi called three giant Doki to her side and evened things out on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, the blonde didn't think the monsters would have posed much of a problem. One enemy was no different from a dozen if you could freeze them all in place and pick them off at your leisure. Shikamaru could have easily held all the Doki with his shadows, Ino could possess one or the Sound-nin herself, and Chouji and Kiba were strong enough to just pulverize whatever was left. It was a tactic that saved Team 10's bacon more times than she could count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Ino or any of her teammates could so much as form one hand seal, arrows rained down from the canopy. And just like that, whatever strategy the Leaf ninjas were about to execute vanished in a puff of smoke. An archer was spying on them from high up in the trees. Where exactly he was, none of them could tell. Whatever camouflage techniques he was using were beyond flawless, and he never stayed in the same place for long. And it quickly became evident that if Ino or Shikamaru used their families' jutsus, they would have been sitting ducks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as it was, Chouji was forced to fight the three Doki alone, Kiba took it upon himself to track down the archer, and Ino and Shikamaru, having no real skills when it came to combat, had no choice but to cower in the shadows and wait for an opening. Ino tried to get a bead on the flutist multiple times; if she could just get a glimpse of that magenta-haired bitch, then she would have had a chance to take control of her mind. But while her song echoed throughout the forest, she was nowhere to be found to Ino's growing frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the archer, he proved to be a frighteningly cunning enemy. Ino didn't know what the whole story was, but it looked as though he was able to stay one step ahead of the hot-tempered Inuzuka's keen sense of smell every step of the way, leading the boy into one trap after another, many of which seemed to involve spiders and webs. And if he was distracted in any way, he didn't show it, for the archer never once let up on his attack. Ino lost count of how many arrows she and Shikamaru had to dodge, while Chouji...was not so lucky in that department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He'll recover</i>, she told herself. <i>You know Chouji, he's tough, he can take a beating with the best of them.</i> That's what she told herself after the first arrow struck him, burying itself right through his shoulder. And again once another went into his stomach. And another once it buried itself in his thigh, forcing him to buckle down onto his knee...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was evident that their current strategy was just not going to work. The flutist and archer were both untouchable, Chouji could only hold the Doki back for so long, and Shikamaru and Ino were nigh useless as long as their tree-bound enemy still lived. They needed to kill the archer, and they needed a trick that he couldn't counter. And after he, Ino and Kiba were able to get together for a moment to discuss their options, Shikamaru had a hunch that the Hyugas might just be the key they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Find Hinata or her twin and bring them back here,\"</i> Shikamaru had said to Kiba, in an uncharacteristically commanding voice that told the Inuzuka it was an order and there was no room for argument. <i>\"This is top priority, so do not under any circumstances even consider doing anything else. Do I make myself clear?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba simply nodded with assent and took off. From that point on, it was just a matter of waiting. Waiting, surviving and hoping. And that's where Ino and Shikamaru were now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that her job with field medicine was complete, Ino stood up to give Shikamaru a chance to put on his shirt and more importantly, his armored flak jacket. The wound he suffered was deep, but thankfully not fatal in part due to the jacket's thick padding. If it hadn't been there, then chances were good the arrow would have gone deeper and possibly hit a vital organ or major artery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought made Ino scowl irritably. <i>And it's just our luck that the two people we need right now have no protection on whatsoever. They had better still be alive!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, she was nearly bowled over by two jiggling mounds of ivory that proclaimed: \"Hyuga Ninata to the rescue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH!\" Ino cried, falling backwards onto her butt. \"Where did you come from?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata scratched her head sheepishly while giggling apologetically. Poor Ino looked like she just suffered a heart attack, and Shikamaru was shooting her a glare that could've melted an iceberg. Or at least, he would have before his eyes drifted down to her still jiggling mounds of girl flesh and he was forced to look away with a blush on his face and a small trickle of blood in his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, sorry about that,\" she said, sheepishly putting an arm over her boobs. In retrospect, sneaking up on them like that was probably not the best idea. \"Didn't know how else to meet you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that,\" said Shikamaru in as professional tone as he could muster while he looked away from the dark-haired beauty in front of him. \"It looks like one of you arrived at least. That's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba said you needed a Hyuga,\" said Ninata as she knelt down. \"So I came as fast as I could.\" Wait, that came out wrong. \"Er, as in, I got here as fast as I could, not...\" A crash shook her as the fight between Chouji and the monsters intensified. She resisted the urge to focus her spherical vision on him, knowing that she wouldn't like what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen an archer anywhere on the way here?\" said Shikamaru, clearly not caring about her unfortunate use of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nodded. \"Yeah. I caught a glimpse of him just before I found you. And I nearly got shot in the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he's seen you,\" said Shikamaru with a sigh. \"And chances are, you've lured him straight to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata felt the blood drain from her face. Crap, she screwed up. She screwed up bad. \"Oh. Oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about it!\" Shikamaru barked. \"Can you see him <b>now</b>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme a second,\" said Ninata. Turning her focus away from Shikamaru, she extended her vision outward to the trees all around them. She saw Chouji bleeding and breathing heavily on his hands and knees before he popped a pill into his mouth and stood back up with renewed vigor against the trio of monsters overpowering him. She saw a lone Sound-nin sitting idly on a tree branch playing a flute, with vermillion skin and demonic horns sprouting up from her long mane of fiery pink hair. She saw endless trees with green leaves rustling in the wind. And she saw a strange, tanned, inhuman <i>thing</i> with more arms than a person had any right to possess part some leaves away as it strung a massive arrow, bigger than any of the others she had seen that day, on an even larger bow that was poised in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see him,\" said Ninata, her blood running cold. \"And he sees us, and he's arming a bow! Quick, we have to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden chill came over the former boy, and in instant, she was out.</span></div></div>",

She made the seals for her Shintenshin no Jutsu, and threw her consciousness right into the Hyuga girl's head, taking control of her on the spot. Forcefully possessing someone without their permission wasn't a very nice thing to do, and she had to admit, it felt even more wrong to do it to the shy little Hyuga girl, or at least her yin-yang chakra twin. But they didn't exactly have a whole lot of options, and there wasn't any time to explain the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, she was in the girl's head. And more importantly, she could see everything the Hyuga girl could with her powerful eyes. And holy smokes, were they powerful! She could see everything in front, behind, and above her all at the same time. The many trees in the forest, Shikamaru's perpetually annoyed glare as he reached out to keep Ino's body from hitting the ground too hard, and even the naked body of the girl she now possessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a body it was! Hinata, or Ninata's skin was absolutely flawless, pale all over with not a blemish to be found anywhere, aside from the warm glow of pink literally jutting from her nipples and peaking ever so slightly out from between her legs. If Ninata was growing any hair down there, she left no sign of it, indicating that she was either a very practiced shaver, or just naturally bare all over. Without having to twist her neck an inch, Ino could also trace the gentle curves of the Hyuga's back and insert herself into the cleft of her quivering, heart-shaped rump. The girl's usually baggy attire did much to disguise her perfect hourglass figure, which the blonde couldn't help but feel jealous about. No wonder she was content to run around completely naked right now! Kami knew if Ino looked like this, she wouldn't want to wear clothes either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The fresh air feels really good on my, er, her skin too.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the breasts\u2013they were huge! When Ino had first laid eyes on them, she swore they had to have been implants. No girl of Hinata's size and age could possibly grow a pair like these naturally. She couldn't help but grab them, to fill her palms up with their soft fleshy goodness. They had a healthy bounce, so much so that Ino had to wonder how the poor girl and her twin had been able to run around the woods for so long without hurting themselves. In Ino's experience, she could hardly go a few minutes without any support, and her girls were sadly inferior to these beauties. But they were also firm to the touch and showed no sign of sag; gravity clearly had no effect on the Hyuga clan it seemed. However, holding Ninata's breasts like this told the blonde everything she set out to know: both she and Hinata's breasts were real, and they were fantastic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino!\" Shikamaru hissed. \"Now's not the time for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, right,\" she stammered. That's right. She wasn't here to gawk and feel Ninata's body up. She wasn't a freak like that. She liked boys, she needed to find and finish that archer bastard once and for all...and she could finally see him! It was not a pretty sight. His face was completely inhuman and twisted into a monstrous smirk as he aimed down the sights of a massive longbow that was bigger than his whole body. The arrow he was stringing was bigger, longer and thicker than anything he had launched up to this point; it looked more like a ballista spear. Depending on how fast it went, whatever it hit would likely explode from the sheer force of the impact alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the most off-putting thing about the Sound archer was the third eye that seemed to be looking hungrily down at her, as well as the six arms sticking out of his sides. Ino had to suppress a gag just staring at him. <i><b>That's</b> the body I'm supposed to possess? You've got to be freaking kidding me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, as loathe as she was to do it, this was the plan she and Shikamaru had formulated. By taking possession of a Hyuga with an active Byakugan, they both hoped she would be able to see the fiend, and jump straight into his body. It...was a long shot to say the least. Hopping from one body to another required near-absolute mastery of the Yamanaka clan's signature technique, and truth was, she had yet to actually accomplish it. But the way she saw it, they didn't many other options. It was either take the chance now, or die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, Ino, you're here now</i>, she mentally whispered to herself, licking her, or rather, Ninata's lips nervously. <i>This is the moment of truth. Your time to shine. The instant where everyone's lives are now resting on <b>your</b> shoulders.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe formed the signs with Ninata's hands, ignoring the thin bead of sweat that dripped down her face. She could do this. All she needed to do was project as much chakra as she could into the girl's coils, keep her concentration up, and catapult her conscience out. It was just like all the other times she used the Shintenshin no Jutsu. Only difference was that she needed to do it in someone else's body now. But that was no problem! Generations of Yamanaka ninjas had done it. There was no reason to think that Ino couldn't.</span></div></div>",

Why was everything starting to look so dark and blurry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause the truth of the matter, and which Ino knew deep down, was that using everything in a person's body was well beyond her level of skill. She could walk in foreign flesh, see the world in another's eyes, speak with a voice that wasn't hers, and fight in her own amateurish way with someone else's hands and feet. But actually using another's chakra to cast any kind of jutsu, let alone her family's distinct techniques, was a whole other matter entirely, one that she knew she couldn't pull off in the best of times. Worse, forcing it was only stretching the blonde's conscience even more. And like a rubber band, that meant it could only snap in two ways: back to its original position, or into pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn invisible claw seemed to yank at the girl's mind, pulling her hair bun as it got ready to drag her kicking and screaming back into her own body.

Not in the forest, for she knew at least two pairs of eyes were on her at the moment (and not all of them were on separate faces), but in the space between her mind and Ninata's bare flesh. Something...huge was bearing down on her, something so inhumanly massive, that it could sweep her away with a mere wave of its hand, assuming it even had one. Surely it was just her mind playing tricks on her? Body-hopping tended to have that effect on people. Why, she recalled something very similar happening when she last tried to possess Sakura during the preliminaries...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought ended when a surge of chakra suddenly flooded into her. Chakra that she didn't even know this body was capable of holding and that seemed to come from nowhere. It was like no chakra she had ever experienced before. <i>It's so hot.

Where was Ninata? Where did that chakra come from? And where the hell was Ino now? A quick glance down at her \"new body,\" with its heavily tanned arms grasping an immense bow, told her everything she needed to know. She was in the archer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it?\" she said in the Sound-nin's voice. \"Uh, I mean, I did it! I really, really did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know how she did it. She didn't know how she was able to jump from the hot bod of Ninata to the ugly bod of this Sound ninja. And she most definitely had no idea just what the blimey <i>fuck</i> happened while she was in the mindscape of Hinata's naked twin. But whatever it was, Ino was thankful. She accomplished what she set out to do, and was now in a position to give her friends a fighting chance! Whatever questions she had could wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Ino remembered that she now had six arms and at least three eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeewww!\" she cried in that same sick, monstrous voice. This body was even worse than she thought! What kind of a freak was she possessing here? Ino hoped that the six arms were just an illusion when she first laid eyes on them, or that maybe they were the result of some kind of secret...limb-sprouting jutsu thingy. But nope; this person was really sporting eight limbs. His saliva also felt wrong in her mouth, and a quick glance at her surroundings told her why; there were thick strands of spider silk hanging from the trees and even sticking to his clothing. And when she took a closer look at the arrow that was currently nocked in the bow, Ino soon realized that it was made of the exact same stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrific. Not only did Ino look like a spider at the moment, but she had the disgusting biology of one too. That realization made her shudder in the Sound-nin's body. She didn't suffer arachnophobia or anything of that nature; the girl was made of tougher stuff than that. But she still had no love for the wriggling little pests. Ninata's body was a trillion times better than this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it,\" she mumbled in the archer's voice. \"You got into his body. That's good.

She would have given anything to see the arrow pierce the Sound-nin's skull and end her song with a meaty <i>thunk!</i> Luckily, it didn't look like Ino had to be completely accurate; she still hit the branch the flutist was perched on, and the arrow was so massive and it moved at such incredible speed, that both the branch and the tree it was attached to just about exploded on contact! The crack of splintering wood was positively deafening, as was the thunderous boom that echoed across the forest when the trunk crashed upon the ground, taking numerous other trees with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the most wonderful thing of all was that the infernal song that had been ringing in Ino's ears for so long now was finally gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno wanted to cheer, but a sudden tug on her mind brought her back to the present.  The flutist may have been down for the moment, but the archer was still very much alive. And if she was expelled from his body before she did anything with it, then this whole ordeal would have been for nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another forceful tug. The timer for her jutsu was rapidly winding down. In a few seconds, she'd be back in her body, and the archer would have full control of his facilities all over again. She needed to act fast. Reaching down with one of the archer's six hands, Ino drew forth a kunai. She would have preferred something a little longer, but it was all she, or rather he had. Looking down at the ground, she estimated that he had to have been about 70 to 80 feet above it. Hopefully, that would be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking the Sound-nin bite his lip, Ino, shut his eyes and took the plunge, leaping headfirst to the forest floor. With seconds to spare as the ground grew bigger and bigger, she thrust the kunai straight into the archer's stomach.

She was pissed that Ino had gone prodding into her head without her permission, and had half as mind to gentle fist both the blonde and her lazy leader for pulling that trick on her. But when Shikamaru hastily told her the plan that they made, and explained that they really didn't have any time to explain it to her ahead of time, she had no choice but to grudgingly accept it. It still didn't improve her mood, and when this was done, she'd get back at them both for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno's eyes flapped open, indicating that the Yamanaka girl was back inside her body. \"The archer's down,\" she said breathlessly. \"And the flutist is out, for now at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru nodded. \"The fighting stopped after you knocked half the forest down, so hopefully, the Doki are down too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata activated her Byakugan. \"I don't see them anywhere around here. But I do see Chouji, and...he doesn't look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru's normally unflappable exterior broke as a wave of fear and concern washed over his face \"Damn it,\" he whispered, getting up to no doubt rush to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" said Ino, putting a hand on his shoulder to stop him in his tracks. \"I'm the most qualified healer among us. If anyone should go attend to Chouji, it's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't we all just go?\" said Ninata. She didn't know the chubby boy too well, but she could sympathize with Shikamaru's concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if the flutist is dead or alive,\" said Ino. \"You two need to go and check up on her. Make sure she's no longer a threat. And maybe...just maybe find Sasuke while you're at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru didn't look like he was ready to listen. The scowl he shot at the blonde's way wordlessly said: \"Don't tell me what to do!\" Ino did not budge. She merely tightened her grip on his shoulder and gave him a firm stare. The boy groaned in response, screwed his eyes shut, and turned away. After a moment of likely counting to ten in his head, he reopened his eyes. The frightened boy was gone, and the leader had returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" he said. \"Ninata, you're with me. Stay behind me, keep your Byakugan up, and tell me if you see anything. Ino, you check up on Chouji. Give him all the medical care you can. As soon as he's safe and stable, or...you realize there's nothing left to do, you catch up with us. Everyone clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting a nod of assent from both girls, they all split up, Ino going in once direction, Ninata and Shikamaru going in the other. Gazing at the acres of forest through her sphere of vision, the former Uzumaki couldn't help but keep her stomach from somersaults. The place looked like a war zone. Craters pockmarked the ground, branches and whole tree trucks littered the earth from where the four giants had fought. Black soil was scattered everywhere, congregated around upturned roots and the spots where boulders had been hurled from the patches of earth they had sat in for the past hundred or so years. Had she been at least one year younger, Ninata would have believed Chouji's fight against the Doki was likely the coolest thing ever. But right now, all she could do was shudder at the thought that he had been fighting for his life the entire time. And he had been losing. Not even the cool air on her naked skin or the feeling of her bouncing bosoms could distract her from that frightening thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see anything?\" Shikamaru asked, not even bothering to steal a glance behind him, likely to avoid getting another eyeful of bare female flesh. He had been doing that a lot, keeping his gaze firmly averted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not yet\" said Ninata. She focused her vision ahead of her, to where the wreckage of about a dozen or so trees laid, and where the musically-inclined ninja presumably hid herself. The damage here was much different. An entire line of trees had been partially or completely felled, and there was a lot more splintered wood. The transformed Hyuga girl decided that it wouldn't be a good idea to get on Ino's bad side; she had no idea what the hell the Yamanaka girl did to cause all this destruction, but it couldn't have been pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still mad at her for getting into my head though.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" she suddenly cried, as she caught sight of a sudden anomaly in the forest. Beneath the bulk of one formerly proud tree, she saw an arm lying limply on the ground, a shock of scarlet hair pooling just beside it...and two halves of a flute just outside its grasp. \"I think I found our flutist at three o'clock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru immediately veered in that direction. \"Dead or alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata took a moment to clear the image of the tree from her vision, turning it transparent so she could get a look at the figure below. Her stomach turned at the gruesome sight that greeted her. \"Dead,\" she gagged, feeling the burning sensation of bile climbing up her throat. \"Definitely dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came upon what remained of the Sound kunoichi, where she had been crushed under the tree. Shikamaru, ever the cautious one, kneeled down and took hold of the arm, grasping it at the wrist.  \"Ew, Shikamaru, don't touch it!\" said Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm checking her pulse,\" said the chuunin. \"Making absolutely sure she won't cause any more problems for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I saw,\" Ninata huffed, putting her hands on her bare hips. \"And what I saw wasn't pleasant to look at, thank you very much. Or even remotely survivable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can never be too careful,\" Shikamaru. \"And on that note, do you see anything else around us? Any more threats?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not a thing,\" said Ninata. The forest was oddly tranquil right now. Eerily so. It was hard to believe that only a few minutes ago, it had been a scene of violent carnage. But besides a bunch of fallen trees, it was now back to its ordinary green splendor, save for that one spot where a shadowy black chakra appeared to be pulsing. \"Hold on! There's something weird over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Shikamaru, before he saw a creamy derriere wiggle tantalizingly past him. Blood quickly rushed to his nose. \"Damn it, I said stay behind me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata paid him no mind. Something about that chakra greatly unnerved her. It wasn't demonic, which she was thankful for, but it wasn't natural either. And the way it seemed to spiral and swirl like a miniature typhoon was seriously unreal. But the worst part was that she thought she could see the dim silhouette of a person inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you found Sasuke,\" said Shikamaru as the two of them reached the object holding the dark chakra, which on the outside looked like an ordinary bamboo taru that was meant to store sake. \"And Ino very nearly killed him. How troublesome.\" The taru was turned on its side, wedged tightly under the trunk of a fallen tree and hidden behind a tangled mess of branches and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's happening to him in there,\" said Ninata as she crawled under the tree, completely unaware about the fact that she was giving the boy a full view of her bare ass and hairless pussy. She did feel the heat of his blush, though, and heard a splatter of blood hitting the forest floor, but paid it no mind. \"Gotta' get him out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata tugged on the lid of the taru, but it held firm. \"Shit, this thing is locked up tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is,\" Shikamaru grumbled in that know-it-all tone of his that made Ninata really want to kick his stupid face in. \"They <i>clearly</i> designed it to be locked up tight what with how they were waving and throwing it around. Do you think you can get it out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata gripped the side of the barrel and pulled, but had just as much luck as the lid. \"No good,\" she said. \"The tree is holding it in place. No way are we getting this thing out of here. Gimme a kunai. Maybe I can cut it open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached a hand back and was thankful to feel the cold steel in her palm as Shikamaru obliged, muttering a low \"How troublesome\" in the process. The naked girl then started the task of stabbing and hacking at the bamboo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Sasuke,\" she whispered. \"We're gonna' get you out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata stabbed a few more times, the kunai making only faint scratches in the wood. She was only hacking for a few seconds before she heard Shikamaru utter a curse. Startled, the boy-turned-girl pushed her way out from under the tree and nearly froze at the sight that greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakon was standing tall before them, with the head of his brother leering at the two Leaf ninjas from over his shoulder. \"Did you miss us, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stay back!\" Ninata gasped, holding her borrowed kunai out as far as she could reach. The memory of her most recent encounter with the lecherous Sound-nin flashed through her mind. \"Don't come any closer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that,\" said the white-haired monster. \"Your friend there is making sure my brother and I stay right where we are.\" Ninata glanced down. Shikamaru's shadow was stretched out and appeared to be holding the conjoined twins in place. The nude girl mentally sighed in relief, though stealing a look at the chuunin, she couldn't help but be worried. He was straining hard, his face only barely masking the pain he had to feel maintaining the jutsu like that while wounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakon continued. \"But as soon as he lets up on it\u2013and he will very soon, mark my words\u2013we'll deal with the both of you very handily. Just as we did with your friend and his little dog too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba?\" said Ninata, feeling her heart skip a beat. \"What do you mean? What did you do to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've already lost,\" said Shikamaru calmly, clearly taking control of the conversation. \"Your friends are all dead, and the rest of mine are coming right now as we speak. You can't take us all at once, and we've just about rescued Sasuke. It's over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sakon nearly grinned, letting out a hushed chortle at the ponytailed boy's bluff. \"Rescued? Is that what this is all about? You think that you're saving your precious Uchiha from a kidnapping? We didn't force Sasuke into anything; he joined us of our own free will!\"</span></div></div>",

Sakon only laughed some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe what you want. But this 'rescue operation' of yours was doomed from the start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakon,\" Ukon whispered. \"Don't goad her. She might\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry,\" said Sakon. \"Our little birdie's about to hatch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" said Ninata as she glanced behind her. She caught only a small glimpse of the taru before an explosion of what could only be described as black fire flooded her vision and sent her hurdling up in the air and into a tree. The force knocked the wind out of her and sent shocks of agonizing pain into her two breasts as they smashed and scraped into the rough back. From the corner of her vision, she saw Shikamaru drop his readied stance as his concentration puffed away and his shadow jutsu ended. Now free of the boy's hold on him, the conjoined ninjas leaped at the Nara and sent him spinning to the ground with a backhanded slap to the head. He did not get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Ninata mumbled. She was hurting all over and her lungs burned with desperate need for oxygen. She didn't have time to recover, she had to get up and\u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand clamped down on her throat. The former boy felt her body pull upward until it no longer touched the ground. And the next thing she knew, she was staring directly into the hateful eyes of Sakon. <i>No...not again!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" said Sakon with an evil smirk. \"Don't have any more tricks? No more red chakra? Come, we're all waiting to see what you can do, bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop dawdling and just kill her!\" barked Ukon, his voice strained. Whatever he had gone through previously, he was still recovering from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she tries anything, I'll just snap her neck.\" To demonstrate this, he squeezed Ninata's throat. The girl, already short of breath, choked and gasped, her lungs desperate for air. His point made, Sakon eased up his hold, giving the blunette a chance to breathe again. \"But first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's vision was all a blur. She could barely make anything out. And she was too weak and tired to do anything. She was too weak and tired to even think. But she caught something. She saw a figure, cloaked in black, stand up on shaky legs like a newborn foal, and shake off a dreadful mixture of liquid darkness as if it was afterbirth. Wings sprouted from its back like a demon of western lore before it took to the air, flew into the sky, and circled around the canopy of the forest as if it was testing its new appendages out for the first time. It then veered its way down in her direction, landing feet-first right in front of her, and chilling her body with a gust of wing as it buffeted its wings one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformed Hyuga gazed at the figure, willing her vision to sharpen so she could make out who or what exactly it was. It was alien, with granite skin, violet lips, and a cross-like symbol etched into the middle of its face. Looking deep into the blood-red irises of its eyes that spun with the familiar sickle-like shapes of the Sharingan, Ninata quickly realized just who she was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sas...uke?\" she moaned weakly. It was all she could get out, but inwardly, she was all but screaming: <i>What the hell happened to you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know this girl?\" said Sakon, all traces of black humor gone from his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke gave only the faintest hint of a head shake. \"Just her name,\" he said, his voice deeper and graver than Ninata remembered. He spoke with absolutely no emotion, save for maybe a hint of disappointment, as if he was expecting to see someone else. \"Hyuga Hinata. She means nothing to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Means nothing, hm?\" said Sakon, his mouth forming a horizontal line. \"Strange, she seemed really interested in you. No matter. Since she clearly means absolutely nothing to you, you'll have no qualms against killing her then? As a test of loyalty to your new master, Orochimaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata couldn't move, but she could feel her heart thump into her chest. <i>He wouldn't...</i></span></div></div>",

She had taken off the very second Tenten was stable and securely hidden, wanting nothing more than to be reunited with her love. Tenten had been kind enough to lend her a shirt before she left though, which they both figured the younger girl was in greater need of. It was a little long on her small frame, but that was okay; it just meant more coverage for her otherwise bare bottom. She wasn't about to complain about finally having some decency, though she had to admit feeling a little weird to have any kind of clothing on after being naked for so long outside of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Byakugan active, Hinata traced the path she hoped Ninata had taken, working her way in the direction that Shikamaru and Ino had last been seen in. Her enhanced vision allowed her to literally see the forest through the trees, and sure enough, she picked up on a clearing just ahead of her. And lo and behold, the blunette caught sight of Ino, who looked to be rushing ahead in a fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is she in a hurry for?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn three bounds, Hinata got her answer when she saw the conjoined Sound twins, holding her naked lover up by the neck! Her heart just about leapt into her throat. <i>How did he...when did...no!</i> And standing before them was a demonic winged figure that looked kind of, sort of, vaguely like Sasuke. But wrong. Very, very wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse, his arm was thrust straight into Ninata!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, it was over. The naked, lavender-eyed girl with the hot bod was dead. Impaled by her fellow Leaf-nin. Sakon would have preferred a more drawn-out death; hell, he still got hard at the thought of pinning her to the ground and getting a taste at all her supple flesh had to offer. But he supposed watching her die by Sasuke's hand would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll just have to make sure to give her twin sister the treatment they both deserve.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" he said, locking his eyes onto the Uchiha's to see if he could sense any kind of latent emotion from the raven-haired boy. Shock, guilt, sorrow, doubt, or anything really. But all he got was a blank and unreadable expression. \"Your loyalty to Orochimaru is proven and your ties to Konohagakure are well and truly severed. Now we can\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't get to finish that thought as a familiar heat began to wash over him from the girl's slumped form. It started off like the warmth of a small candle, but rapidly boiled into a fire that was rapidly going out of control. Instinctively, he released his hold on her neck and leaped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It can't be.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's hand seized the shocked Uchiha's arm, even as it was still impaled through her torso and protruding sickly out of her back, his fist red with her blood. The boy, still looking like an unholy imitation of a tengu, struggled to pull his hand out of her grip, his previously stoic face twisting into mild panic as his efforts proved useless against the girl who by all rights <i>should not be physically capable of standing!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low hiss escaped from her lips as she slowly, agonizingly pulled Sasuke's arm out of her torso, the action making a sickening wet slurping sound as corrupted flesh rubbed against naked muscle and torn viscera. The Uchiha's eyes widened as it quickly dawned on him that there was absolutely nothing he could do. He could only gape in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the girl hurled his body into the nearest tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small tremble shook Sakon as his brother drew in a sharp breath behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hyuga girl kept her gaze locked on the Uchiha boy. She took one step forward, her whole body lurching from the sudden mass of missing matter in her form. A cloak of crimson chakra enveloped her body, the same kind that the twins had seen in their last altercation with her. And they watched in complete wonder, as the gaping hole where her stomach was began to close. Muscle and fat seemingly bubbled and melted like wax as tissue was reformed, torn blood vessels were reconnected, fractured bones were realigned, and ruptured organs inflated and pulsed again with life-giving fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssssaaasss...ukeee,\" the girl snarled, her voice a dangerous octave lower and seething with unbridled hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakon,\" said Ukon with absolute certainty. \"We have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakon merely nodded. For once, he was in complete agreement with his more practical brother. He didn't know what the hell this...thing was, but he was absolutely certain that there was no way he could defeat it. Not alone and not now. He dashed to Sasuke, who was starting to pull himself out of the tree he was all but embedded in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up!\" he commanded. \"We're leaving. Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy glared at him stubbornly. \"But\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't beat this thing,\" said Ukon. \"Not as you are now. We can escape while it's still recovering. But we <i>will</i> lose if we fight it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is she?\" said Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakon turned to the Hyuga girl, and saw her face for the first time. The soft childish naivet\u00e9 that it originally bore was gone. In its place was the ugly grimace of a wild animal no longer capable of rational thought, with sharp bestial fangs jutting out of her mouth, and the large orbs of her eyes now a blazing red, like two angry blood moons hanging in the sky. Nothing was capable of doing that. Nothing except...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Jinch\u016briki,\" said Ukon in the lowest of whispers.</span></div></div>",

A blood-hued mist that drowned everything, choked the life out of world, save for the only things that mattered: the shadowy shapes of the ones she was <i>going to kill.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kill kill kill...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body burned, inside and out, but she welcomed the pain. The air was thick and threatened to crush her under its sheer weight, but she welcomed the burden. Her breath was ragged and it tasted of salt, iron and copper, but she welcomed that too. She would suffer any agony if it meant she would hold their three heads in her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cloud the color of congealed blood flooded her vision as the two-headed demon of sound hurled an object upon the earth. She knew what that meant. They were running, trying to get away within a cloud of smoke. She would not let that happen. She'd rip them limb from limb before she'd let that happen! She'd flay the flesh off their backs, devour their hearts, tear their tongues, gouge out their eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...kill kill kill...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave chase, cutting through the smoke that threatened to blind her. She would find them. By every unholy spirit that had ever been conceived, she would find them, and give them their due reward. Her nerves erupted with heat until it felt as though pure magma was pumping through her veins, but she ignored it. She would gladly burn all her flesh away to see the look in their eyes as she snuffed their lives out, one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...kill kill kill...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled. She tripped. She fell. She crashed upon the forest floor. And just like that, the energy within her body left her. Dissipated, like a candle with no more wax to burn. And in the distance, beyond the reach of her talons, in the crimson-hued fog that clouded her sight, she saw their flickering forms growing ever smaller in the rustling leaves of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...won't...get...away...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...nata!\" She thought she heard a voice call her name. A familiar voice, as gentle and soothing as the soft pattering of rain on a koi pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who is that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vision blurred, but she thought she saw a face enter her vision. A beautiful face, angelic and heart-shaped, with two large orbs of silver that glowed softly through the crimson haze like pearls from the bluest ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I know her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninata!\" the girl cried, her voice panicked, fearful and growing more and more distant to her ears. \"Ninata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vision went black. She heard nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Beep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeep.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata opened her eyes to the sound of electronic hums and computerized blips. A stretch of harsh, florescent light shone coldly upon her from above. White stretched on every which way she looked, bright, blank and lifeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Am I...dead?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed herself up to a sitting position, only to clutch her head as a wave of dizziness and stinging pain suddenly washed over it. A blast of cool air hit the skin of her bare breasts as some kind of soft fabric fell off her chest, but she couldn't be bothered to care. This throbbing pain...it was the worst headache she ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Guess that means I'm alive then.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former boy slowly looked around, her hand still massaging her ailing head. She was on a bed of some sort, narrow and just as uncannily white as everything else in the room, with all sorts of tubes sticking into her and an ICU monitor displaying her heart rate to the side. She blinked in confusion. <i>A...hospital? When did I get here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata shut her eyes in concentration as she attempted to retrace her steps and figure out how she got here. She was in the forest, training with Hinata, learning how to make use of her new bloodline ability. They took off their clothes, danced naked on the river, splashed around. Then they swam to the shore, both ready to make love on the bank, when they suddenly saw their fellow Leaf-nin in hot pursuit of the Sound who had taken Sasuke. She and her girlfriend joined them. They got into many fights and dangerous encounters. At the end of it all, she was staring directly into Sasuke's eyes. But he didn't look like himself; he looked like some kind of monster from legend. And then, while she was helpless, a thousand birds began to sing and then he...he...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be true,\" she said, her lips just barely mouthing the words. \"He wouldn't have. It doesn't make sense. He...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's thoughts were interrupted by a harsh voice cutting through the air like a sharpened katana. \"You are an idiot.\" The transformed Hyuga girl broke away from her reverie and brought her attention to the doorway where Tsunade stood, arms crossed and brows lowered to form a disapproving glare directed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obaa-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are an idiot,\" Tsunade repeated, stepping into the room and closing the door behind her, quietly so as to not disturb any other patients, but also with an air of authority that told the younger girl that there would be no escape. The short-tempered drunken gambler that Ninata knew was gone, replaced by a woman of steel who had been selected to be the Leaf's fifth Hokage for a very good reason. \"You are in a significantly weakened state, in a body you don't know how to control, not even an official ninja, who threw yourself into a military operation unarmed and...undressed!\" She punctuated that last point with a tug on Ninata's blanket, raising it up from where it was piled at the girl's waist so as to cover her still naked body. \"What the hell were you thinking?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata winced at the Hokage's words as she clutched the hospital blanket to her chest, the older woman's every syllable penetrating the transformed Hyuga like a stab to the heart. \"I...I just wanted to...\" she trailed off, not quite knowing what to say or how to explain herself, her adrenaline starting to run too high to give her a chance to think clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know what you wanted to do. You wanted to show off your new power and strut your stuff like a peacock in a mission you were to have no part in. All the while never once conceiving that your current state would make you a liability in the field and possibly get people killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...provided some help!\" Ninata cried, looking up at the Hokage with watery eyes. \"I helped save Shikamaru and Ino and Chouji, didn't I? And Hinata, she saved Tenten. I wasn't...I wasn't totally useless. Was I?\" Suddenly, her eyes widened. She didn't recall seeing Hinata after they ran unto the bun-haired girl. \"Is...is Hinata-chan all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed as she pulled up a chair to sit beside the former Uzumaki's bed. \"Hinata's fine,\" she said, her tone softening up, but still keeping its razor edge. \"She was actually one of the few who got through this disaster unharmed, in fact. She was absolutely hysterical when my men found her and the rest of the team in the woods, and we had to just about pry her away from you. I sent her home to your shared apartment, in case you're wondering. I'll be sure to inform her that you've awakened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata let out the breath she didn't realize she was holding. Hinata-chan was safe. That was good. \"So how long have I been out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been unconscious for a little over a day. Somewhere within the realm of 35 hours. Your chakra levels were dangerously low, and your coils were...Ninata, to be perfectly honest, what I saw of them was one of the worst cases of interior chakra burning I had ever seen in a person. What the hell did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well,\" Ninata said, licking her lips nervously. \"That...that happened when I was forced to call on the Kyubey's chakra. Turned out my new coils were a little too...small for it I guess. That's what I got from Hinata-chan anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should have thought as much,\" said the Hokage, kneading a finger into the diamond-shaped mark on her forehead. \"Well, you'll live, that's important. But if we didn't have you hooked up on so many pain killers right now, I don't think you'd be in a position to speak right now. And don't think about leaving this hospital for the next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata wordlessly nodded at that. \"Did we...was the mission successful at least?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade shook her head. \"No. Hinata and Ino reported seeing Sasuke leaving the borders of Konoha's territory accompanied by a Sound-nin. With everyone else indisposed of, and it being quite clear that this was no longer a rescue operation as we were led to believe, they concluded it was not to their advantage to continue pursuit. The mission was a failure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh,\" said Ninata, lowering her head despondently. They failed. She failed. The Sound won again. They got what they wanted, and now they had her friend in their clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriend? Could she even call Sasuke that anymore? She knew he was a jerk, he always got on her nerves, and they weren't exactly on the best of terms in recent times, but...but...Ninata's mind drew a blank. All she could see anymore was that twisted inhuman mask he wore, devoid of all emotion as he thrust an electrified fist into...why did he do it? Why did he betray his village? What was going on in his head? Why...was he willing to kill her? <i>No, it wasn't me he was willing to kill. It was Hinata-chan. He thought I was Hinata-chan. He was willing to kill her, and he would have without a second thought. If he ever did anything to hurt her, I'd...I'd...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninata?\" Tsunade asked, her voice filling with concern. Ninata snapped back to the present and noticed that the palms of her hands were slightly damp and stinging in pain. She had clenched her fists so tightly into them, that her nails had drawn blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry,\" the former boy sputtered as she loosened her hands and laid down, blushing with embarrassment that she had almost let her temper get a hold of her. \"Just...tell me, how is everyone else? Did everyone...make it out okay?\"</span></div></div>",

Shikamaru suffered a deep cut and a concussion, but he'll be ready for active duty soon enough. Tenten is alive, in no small part thanks to Hinata, but her leg will require surgery before she can return to the field. She'll be recovering alongside her teammate, Lee, whose operation I just completed yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a momentary pause. \"And the rest?\" said Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade closed her eyes and sighed. That was never a good sign in Ninata's experience. \"Chouji suffered many severe injuries\u2013which I will not go into at this time\u2013and a massive drain to his chakra reserves. He's comatose and in intensive care now, and nobody has any idea when, or if, he will ever wake up. As for Kiba...Kiba is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another pause. Ninata couldn't help but fidget uncomfortably in the silence. \"Yes? What happened to Kiba?\" she asked, though she had a feeling she already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hokage's words were soft, but to Ninata's ears, they might as well have been a thunderclap. \"Kiba is dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tangible silence fell over the room, so thick it was almost suffocating. Ninata took a few deep, measured breaths as the older woman's words echoed in her head, an exercise she had been taught to stay calm and steady in the wake of extreme distress. Kiba was dead. A boy not much older than her, who she had grown up alongside for most of her young life. He was strong, healthy, determined and ready to fight the last time she saw him. And now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata couldn't say she would necessarily miss the dog boy. She didn't hate him <i>per se</i>, but she didn't really know him all that well either. And what little she did know was not very positive. She wouldn't beat around the bush; Kiba was a jerk, one of among many children whose taunts and jeers made her life in the academy a living hell. But Kiba was Hinata's friend, and Hinata, true to her kind heart, had nothing but good things to say about both him and his dog. She often said that he was like the older brother she always wished she had. The older brother she wished she had...without estranging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't have that older brother. Not anymore. And Ninata would never get to know or see that side of him. The former Uzumaki may not have liked Kiba personally, but she knew she wasn't one to hold a grudge either. Maybe if they had a chance to actually talk and spar like two equals, they could have been friends. But it was too late for that now. And Ninata knew why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was because of her. It was because she was weak. It was because she didn't have the strength to kill that bastard Sakon when she had the chance. It was because she was barely able to stand when Kiba showed up in the nick of time to save her and Hinata. If Ninata hadn't been there, then he wouldn't have needed to save them. Maybe, just maybe, he'd still be alive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Uzumaki rolled to her side. She couldn't bear to look the Hokage in the eye. She didn't deserve to. Trash like her didn't even deserve to be in the same room as a ninja so powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You blame yourself,\" said the Hokage. It wasn't a question. \"I suppose on some level, you should. Ninata, what you did was grossly irresponsible. You were not ready for that kind of combat situation and it will be some time before you ever are. And you most certainly were not prepared or equipped for it. I don't doubt that you meant well, but whether you knew it or not, your presence in the mission affected things, and probably not for the better. If you hadn't been there, then things might have gone differently. Maybe it would have succeeded. Maybe we would have Sasuke here in our custody. Maybe everyone I sent would have come home alive and in once piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to rub it in,\" Ninata murmured, her normally chipper voice sounding so deflated, even to her own ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade continued. \"Or maybe...maybe everyone would have died if you weren't there. Maybe if you and Hinata hadn't intervened, then we'd be carving several more names on the monument. I heard the reports from Shikamaru, Ino, Tenten, and Hinata. I won't deny that you two did some good out there. And I won't deny that the responsibility for this failure rests on the shoulders of many people, not just you. But that doesn't change the fact that both you and Hinata were reckless. And if either of you continue this kind of behavior, you will eventually get yourselves or someone else killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's eyes widened at the mention of Hinata's name. \"Wait!\" she gasped, turning her attention back to Tsunade. \"Hinata-chan did nothing wrong. Joining Shikamaru and the others was all my idea! She tried to talk me out of it. It was my fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata may have been reluctant,\" said Tsunade as she crossed her arms, \"but she is every capable of making her own choices, and she still followed you in this fool's errand. She understood the risks, she understood that what you and she were doing was not smart, and she did it anyway. She let you commit this foolishness, and for that, she bears just as much responsibility as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't punish her,\" Ninata whispered. \"She doesn't deserve this. Not after...Kiba...\" The former boy would take anything the older woman could throw at her. Beatings, demotions, community service, dishonorable discharge, she could handle it. She'd accept it. It's what she deserved after all. But if Hinata suffered in any way due to Ninata's fuck-ups...she didn't think she'd ever be able to forgive herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already had this talk with her,\" said Tsunade. \"And she understands precisely where she failed. As for what I'm going to do with you two...I haven't decided yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata moaned as she turned away from the Hokage again, the weight of her actions really coming down on her now. Every test she failed in the academy, every lowly D-rank mission she botched, none of them could approach the magnitude of this latest screw-up of hers. She couldn't do anything right, she failed every task she took up, failed every person who depended on her. How could Hinata ever love a worthless cur like her? Would she even <i>continue</i> to love her after this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed again, her voice beginning to soften to a more motherly tone, the anger that had been coursing through her veins finally burning out. \"Ninata, I'm not...I'm not trying to kick you while you're down. Or Hinata. A lot has happened in such a short time, I understand that, especially in the wake of this transformation you've undergone that we're still trying to wrap out heads around. I only want you to...understand. There's more to being a good ninja than just leaping into every fray you come across. You might think it's your sworn duty to risk everything you have for your people, and that's admirable. But you need to understand your limits too, know what you can do and what you can't. Something I'm starting to think your instructor never bothered to teach you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I worry about you, you know,\" she added, her voice almost dropping to a whisper. She paused for a moment, as if to hear what Ninata had to say. But for once in the young loudmouth's life, she had nothing. When that became clear to the blonde, she stood up, knowing that the discussion had run its course. \"We'll talk later. Until then, just rest. That's an order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade tenderly ran a hand through the younger girl's dark locks, clearly as a sign of comfort. But Ninata found no peace from the gesture. It only reminded her of how Hinata would lovingly caress her after the two of them shared an intense orgasm. <i>She'll never want to touch me again after this. Ever.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights flickered off and the door closed once more, leaving Ninata alone with her thoughts. And a steadily growing ache between her legs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata could not recall a more miserable time in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe events of yesterday had already been one heart-stopping moment after another. So when she saw Sasuke's electrifying fist pierce through her love, she just about thought her heart would finally give out. She had been just about ready to fall on her knees, shut down, and let fate decide he rend. She honestly didn't care what happened to herself at that point. But then, the red chakra that Ninata had used earlier came back in full force, and something wondrous happened: her wound, massive, gaping and fatal as it was, regenerated. Bones, muscles and organs that weren't supposed to heal were restored into near-perfect condition in a matter of minutes, as if they had been whole the entire time. But even so, Hinata feared the worst; she feared that her dear Ninata would shuffle away from her mortal coil at any moment, especially when she went limp and fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had clutched her naked love with all her might, holding her close to make sure she still drew breath and emanated warmth, keeping a hand on her chest to count her heartbeats. She didn't recall anything else after that, only that she was eventually pulled away from Ninata by Anbu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief only came to Hinata when she was assured that Ninata was would live. That she was fatigued, low on chakra, still had inflamed coils, but was stabilized, expected to make a full recovery, and wasn't going anywhere. At that moment, Hinata was sure that they were finally over the worst of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then news of Kiba's condition reached her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the young Hyuga cried that day. She cried in the hospital. She cried in front of the Hokage. She cried as she was escorted home. She cried into her futon. She cried for so long, until her eyes were too red, sore and dry to keep crying. So she took a shower and sat miserably under the spray of water for nearly an hour, just so that she could continue to feel the sensation of hot water cascading down her face in tiny little rivulets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata ate nothing that evening. She never even left her apartment. After her shower, she just marched to her futon without bothering to put on any clothing and lied down. The day left her physically and emotionally exhausted, but for some reason, sleep just wouldn't come to her. So she stared at the ceiling, which was blank and white, just like her mind. She felt so small there, all by herself, in her own home. It felt empty without Ninata by her side. <i>She</i> felt empty without Ninata at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata...with her sparkling lavender pearls, those dark tresses of hair, large jiggling mounds of mammary flesh, all the better to nurse her children with, capped off by her cute, pointy, pink nubs. The hairless ivory flesh, the soft gentle curve of her still widening hips that Hinata dreamed would carry a child one day, <i>her</i> child one day...and especially the swaying, ever-so-slightly rippling orbs of her sumptuous rump. Just thinking about how it wiggled as Ninata ran through the forest in her birthday suit made Hinata's mouth water. She wanted to hold it in her hands again, to feel the almost baby-smooth flesh ooze between her fingers as she pressed her lover tightly into her, mashing her swollen clit against her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was how Hinata spent her night, with one hand jammed into her crotch, and the other on her breasts. She massaged her tender flesh, flicked and pinched her nipples, gasped at the electric tingles as they grew in size and hardness, and rubbed her parted lips in vigorous circular patterns, setting her whole being aflame. She was wet all over, with liquid love between her legs and perspiration everywhere else. The fabric she lied on grew increasingly damper as the hours ticked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her climax did not come that night. And neither did sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's...wrong with me?\" she hissed, hurling her vibrator at the nearest wall. It was a little thing that Hinata had secretly purchased in a mission to the Tea Country a ways back to help her get through the many lonely nights that dominated her life. While the Leaf had no shortage of shops of such ill repute, she would never dare set foot in one of them; if someone found out what a little pervert the demure Hyuga could be, she'd just about die of embarrassment. So she settled on a place in a town in a foreign country where nobody knew her, and transformed into an adult to trick the proprietor into thinking she was completely legal. Which, at the time, Hinata couldn't help but find a little ridiculous despite herself. Modern day society had no problems with a girl her age killing and dying for money, but doing anything to her vagina outside of keeping it from dripping blood everywhere a few days every month was a big no-no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in any case, whenever Hinata needed a quick bout of pleasure, the vibrator always delivered. It even had a photograph of Naruto's face taped to the end of it! But now, even it was failing to please her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole day had been the same as last night; endless stimulation, nonexistent ejaculation, and ceaseless frustration. Hinata tried everything she could think of; she rubbed herself against her pillow, on the furnishings, on some of Ninata clothes, both the new ones for her new feminine body and even some of her old boy clothes like those garish orange coats they needed to get rid of. She attempted to blast herself with the showerhead, to no avail. She even tried to suck her own tits with limited success. Nothing worked. She was as horny as she had been all night. Her hard nipples had been throbbing for hours, and her pussy wouldn't stop dripping fluids. But she just...would...not...cum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as frustrating as it was mystifying. Hinata didn't think it was possible for a girl of any age to get stuck in non-stop state of arousal for so many hours without getting any kind of satisfaction. What time was it anyway? Nearly 9:30 at night? Where the hell did the day go?! She had just spent an entire night and day masturbating in the apartment and hadn't gotten one orgasm out of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really confused the girl most of all was how did she get this way? What happened to her grief over Kiba? She wasn't supposed to be obsessing over sex, she was supposed to be mourning her fallen friend. She was supposed to be feeling guilt for his death, railing against herself for not helping him when he needed her most, just as she had been doing ever since she returned home yesterday. But no matter what she did, the craving for her dear twin's flesh and crushing her naked body against Hinata's own was the only thing on her mind. But she couldn't do such a thing because Ninata was in the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninata-chan,\" she whispered, licking her lips, as if trying to catch the taste of her lover's name in the air. She needed Ninata. Only Ninata could satisfy her now. Maybe Ninata was the only thing who would <i>ever</i> be able to satisfy her. Her hands and toys most certainly weren't working anymore. Hinata received the news; her twin had woken up a few hours ago, and she would be able to visit her during the normal hours tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck tomorrow,\" the blunette wheezed, forgetting to remain polite like a good little Hyuga girl. The tingling sensation in her perpetually hardened nipples and dripping labia were driving her absolutely insane. She couldn't think or focus on anything except about all the orgasms she wanted to have over the next week. And she was going to have them. Now. Hinata hastily put on some clothes, mostly just a pair of shorts, sandals and a white shirt with the sigil of the Leaf. She didn't bother with a bra and panties; they were just another layer of fabric she really had no need of. Once she was legally dressed, the Hyuga just about leapt out the door to seek out her princess in the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding Ninata was easy thanks to her Hyuga eyes. Hinata could detect her distinct chakra easily enough from outside the hospital. The boy-turned-girl was in a room on the second floor of the hospital, and she could see how her chakra almost seemed to react to her presence, as if it knew she was coming. It was just as Hinata thought after their first night together; she and Ninata would always desire the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no time to waste, the young Hyuga ran up the wall, hopped onto the window sill, and popped the glass open in what could be described as one fluid motion. And before her laid her fair maiden, Hyuga Ninata. But she was not resting. She was trying to, if her closed eyes were any indication, but her thrashing around on the little hospital bed indicated that she was having a lot of trouble sleeping. And Hinata had a good idea why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All the more reason why we must do this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninata-chan,\" Hinata whispered in a husky voice, her heart beating a thousand times a minute. At the sound of her name, the former boy's eyes flew open just in time for her twin to yank the covers off and expose her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi-Hinata-chan?\" Ninata stammered. \"Wh-what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't answer. She merely looked longingly at her double with pure hunger, exhaling a long breath of hot air. Ninata may have been shocked, but she was still very aroused, Hinata could tell. Her skin was flushed. Her tits were hard. And she could smell the musty scent of Hyuga pleasure emanating from her slightly damp thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninata-chan,\" Hinata repeated as she just about tore her clothes off. \"I <b>need</b> you.\" She climbed onto the foot of the bed and crawled her way up her twin's form like a cat, shuddering as her large breasts brushed against and trailed on the creamy flesh of Ninata's body, but all the while never letting her hooded eyes leave Ninata's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata still didn't look so sure. \"Hi-Hinata, we mmpphh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata did not let her lover finish that thought. She merely took advantage of her slightly parted lips to smash her own upon them and guide her tongue, hungry for the taste of Ninata, into her waiting mouth. Ninata was taken aback...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...but she very quickly turned to butter at her twin's touch, almost seeming to fall limp onto the bed as she welcomed Hinata inside. The born-Hyuga in turn laid her form down upon Ninata, pressing their identical naked bodies together, stomach to stomach and breast to breast. If her lips weren't interwoven with her twin's, she would have giggled at the full-bodied shudder that came over Ninata as her breasts came into contact with her skin, the softness of her girl flesh as it squished into Ninata's striking a strong contrast with how hard her nipples were as they prodded into the former boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's legs spread out to allow Hinata to fall even closer into her and her arms rose to embrace the born-Hyuga. Her hands explored Hinata's back in the same way that Hinata explored her twin's mouth, tracing every ridge of bone and every stretch of rippling muscle until they made their way down to where the pillowy flesh of her dainty derriere awaited. Hinata just about gasped in Ninata's mouth as she felt her twin's fingers give her a little pinch down there. Kami, she needed this, needed to feel her lover's touch sooooo bad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata finally broke away from the kiss and pulled back, her eyes never leaving Ninata's as they opened in silent alarm. Ninata murmured a quiet complaint and began to sit up so that she could catch Hinata's lips before they flew out of reach, but the born-Hyuga wouldn't have it. Gripping her shoulders, Hinata shoved Ninata flat onto the bed as she sat upright over her. Ninata did not resist, as she seldom ever did, but her worried expression turned into one of slight confusion as she wondered what Hinata was going to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blunette could only lick her lips in hunger. Ninata looked so innocent every time she surrendered control over to her completely. So innocent and adorable that one could almost mistake her for a child, provided they ignored the firm plump breasts which just begged to be groped. Or suckled. And normally, Hinata would do just that. She'd envelop one supple nipple into her mouth, trace the pink circle of her areola with her tongue, and pull at the little nub with her breath as well as her teeth, just to get the juices stirring in her loins as well as Ninata's. Then she would kiss her way to Ninata's collar and nibble lovingly at the soft flesh on her neck, leaving little love bites that would show through all the next day, telling everyone that Ninata was <b>hers</b>. As her twin's heat steadily rose, Hinata would then suddenly flip her over with domineering force, and gaze hungrily at the milk-hued orbs of her wondrous behind, which more than anything else, were the things she missed the most about her lover. Then she would entwine them in her fingers, knead them like dough, plant soft kisses on them just to feel how baby-smooth the flesh was on her lips before she spread them wide and exposed the pink folds of Ninata's sex before her. And then she'd...she'd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Well, whatever Hinata would do in that situation would take time. Teasing Ninata was all well and good, and it always ensured that both of them would share an even more explosive orgasm than normal. But Hinata wasn't concerned about the quality of her orgasm; she just wanted to have an orgasm <b>period</b>. Her loins still dripped and burned with desire, with aching need, and she could tell by the wetness around Ninata's groin that her twin did too. Teasing and foreplay would have to wait for another time. Tonight, the only thing Hinata and her girlfriend needed was pure, unbridled, animalistic action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinat-AH!\" Ninata gasped as Hinata yanked her form a quarter of the way down the length of the bed, nearly turned her onto her side, and entwined their legs together so that they met pussy to pussy. A feeling of electricity sparked in Hinata as her swollen clit collided with Ninata's, hotter and more intense than all the hours she had previously spent masturbating combined. It was all the Hyuga girl could do to not faint in surprise. But it confirmed what she had come to realize over the past day and night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We need each other. We need each other now. And we'll need each other always.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting one of Ninata's legs up so that she could fully brace herself, as well as feel more of her lover's tantalizing flesh on her naked skin, Hinata began. Rhythmically she swayed her hips, frontward, backward and side to side as she grinded her crotch into Ninata's. Slowly at first, just to savor the feelings of once again holding her lover again after being deprived of her for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the sensation of her wet folds rubbing and squishing against her near-identical twin's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr feeling the surface area of Ninata's thigh slip and slide between the cleft of her buttocks while her hardened nipple raked across the boy-turned girl's other leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr the tingling sensations that grew ever hotter in her core, in her spine, in her tits, and even on the tips of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more than anything else, Hinata simply wanted to enjoy the lilt in Ninata's voice as she sang to her in those low, quiet moans the born-Hyuga loved so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as Hinata had no time for foreplay, she also had no time to take it slow for long either. Her clit was throbbing as it mashed itself into Ninata's sex, whose clit in turn pushed itself into hers. She needed release. Now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching Ninata's leg so tight that it nearly buried itself between her boobs, Hinata sped up her gyrations, rubbing herself circularly harder and faster into Ninata while loud squelching noises of skin slick with perspiration and liquid love rang through the air. Ninata let out a small cry before biting down on her lower lip to suppress any more moans from escaping them, but even her muffled gasps couldn't escape the Hyuga's trained ears. Hinata would have let out a low breathy chortle at how adorable her twin looked, but she couldn't. For she found herself doing the exact same thing and knew that her own face was a perfect reflection of Ninata's, as it always was. But onward she rubbed, onward she grinded, onward she thrust and slid and squelched, and Ninata followed her in what had been their nightly dance ever since this wonderful transformation came over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ni-Ni-Ninata,\" Hinata moaned in what she hoped was a whisper but knew had to very nearly be a shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-wh-what is it?\" Ninata said with much difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I...I need you,\" Hinata stammered without ceasing her movements. It was getting wetter down there, she could feel it, feel herself practically slipping over Ninata's skin, which was indeed taking on an increasingly more glassy sheen. \"I need you with me f-f-for...forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nodded her head even as she struggled to keep up. \"I-I need you t-too, Hi-Hinata-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ever leave me again! P-please! Ninata-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I won't!\" cried Ninata as she reached a hand out to grope Hinata's breast, which had been bouncing and jiggling beautifully not even a foot away from her. It hurt a little to be bouncing around so much, but in a good way, a way that let Hinata know this was real. \"I'll be with you 'til...til the end!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Til the end!\" screamed Hinata, her mind going into absolute overdrive as the growing pressure in her core flared up in no small part to feeling her lover's tender fingers wrap around her sensitive mammary flesh. \"'Til the end!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was coming. She was cumming. For the first time in what felt like centuries! Hinata threw her head back and screamed in ecstasy as the sensation of heat erupted from her like a tsunami. One wave came out. As did another. And another. And another! And with each crashing wave, Hinata's entire form trembled involuntarily, enough that her skin tickled as it vibrated against Ninata's, which only elicited another cry of pleasure from her lips. And Ninata in turn followed her, her whole form quaking in response to Hinata's spasms of bliss, and her own cries of pleasure echoing Hinata's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were loud, both of them, but Hinata didn't care. She didn't care if anyone heard them. She didn't care if they woke the whole hospital. She didn't care if she was caught having a highly inappropriate visit with a patient in the middle of the night. All she cared about was being with the girl she loved and getting the relief she so desperately craved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninataaaaaa,\" she whispered, letting go of Ninata's leg so that she could lay atop her girlfriend and kiss her on the lips. Ninata's face, like the rest of her body, was glossy with sweat, and much of her unkempt hair had to be brushed aside, for it clung to her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, mmmphh, Hina-mmmmpph-ta-chan?\" the former Uzumaki breathed quietly, struggling to get a word out in between every suffocating kiss Hinata planted on her lips. \"Wh-what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need more.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tenten was always on the alert, even when she was fast asleep. Her ability to wake up at the slightest noise in the middle of the night had saved her team more times than she could count. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thump! Ah! Thump! Oooh! Thump! Mmmm! Thump!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, tonight was proving that it could be just as much of a curse as it could be a blessing. The noises and vibrations coming from the room right next to hers were doing everything they could to keep the usually bun-haired kunoichi awake, and it didn't sound like they would be stopping anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on in there?\" she growled. Didn't they know that some people were trying to sleep? Tenten had half a mind to get up, march into that room, and give the occupant a piece of her mind, but she knew that wasn't really possible. The doctors had extracted the strange white arrow from her leg and stemmed the bleeding for the time being, but until they completed the surgery on it, walking was just not going to be an option. Tenten supposed she could just call a nurse to shut them up, but somehow, she doubted the lazy hospital staff would even show up to answer her complaining. Alternatively, she could try banging on the wall and demand that the neighbor knock it off, but she quickly dispelled that thought. She didn't know who exactly was on the other side. It could have been someone very dangerous or temperamental for all she knew, and Tenten really didn't want to risk picking a fight with a bum leg. Damn it, she hated feeling so helpless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Guess I could listen in first. Should learn what I can about this asshole before I act.</i> That seemed to be the logical course of action, so Tenten pressed her ear to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe identified a lot of the noises. Like the springs of a bed groaning, the clattering of some small object falling upon the floor, and moaning. Lots and lots of moaning that spoke volumes denoting pleasure, ecstasy and arousal from a very familiar feminine tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, ah, oh, oh, ahhh, mmm, yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager felt very hot around the cheeks. She recognized that voice; she had heard it only a day or so ago, and it was something she would never forget. Seeing and hearing a naked Hyuga girl masturbate while she performed lifesaving surgery on you in the field of battle was something that tended to stick in your memory. Of course, Tenten knew it wasn't the same Hyuga girl who was making those sounds currently; Hinata was fine from what she could gather, and it was her mysterious twin, Ninata, who had been hospitalized, but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ni-Ninata!\" the voice on the other side of the wall gasped as...something pounded the wall hard enough to send Tenten reeling back. \"Ninata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi-Hinata,\" another voice cried out which sounded exactly like the first one. \"Hinata! Ah-ah-AH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Ohhhhh. Tenten cheeks grew even warmer. Hinata and Ninata were <i>both</i> in there. And it sounded like they were having very loud and very passionate sex. Was that even allowed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten chewed her lip. She had been thinking about Hinata a lot lately. Thinking how the Hyuga had saved her life, knowing what an enormous debt she owed her, and...other things. Things she couldn't exactly find the words to explain. The bun-haired girl had always been a tomboy at heart and never had any time for the typical girly stuff, but even she had to admit that the whole experience, grueling as it was, had been strangely...romantic in a way. Like the kind of thing most girls her age thought about in their dreams or read about in those trashy romance novels and shoujo manga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero had come to save Tenten from the brink of death, helped to nurse her back to health, and, to Tenten's great surprise, clearly found the black-haired ninja attractive. And while Tenten wasn't gay or anything, she couldn't help but be flattered to have that effect on another girl, as well as feel a little amused and perhaps even giddy to be part of such a multitude of rescue fantasy clich\u00e9s. A part of her had always maybe hoped that she would find herself in that position with Neji, but...well, she was too proud to ever let that happen, and he had a twelve-meter-long stick up his ass. And knowing Tenten's luck, it was more likely be that overzealous ham, Lee, who would jump to her rescue. That thought alone was enough to make her gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't just that; her thoughts about the blunette were dominated by the sight of her standing proudly in all her glory, shimmering in the natural world of the forest, naked as the day she was born. It had been so downright surreal and...well, once again, she was not a lesbian or anything of the sort, but even she had to admit that it was kind of hot. Especially how Hinata was able to reposition the arrow in Tenten's leg with one hand, while the other one was down in her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten jumped as a realization hit her. Her hand was under her hospital gown...no, under her <i>panties</i>, and it was feeling especially warm and moist. She didn't even know when she moved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another thump, as though something, or more likely, someone, had been pushed directly into the wall. There was a sound of heavy breathing, like what you would hear from the lungs of a person who had just run a marathon and was completely drenched in sweat. And it was followed by a litany of girlish giggling that promised all kinds of mischief. Tenten couldn't help but smile as she ran her fingers on both sides of her sensitive organ, shuddering at the electrifying tingling her own touch created. <i>I never realized how adorable Hinata's voice was.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaaaahhhhhh.\" Another moan, long, slow and drawn out, a sign that the next bout of pleasure its owner was experiencing was about to begin. \"Ahhhhhhh. Ohhhhhhh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten curled her fingers up, running them along her swollen clit a second time. She wished she had Hyuga eyes, just so she could see what the Hinata twins were doing on the other side of that wall. Just so she could see their naked bodies again, completely identical, shining with perspiration as they mashed and writhed and  slipped and rolled against one another, caressing, kissing, licking, and looking soulfully into each other's eyes. She wanted to know what positions they were using, how often they switched, and how long their hands, fingers and tongues would linger on their most sensitive womanly parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhh...ohhhhhh...ahhhhhhh.\" There were no groaning bedsprings to accompany the girl that was moaning. Perhaps one was eating the other out? Tenten ran her fingers down her clit again, jolting at the next pleasurable sensation she felt as she started reaching for her breast with her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...mmmm...mmmm...Hinata.\" So it was the twin, Ninata, who was moaning. That much was clear. And she was starting to speed up. Perhaps in response to Hinata? Maybe at this point, Hinata, who had been gently teasing her lover's pink folds with her tongue, was now beginning to lick at her sex faster and more voraciously? Or maybe she had enveloped the girl's now very moist and swollen clit between her lips and was sucking on it with hunger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten bit her lip as a finger slipped inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh, aaaah, uhhhh, ahhhh, uhhh, ahh, uhh!\" Ninata was moaning faster now, too fast to even breathe properly. By this point, her groin and the inside of her thighs had to be completely soaked, and Hinata was enjoying the sweet taste of her nectar as she lapped it all up down to the last drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten slipped another finger in, teasing the pulsing walls of her insides with a prolonged stroke of the creamy digit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kami!\" Ninata cried, her voice, nearly devoid of breath. \"Oh Kami! I can feel it! I feel it! I feel it! Ah, ah, ah...I'm gonna...I'm gonna...I'm gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp. Down. Up. Down. Tenten curled her fingers insider of her, brushing the gooey pink folds of flesh within as they seemed to massage both her hand and themselves with every beat in her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah...AAHHHHHHH!\" And she came. Right into Hinata's mouth, she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten hadn't yet. But she was getting there. She was getting wetter. Her whole body was aflame. She could feel it in her toes, in her breasts, on the back of her neck. In herself. She was stretched out as far as her one ailing leg would allow her to be, bare toes curling up, out and in to grip the fabric of the mattress she was resting on, all in preparation for what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi-Hinata, I-I'm gonna...again, I'm gonna....AH...AAAAAHHHHHHHH!\" And she came again. Probably even harder than last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this time, Tenten followed. Quietly with her eyes slammed close and her lips chewed shut, she came. Her panties were wet, her hospital gown was soaked through, and there would likely be some stains on the bed sheets she'd have a hard time explaining...but Kami, Tenten felt <i>so</i> good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten continued to listen to the twins as they continued their night of passion. Her right hand never left her crotch, and her left hand never strayed far from her breasts. She heard movement from the other room as the two girls seemed to change positions, and the metallic groaning sounds of the bedsprings returned. But it no longer bothered the older genin. Somehow, she couldn't help but think that nothing about those two girls' voices could ever bother her, for there was nothing else she would find more soothing than their pleasurable moans whispering in her ear. Before she knew it, the sounds of Hinata and Ninata's lovemaking lulled Tenten back into a gentle sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ninata awoke to the sound of light sniffling and the sensation of not being held. Squinting through the dim morning light, she made out the outline of her girlfriend's naked back. Hinata's buttocks were pressed flat on the edge of the mattress where she sat, her posture was slouched, and her head was in her hands. It didn't take a genius to know that the Hyuga girl was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata-chan?\" Ninata whispered, pushing herself up onto her knees and embracing her lover from behind, her arms positioned just under the born-Hyuga's breasts. Hinata's form stiffened when Ninata's bare boobs squashed into her, and the former boy had to bite her lip to keep herself from purring at how wonderful it felt to feel her lover with her now sensitive nipples. Last night had been wonderful; making love in the hospital was just so naughty, Hinata had been even more of a wild animal than usual, and it gave both their bodies and minds a sorely-needed release. Most of all, it assured Ninata that Hinata did not blame her for her failures; she still loved her regardless, and she would always love her. All of Ninata's fears had been assuaged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why was her girlfriend acting so sad now? Why was she on the verge of tears? Ninata could only begin to guess. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I,\" Hinata stuttered, rubbing her eyes furiously. \"I had a dream. It was a wonderful dream. I dreamed it was the future, and that we were getting married. I had on my best kimono, and...and...you were naked, Ninata-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaked at her own wedding? That must've been quite a sight. Ninata couldn't help but giggle at the image it formed in her head. \"Heh, that doesn't sound bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata let out a small laugh as well, but it was sad and choked with tears. \"Yes, it was. And you and everyone were acting like it was the most n-normal thing ever. Everyone was there. Sakura, Hokage-sama, Tenten-san, Kurenai-sensei...\" She trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata quirked an eyebrow. \"So what was the problem, Hinata-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba-kun was there too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Kiba. Ninata knew where this was going. After last night, she almost completely forgot about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so happy,\" Hinata choked, biting back the tears that were threatening to come back in full force. \"Then I woke up...and I remembered...Kiba-kun is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head fell back into her hands and the tears fell from her eyes in another torrent. Ninata's eyes began to get misty too; listening to the painful sobs of the girl she loved broke her heart and made her want to cry too. She tightened her hold on Hinata, squeezing her tightly, their mutual nakedness not even crossing her mind. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered. \"I'm so, <i>so</i> sorry, Hinata-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata turned around to fall into her lover's arms, burying her face into Ninata's shoulder. The warm tears from her eyes cascaded down Ninata's form, tickling her skin enough to raise goose bumps as tiny rivulets of water rounded the great orb that was her breast. It felt...kind of nice actually. Ninata didn't think she would ever get over how big her boobs were, or that she even <i>had</i> boobs at all now. But she said nothing about it; right now, she only wanted to give Hinata her peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't know how long she sat there, crying in her lover's arms. But when her sobs quieted down, she couldn't help but feel a bit sheepish about her emotional outburst. Ninata's normally silky smooth skin felt wet and slippery from all the tears she shed, and as she pulled back, she couldn't help but blink a little at how wet the former Uzumaki's breast had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry,\" she said, wiping her face to get all the existing moisture out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be,\" said Ninata, running a hand gracefully down her twin's shoulder. \"I...wouldn't take it well if I lost someone important to me either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA troubled expression washed over Ninata's face as she said that. Hinata couldn't help but sigh inwardly with guilt. She wasn't the only one who lost a friend; Ninata lost Sasuke, and though she was trying to put on a brave face as she always did, the born-Hyuga knew the former boy was likely still thinking about it. Or rather, going to be thinking about it for a while; now that neither of them were distracted by the need to orgasm in each other's arms, they both had to face up to the recent tragedies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ninata-chan.\" Her eyes gazing to the sleek and shiny boob of her lover, Hinata couldn't help but feel her heat begin to rise just by looking at it. She really should be getting dressed and leaving now while she still had time, but...aw, heck, after that, she figured both she and Ninata deserved at least one more roll in the hay, if only to distract them from sadness once more. Reaching a hand behind Ninata's head, she stroked the hair that was still mussed up from last night, and moved in for a kiss. Sensing what was coming, the former boy in turn parted her lips, ready to welcome her twin inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on Earth...oh for Pete's sake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And the mood was completely spoiled by the intrusion of a very peeved-looking Hokage. Not taking a moment to wonder when she arrived, or who exactly \"Pete\" was, Hinata squeaked in surprise as she all but dove under the flimsy hospital blanket, which was barely large enough to cover both she and her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oba-chan,\" Ninata sputtered, \"we-we were just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter slamming the door shut, Tsunade closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and mentally counted to ten as she made a few one-handed seals to cast a jutsu in some shape or form, but whatever it was, Hinata could only guess. After finishing it and regaining her composure, the Hokage opened her eyes to give the Hyuga girl a stony glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady, you are not supposed to be in here! Explain yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt herself go damp all over, and this time, it was not from arousal. \"I-I-I-I,\" she stammered, putting her two index fingers together under the blanket as she always did whenever she felt nervous. The Hokage was a very intimidating woman; she had no idea how Ninata was able to talk sass to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out,\" Tsunade snarled impatiently, pointing a finger directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I...\" Realizing this wasn't working for her, Hinata swiftly changed gears, clamping her hands together to stop her fidgeting completely and just blurted out the next words without thinking. \"I needed to get relief and Ninata was the only one who could provide it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade's angry expression shifted to one of confusion. \"Uh, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed. There was no way around it. Her back was to the wall and she had to tell the Hokage the details of her...sexual problems. Even if the humiliation killed her. So with a red face, she explained. She told Tsunade how she had spent a whole night and nearly a whole day masturbating. How her mind could only focus on sex, and breasts, and butts, and vaginas despite how exhausted and grief-stricken she was. How no matter what she did, she couldn't ever experience an orgasm. And more than that, how absolutely crazy it drove her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That happened to me too!\" Ninata chimed in. \"I was trying to...pleasure myself too, but couldn't. It wasn't until...Hinata-chan came to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...see,\" said Tsunade. \"How long has this been going on? How long have you two been...intimate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since I turned into Hinata,\" said Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we returned to Ninata-chan's old apartment after seeing you,\" Hinata said, feeling they should at least be specific, \"we took a bath together. We didn't think anything of it. But one thing led to another, and before I knew it...we were...we were making love. And we've made love every night since then. And that's not the only thing...I've looked at our chakra, and I've noticed that...our chakras are drawn to one another, almost magnetically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" said Tsunade as she rubbed her chin contemplatively, the authoritarian gone and the medical scientist taking over. \"I'll need to take a look at it for myself later, but I guess that would explain why you two always greeted me in the nude when I came to the apartment to see you. It would seem Ninata's transformation has had an even greater effect than I thought. I knew that she would likely change psychologically due to her new body, but I never imagined it would affect you too, Hinata. Despite how genetically similar you both are, whatever happened to Ninata has made you both instinctively attracted to one another. And it may have also made you both, dare I say...addicted to sex with one another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the girls turned red at the Hokage's clinical bluntness, but neither of them could argue against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had known that would happen, I would never have given you two the current arrangement you have now. I would have done everything in my power to keep you two as far apart as humanely possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarms started ringing in Hinata's head. Keep her and Ninata apart? She couldn't bear the thought! \"H-Hokage-sama, please don't\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata was also gearing up for a fight. \"Oba-chan, you can't! I love Hinata-chan and she loves me! You can't separate us!\"</span></div></div>",

But it would appear that it's too late for that. Separating you two for the time being would do no one any good, which is why you will both continue to live with one another. But from this point on, you will both be subject to medical examination, since I need to stay on top of any other changes you two may undergo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hinata twins both sighed in relief. \"Thank you, Hokage-sama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which leads to my next point, and what I came in here for in the first place. In light of the...recent events, a rearrangement of the current genin teams must be called for. Ninata, I've made my decision of what to do with you. You are to be fully registered as a Leaf ninja again, and you will be assigned to Team 8. Your instructor will be Kurenai from here on out, and your partners will be Shino and Hinata of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata immediately lit up. \"R-really! I can still be a ninja? With Hinata-chan? That's awesome! We're going to be on the same team, Hinata-chan!\" Unable to contain herself, she kissed her twin right on the lips. Hinata blushed at how open she was being about their relationship in front of the older woman, but she said nothing. Truth is she was pretty happy about the announcement as well. \"When do I start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as you're fully healed, just head over to the registry department to have your ID made,\" said Tsunade. \"But don't get excited. After your previous stunts, you two will be doing the most menial D-ranked missions I can find for a very long time. And on that note, Hinata, since you're here, illegally might I add, you might as well make yourself useful. I'd like for you to examine Ninata's chakra coils.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, Hokage-sama.\" Hinata activated her Byakugan to peer into the inner workings of Ninata's body. Her girlfriend looked perfectly healthy; she had lots of chakra pumping through her system, and her coils looked...completely fine. A bit wider than they were last time, but the signs of chakra burn were completely gone. Which she couldn't help but find a bit strange; it normally should have taken a week or so for them to recover. \"Ninata-chan's coils seemed to have fully healed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel great too!\" said Ninata. \"Like I could run a mile. And look, I'm not even on any pain killers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade looked doubtful. Putting a glowing hand on Ninata's shoulder, she observed the inner workings of Ninata's body herself. \"Huh. It looks like you two are telling the truth after all. Though maybe I shouldn't be so surprised whenever it comes to you, Ninata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't miss the conspiratorial tone in the Hokage's voice. But before she could open her mouth to ask what she meant, Tsunade spoke again. \"Very well. If you really are fully recovered, then I supposed I can let you out of here today. No need to waste your time and the hospital's resources. But Ninata, you are expressly forbidden from leaving the village borders until I say so. Failure to comply will result in house arrest and termination of your status as a ninja. Do you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata fidgeted nervously. \"I...yes, I understand, Hokage,\" she said, the steel tone in Tsunade's voice doing its work to put her back in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. As for you, Hinata, I'll let this incident slide, but don't let me catch you sneaking into the hospital outside visiting hours again. I need to speak to Ninata about a few more private matters, so get dressed and get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hokage-sama,\" said Hinata. She started to push her way out of the bed, only to blush when she remembered that she was still naked under the blanket. \"Um, do you think you could...give me a little privacy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Tsunade. \"First of all, young lady, I'm a medical-nin; you don't have anything I haven't seen before. Second, consider the next few humiliating moments of your life to be your punishment for your inappropriate behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata whimpered, but didn't argue. All things considered, this mess could have gone a whole lot worse. Ninata, however, had a different reaction. \"Ha! I bet you just want to see her naked. You're just as bad as the pervy-sage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata rubbed at the sore lump on her head. \"You didn't need to hit me so hard, Granny. And not in front of my girlfriend too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you should learn to respect your elders, betters and superiors. And don't call me Granny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata really wanted to argue, but decided it would be better to hold her tongue for the time being. Back when she was a boy, she could take a few licks, but Hinata's body wasn't quite as sturdy, and she knew well enough she wasn't fast and agile enough with it to avoid Tsunade's right hook just yet. Or even her finger poke of doom. And she knew well enough that it wouldn't be wise to push her luck with the older woman for at least the next month. She was in enough hot water already. \"So what did you want to talk to me about?\" she asked. She hoped it wasn't another lecture about her conduct. Hadn't they spoken enough about that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to tell you this yesterday, but decided after everything else, that it might not be wise to unload so much bad news on you all at once.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata groaned. That really was not what she wanted to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade continued. \"I believe that, since he was your former teammate, you deserve to hear what my, and the village's stance is, on Sasuke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Ninata felt her stomach clench. With the emotional roller-coaster she had been experiencing since yesterday to this very moment, she hadn't had too many chances to pay the Uchiha boy any mind. And truth be told, she didn't think she really wanted to. Not after what he almost did to her, and was willing to do to Hinata. \"What...what do you intend to do with Sasuke?\"</span></div></div>",

Your former teammate, Sakura, was the one who reported Sasuke's departure, and at the time, she told me that he had been kidnapped by the Sound. I've since questioned her about it again, and she has admitted to omitting the truth to certain details. It turns out Sasuke was not kidnapped; he left with the Sound willingly, and he in turn assaulted her to prevent her from stopping him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He what?\" Ninata cried. It looked like she wasn't the only person the Uchiha had attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that key detail in place, I now know that Sasuke's decision was of his own volition. And because of that, his rank and citizenship have been stripped and he has been declared a Missing-nin to be killed or captured on sight. Preferably the former.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata clenched the blanket in her hands, knowing that a deluge of emotions were about to come flooding out of her. She wondered what exactly she would feel? Would she be angry at Sasuke for his betrayal and his attempt on her life? Would she violently protest Tsunade's harsh sentence on her comrade? Or maybe she would feel sad and guilty that things had come to this. She waited for a feeling to emerge in the form of a teardrop or shout of fury. She waited and waited, until she felt... nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" she said stoically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hokage seemed taken aback. \"You...do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nodded, though truth be told, she was just as stunned as the older woman was by how blas\u00e9 she was acting. \"Sasuke is a traitor. He willfully abandoned the village and joined forces with our enemy. He tried to kill me while thinking I was Hinata. It's because of him that...Kiba is dead and the rest are all injured. And as long as he's alive now, he'll continue to be a threat to us. Is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata expected it to hurt to say such a thing, to speak so coldly about her \"friend.\" But no such feeling came. Whatever feeling of warmth she once felt for the Uchiha was replaced instead by...numbness. The same kind of unfeeling coldness she felt radiating from him as he stared directly into her now feminine face with absolutely no hint of emotion. He thought she was Hinata, a person who never did a single thing to earn his ire. And he tried to kill her without even a second thought anyway. Just because a complete <i>monster</i> like Sakon told him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, now Ninata felt something: a flicker of red specially reserved for <i>that</i> particular shinobi of the Sound. For what he did to Hinata's friend. And what he almost did to Ninata herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since her transformation into Ninata, the former boy was starting to get a new perspective on things. If she had been her old blond-haired male self, she might have forgiven Sasuke for the act. After all, they always got on each other's nerves and they hadn't been on good terms lately. If he had tried to kill her knowing she was Naruto, she was sure she would have paid him no ill will for it. But Sasuke was just as willing to kill someone he hardly even knew and who didn't deserve his wrath. And that made Ninata come to a realization; that she really didn't know Sasuke nearly as much as she thought she did. Did she ever truly know him, or was she simply projecting her own feelings of sorrow on another lonely individual? Was he himself ever capable of such empathy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata shook her head. She supposed she'd never know. All that mattered was that Sasuke was an enemy of the Leaf now. As long as he was the Leaf's enemy, he would be her enemy. And he would be dealt with the same way the Leaf handled all of its enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct,\" said Tsunade, clearly stunned to have seen the normally rambunctious teen act so...compliant, though Ninata could detect a few telltale signs of worry in the older woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata sighed. \"Look, Oba-chan, I know I'm not the sharpest kunai in the pouch, but I'm not that dumb. What Sasuke did...I don't think I could ever forgive him. And I also know that as long as he's alive and with Orochimaru, he'll be a danger to the village and everyone I care about, and that he doesn't deserve special treatment just because he was, or because I <b>thought</b> he was, my friend. So if you feel it's necessary to...mark him for death...I understand and I accept your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...glad to hear that, Ninata.\" And with that, Tsunade began her march to leave the room, deciding the conversation had run its course. \"I'll notify the staff to have you released, and I'll make sure they bring you a fresh pair of clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ninata had one last question on her mind. \"Wait, Oba-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade turned around, shooting the blunette a pensive look. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it...is it really necessary that I keep my identity a secret? To keep everyone from knowing that I'm really Naruto?\"</span></div></div>",

It is ultimately your call to make if you decide to reveal that you're really Naruto. Just as it's your call who you decide to tell about your prisoner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata perked up, enough that she could feel the blanket's thin fabric brush against her nipples as her breasts jiggled underneath. \"Really? So I don't need to keep up this charade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me finish,\" said Tsunade. \"Just because you <i>can</i> doesn't mean you <i>should</i>. Or have you forgotten about the Akatsuki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata pouted indignantly. \"I sure as hell haven't!\" She may not have had the best memory, but she would never forget the sheer power that both Kisame and Itachi displayed. It still gave her shivers at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you should know that you're being hunted, Ninata. Sooner or later, they will come for you. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday. And in your current state, you're more vulnerable than ever. But...there is one good thing about your transformation into Hinata...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's nostrils flared at that comment. \"What do you mean 'one good thing?'\" she all but shouted with offense. \"Are you saying that being Hinata is bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade raised an eyebrow in confusion. \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like being Hinata!\" the former boy huffed, putting her hands on her hips, which of course caused her blanket to fall, exposing her bare body from the waist up. But she neither noticed nor cared about her nakedness. Nor did she take note of the Hokage's perplexed expression or the drop of sweat beading its way down her face. \"Her body is wonderful, perfect in every way, the Byakugan is amazing when it doesn't give me a headache, and it's all because of this that I was able to finally see how gorgeous and beautiful and cute Hinata-chan really is! There's no other body I want to have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...didn't know you felt that strongly about it,\" said Tsunade. \"I figured you were hoping for a way to change back and would declare that you'd find a way, no matter what, you'd never give up, and...you know the drill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that predictable...am I?\" said Ninata. She sure hoped she wasn't. \"Anyway, you already said that it's impossible for me to change back. And even my henge won't allow it. So I might as well get used to it. And even if it was possible, I don't want to ever change back! I'm staying with Hinata's body forever and you can't stop me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...kaaaay,\" said Tsunade, \"if that's what you really want. I'm...glad to see you've adjusted so fast. Not many people would. But as I was saying...an <i>advantage</i> to your transformation into Hinata is that very few people know who you really are. And as long as nobody knows who you really are, they won't have any reason to come after you. If we keep your identity a secret, we can keep you safe from the Akatsuki and anyone else who's looking for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention I'd rather prevent a panic from breaking out. Your transformation is like nothing anyone's ever seen before. We don't know how it happened to you specifically, we don't know why you became Hinata of all people, we don't know what precisely caused your genes to mutate, and we don't know whether or not it could happen again. I have no explanation for this, I don't even know where to begin looking for one, and if I don't have an answer, then the people will make their own. And that's when we'll have problems. If word got out that you just randomly turned into Hinata one day, I doubt the people of Konoha would take it well. They'd assume that there might be some kind of virus that turns people into the girl and we'd have riots in the streets. I can't let that happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata put a hand to her chin. A whole village full of Hinatas? That was ridiculous! Where would the old woman get such a silly idea? She probably secretly indulged herself in those naughty books the old pervert wrote. It was definitely the kind of thing he'd probably write about. Still, Ninata couldn't get the picture out of her head. A whole village of Hinatas? Sounded like Heaven to her! And what did the old lady know? Maybe the whole village would be totally cool with being Hinatified, and everyone was in fact secretly wishing that they could be the adorable and sexy little Hyuga. And maybe if everyone was turned into Hinata, the world would be a much better place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was getting ahead of herself. This was neither the time nor place to think about a world built in Hinata's image. She had to consider the Hokage's words, and based on her own experiences, she had to admit that as out there as Tsunade's concerns were, they likely held a lot of merit. \"I...guess that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded with approval. \"Good. It's up to you when you want to reveal your secret, but I would advise keeping a lid on it for as long as possible, at least until you get your abilities up to snuff. Jiraiya will be setting off, and the official story we'll be releasing is that 'Naruto' is training with him. Meanwhile, Hyuga Ninata as we're calling you, a living anomaly of Hinata's yin-yang chakra splitting up and gaining sentience, is now the Leaf's newest Genin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nodded. \"Okay, Baa-chan. I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you do.\" Confident that the conversation was now truly done with for real, Tsunade turned around to exit the room and return to her duties. \"Oh, and by the way, Ninata, you're still naked. Cover yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Eeep!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He knew they had come. He could feel the power of his mark pulsing through their coils. It delighted him to sense the movements of his most devoted of servants, to feel the steady beats of their hearts and the air flowing into and out of their lungs as they breathed. It made him feel almost like a god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more than anything else, their arrival meant that Orochimaru's prize had finally come. Sasuke accepted his offer, welcomed his power, and would now be enslaved to his will. The Sharingan was nearly his. Nearly. The Sannin couldn't help but quietly seethe at that thought. He wanted desperately to take Sasuke's body as his own, to see the world with the blood-red eyes of the Uchiha, and inherit the power those miniscule orbs of flesh held. But the pain in his arms had been too agonizing, and Kabuto was correct; they couldn't afford to wait any longer for the boy to arrive. He needed a new body, and he needed it immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sadly, that meant taking what he had available. This latest body was left rather wanting. There was nothing special about its former owner, whose name the sage couldn't recall. He was not the scion of a prestigious lineage and his bloodline held no secrets. He was a nobody, a stop-gap for the Sage of Snakes to use until he was once again physically ready to claim a body of real power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to his inner sanctum opened to reveal Kabuto, Sakon, Ukon, and of course, Sasuke. \"They have come to see you,\" the bespectacled shinobi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show them in,\" said Orochimaru from where he sat cross-legged in the center of the chamber. He added a small wave, signaling his assistant to leave them in private. It was a mere formality, of course. Kabuto would hear every word that was uttered from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKabuto nodded and slid the door shut as Sasuke and Sakon marched inside. The Uchiha was dead-eyed and unemotional, Ukon looked like he was asleep on his brother's back as always, and Sakon looked absolutely livid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is just you three,\" said Orochimaru. It was not a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gave us faulty intel!\" snarled Sakon. \"You told us that our attack weakened Konoha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru snorted with disgust at the impudent whelp. \"Boy, if you wish to walk out of this room with all your organs intact, I would suggest you remember your place,\" he hissed, his voice lowered to a dangerous whisper that still reverberated through the walls of his sanctum. Ukon's face remained resolute in its rage, but the sage did not miss the pale-haired ninja's hesitant half-step backward. That secretly pleased him. Even with this inferior body, he was still able to inspire terror in his subjects. \"Your poor leadership abilities have cost me three of my best ninjas. You should be thankful I'm even letting you and your brother speak at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Ukon awoke and turned his head to address his master. \"That's not what my brother means. You told us the Leaf had only one Jinch\u016briki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did,\" said Orochimaru. \"The young blonde-haired idiot. You were provided all the information you needed about him. I'm not accountable if you let that fool get the better of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words struck a reaction from Sasuke. \"Blonde-haired... Jinch\u016briki?\" he asked, looking back and forth between the sage and the conjoined twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUkon carried on as though the Uchiha boy had not been there. \"No, we didn't see him, there was another. A Hyuga girl in about the same age range. She displayed all the signs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru quirked an eyebrow. He hadn't expected to hear that. \"A Hyuga girl you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" said Sakon. \"She fired up an aura of red chakra, regenerated her wounds, starting looking and acting like a monster...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn normal circumstances, Orochimaru would have dismissed the claim entirely. But something about the twins' words was intriguing him deeply. \"Kabuto!\" the Sannin called out, not caring to hear another word out of Sakon. The door slid open to reveal the young spy. \"Show our impudent twins everything you have on the younger female members of the Hyuga clan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Orochimaru,\" said the bespectacled ninja as he entered, pulling out the cards that contained all the hidden information he had gathered on the Leaf's active shinobi. Spreading them on the floor, he formed a sign with his hand, and in an instant, every card displayed an image of a female Hyuga.\" \"Do any of these women look familiar to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's her, right there!\" said Sakon, pointing to the card depicting one Hyuga Hinata. \"But there were two of them present, identical twin sisters. One of them is the Jinch\u016briki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKabuto rolled his eyes dismissively. \"Do you have any idea what you're saying? Hinata is the oldest child to the head of the Hyuga clan. She has only one sister, Hyuga Hanabi, who's around six years her junior. You are mistaken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I saw!\" said Sakon. \"Ask my brother! Ask him!\" he pointed at Sasuke. \"They were there and they saw it! AAGGHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru clasped a hand on the Cursed Seal marking the twins' shared body and began to pull the chakra from it. It glowed an unearthly black as a cloud of darkness surrounded it. It was a painful procedure, and it sent the conjoined youths down on their knees screaming, but Orochimaru couldn't be bothered to care. He needed to see for himself what Sakon and Ukon had seen, confirm it with his own eyes. And the Cursed Seal allowed him to do just that. It was a part of him, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw them, two versions of the Hyuga princess, naked as the day they were born. He saw one, through the eyes of Ukon, standing her ground, fighting with the deftness and grace that the clan was known for, completely unaffected by her nakedness. And he saw the other, barely capable of defending herself. She tried to trick her enemy, but it was for naught, for Sakon soon had her pinned to the ground. He saw Sakon bash her head in, dazing her immediately. And he watched as the arrogant shinobi began to pull down his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru snorted in disgust at his underling's actions. He was on a mission of vital importance, and he was wasting time and energy to satisfy his base carnal instincts? The Snake Sage was not known for his sympathy, and he certainly felt none when the crimson chakra erupted from the girl and viciously incinerated the hormone-addled fool right where the sun didn't shine. He deserved no less for displaying such idiocy in the heat of battle. But Sakon's stupidity revealed that he was indeed telling the truth. There could be no mistaking it; this Hinata look-alike did not fight, talk or carry herself like a Hyuga traditionally did. Her mannerisms matched the container of the Kyuubi to a western T, and the red aura she exuded was the very same one the boy had used in the third part of the Chuunin Exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sannin released his hold on the Cursed Seal, the dark aura of chakra emanating from it flickering out like a dying light bulb. \"Identical twin sisters, you say?\" he said as a serpentine grin spread across his face. \" Jinch\u016briki...interesting. Very, <i>very</i> interesting.\"</span></div></div>",

And it would seem that I've learned something new about our enemies as well. So for that...you and your brother may go. I will see about assembling a new team for you to lead in the future. But until then...rest while you have the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you three are done,\" said Sasuke in an impatient tone, \"I have some questions for you myself, Orochimaru. And I would like to discuss my terms. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru glared at the Uchiha. For once, he was finding himself completely uninterested in the boy and the latent power he held. \"We will do that in good time, boy. Tomorrow. For now, you should get some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the boy would not be deterred. \"I am not tired!\" he snorted petulantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru sighed. Why did he always attract the big-headed egotists who couldn't simply just do what they were told? Flicking his hand dismissively into a few one-handed signs, he watched as the raven-haired youth suddenly went limp and all but fell into the startled Sakon's hands. It was a simple genjutsu that invoked a brief moment of exhaustion in the target. It could be easily disrupted and it wasn't particularly good at long range, making it nigh useless in battle, but when you needed to shut someone up real quick, it was a handy little tool to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See him to his quarters. And keep him locked up if you have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" said Sakon, \"I'm not done with\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shut up instantly when Orochimaru looked him hard in the eye with a hateful glare. \"Do not try my patience, whelp. I've given you and your brother a second chance. You won't get a third.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...do what he says,\" grumbled Ukon, who looked like he was still reeling from the pain that Orochimaru's seal-tampering had caused. Sakon didn't look pleased, but he acquiesced to Orochimaru's orders, shuffling out of the sanctum with Sasuke's limp body in tow. Seeing them disappear down the corridor, the Snake Sage saw fit to leave as well, signaling for Kabuto to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something I should know?\" the bespectacled ninja asked in a neutral tone as he gathered up his cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking it is time I tell you about a certain pet project of mine,\" said the Sannin. \"Something I've been working on ever since we came upon that Kimimaro of the Kaguya clan. His body was strong, his bloodline ability was particularly potent, and most of all, he was the only remaining person who could ever use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember who he was,\" said Kabuto. \"I was his primary physician when he fell ill after all. And I also know he was a eunuch, a victim of the Water Country's barbaric practices to exterminate any and all Kekkei Genkai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that was very unfortunate,\" said Orochimaru. \"I so would have liked to have bred him and taken his body, but unfortunately, he was a dead end. There was absolutely no way I would have been able to preserve his unique bone abilities the 'traditional' way. So I began looking into alternative methods to keep his legacy alive, ways to create a perfect or partial clone of the boy, or perhaps even just transplant his genes into another person. And I found a way to do just that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You devised a new jutsu?\" said Kabuto, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came upon a flight of stairs and began to descend. \"It was no mere jutsu,\" said Orochimaru, \"but a small-scale ritual, you could say, that combines the fields of f\u016binjutsu with medical science and gene therapy. By taking a mixture of chakra and the right reagents together\u2013don't ask what they are, it would take too long to explain\u2013and injecting them into the body via a seal\u2013any kind of seal, it doesn't matter what\u2013I could create a process that could delve deep into the cells of the subject and alter their genetic structure into anything and anyone that I wished. It would have no visible or immediate effect, but it would be in there, lying in wait, whether they realized it or not. All it would need to activate was contact with a certain humor. A humor that would provide the very blueprint it would need to permanently alter the subject's genetic structure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA switch seemed to click in Kabuto's head. \"You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru grinned. \"Blood. As soon as the subject who had been marked touched so much as single drop of blood, the formula would begin its work. It would traverse through the cells of the body like a virus, then rearrange the genes until they were a perfect copy of the blood-touched. I took in many people\u2013beggars, orphans, prisoners\u2013applied the seal to them, and exposed them to foreign blood. Usually Kimimaro's. I hoped that by transforming them into the boy, that I could efficiently create an army of his clones, and possibly even make a future body that I could use for myself with his unique bloodline abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair reached the bottom of the stairs and proceeded down another dim corridor, stopping only at a sealed door that was marked as one of Orochimaru's private laboratories. The lock was marked with a seal that would only respond to the Sannin's chakra signature. Only Orochimaru could open this door, and only Orochimaru had ever been inside this specific lab. \"I'm going to guess it didn't go quite as planned,\" said Kabuto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru frowned. \"No. It didn't,\" he said cryptically as he placed his palm on the door. There was an audible click as an inner mechanism shifted, and the door slid open as if it had a will of its own, revealing a laboratory like any other. The walls were lined with shelves and refrigeration units, all filled with to the brim with vials, beakers and jars containing chemicals, bacterial cultures, viruses, fungi, organs, tissue samples, and other substances that would turn the stomachs of those who were weak in constitution. <i>And vision.</i> Steel ducts and wires extended from the ceiling and congregated around an elaborate machine in the back that stood as tall as two men and twice as wide. But that wasn't what interested Orochimaru or his assistant, who was seeing it all for the first time. Their attention was drawn to the table at the center, where stood a great canister holding a shapeless...thing that could be seen floating through the foggy glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser inspection revealed that it was a human being. A horribly mangled human being. His left arm was noticeably longer, thicker and burlier than his right, and it looked as if it could reach past his knee if he stood at full height. His naked torso looked equally mismatched; one side seemed to boast the impressive muscles of an accomplished athletic, while the other wouldn't have been out of place on a child. Anyone who looked closely at the ribs under his skin could pick up even more deformities. Some jutted prominently out so tightly, it was a wonder they hadn't burst through the flesh. Others looked as though they had snapped, and even more were completely invisible, as though they had sunk even deeper into his innards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people would have retched at the sight. But Orochimaru and Kabuto were content to stare coolly at the deformed corpse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see,\" said Orochimaru, \"it turns out that the process of changing from one form to another physically without the use of a proper Henge is not so easy. People are built differently. Different sizes, different shapes. And unfortunately, my formula wasn't perfect when it came to genetic infusion. The change was always...uneven. Some parts would change and others would not. Sometimes, a bone would shift in size and stab through a major artery or two. In others, one organ would grow in size and crush all the others. And in this fellow's case, I believe his lungs expanded faster than his ribcage. The end result was always the same: the subject would die partway through the transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it looked like the process was extremely painful as well,\" said Kabuto, noting the subject's face, which was permanently frozen into a scream of anguish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too,\" said the snake ninja. \"Had to use up a lot of good chakra just to silence their wails. None of them were able to bear pain the way Kimimaro could.\" He frowned. Thinking about the last scion of the Kaguya clan was always a bitter pill for the self-proclaimed Otokage. Even if he had been an evolutionary dead end, he was still a talented ninja, far more skilled and intelligent than his four idiot underlings. And loyal too. It was a shame Kimimaro came down with that terminal illness, but at least he was willing to let Orochimaru harvest his body for future use before it fully claimed him. Not one part of the young man would go to waste. Blood, marrow, bone, muscle tissue, the internal organs, all had value. Heck, Orochimaru could even make a stylish wig out of his hair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what of the transformation process?\" asked Kabuto, who was clearly more interested in hearing about Orochimaru's project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The issue was that the genes would start to change before all the body's cells were properly infected. If there was to be any hope for the subject to survive the change, then that step in the process needed to be delayed for as long as possible. I found that in order to yield better results, I had to change up the formula, alter the ratio of components. Most annoyingly, I needed to throw in a greater concentration of the most expensive and difficult-to-acquire reagents. That would stall the transformation, allow the concoction to infect more cells before it began to alter the genes. But it was never enough; no matter how potent the mixture was, and no matter how long I stalled the change, it was still too fast and uneven for a body to handle. Around the time of the Chuunin Exam, I just about had it and threw ever last bit of the rare reagents I had into my latest formula.</span></div></div>",

I wanted to see if it would work, but the concoction I had was simply too valuable to simply use on any mere test subject. It would need to be something special, something unique, to convince me it was worth expending. I put it out of mind and focused all my energies on the invasion of the Leaf. Progress could wait, war could not. But I kept it with me, even as I infiltrated their Genin forces and went to go see what the Uchiha boy was capable of in the Forest of Death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then, inspiration struck me. I encountered the Nine-Tailed brat, I saw firsthand how the beast within could influence him, and more than that, I had him in my grasp! Subduing him would have been easy enough, but I wondered; what effect would my formula have over a Jinch\u016briki? I didn't know if I'd have another chance, so with a simple Five Elements Seal, I injected it into him. I figured that after we conquered the Leaf, I would be able to capture and observe him afterward...assuming it didn't kill him by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that was another scheme that didn't go according to plan. And despite his relatively good mood, the Sannin couldn't help but scowl again. Thinking about his failures was always a surefire way to ignite his wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you're saying,\" said Kabuto, \"is you applied the seal and the formula to Uzumaki Naruto, and you believe that it's caused him to take on Hinata's form?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no doubt,\" said Orochimaru. \"I saw what Sakon and Ukon saw. The Nine-Tails brat is the very first to survive and successfully undergo my process!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKabuto still looked doubtful. \"But he lasted the entire month leading up to the third part of the exam without undergoing any changes. And we saw him weeks later when we tried to make contact with Tsunade, and he still looked the same. And I thought you wanted him dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru nodded. \"Indeed. At the time, I thought that perhaps the fox within made him immune to its effects, and had written the whole thing off as a failure. He was useless to me as an experiment, and he was, and still is, a very problematic element in my plans. Or will be in the long run. But it would seem that either he hadn't made contact with anyone's blood in that time, which I find highly unlikely...or that the effect was stalled for an abnormally long amount of time. Long enough for every cell in his body to be affected before the transformation began. And it was either due to the unique mixture that was injected into him, the influence of the demon, or both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever the case may be, he has successfully undergone the transformation. Every part of the brat likely changed evenly and at the exact same time. No bone or organ grew out of place, no tissue or blood vessel stretched beyond its bounds. Judging by the change to his genitals, it would seem he even switched sexes flawlessly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...not going to ask how you figured out that last part,\" said Kabuto as he kneaded his forehead. Orochimaru could only shrug at that. He didn't know what she and her now twin were doing running around naked in the woods either, but that's what he saw and he would take what he gleaned from it for all that it was worth. The Nine-Tails brat now sported a very womanly labia and a mature pair of mammary glands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do you have any idea when Uzumaki came into contact with the Hyuga girl's blood?\" said Kabuto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said Orochimaru. \"All that I care about is that my project was a success and that I can now proceed with it. Some things are just not worth knowing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now that you've told me all this,\" said Kabuto, \"what is the next step? Do you intend for us to take the Jinch\u016briki now?\"</span></div></div>",

Nothing would delight me more than to hack the brat open and see what makes her new body tick, but going in so soon is risky. She's under the protection of Jiraiya and Tsunade, and after losing Sasuke, the Leaf will likely be on high alert for quite some time. It would be best if we...waited for a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKabuto nodded. \"Very well. Still, I'll see if there's not some way we can monitor her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two exited the lab and began their trek back to the upper parts of the Sound Village. All the while, the smirk never left Orochimaru's face. This day had taken a surprisingly insightful turn. He had the Uchiha right where he wanted him. He had an experiment that was starting to yield fruit. And with it, he had possibly yet another way to strengthen his military force. And maybe, just maybe...he would have a strong, young Uchiha body and a pair of Sharingan eyes much sooner than he expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This time...all will go according to plan.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Naruto glared hatefully at Neji. That look of absolutely murderous fury had melted away into the most obnoxiously smug shit-eating grin the blonde had ever seen. He may not have killed the girl as he so wished, but he still hurt her plenty, and he damn well knew that he wouldn't be suffering any repercussions for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't know what the story was between these two Hyugas. He didn't know what Hinata had done to deserve Neji's wrath. Hell, he couldn't imagine how anything could justify the severe beating and emotional thrashing the older genin subjected the quiet girl to. But Neji's arrogant attitude and his inability to shut his damn mouth about fate and destiny pissed the blonde off to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't know Hinata all that well, but her desire to improve herself and rise above everyone's low expectations of her was something he understood very intimately. And he wasn't going to stand still and let her get pushed around by some fatalistic jackass who was too cowardly to face his problems head-on. Hinata couldn't get up and prove him wrong, but Naruto most certainly could. And come the next part of the exam, he would. He didn't care if the arrogant Hyuga asshole was a genius, or if he was the top of his class; Naruto was going to ensure that Neji's only destiny would be to have a smile that was all gums. This he silently swore for Hinata's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a handful of the girl's blood that now stained the arena grounds, which was still warm to the touch, he raised a fist in the older ninja's direction. \"You're going down.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that was odd,\" said Ninata to herself. She had just been ambling down the street when all of a sudden, her mind went back to that specific moment in the Chuunin exam. It was so weird to think back on, knowing especially how far they had both come since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was happy. She had a shiny new ninja ID and would soon be going back to work. Granted, she wished she at least had a chance to properly comb her hair for it; she still had a slight \"bed head\" going on when the photo was taken. And she kind of wished that maybe she could have done her face up to look prettier. And thinking even more, she couldn't help but grumble, knowing that she was going to be stuck doing lowly D-rank missions for a while. But it was a small price to pay. She got to train, work and live with the cutest, sweetest, nicest and sexiest girl in the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Speaking of which...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was at the door of her new apartment when it suddenly slid open to reveal Hinata. Her large lavender eyes widened when she saw her twin staring back at her. \"Ninata-chan, you're home already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am!\" said Ninata with a grin. \"Why, did I interrupt something? Are you going somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...was,\" said Hinata. She was poking her index fingers into one another as she often did, though Ninata did not miss the impish smile that was spreading across her face. \"But...I think it can wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ninata could say another word, her double all but yanked her inside. Soft pink lips smothered her own, warm air cascaded onto her legs as the trousers Tsunade lent fell into a pile at her feet, and Hinata's greedy hands started pulling at the hem of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slammed shut. Ninata was home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days went by without incident. The girls spent much of the time between their lovemaking sessions doing what they could to make their new home more livable. They arranged the furniture, decorated the walls with whatever sparse paintings and photos they had, and cleaned up a few stray cobwebs. They also set about the task of disposing of all the things that could be traced back to Naruto, including all the tacky orange jackets and pants that had originally dominated his wardrobe. That had been a bittersweet affair for the girl that he had turned into, but she understood why it was necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't all Hinata believed she needed to do; there was still the issue of Tenten. She couldn't explain it, but she felt some level of responsibility for the older girl, particularly since she had saved her life. And while the black-haired kunoichi was in safe hands now, the blunette thought it was only right to maybe go see her in the hospital. Perhaps even with some flowers in hand. That seemed like a good idea, and she knew just the right place to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hinata stepped into the Yamanaka-owned flower shop, she was a bit surprised to see Ino manning the register. The blonde looked tired, and she was wearing more makeup than usual to hide the bags around her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, welcome to Yamanaka Flowers!\" she announced in voice full of artificial pep while wearing an equally artificial smile. It was clear she was trying to look happier than she really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ino-san,\" said Hinata as she picked up a violet hydrangea, which seemed like the perfect 'get well soon' flower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this for Ninata?\" asked the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is for Tenten-san. Though I should get something for Ninata-chan.\" She eyed a pack of orange lily seeds. She never imagined that Ninata was much for flowers, but if she did, she'd probably like those. They'd make a suitable replacement for her clothes. In more ways than one. \"I'll take some of these too. Our home could use some more color, and Ninata said she'd like to start growing some plants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that's really nice. Wish I had someone like you,\" said Ino. Before Hinata could ask what exactly she meant by that, the blonde's fake smile evaporated. \"I've been seeing Chouji whenever I can myself. Leaving him flowers too, hoping that he'll wake up soon. But there's been nothing. And I just can't talk to that lazy idiot, Shikamaru. He's avoiding me, won't talk to anyone. Don't think he's gone to see his friend either, the jackass. Sometimes, he just makes me so...but I really shouldn't unload my problems onto you. I know you lost someone too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded. \"It's okay. And I'm sorry about Chouji-san as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno nodded sadly in silent thanks as she rung up the Hyuga's items. With that business taken care of, Hinata took her things in hand and began to leave. However, she couldn't help but let her heart go out to Ino. Hinata knew the feeling of loss, but she could weather it. She had her Ninata. But poor Ino was all alone. The Hyuga couldn't fathom why the blonde was working on what was likely her day off, but if she could hazard a guess, it was to try and keep her mind off of things. She couldn't help but shake her head at that thought. Problems needed to be dealt with, not avoided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino-san,\" she said, turning around, \"if you ever need someone to talk to...you can always come to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Tenten-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" the bun-haired girl looked up from her hospital bed, startled from the intrusion. \"Hinata? What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shrugged. \"I just thought I should come and see how you were doing. I brought you something.\" She withdrew the flower she had just purchased from Ino and gave it to the older girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten was clearly stumped as her fingers wrapped around the hydrangea's stem. \"Um...are you asking me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, no!\" Hinata half-gasped and half-chuckled, feeling a warm blush on her cheeks. \"No, I'm just wishing for you to get well soon. That's all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see,\" said Tenten. Hinata thought she detected a hint of disappointment in the brunette's voice, but simply brushed it aside. \"Heh, sorry, I always just kind of assume that flowers were used as some kind of courting ritual. But thanks, I appreciate it. And I didn't get to tell you the last time I saw you, but thanks for saving me. I don't know how I could ever repay you.\" She took a deep sniff into the hydrangea's petals. \"To be honest, though, I'm feeling kind of nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nervous? About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going under the knife soon. They're going to fix up my leg. Hokage-sama and the doctors all assured me that I'd be fine, but there's always a chance that things could go wrong. And, well, there's not really much I can do but wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata frowned. She could understand that. Surgery was always scary. \"I'm sorry, Tenten-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten shook her head. \"Don't be. I'm just over-thinking it. Lee had it much worse than I did, and he got through his surgery just fine. He's walking again, and he sees me every now and then. If he got through his problems, then my chances have to be pretty good as well...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Tenten-san,\" said Hinata as she placed a hand reassuringly on the brunette's shoulder. \"I'm sure everything will be all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten locked eyes with her and gave Hinata a very meaningful look that she couldn't help but swear was beyond platonic. \"Thanks, Hinata, that means a lot. Maybe once I'm out of here, we can...I dunno, train together? Hang out? Do something...fun, you, me and Ninata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled at her. \"I'd like that.\" <i>And maybe we could bring Ino-san as well.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hinata-chan, can you help me with my bra agai...ohhhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a morning like any other for the young Hinata twins, and they had been going through their usual routine so far. They'd wake up, reluctantly pull away from each other, share a shower, moisturize their skin, comb each other's hair, and brush their teeth. When they were done washing up, they'd exit the bathroom and, without bothering to put any clothing on, go about their early chores. One girl would prepare breakfast, while the other would clean up the aftereffects of their nightly \"activities.\" The futon would be folded up, the sheets would be put into the wash, and all the clothes that were inevitably scattered around the apartment would be gathered up. Then they'd sit down at the table together and eat. When they were ready for the day, they'd get dressed and go out to face the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded simple, but for two girls who were young, in love, and always craving sex, it could be quite the complicated affair. Hinata and Ninata just couldn't get enough of each other. One would sneak a peak at the other and admire her beautiful naked body. And the other would catch on and give her leering partner a little tease. She'd shake her butt, massage her breasts, or maybe even lick her finger and slide it sensuously into the slit between her legs. Then they'd get all hot and bothered, run right into one another, start kissing and caressing, and before the girls knew it, they were having sex again. When they were done, they'd pull away, go back to the bathroom, wash up, and return to their respective chores. Then one would sneak a peak at the other, and the cycle would repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they were lucky, they'd be fully dressed by noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, they couldn't really take their sweet time today. Because this morning was different from the previous ones over the past week. This morning, they were expected to meet with their sensei, Y\u016bhi Kurenai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi-Hinata-chan,\" Ninata gulped as she felt the telltale signs of female arousal prod into her back, Hinata's nipples hardening as they made contact with her skin. It was clear she hadn't put anything on yet. \"We-we can't do that! We-we have to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't listen. She merely kneeled onto the tatami floor and pulled Ninata's trousers and panties down with her, giggling coquettishly the whole way as her nipples scraped along the curves of her girlfriend's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata-chan, I-I...aaahhhhh!\" Ninata's weak protests promptly dissolved into quiet moans as the great fleshy mounds of Hinata's breasts pressed against the sensitive skin of her sumptuous derriere. The feeling of her twin's hard pink nubs poking into her taut girl flesh was tantalizing, and it made Ninata's own nipples start to harden. But the born-Hyuga wasn't done yet. Swaying snakily to the side, Hinata slid her left breast horizontally across the curve of Ninata's buttocks until it fell squarely into her cleft. That made Ninata jump a bit in surprise. \"Hinata?\" she asked, wondering what the girl was up to. Her mind told her this couldn't go on, but her body demanded she let it continue. The feeling of Hinata's hard little nipple squished between her buttocks was...amazing and it made her quiver all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, Ninata-chan,\" cooed Hinata as she planted multiple kisses on her double's right cheek. She sunk lower to the floor, sliding her breast further down the cleft of Ninata's butt. Ninata didn't know whether to moan or laugh; the way Hinata's nipple teased her soft and sensitive flesh down there was equal parts arousing and ticklish. But before the former boy could utter another sound, she felt the nub brush gently along the groove of her vulva. It was starting to get wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh to hell with it,\" she muttered. Kurenai could wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words hadn't been directed at Ninata for a <i>long</i> time. Ever since she came under Kakashi's tutelage, she had never been late for a meeting. Not necessarily because she was the punctual type, but because the lazy bastard couldn't ever be bothered to show up on time. Unfortunately for her, it did not look like Kurenai shared that particular foible. And judging by the stony glare she was giving both she and Hinata, which wouldn't have been out of place on the face of an empress, it didn't look like the older kunoichi appreciated those who did either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A sensei who's always on time. That's definitely going to take some getting used to.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for our tardiness, Kurenai-sensei,\" said Hinata with a polite bow. Looking at how dignified she was acting, one would never guess that she had spent an entire night and a good chunk of the morning having wild lesbian sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let it go just this once since it's the first day of training for you both in a while,\" said Kurenai. \"But don't make a habit of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Kurenai-sensei,\" Hinata and Ninata both said in perfect unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA drop of sweat slid down the older woman's face. \"Yeah, this is going to take some getting used to,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata looked around curiously. \"Hey, where's the creepy bug guy, Shino? Isn't he also part of this team?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is,\" said Kurenai, \"but he's currently on a mission with his father, so it's just going to be us three today.\"</span></div></div>",

First, we'll need to go someplace more secluded. Come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman turned around and set off towards the forest. Ninata gave Hinata a questioning glance as if to ask her \"Does she do this all the time?\" Hinata responded with a face that might as well have been her reflection. She didn't know what was going on either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly, the two followed their sensei out of the training field, into the forest surrounding Konoha, and away from the village limits. Ninata chewed at her lip nervously. The last time she had gone into the woods, she and Hinata got mixed up in that business with the Sound, the twins and Sasuke, and the bitter memories were still fresh in her mind. But the silence Kurenai was treating them to wasn't helping either. The boy-turned-girl didn't know a thing about the older woman. Was she a strict teacher? Was she mad that they were late? Was she taking them out into the woods so that she could indulge herself in her one and only passion in life: hunting the most dangerous game?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't stuff me and mount my head on the wall!\" she cried out in a panic. \"Taxidermy would ruin my cuteness! I'd make a terrible trophy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo pairs of very confused eyes turned towards her. \"Excuse me?\" Kurenai said with a quirked eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's cheeks grew very warm. \"Er...did I just say that out loud?\" she asked, wringing her hands nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninata-chan, are you feeling okay?\" said Hinata as she pressed a hand to her girlfriend's forehead. \"You feel a little feverish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" said Ninata. \"I'm just...just...\" She trailed off. What <i>did</i> cause that outburst anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess this is far enough then,\" said Kurenai, though the amused smirk on her face couldn't be missed. \"The sooner we get this training exercise done, the sooner we can get Ninata back to civilization before she completely loses her mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata brought a hand to her lips as she giggled at the older woman's quip. Ninata could only sulk. This was just great. She only knew her new sensei for about 30 minutes now, and already she made a complete fool of herself. And worse, Kurenai was apparently a smartass. Why couldn't she be like most of the women in Ninata's life? Why couldn't Kurenai just deck her whenever she said something stupid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down, both of you,\" said Kurenai, her voice getting all businesslike again. \"I have something to show you.\" She turned around as the twins complied, forming the seal of the ram with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going...on?\" Ninata asked, but her question was answered in very swift order. She watched as a patch of the bandage-like cloth on Kurenai's tunic glowed a faint orange before it transformed into a butterfly made entirely of light and fluttered away. And then it was followed by another. And another. Soon, dozens of flame-hued butterflies were fanning out from Kurenai's form, and with each one that appeared, so did a speck of the older woman's pale skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata and Ninata stared transfixed as more and more of their teacher's clothing disintegrated. Her arms were completely bare, the wild tresses of her black hair spilled freely over her naked shoulders, the visible muscles on her back could be traced with an observant eye, and if they looked carefully enough, they could even make out the very tip of the woman's butt cleavage as it peered out from the remains of her breeches...and soon enough, even those was gone. Kurenai's ass was on full display before the girls, taunt, firm, and bubbly in shape. She swayed her hips to the right and to left, as if she was trying to shake more cloth off her body, and in doing so, she caused the butterflies around her to flutter so lovingly close to her derriere, making her cheeks glow a faint orange in the dim lighting of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a hand on her bare hip, the now completely nude instructor turned around to face her students, who could only stare at her completely dumbfounded and awestruck. When dressed, the older woman looked stern, authoritative and maybe even a bit uptight. But without any clothing on, it was a different story entirely. Her breasts, which were usually completely obscured under her clothes, were shown to be medium-sized but perky, and the areolas of her nipples were a dark red, almost russet, much like the outer layer of her eyes. They stood in stark contrast to her skin, which was nearly as fair as the Hyuga girls before her, but unlike them, she bore a few scars that spoke of extensive combat experience. Marks where blades had sliced her skin, like the two parallel lines that stretched from her abdomen to her thigh, or the vague lightning-bolt shape raked into her sternum, just beneath her breasts. But the scars in no way marred Kurenai's beauty. In an odd way, they enhanced it. Combined with the woman's long and unkempt hair, the scars made her look wild and untamed. She did not for a second look out of place standing completely naked in the natural splendor of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata had to clamp her mouth shut to keep herself from drooling. <i>Wow...Kurenai-sensei is hot!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata, meanwhile, was red as a tomato. \"K-Kurenai-sensei...wh-what are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Hokage informed me about what you two did in the forest,\" said Kurenai without batting an eye. \"She told me how you both fought toe-to-toe against the Sound forces without a stitch of clothing on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata and Ninata blushed deeply at this. It was starting to dawn on them that that incident was likely going to haunt them for the rest of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She also told me about your...curious condition,\" she continued. \"How you both need to copulate regularly just to function properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata squeaked in embarrassment and buried her face in her hands. Ninata, meanwhile, just tilted her head in confusion. \"Copu-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai's painted lips curled upward in a smirk. \"Have sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, WHAT?!\" Ninata sputtered, feeling her face warm up in both anger and embarrassment. \"Sh-she told you about that? What happened to patient confidentiality?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a genin instructor,\" said Kurenai, \"I need to be aware of my students' medical needs. When we're out in the field, my life is in your hands just as often as your are in mine, and it won't do if two of my girls aren't in top fighting form because they haven't been getting the physical stimulation they require. I am within my rights to know, and that is why the Hokage informed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata could only look at the ground and grumble at that. It wasn't right for the old lady to leak such a private detail out like that. But she supposed she couldn't exactly argue against Kurenai's logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to judge you two,\" said Kurenai. \"What you two do in your private lives is of no concern of mine. If you two must have sex in the field, so be it. But I need to make sure that you'll always be ready to fight at a moment's notice, even when you're not properly equipped for it. The day will come when enemies ambush you two while you're both doing your thing. You won't have time to get dressed when that happens, and you'll have no choice but to fight in the nude, which is always a dangerous situation. Which is why I am standing before you in my natural state. Because today, that is what you are both going to learn: the basics of natural state combat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's actually a form for fighting naked?\" said Ninata. \"How come I've never heard of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai shrugged, which caused her breasts to jiggle a bit, a fact that did not escape the twins' attention. Ninata had to bite her tongue to keep it from coming out and licking her lips in hunger. \"It's just not a very common style. People in general prefer to avoid fighting in the nude in the first place, so they never bother to learn it or even learn <i>of</i> it. Few people ever want to go through the process of learning it, since it requires both the instructor and the student to train nude. And you can thank the moral guardians and uptight teachers in the academy for not going over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata couldn't argue with that. Just knowing that there was a style of naked taijutsu would be enough to give poor Iruka an aneurysm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But while it may be obscure, there is a reason some people picked up on it,\" Kurenai continued. \"Bathhouses are just as vulnerable to attacks as anything else for instance, and many jutsus can destroy clothing and armor just like that, rendering a ninja naked in the battlefield. If you're interested in the history of the technique, I have several books to recommend, but we've talked enough. Hinata, Ninata, I need you both to take your clothes off. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls' reactions were expected. Both of them turned a deep shade of red again. \"Um, Kurenai-sensei,\" Hinata asked, looking away from her instructor shamefully. \"Is it...necessary to do this now? With you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose if you don't want to do practice with me, I could arrange for Guy to do it instead. He's a far more experienced taijutsu instructor than I am, he's had a lot of free time since Lee was hospitalized, and I'm certain he's very familiar with the style of naked fighting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE'LL GO WITH YOU! WE'LL GO WITH YOU!\" both Hinata and Ninata screamed in unison. If there was one thing Ninata did not want to ever see, it was what that particularly unfashionable man looked like under that damn green jumpsuit of his. Hell, she didn't even want to think that it was possible for a man like that to get physically naked at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Kurenai. \"It's better to work with someone your of your own sex anyway. Now get naked!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stripping in front of their instructor was not the easiest thing the twins had ever done, but both of them had to admit it could have been a whole lot worse. While they were once again putting their naked bodies on display and burning red the whole time, at least they were doing so in front of a woman who had the courtesy to be naked as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, not all naked bodies reacted to the loss of clothing equally. Kurenai may have been bare, but she was still cool and collected, as any professional should be. Ninata was not a professional. She was a teenage girl with raging hormones, a heightened libido, and a deep appreciation for the fairer sex. And being naked meant that everyone could see the arousal she was feeling. From the hard pink nubs of her nipples standing at attention, to the dull sheen of dampness glowing between her legs. If her bare lips parted just a little, something would surely drip out. And since she had no pubic hair, there was absolutely nothing down there to disguise her lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why did I have to inherit Hinata-chan's natural hairlessness?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you both <i>in</i>decent?\" said Kurenai as she looked her two now completely nude students over. \"Good. We can begin. We're going to spar, you two against me, the way we were born. For the sake of this exercise, I'm going to stick with hand-to-hand combat, but you're both free to use whatever you know and are most comfortable with. The only thing that I ask is that you both pay special attention to my movements. And while I understand this is an unusual situation for you both, try not to get too flustered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't good. She was already on to Ninata. The boy-turned-girl activated her Byakugan and hesitantly took up a combat stance. Her girlfriend did the same, assuming the Hyuga's trademark position, which, now that Ninata was paying attention, did much to accentuate Hinata's beautiful figure. The pose forced her to stretch out her limbs and tighten her muscles, enhancing her feminine curves. She looked leaner. More fit. And the fierce expression that the Byakugan seem to naturally put on her face only emphasized her nakedness more. In her current stance, Hinata's nudity didn't make her look vulnerable; it made her look more like the statue of a legendary heroine brought to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata shivered as a tingling sensation rippled throughout her core. So focused on Hinata's loveliness was she, that she didn't notice the creamy wall that was Kurenai's naked flesh advancing on her until it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata didn't have enough time to react to Kurenai's attack. The older kunoichi very nearly crashed into Hinata's twin, stopping just short enough to tease the former boy with a very close view of her breasts before delivering a punch to the gut that sent her flying into some nearby undergrowth. Knowing there was nothing she could do for her girlfriend, Hinata pivoted on her foot to face her mentor and await her next action, knowing full well that the older woman was going to turn on her next. She proved correct when Kurenai did just that, veering her way straight into Hinata's direction immediately after deposing of Ninata, stringing her movements together so fluidly it was almost as if Ninata had never been there in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai didn't move far before she reared back on one foot and delivered a full-bodied kick at her student. The Hyuga was able to deflect the attack easily enough, as it was hardly the first such blow her sensei had ever thrown her way. But now, in all Kurenai's nakedness, Hinata realized that in her current position, she was being treated to the sight of her instructor's womanly snatch. Her bush was groomed and cut into a tidy triangular pattern just above her vulva, which was now wide open thanks to her kick. Hinata could see right into her teacher's womanhood, at the folds of flowery pink flesh within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could go right in there</i>, she mused. <i>I could feel Kurenai-sensei with my own hands. I could smell her. Lick her. Taste her...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo lost in her dirty thought, the born-Hyuga failed to react when the older woman pivoted on her grounded foot and folded her extended leg in such a way that she was able to hook Hinata's body into it and throw her to the ground. Stunned, the blunette could only look up at the sky and rail herself for her own stupidity. <i>How could I let myself get distracted by...ohhhhh!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai's face appeared above her as she looked down into her student's eyes, wearing a stony expression and nothing else. She straddled Hinata's form, pinning the little Hyuga to the ground by pressing, nay, <i>grinding</i> her crotch into the blunette's torso and seizing her wrists. Hinata kicked and struggled in a feeble attempt to escape, but Kurenai held fast. Seeing that she had her student in her grasp, the older woman threw her body down, slamming her chest into Hinata and burying her face inside her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where did...mmmpphhh...Kurenai-sensei...huuuuhhhhhh...learn to...fight like this? Aahhhhhh!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pure sensory overload for Hinata. Kurenai was not being gentle in the least; she was putting a lot of force into her full-bodied slams, and they hurt. But at the same time, Hinata could only muse at how nice and warm her breasts felt rubbing against her cheeks like this. And how she wouldn't mind nuzzling them in more agreeable circumstances...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You leave Hinata-chan alone!\" the identical-sounding voice of her double roared. YAAGGGGHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sucked. Kurenai was a clever one, using both she and Hinata's naked bodies to distract and sucker-punch her like that. Well, Hyuga Ninata may have been enthralled by the luscious sight of both her girlfriend's nude form as well as that of the older woman's, but she was no fool! She would not fall for the same trick twice! This time, she would prevail!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her head no longer spinning, the naked blunette was finally able to find her feet and crawl out of the vegetation she was tangled up in. And she was greeted to the sight of Kurenai, straddling her naked body over Hinata's, and rubbing her bare breasts all over her girlfriend's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, Kurenai-sensei's going down on Hinata-chan. Hot</i>, Ninata thought, while licking her lips. <i>Er, uh, I mean...Kurenai-sensei's going down!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You leave Hinata-chan alone!\" she cried, rushing in Kurenai's direction with a raised fist. \"YAAGGGGHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to slow down, even though it was evident that Kurenai was acting in a flash. With her left hand and foot flat on the ground, the older kunoichi spun off and away from Hinata's form, and stretched her other limbs outward as they rose skyward. Keeping her momentum up, the russet-eyed woman then used her grounded limbs to propel herself further upward, sending her body up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in her fury, Ninata couldn't help but find it a dazzling sight. There was Kurenai, twirling diagonally through the air, the dark wavy locks of her hair billowing behind her heroically like a cape, and her legs spread apart. The former boy stumbled, wincing in slight pain at the erratic jiggling of her breasts and she forced herself to come to a sudden stop. She knew Kurenai was about to deliver a flying kick to her stomach, and it was all she could do in this still unfamiliar body of hers to avoid or brace herself for the oncoming blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept she wasn't kicked. Kurenai didn't make any forceful motions with her legs. Rather, she splayed them even further apart as she spun closer toward Ninata, reaching a spread-eagle formation that showed the young lesbian a very close-up view of her muff. Her wide-open labia, the slick pink walls of her inner flesh, and the small dark void that led to depths of her most innermost treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to freeze. Ninata lost whatever will she had to fight. All she could do was stare at the womanhood that her instructor was so kindly showing her in full detail and just...take it all in. Ninata thought she knew everything about the vagina during her time as a girl and the many intimate moments she shared with her twin, but seeing the flower of another woman told her that there was still much about the female body for her to learn. Much, much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared deeply into that wondrous pink abyss. It was... amazing. Beautiful. She could stare at it for hours, breath in its musty scent, and let herself be engulfed within those lovely pink walls that promised to hold her, safe and sound, forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh crap!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Ninata realized something. She <i>was</i> letting herself be engulfed in those lovely pink walls! Her face was buried inside Kurenai's crotch, and the woman's thighs were wrapped tightly around her neck with the force of a vice. The older kunoichi was using her legs to put her student in a headlock. Ninata would have howled in frustration if she could, but her lips were all but smothered within the musty folds of Kurenai's nethers, so whatever cry she had was severely muffled. Damn it, she got distracted by the sight of a woman's nudity <i>again</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stupid, stupid Ninata!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former boy had to admit though, experiencing the smell and taste of her new instructor was well worth the pain of her whole naked body slamming into the ground. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata's wrists hurt from where Kurenai's hands dug into them when she pinned her down, but she didn't have enough time to nurse them before the crash sounded off. Her moment of reprieve was over, and if she didn't act soon, then Kurenai would either turn her attention back at her, or deliver even more pain to Ninata. And focusing her sight on her girlfriend, she could see Ninata definitely looked like she was hurting. The older woman threw her to the ground so hard, the born-Hyuga swore the earth shook. It honestly scared her a little; she never thought her instructor was capable of such deadly physical force. Kurenai specialized in illusions and mind tricks, leaving her foes too weak and distracted to react when Kurenai finished them off with a kunai sliced or thrown decisively with surgical precision. This nude taijutsu style was <i>strong.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, Hinata couldn't help but be a little puzzled by Ninata's expression. <i>She's had the wind knocked out of her, but she looks so happy. I hope Kurenai-sensei wasn't too hard on her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought the girl's attention back to her instructor. Kurenai was standing tall over the boy-turned-girl, strong and naked, the muscles in her back rippling while her firm buttocks clenched tautly from their previous exertion. Her head appeared to be tilted down as she observed her latest victory. That meant she was distracted, and Hinata had a window of opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping to her feet, the blunette charged at her sensei with an open-palmed hand reared back and ready. A light J\u016bken strike to the adult's thigh would hurt enough to make Kurenai buckle down to her knee. If Hinata was lucky, she could follow up with another blow, possibly at the older woman's lungs so she could knock some of her breath out, but knowing her sensei, she'd have to act fast before the older woman either beat back a hasty retreat using her natural mobility, or countered with a few smart blows herself. The young Hyuga had to be ready for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was decidedly <i>not</i> ready for what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she zoomed closer towards the adult kunoichi, Hinata noticed the distinct glowing sensation of chakra gathering in the coils within Kurenai's shapely rear. She didn't have the time to wonder what that was all about before her instructor made a slight turn to the side, and swayed her hip right into Hinata's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the\u2013</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tantalizing smack, Hinata's feet left the ground and the world around her spun into a blur as she rolled through the air, and landed smack dab into a puddle of mud. Water and muck splattered everywhere, staining the girl's porcelain complexion and ruining her usually perfect hair, but she couldn't care about that. Only two things mattered to the stunned blunette. One was the fact that Kurenai promptly pummeled her with her pretty posterior. And the other was that it actually really <i>hurt</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have any time to ponder the ramifications of getting literally butt-kicked. Kurenai's form clouded her vision. Hinata just barely rolled out of the way before the older woman hit the wet ground she had lying on heel-first. If Hinata hadn't acted, then her head would have ended up in the same moist place Ninata's had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent and taste of Kurenai's essence did not leave Ninata, though at least the numbing pain in her back and butt was fading away. The former boy pushed herself up with a groan, wincing a bit as some joints that had been rearranged just minutes ago popped back into place. <i>Damn, girls fight dirty when they're naked. And speaking of which...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata leaped to her feet as she heard the melodic voice of her beloved crying out. Hinata and Kurenai were currently engaged, the older woman assaulting the younger one with swift, but calculated blows with her hands, legs and...did she just bop Hinata in the face with her butt? Hinata was only just barely keeping up, using her J\u016bken to deflect her sensei's attacks, but she was having a lot of trouble landing any hits of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a quite a sight really, two ivory-skinned kunoichi dueling each other in nothing but what their mothers gave them. Kurenai made excellent use of her long legs, stretching them to their absolute limit as she launched one sweeping kick after another upon her student, likely showing off a lot of pink flesh to her in the process. Every time Hinata was brave enough to launch a gentle fist at her, the genjutsu specialist was quick to avoid it, pivoting on a foot, pirouetting around the blunette in a display that showed off her entire body, butt, breasts, navel, hips, sideboob, back and all, and throwing a quick jab of her own. Every time she pulled this motion, Hinata would follow her, twirling around to be ready to face her instructor's next attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes, she wouldn't have enough time for that. Sometimes, Kurenai would be too fast to the punch. Whenever that happened, Hinata had to take more desperate measures. At one point, the older woman aimed a bare foot at Hinata's head, and the younger girl had to bend her whole torso back at a nearly ninety-degree angle to evade the strike. She succeeded, but the giant bouncing mounds of girl flesh on her chest that couldn't be tamed and were forced to be in constant motion quite handily smacked her in the face, squishing sumptuously against the girl's narrow jawline like fluffy white pillows. Hinata's clenched teeth and quiet murmurs indicated that she was in quite a bit of pain from the parts of her body she could not control, but Ninata secretly delighted in the vision and burned it to memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a dance really. Two gorgeous young women, naked as the days they were born, showing off everything they were made of for Ninata. Stretching limbs, tightening muscles, the flashes of pink between splayed legs, the rippling orbs of jiggling gluteal and mammary flesh, all before Ninata's Hyuga-enhanced eyes. The heat in her loins was growing steadily within her as she watched her lover and her teacher fight, so much, she didn't think she could hold it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh...huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata blanched as realization struck. She couldn't hold it in at all! She hadn't realized it, but as she watched the beautiful display of Hinata and Kurenai's naked tussle in the woods, her own hand had crept down to her crotch and a few fingers wormed their way inside. Warmth dripped down her hand, soft velvet pulsed around it, and her knees trembled as fire raged all throughout her core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This isn't the time for <b>that</b>. Hinata-chan needs my help!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata withdrew her hand, hastily cleaned her fingers off with her mouth, and, trying to ignore the sensation of her own taste on top of the tingling feeling of electricity surging through her being and demanding release, leaped into action. Going for a ground-based assault hadn't worked in the past, and she doubted it would right now; Kurenai seemed to have eyes on the back of head, or could at least hear her two opponents running on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So we'll take her from the air!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata shot a pulse of chakra to the soles of her feet, enough so that she could stand vertically on the trunk of a nearby tree about a couple meters above the ground. And with another pulse of chakra she propelled herself back into the air and rocketed straight for Kurenai. The action was swift, decisive, and most important of all, silent. And the flash of chakra she exerted would be enough to alert her fellow Hyuga without catching Kurenai's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai's back was to her. Good. It would make the attack a lot more painful. As would the surge of chakra Ninata was directing into her fist. It wasn't the most chakra-efficient action, but if it connected, it would <b>hurt</b>. Or at least...she hoped it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata threw a J\u016bken strike at her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai spun around the attack, turning to the side so that Ninata could see her in profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata wound up her fist, which was glowing blue with chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai swerved her chest to the right. Her breasts followed. For a second, Ninata thought she saw an influx of blue flow through the medium-sized lumps of womanly flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata was in striking distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai swung her chest to the left. Like a pair of pendulums, her breasts swung that way too. They were glowing a brilliant shade of azure, there was no mistaking it now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and they collided with Ninata's face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Ninata knew, she was on the ground fifteen feet away, with hard nipples, utterly soaked thighs, and a dozen naked miniature Kurenais circling around her head, jiggling their boobs back and forth.</span></div></div>",

I think that's enough for now,\" said Kurenai as she brushed herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been sparring for nearly 20 minutes now, and Hinata and Ninata were getting awfully beat. Hinata did admirably at a few points, managing to deliver a few grazing hits on her teacher. Ninata didn't fare nearly as well, though she was admittedly able to trick the older woman using some well-timed illusory clones that provided a decent-enough diversion for Hinata to get a hit in. But overall, this was definitely not the girls' proudest moment. Even though they had both been Genin for well over a year now, this lesson was making them feel like fresh-faced academy graduates all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, this is even worse. I was not in this much pain when I did Kakashi's stupid bell test!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owwwwww!\" wailed Ninata as she grasped her breasts, rain pouring out of her eyes. \"It huuuuuurtsssss!\" She had taken an especially painful fall not 30 seconds ago, where she hit the ground boobs first, and then got dragged around on them while her stiff nipples ground painfully into the dirt. The poor little pink nubs were stinging with pain, and the great mounds of flesh that had given the former boy nothing but endless joy ever since she first got them felt absolutely tender and raw. This was honestly the worst non-testicular pain she ever experienced!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was on her in a flash, her satchel of medicine on hand and a sympathetic grimace on her face. \"Shhhh, Ninata-chan, it's okay. I can make it all better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata released her breasts to let Hinata do her thing, running her delicate fingers over the former boy's breasts, and coating them with an oily substance that felt cool to the touch. \"Ahhhh,\" she moaned, half-shuddering at how nice it felt, and half-wincing at how raw the sensitive mounds of flesh still were. \"What is this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you don't know,\" said Kurenai as she approached the girls, sitting down cross-legged with a good-natured chuckle, still naked as the day she was born. It took every ounce of willpower on Ninata's part to not steal a glance at the older woman's exposed groin. \"Hinata never comes to a mission or training session without her collection of medicinal vials and healing creams, all of which she makes at home. Surely, you would have known it's a hobby of hers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, I know she makes them,\" said Ninata. \"I just...haven't needed them yet. Or seen her mixing them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because I've...been busy this past week,\" said Hinata. \"With...things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her pain, Ninata could help but giggle at that. She knew exactly what \"things\" Hinata had been busy with. \"Well, seems like this stuff works great. My boobs aren't hurting anymore. In fact, I think they might even be...\" Ninata took a moment to jiggle her girls...only to gasp in pain as the familiar twinge of soreness flared up in her currently not-so-fun bags. \"Ow, no, they still hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you two are finished,\" said Kurenai, \"I'd like to get started. Before we began sparring, I told you two to pay attention to me as we fought. Now that you've had ample opportunity to observe nude fighting, or <i>zenrajutsu</i>, in action, I want to hear what you two have taken from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides the fact that we suck at it and you completely schooled us both?\" Ninata grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've only just begun your training, Ninata,\" said Kurenai pointedly. \"The purpose of this session was not to defeat me, but to show you what this particular combat style is capable of firsthand. So I'll ask you again: what did you see as you fought me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata raised her hand to speak, only to lower it when she realized how unnecessary that was. As well as how it would cause her bare breast to bounce \"Um, I noticed you seemed to channel chakra into...specific areas of your body,\" she said, the blush in her cheeks completely unmistakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where, specifically?\" said Kurenai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, on your hands. And feet. And...and...\" Hinata stuck her fingers together shyly. She may have been growing bolder by the day, but old habits don't die easily. \"...And...your backside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai nodded. \"That is correct. Being nude in a life-or-death situation is a terrifying prospect because of how vulnerable you are. But by molding chakra and directing it to strategic regions of your anatomy, you can temporarily harden your skin and muscles in such a way that they'll absorb or deflect damage, and prevent you from feeling pain, effectively serving the role of armor. With proper timing, you could take a direct spear thrust without losing a drop of blood. Muster enough chakra for it, and you could even break that spear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" said Ninata, perking up. That definitely sounded useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that,\" said Kurenai, \"but the natural hardening effect is has on your body can make your regular attacks even more devastating. With proper chakra control, it's theoretically possible to use your fist to punch through a boulder, or kick an enemy so hard, you could shatter their bones. And if you're feeling creative, you can even turn less conventional parts of your body into a weapon. That's how, Hinata, I was able to exert a lot of force on you using only my gluteal muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata turned red as a tomato at that and seemed to sink into the ground. Ninata just looked confused. \"Your what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My buttocks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Ohhhhh. So <i>that's</i> what happened.\" Now Ninata was blushing too. That move of Kurenai's was...well, it was kind of hot actually. It may have been painful from Hinata's perspective, but it was still hot. Knowing how much her girlfriend liked her own creamy little derriere, the boy-turned-girl had to wonder how Hinata would handle it if Ninata pulled that move on her. Absentmindedly, she found herself running a hand down one of her supple cheeks, which thankfully hadn't taken too much damage during the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like you could really distract people with these moves,\" said Ninata, giving herself a playful little pinch. \"Kami knows I sure was with how you were kicking. I could see all the way up your...\" Suddenly, she realized what she was saying. \"Er, uh, that is...I mean...damn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all right, Ninata,\" said Kurenai with an amused glint in her eye. \"You're not the only one who was distracted by me. And that is in fact another facet of nude fighting. The female body in all its nakedness is an unusual thing to see in any context; so rare and unusual, that even the most experienced ninjas can be thrown off by it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just like the old man</i>, Ninata thought with a giggle, remembering how quickly the Third Hokage succumbed to her Sexy no Jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter whether they find the human body enticing or repulsive,\" Kurenai continued. \"Both kinds of people will be distracted. And as such, it is important that you use everything you can to control where their attention is diverted. When you and I were engaged in combat, Ninata, I deliberately moved and attacked you in ways that would open my vulva wide and display my genitals in full to you. And it worked. You became so focused on my anatomy that you failed to take into account what I was going to do next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, did the older woman have to rub Ninata's stupidity in so brazenly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Distraction is a very important component to my tactics as it is,\" said Kurenai. \"And one of the great things about zenrajutsu is how flexible it can be. Various close-combat styles can be intermixed with it, and if you're tactical enough, you can even seamlessly blend it together with advanced ninjutsu. I for one am perfectly capable of combining my mastery of genjutsu with zenrajutsu, using my natural state as the basis for my illusions. For instance, if I were to spread my legs out, then I can trick my enemy into believing she is being swallowed up into my vagina until she's completely trapped within my uterus, rendering her completely inert. While genjutsu is not an area in your expertise, girls, you nevertheless can combine what you know of J\u016bken and whatnot with zenrajutsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You talk as if you've done it a lot, Kurenai-sensei,\" said Hinata. \"But I haven't seen you fight like...this ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I have,\" said Kurenai with a sly edge to her voice. \"You think I always go into battle in my usual uniform? I've actually gone into a few missions with you and Team 8 as I am now, wearing only an illusion of my clothes. Shino and Kiba never noticed, and my genjutsu was so good, it even tricked your Byakugan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...you've sometimes traveled around in broad daylight...completely naked? And we never knew it?!\" The little Hyuga was absolutely flabbergasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm,\" said Kurenai. \"I considered it a form of personal training. Fooling the advanced eyes of the Hyuga isn't something I normally get to do, so I took every opportunity I had to test my skills against your Byakugan. But we've been on this tangent long enough. Was there anything else either of you noticed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata furrowed her brow in thought as she tried recall if there were any other details she missed. Ninata could only shrug and give her slightly aching boobs a gentle rub. This new fighting style had potential, but without any support on the chest, it was hard on the girl parts. Even with her double's ointments, Ninata's breasts still hurt, and while Hinata's hadn't taken as much punishment, she could still notice the telltale winces in her twin's face to indicate they were hurting as well. Meanwhile, Kurenai looked completely fine. Even though she had been spinning and flipping and punching in all her glory with her breasts out and about the whole time, the Jonin hadn't once given her breasts anything as miniscule as a soothing caress. Ninata couldn't figure out why; they might not have been as proportionately large on the older woman's chest as the twins' were, but that didn't mean they wouldn't be bouncing around any less...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Wait a sec!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai's breasts...they hadn't bounced or jiggled at all during the fight! Not once...save for the one time where she used them to smack the former boy in the face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your boobs,\" she said. \"They weren't jiggling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai nodded approvingly. \"That is correct, Ninata, and that is one of the most important techniques to learn when you must fight in the nude. The woman's breasts are one of the most sensitive parts of her body, and without giving them any support, the stresses of combat will induce a lot of discomfort. But, by projecting a constant stream of chakra into my pectoral muscles, and pushing it through the fatty tissue surrounding my mammary glands, I can exert a lot more control over their motions.\" As if to demonstrate, the older ninja thrust her chest up and down. And her breasts, rather than bounce with her movements, stood stiff like two porcelain stones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very odd sight to say the least. Odd and maybe a little off-putting. Kurenai's unmoving breasts made her look somewhat like those plastic toy dolls all the little girls went wild over. But for two especially gifted young women like Hinata and Ninata, who both had firsthand experience of the hassles that came with having big boobs, so many possibilities just opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" they both uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you're impressed,\" said Kurenai. \"It's a very important technique to master, and one that I think should be taught to all girls. As it is now, only those who seek to learn about zenrajutsu know the trick, as do a few particularly 'large' women like our current Hokage. But I digress. Now that we're done with the demonstrations and the theoretical aspects of zenrajutsu, it's time for you both to begin learning it for real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few hours, Kurenai walked her two students through the basics of naked fighting. She taught them the proper stances, showed them the basic kicks and punches that would serve as the basis for all unclothed combat, and described in great detail how they would go about evading attacks in their undressed states. Surprisingly, Ninata actually had an easier handle on this. Hinata, who was too used to the Hyugas' rigid fighting style, kept inadvertently falling back into her old tried-and-true habits. When an attack called for a wide circular motion, she went for being stiff and linear. When Kurenai ordered her to dodge and spin, Hinata stood her ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flexibility is the key, \" Kurenai explained. \"You can still unleash the J\u016bken on your opponent, and deflect oncoming attacks the same way, but if you wish to use your exposed body's assets to their full extent, you need to be more nimble and fluid. Spread your legs, wider, learn to spin on the balls of your feet, pirouette, just like that. Good. Puff out your chest more, let them see what it has to offer. Don't be shy, Hinata. Revert to your Hyuga stance when you see an opening, but be quick about it. It should only last for an instant before you flow back into proper a zenrajutsu form. There, see what Ninata is doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnward the lesson went. Eventually, they took a break from zenrajutsu training to do more generalized exercises, like running laps up and down the trees, stretching their muscles, training their endurance, and walking on water. The last point eventually segued into a more relaxed dip into the river, which gave all three young women a chance to clean off the sweat and grime they had been accumulating from the day's events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing was strange to say the least. Three women running around the woods butt naked, doing nothing to shield their jiggling mounds, parting lips, or stretching muscles. Strange, and more than a tad embarrassing. Hinata and Ninata's faces were red for a good chunk of the time, particularly whenever Kurenai commented on the size of their breasts, their complete lack of body hair, the pinkness in their slits, and the wobbling motions in their behinds. But after a while, they grew comfortable with it. Since Kurenai wasn't wearing any clothing herself, their respective nakedness felt...casual in a way. They were naked, yes, but it wasn't a big deal. Even the growing tingles in their loins did little to shake them, though the occasional droplets of natural lubrication dribbling out most certainly did. Ninata couldn't help but feel jealous of the fact that Kurenai seemed to be in complete control of her flower; try as she might, the former boy never once caught a sign of moist arousal shimmering between the legs of her new teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was thoroughly clean, Kurenai stepped out of the water, cast a small jutsu to shake all the excess water from her form, and summoned her illusory outfit again. \"That'll be it for today,\" she said as the bandage-like garbs started to appear over her skin, fading in like ghostly images before solidifying into more genuine-looking cloth. \"You two are free for the rest of the day. Just be ready to see me again for tomorrow's lesson, same place and time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata watched her go. This was the first time she ever seriously interacted with the older woman, and overall, she was impressed. The kunoichi was impeccably professional, and her teaching methods were a lot more involved and hands-on (figuratively of course) than Kakashi's had been. Kakashi just seemed to expect you to figure out whatever lesson he was trying to impart, and if it flew over your head, then he'd pretty much just write you off as a failure. That was the most infuriating thing about him, and the more bitter side of Ninata couldn't help but wonder if that was why he showed more preference for Sasuke. Kurenai also didn't seem to be nearly as condescending as the masked bastard usually was either; she always answered Ninata's questions thoroughly, pointed out where she was going wrong, concisely told her how to correct herself, and never once said or did anything to make the former boy feel like an idiot. It was...nice. The former boy could definitely get used to training under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if she got to see her naked again, then it would be even better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurenai-sensei's really cool,\" she said. \"I can see how you, Shino, and Kiba managed to get so strong under her. I admit, I was a little leery about this, 'cause I was afraid she might not like me but...huh?\" As Ninata turned around, she saw she had been talking to air the whole time. Her girlfriend was nowhere to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata-chan? Where did you go-ohhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn electrifying sensation of warmth flared up in her core as something soft and boneless seeped its way between her slightly parted vulva lips. She knew that feeling all right, and she now knew exactly where Hinata was now. Ninata leaned her head back and closed her eyes to simply enjoy the sensation of her gorgeous lover's tongue slithering around inside of her, knowing that the two of them were likely going to be here for quite a while.</span></div></div>",

Lovemaking was not a tiring affair for them, but a renewing one. An hour or two spent rolling, grinding, caressing, licking, suckling, and kissing was all they needed to feel fired up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the groaning in their stomachs served as a stark reminder of one very simple fact: sex was no substitute for food. That was why the twins were seated at Icharaku's, enjoying a hearty bowl of ramen each and some sticks of dango, which they were playfully feeding each other. Ninata had just managed to snatch a sweet ball of dough in her mouth when they chanced upon an odd sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Ino were trudging up the road, leaning on each other's shoulders and looking very disheveled. Their hair was in disarray, their clothes were dirty and torn, and most notably, both girls were sporting a shiner over one of their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whuf happenff thoo hoo foo?\" said Ninata, her mouth still full of dango. After taking a moment to swallow the treat, she repeated the question. \"What happened to you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over,\" said Sakura in that moody tone of hers that Ninata was quite familiar with. \"Nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get into a fight?\" said Hinata, who was already reaching into her pouch of medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we fought,\" said Ino. \"Let's just say we both had a few...personal issues to work out. Disagreements. But we're cool now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What issues?\" said Ninata, narrowing her eyes at the blonde. If Ino was picking on her bubblegum-haired friend, there would be hell to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's between us, alright?\" Sakura snapped, which Ninata couldn't help but flinch at. She didn't mean to upset the pinkette; she just wanted to know what got them so riled up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the faceful of Haruno knuckles Ninata was expecting never came, for Sakura's surly glare softened up when she saw the innocent-looking blunette's reaction. \"Sorry. What I meant to say was, what we fought about isn't important. Not anymore. What's important is that...Ino and I have buried the hatchet. We're finally ready to stop our feud and start being...friends again. That's all. So you don't need to worry about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno nodded in agreement, though she couldn't resist giving the pink-haired girl a forceful nudge. \"You didn't need to bite me on the ear, though\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what you get for kneeing me you-know-where!\" barked Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't aiming for that! And besides, it wasn't that hard! If anything, it looked like you enjoyed it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura glared Ino. Ino glared at Sakura. If looks could kill, then the spot they stood upon would have been ground zero for the crater Konoha would have been reduced to. Hinata and Ninata exchanged worried glances as they both wondered if now was the time for them to vacate the premises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...heh, heh, heh.\" Somewhere in the silence, a quiet chuckle began to leak its way out of Ino's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha...ha, ha, ha, ha...\" Sakura replied, her scowl appearing to melt into a grin against her will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-HA, HA, HA, HA, HA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of raucous female laughter filled the air. Hinata and Ninata could only look on in bewilderment as Ino and Sakura cackled like madwomen in the middle of the street. They weren't the only ones gawking either; the duo were catching a lot of attention from passerbys, who couldn't help but wonder just what in Amaterasu's name these loony girls thought was so funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...heh, heh, heh,\" Ino giggled as she started to calm down and pull away from the pinkette, rubbing a tear out of her eye. \"It feels so good to get that out of my system,\" she said, leaning her head down so that her forehead bumped affectionately into Sakura's, which was currently mottled with a few bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, watch it, you pig,\" Sakura giggled, twitching a little in pain. \"You know how sensitive I am about my forehead. Especially now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to kiss it to make it all better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino! People are watching!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. You're no fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls pulled away and took a seat on the stools next to the still very confused twins. \"Are you sure you're okay?\" said Ninata. She was starting to wonder if maybe Sakura and Ino were partaking in drugs and if she should contact a rehab center. In their current state, they certainly <i>looked</i> like they could be junkies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, we're fine,\" said Sakura. \"I might look like a wilted salad right now, but this is the best I've felt all month.\" She peered at Ninata with a raised eyebrow. \"Uh, which one are you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninata, right. Sorry, it's hard to tell with you both looking the same. But thanks for the concern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata fidgeted nervously in her seat. \"Um, so, how are you two doing otherwise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm being worked to the bone by my new sensei,\" said Sakura. \"I got transferred to Team 10 since I don't...really have anyone to train with anymore. I tried asking the Hokage if she could take me under her wing, but it turns out being the village leader doesn't give you much time to train a student. So Asuma-sensei's been training me, and well...\" her expression turned glum. \"He said I need a lot of work. On my taijutsu, my coordination, my stamina, jutsu arsenal, and...just about everything else, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He specifically said that you should never have partaken in the Chuunin Exam,\" said Ino. \"And that it was irresponsible of Kakashi to put your team up to it. I'm sorry, Sakura. I know he was your sensei and all, but looking at you, I don't think whatever he was teaching you was working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my fault,\" said Sakura. \"I should have gotten my priorities straight. I should have spent more time training instead of trying to look pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if that was the case,\" said Ino, \"then it was Kakashi's job to get your head out of the clouds and <i>make</i> you train. Like teach you new jutsus, write up an exercise regimen, talk about battle strategy or...something. From what I heard, it honestly sounds like he only gave you the bare minimum of attention, and lavished most of his time on Sa\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, can we just not talk about this right now?\" said Sakura. \"We agreed we wouldn't talk about Sasuke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the Uchiha's name made Ninata's stomach clench. Setting her spoon down, she could only stare dispassionately at her half-eaten bowl of ramen, which was no longer appetizing. It looked like this was going to be the first time Teuchi would ever have to dispose of food ordered by her. Her sudden change in attitude did not go unnoticed. Hinata put a comforting hand on her double's shoulder as she saw the spirit sap out of her. Ino cast a worrying glance her way as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" said the blonde with a sigh. \"I shouldn't have brought it up, especially right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...yeah,\" said Sakura. \"That's what's been going on with us. Once we make ourselves look more...presentable,\" at this, she ran a finger along the black and blue ring around her eye, \"we're going to the hospital to see Chouji.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chouji-san hasn't woken up, has he?\" said Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno shook her head. \"No. Not yet. I keep bringing in herbs and flowers that smell nice and spicy, like what you would use for seasoning food, or other things that mimic the scent of barbeque. Hoping maybe they'll wake him up. And if not that, then at least giving him something to enjoy while he's sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Maybe we could go together,\" said Hinata. \"I need to see Tenten-san. She'll be undergoing surgery soon, so she could use the support.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a good idea,\" said Ino. \"I should see her too. We are war buddies, in a way. It's only fitting that we look out for each other.\" She sighed again. \"The way teams are usually arranged, with one girl for every two guys, it just seems like kunoichi like us don't really get to a whole lot of opportunities to band together and watch each other's backs. I swear, there must be some kind of law in place that makes it so that there can only ever be one girl to a team. It's bullshit, but I'm glad that us four can finally be an exception to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it'll be nice to have some girlfriends again,\" said Sakura. \"Guys are great and all, but hanging around them all the time can get real tiring after a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, guys are overrated,\" said Ino. \"We don't need 'em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, hm, that's not very nice, Ino-san,\" said Hinata, but her playful giggling proved she wasn't in complete disagreement with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata, meanwhile, couldn't help but be offended by this. She used to be a guy, and she knew firsthand that they weren't <i>that</i> bad. Sure, they could be assholes who only ever belittled and fought each other over the minutest of slights directed at their mothers. And yeah, they were kind of ugly too, and didn't look anywhere near as good as girls did, especially when they were naked. And a lot of them were shameless pervs who had nothing better to do than to gawk at girls in the bath. But they could...they were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm...she couldn't quite think of anything good to say about them. Just like she couldn't quite think of anything that she missed about her old male body. Come to think of it, Ninata couldn't even remember having a close relationship with any guy in her peer group. She never got to hang out with them, she never got to be part of a group, and she never had any around to spar with or laugh at her dumb jokes or sneak answers to on a tough test. And just the thought of being in the same bed with one made her skin crawl. And hell, when she was a guy, she was too damn clueless to realize how awesome and hot Hinata was.  Maybe there was some merit to what Ino, Sakura, and Hinata were thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're probably right,\" she said in that sweet, gentle tone that was a perfect pitch-by-pitch copy of Hinata's. \"Fuck guys!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The world turned and life went on for Hinata and Ninata with all its ups and downs. Somber times awaited the young couple; the funeral for Kiba had to be held, and the Inuzuka clan was kind enough to extend an invitation to his team to attend. Hinata dutifully accepted it. It was painful to have to open up old wounds again, but the born Hyuga was able to soldier on without shedding any more tears. And when all was said and done, she was grateful to finally return to the arms of her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were rough for Ninata too. About a week later, she had her first period. Though Ninata knew about and understood the general science behind the menstrual cycle, she was woefully unprepared when it hit her in full force. The bleeding, cramps, headaches and nausea proved to be too much for the poor girl; it was the first time she ever expressed regret for her transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be a boy again!\" she wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that,\" Hinata whispered, hugging her from behind. \"It's hard, I know. I've been through it. I'm...going through it right now. But it'll pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose days marked the first time the girls felt no urge to make love. For a while, Hinata feared that their sex life would take a downturn from there. Luckily, once the cycle ended, so too did their physical desires. And Ninata once again was happy about being her lover's near exact double.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were generally more positive where their new circle of girlfriends was concerned. Tenten got through her surgery with no complications. She needed time to heal of course, and she had to walk around with crutches for a few weeks, which was disheartening. But spending time in the company of her fellow kunoichi made it bearable. Always the tomboy with a fascination for all things sharp and pointy, Tenten never thought she had much in common with other girls, but she soon found that wasn't the case at all with Ino, Sakura, Ninata, and her savior, Hinata. Remembering their past talk in the woods, Hinata in particular encouraged Tenten to try looking into the interests she hadn't yet taken time to pursue while she recovered. Sure enough, the brunette started to read up on tengenjutsu, and found the little Hyuga to be a more than willing test subject to practice on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, so you're right here,\" said Tenten as she looked over her chart of the sexagenarian cycle. \"And you were born on...the 27th, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded her assent. They were sitting across one another cross-legged on the floor of the apartment she and Ninata called home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Tenten. \"So all I have to do then is get a feel for the shape of your body, and then we can begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata tilted her head quizzically. \"The shape of my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I need to see into your inner yin and yang if I want to tell your fortune,\" said Tenten. \"Should be interesting, seeing how yours split up and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said Hinata, spreading her arms to give her friend free rein over her body. Tenten thought she saw the Hyuga's lips curl up into a slight grin, but she ignored it. She wasn't here to...pleasure the Hyuga, she was just here to read her fortune for fun. That's all she was here for: good traditional fun. Putting a hand on each of the blunette's shoulders, she gently squeezed them to get a feel for the smaller girl's muscles before trailing down the lengths of her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's so slender</i>, the brunette thought. <i>I wonder how smooth her skin would feel if...no, stop thinking that way, Tenten! This is no time to\u2013</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thought was interrupted when Hinata suddenly grabbed her hands and shoved them into the large, luscious mounds of her breasts. Feeling the soft flesh mold itself into her palms made Tenten's heart seize up so hard, she feared her femoral artery would burst open again. \"Wh-what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giving you a feel of my body,\" Hinata whispered, her voice dropping to a husky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno too was enjoying the new situation, especially in light of how things were deteriorating with her male teammates. Chouji was unfortunately not waking up, and it broke her heart to watch him grow thinner with each passing day. Shikamaru was no help; he may have been putting more time and effort into his training and leadership studies than ever before, but the already reclusive boy was becoming increasingly more distant. She knew he was crushed by guilt for failing his mission. He blamed himself for Sasuke's defection, Chouji's coma, and Kiba's death. But he wouldn't let anyone come near him anymore, and the blonde for the life of her couldn't penetrate his walls. She would have fallen into depression, but rekindling her friendship with Sakura and being in the company of the other girls did much to keep her spirits up. Most surprisingly, she and Ninata found a lot of commonality in their mutual love of watching plants grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lilies are coming out really nice,\" she said while examining some of the potted flowers Ninata had growing around the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said the blunette as she sprinkled water over a particularly large pot. \"You've been a really big help. If I tended to them myself, I'd probably drown the poor things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Ino replied, tilting her head to get a better look at Hinata's twin. She was currently wearing a croptop that left her midriff exposed, and it appeared that she had some low-riding shorts to go with it. Shorts that were cut so low, they showed off a bit of Ninata's butt cleavage. \"Mmm...nice butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, Ino?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said...nice, but...don't you think maybe you could use a little more...color around here?\" <i>Good save!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" said Ninata, turning around to face her. \"You got a problem with orange?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orange is fine,\" said Ino, thankful that Ninata hadn't caught on to her slip. It helped that it wasn't entirely dishonest and the lack of floral variety in the apartment was a genuine concern of hers. \"But it would look more vibrant if maybe you added some blue around here. I can give you some recommendations of some flowers that would go well with your lilies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to do a sales pitch on me?\" said Ninata as she narrowed her eyes suspiciously at the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno could only grin. <i>She looks so adorable when she's grumpy.</i> \"Not at all,\" she said. \"I have some flowers that I can give you for free! No cost at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay. If you say so. I guess we could go pick something up at your shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Let's go!\" Ino exclaimed, grabbing the little Hyuga by the hand and running out the door with her in tow. She ignored Ninata's confused protests as they wound their way down the street, wind fluttering through their hair. She always felt like a kid whenever she hung out with Ninata or Hinata. Around them, she didn't have to worry about her training, or if guys thought she was pretty, or whether or not she'd come back from her next assignment alive, or about Chouji's condition. Maybe it was their seemingly innocent demeanor rubbing off on her (though Ino was quite aware their relationship was most definitely not innocent), but something about the twins made it seem like it was okay to be carefree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she had a Hinata of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Tsunade, she continued to closely monitor the twins. Every week, she'd give them a thorough medical examination just to make sure there weren't any complications. There weren't; Ninata's genes displayed no further changes, and Hinata was completely unaffected. And though it was prying into private territory, she also questioned them about their sex life. Both girls admitted to having sex every day for months on end, save for whenever they menstruated. It honestly baffled the aged woman; the twins' sexual proclivity dwarfed even the most hormonal of teenagers by multiple country miles. And despite her best efforts, there was nothing Tsunade could do to quell the girls' physical need for each other. No matter what drugs she fed them, jutsus she cast on them, rituals she invoked, teas she served, and meditative therapy she put them through, Hinata and Ninata would always crave one another sooner or later. Something about Ninata's bizarre transformation into Hinata awakened an insatiable lust in both girls, a kind of hypersexuality she had never seen before, but Tsunade would be damned if she could figure out why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut besides that, they were both perfectly healthy, growing young girls. And the Hokage supposed that was really all that mattered. As long as Ninata was happy, then Tsunade was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was, however, one anomaly that concerned the Hokage, something she had only recently discovered. Looking over their health charts over the past few months, she noticed that there had been a steady rise in both girls' chakra levels. Now, they didn't have the exact amount of chakra <i>per se</i>. Thanks to the influence of the demon fox and the genetic remnants of her old self, Ninata had more to spare, though her abysmal control meant she tended to run dry a lot faster. But the rate that each twin's chakra improved was not only greater than it was for most people, but both sets of chakra were perfectly parallel with one another, as if even their growth was in synch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this due to their near exact physiologies?\" Tsunade asked herself, speaking into a recorder. \"They are growing girls, it's pretty normal for chakra levels to start rising at their age. But I've never seen such a steady, exact and I daresay even rapid a rise like this. What could possibly be causing it? Is it another symptom to Ninata's transformation? And will it ever stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a bad thing; a ninja could never have too much chakra after all. And if the rates continued as they were, then both girls could very well reach Kage levels of chakra before they were 20! But it still concerned the Hokage. Everything about Ninata only raised questions and no answers. And it could only leave her wondering what else awaited the former Uzumaki.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ninata was standing in front of the full-length mirror, looking at herself from the side and running a hand down her waist. She was dressed in a kimono, primarily orange in color, decorated with all manner of petal-like shapes that ran the gamut of shades between light orange to peach, and all of which were arranged in vaguely floral patterns. A blue obi around her midsection kept the whole thing tied snuggly around her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked a little unsure, and was likely asking the age-old question that ran through every girl's head every time she put on a new article of clothing: <i>Does this make my butt look big?</i> To Hinata's well-trained eyes, it didn't. Ninata's butt looked fine, as always. Even while it was wrapped up in a lovely traditional garb. <i>Which will be too fun to take off</i>, she mused with a lick of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look beautiful, Ninata-chan,\" she said, embracing her girlfriend from behind and purring huskily as her nude body molded itself on Ninata's clothed form. The fine silken fabric felt absolutely divine on her bare skin. It had been an expensive kimono, well out of Ninata's price range, especially since she had to get by on low-paying D-rank missions for the past few months. But Hinata was more than willing to dip into her own account. She had been dying for a long time to see her Ninata-chan in a lovely kimono, and as far as she was concerned, the sight before her eyes was worth any price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you, Hinata-chan,\" said Ninata. \"I just wonder if I'm wearing this right. This is the first time I've ever put on a kimono, so I'm not so sure how I look. And you know how much trouble I have wearing girl's clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Ninata-chan,\" giggled Hinata. She knew abundantly well why Ninata had so much trouble wearing women's clothing. She knew precisely why they always just seemed to slip off her frame. But that was a detail for Hinata to know, and Ninata to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata pulled her lover closer to her, rubbing her chest into her back and crushing her breasts deeper into the kimono. She shuddered as the silk enveloped her hardened tits. Again and again, she pressed her chest into Ninata's back, reveling in the electrifying sensation of the fine cloth gliding over her sensitive little nubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Hinata-chan? We, uh, do need to get going soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in disappointment, Hinata pulled away. She could have stood there rubbing her naked body against Ninata's kimono-clad form, but her girlfriend was right. The new year was upon them, and it was time to celebrate with their friends and the rest of Konoha. She and Ninata had spent enough time making love today. Hinata turned to fetch her own kimono, which was folded up on a nearby loveseat, when she was suddenly spun around to face Ninata again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't do!\" her double said, slipping a finger down to the blunette's crotch, which was feeling especially moist and tingly. \"We can't have you walking around in your finest dress while you're dripping all over the place. What would people think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well,\" said Hinata, trailing off. She wondered if she should come clean to Ninata and tell her that girls didn't really <i>have</i> to go commando when they wore a kimono, that they could indeed wear panties under it. She just spun that little lie because she liked the idea of her girlfriend walking around all day without a thing underneath her fancy garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata grinned, her beautiful lavender eyes twinkling with mischief. \"Don't worry, Hinata-chan. I'll clean you up.\" Gently pushing the born-Hyuga down to a sitting position on the sofa, the former boy knelt down to gaze longingly at Hinata's slit. She moved closer, taking a deep breath through her nostrils to breathe in her girlfriend's wonderful scent, and exhaling just as strongly. Hinata shuddered again as Ninata's hot breath poured over her sex, prompting her to spread her legs wide and open herself up to her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm,\" Hinata murmured at the warm, wet caress of Ninata's tongue. It tickled the sensitive flesh on her thigh, every lick a gentle brushstroke on her skin, and ran slowly up to her groin. It left behind a thin film of saliva that chilled her to the core, and lapped up the stray droplets of fluid leaking from her moist sex. Hinata shut her eyes and leaned back as Ninata strayed to her crotch, feeling the wet organ trail mere centimeters away from her slit...and just about gasped as her twin suddenly pulled back to start licking her other leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was getting lightheaded. More and more, Ninata was licking her, cleaning off the residue that only her arousal could create. And with every masterful stroke of Ninata's tongue, Hinata dripped even more. She could hear herself gasping as Ninata's tongue strayed longer and closer to her open slit, knowing she was giving the former boy an eyeful of pink wetness. Her core was absolutely throbbing, begging with need, her clit swollen and ready to be touched, caressed, licked and loved. She needed but a touch from her lover. A single featherlike brush to her insides, nothing more. That was all Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Ninata complied. Ninata's tongue brushed the soft velvety flesh of Hinata's inner folds. It was gentle, as light as a feather, little more than a soft prod, but it was all that was needed to set the born Hyuga off. Hinata's legs clamped down on her lover's head like a vise, trapping Ninata's face within Hinata's crotch. Hinata was hot, Hinata was bothered, and Hinata would not be satisfied until Ninata had completed her task. And Ninata was nothing if not obedient. Opening her mouth wide, she extended her tongue, running the mollusk around in circles to taste the sweet, musky tart of Hinata's essence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhh.\" Hinata moaned happily, leaning her head back as she marveled at the sensation of her muscles clenching around her girlfriend's roaming and wriggling tongue. Ninata licked her walls, traced the wet pink folds of flesh, and seemed to push herself ever deeper inside, unleashing soft wet squelching sounds as she went. Hinata tightened her hold on the former boy, pulling her closer. If it was possible, she would have pulled Ninata all the way into her vagina, where she would spend the rest of her days pleasuring her lover from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Hinata's felt a gentle tug on her clit as it was in turn pulled inside Ninata's lips. And from that moment on, all rational thought had vanished from the Hyuga's head. All she could do was scream in ecstasy as the storm in her loins completely overtook her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few moments, Ninata had a much bigger mess to clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry we're late!\" said Hinata as she and Ninata stumbled to the sweet bun shop where Ino, Tenten and Sakura were waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, what took you guys so long?\" said Ino, who was looking quite dignified despite her slightly annoyed demeanor. She was wearing a violet kimono adorned with white floral patterns that were sprinkled all over the fabric like a meadow of flowers, her lips were painted a deep red that only accentuated the cute pout she was wearing, and her hair was gathered up in a neat bun that was held in place by a pair of hairsticks. Had she been holding a fan, she could have easily been mistaken for a young noblewoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two better not be turning into Kakashi-sensei on us,\" chortled Sakura, putting a hand to her lips in a similarly aristocratic manner. She was dressed in a kimono that appeared to have the same design philosophy as the qipao she frequently donned, bearing that same shade of red, that same white trimming, and similar-enough circles on her sleeves and the panels of her garb. Her eyes were dabbed in plum-hued eyeshadow that really brought out her green irises. \"Did you get lost on the road of life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's nostrils flared, though the effect looked more cute than menacing with Hinata's face. \"Hey, we're not that baaaa\u2013\" she stopped with a sudden realization that she wasn't supposed to know how notorious Kakashi's tardiness could be. \"I mean, uh, we didn't get lost at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, she had been keeping her cover story up pretty well. She, Hinata and Tsunade had convened in the past to get as many details on how much 'Ninata,' the yin-yang chakra split clone, knew about Hinata's past. Since Hinata outright said Ninata shared her memories, they had no choice but to run with that, but they developed some ways to work around it. Since Ninata was wired differently as a result of being borne from a specific half of Hinata's chakra, it stood to reason that some memories would stick out better, or worse, than others. So any discrepancies in what either girl recalled could be explained away with that. Ninata also had an ace up her sleeve just in case she was asked something she had no way of knowing: \"You should ask Hinata-chan. I dunno if she'd be comfortable if I told you.\" Fortunately, their friends didn't pry. They knew Hinata was a private person in general, and respected that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just had to do a little extra cleaning is all,\" said Hinata, her face completely straight, for she spoke nothing but the truth. The truth, though maybe not the whole, naked, sexy truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're all here now,\" said Tenten, who honestly had undergone the biggest transformation in getting into the spirit of the new year celebrations. Like the other girls, she was dressed in a fine silk kimono that likely cost a pretty ryou. However, what stood out was the way she made herself up. Looking at Tenten now, one would never guess what a tomboy she was. Her face was powdered white, her normally thin lips were painted a glossy pink, a light rosy blush had been applied to her cheeks, and her eyelashes were made darker and thicker with mascara. Most notably, her hair was completely let down; without the buns in place, it cascaded neatly down just past her shoulders in a way that accentuated her femininity. And sensuality. \"Let's go have some fun!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The celebrations were in full swing across Konoha. It had been an eventful year for the village, for the five girls, and especially for the one who used to be a boy. There had been a lot of hardship and a lot of loss. But they endured, and with endurance came rejuvenation and a chance to grow stronger than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls wandered around for a while to simply take in the sights and sample some of the local goods. The air was filled with the beating of taiko drums and the sweet scents of tea, incense and sesame. Brilliant red and orange banners and ribbons fluttered in the breeze. There was raucous singing and heavy footsteps in the distance, which revealed upon investigation, that a parade was making its way through the streets, trailed by dancers and headed by a massive scarlet dragon puppet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one seemed too eager to do anything just yet. They were content to simply revel in the splendor around them, and enjoy some nice sugary treats. They only stopped at the sound of an explosion. Running to investigate, the girls came upon a square stage in an open marketplace, surrounded by people on all sides who were viewing and laughing at the proceedings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one corner of the stage sat a small troupe of musicians all playing various instruments, while in the center stood an assortment of people. Most were dressed head to toe in tight black garbs, and one was a particularly burly man who wore a fancy elaborate navy blue robe embroidered with the images of dark purple-grey storm clouds and lightning bolts. He was laughing heartily onstage with a sake jug in hand as he stumbled around in some kind of drunken dance. This went on until he tripped on a large stage prop that looked like some kind of large plush animal, causing him to fall and roll comically on the floor, which shook and thundered with his movements. The entire audience burst into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis definitely caught the girls' attention, and they all stood in rapt attention to see what would happen next. As the big man got back on his feet, wearing an expression of indignity on his face, the black-garbed people rushed to the animal and raised it to a standing position, revealing that it was some kind of horse puppet. A noise went off from the musician's corner that could only be summed up as an annoyed nicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare challenge the great Susano-o?\" the man roared in a deep booming voice. The horse \"shook\" its head in annoyance at him, letting out another nicker. \"So be it, then!\" he responded. The man, Susano-o, then seized the puppet and with a firm yank, took off its furry hide, rendering the horse hairless and revealing its peach \"flesh\" to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" said Ninata, tilting her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this may be the story of Amaterasu and Ame-no-Uzume,\" said Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata recognized the name of Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun, but drew a blank at Uzume. And she had to wonder that if the play was about them, what was Susano-o, the god of storms, doing here? She just never knew much about mythology and religion outside of the very basics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn embarrassed nicker went off as the black-garbed stagehands rose the horse up onto its hind legs and crossed its \"arms\" over its chest and \"groin\" as if it was trying desperately to cover its nudity. Everyone laughed at its cartoonish antics, including the five friends. \"Though I have to say,\" said Sakura, \"I don't think I've ever seen it told quite like this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still want to fight, eh?\" said Susano-o. \"Then take this! Hai-yooooooo-YA!\" He threw a series of exaggerated punches and kicks into the horse, whose operators made to react in equally exaggerated ways. It doubled over as a fist connected with its stomach, flung its head back when another hit its muzzle, and twirled around in a circle when it made an acquaintanceship with Susano-o's soles. Finally, the actor grabbed the beast with both hands and through coordinated effort with the stagehands, lifted the animal above his head and hurled it. The operators ran in circles around the stage, twirling the horse around as though it was helplessly spinning through the air, hilariously neighing all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point when a new character entered the stage: a woman wearing a radiant kimono dyed in the warm colors of the sun, with sleeves so long they nearly reached the floor. How she was able to glide along so fluidly with nary a stumble was anyone's guess. Every inch of skin that could be seen, from her hands, to her face, to her collar, and to the enticing nape of her neck, was powdered white as snow, which made her long midnight-hued hair and cherry-colored lips stand out all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata would have mused at how beautiful she was and start fantasizing how Hinata would look if she tried a similar getup, if the horse had not collided with the actress and sent her crashing to the ground, to the laughter of everyone present. Looking in horror at the hairless remains of her mare, the actress, who was clearly playing Amaterasu, stood up with an expression of pure rage, which she directed with laser-guided precision at Susano-o.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a lengthy fight between the two gods. There was much screaming, shouting, and throwing of flowery insults at one another, alongside the occasional blunt object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...motherless stinking son of a Krasue!\" screamed Amaterasu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...rainbow-pissing, excrement-hurling, fish-breathed she-wolf!\" retorted Susano-o.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My breath does not smell of fish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all in good fun. The gods were very creative with their names, and the accompanying music, though played via traditional instruments, was very comical. That all ended when things turned violent and Susano-o threw a punch at Amaterasu's face, sending her to the floor. The music stopped dead and a collective gasp fell over the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bastard, I'll show him,\" hissed Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had to grab her by the sleeve before she did anything stupid. \"Ninata-chan, please, it's just a play...I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmaterasu pushed herself off the floor with shaky arms. Looking up at Susano-o, who appeared absolutely horrified at what he had just done, her previously furious expression twisted into one of sadness and hurt. Sobbing, she fled from the stage, leaving what was supposed to be her home in the heavens behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scenery on the stage shifted at that point. From the musical troupe, a narrator took over, detailing how in her grief and anger, the sun goddess fled into a cave. Without her light to shine upon the world, life began to dwindle. Plants withered, people starved, and the spirits weakened in the darkness. Actors and stagehands moved on and off the stage to demonstrate these calamities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata had to stifle a yawn. <i>Man, how long is this going to go on?</i> she silently groaned. She rather enjoyed the first part of the play, which was really funny, but she was finding this section kind of slow. And what wasn't boring her was absolutely depressing. This was supposed to be a day of celebration, so why were they watching something that was doing its damnedest to sour everything? She really just wanted to go. However, looking at her girlfriends, she saw she was clearly out-voted in that department. Only Tenten appeared to share her disinterest, but Hinata, Sakura and Ino were really getting into things, if their wide eyes were anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it was then that Ame-no-Uzume devised a way to draw the sun goddess out from her self-imposed exile,\" said the narrator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new actress came upon the stage. She was shorter than the previous one, more petite and slender. She wore a simple white kimono with scarlet trimming, and had her black hair cut in a cute pageboy style. Ribbons of the same shades of white and red were tied into it, and they trailed just past her shoulders. She carried with her a washtub, which she placed upside-down at the entrance of the cave where Amaterasu had hidden herself. Stooping over it, she began to pat it as if it were a drum, and it indeed let out a booming sound not unlike the taiko that could be heard all across town. Or maybe that was thanks to the person who was playing the drum to the side. She started out with a slow beat, but steadily worked her way up to a fast rhythm, which she seemed to playfully sway her behind to, until she finally climbed up onto the washtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on the impromptu instrument, the actress playing Ame-no-Uzume began to dance. She swayed her hips one way and her body the other in fluid serpentine motions and spun slowly about on her feet to give everyone surrounding the stage a full view of her movements from every angle. She cast many longing glances at the cave, made graceful beckoning gestures with her hands, and though she didn't say anything, Ninata could see she was mouthing \"Come, my goddess,\" just from the movement of her lips.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Neither ceasing her movements nor taking her eyes off the cave, Uzume's hand crept to her red obi, which was tied in a bow on her front. With a deft tug, she undid the entire thing, and let the fabric fall carelessly to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She couldn't be.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was. Uzume pulled the front panels of her kimono away from her chest, offering more teasing glimpses of the creamy skin on her collar. As she began to spin away from the view of Ninata and her friends, she loosened the fabric so far back they could see her bare shoulder. There was uproar from the audience on the other side of the stage as the actress faced them, both her arms and the panels of her kimono spread out as far as they could possibly go. Some people cheered, some laughed, some wolf-whistled, and more than a few parents covered their children's eyes before scurrying away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" said Ninata, as she comically hopped to get a better look at what was going on, even though nothing was really obstructing her view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see, Ninata-chan,\" giggled Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUzume cast off her clothing and revealed what she wore underneath. Which wasn't much. She wasn't naked, but she might as well have been, for her costume looked like it did everything it could to spit in the face of what was considered proper and taboo in polite society. A series of vines snaked around her skin. They coiled up her legs, her slender thighs and all along her torso. One particularly thick tendril extended its way down into the cleft of her butt, effectively covering it up without hiding it at all. Her bubbly cheeks bounced playfully as she swayed them to and fro the same way they would have had they been completely bare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Uzume spun around again, the five wide-eyed girls were treated to the sight of her cute B-cup boobs as they jiggled freely with her movements, her \"costume\" doing nothing to hide her flesh save the little circles that were her nipples. Those were covered only by the tiniest of leaf-shaped adhesives on her breasts. As she turned to face them again, they could see clearly that her womanhood was neatly covered by the same vine that hid her butt from public eyes, creeping up over her neatly-shaved womanly slit. The actress' costume did everything it could to cover up her naughty parts, but left absolutely little of her beautiful figure to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hushed gasp fell over the crowd, as did many a whoop, whistle and holler. Even the five friends were surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" said Hinata, putting a hand to her lips, which did much to hide the grin that was splitting her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this for real?\" said Tenten incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Ninata. This play just got a whole lot more interesting all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder where I can get something like that?\" whispered Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura, meanwhile could only stare in stunned silence. She knew the story well enough, but this was not the kind of performance she had been expecting. Ninata thought she heard the pinkette say something to them, but she couldn't be bothered to listen. Whatever Sakura had to say could wait. There was a hot 90% naked chick onstage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUzume's dance grew more provocative. Her swaying sped up and she shifted her pose. Sometimes, she would stand up straight, arch herself backward, and put her hands behind her head, jutting her cute breasts out and jiggling them before everyone's eyes. Other times, she would bend forward, slide her hands onto her knees and wiggle her behind. She was not shy about showing off, and nearly everything about her was on display. Her boobs as they appeared from the front and to the side, the way her slim stomach curved inward ever so slightly to show off her cute belly button, how round and spherical her buttocks were and how silky-smooth they had to have been to the touch, and especially how graceful and limber she appeared through her dancing. Ninata burned all her features to memory. And without realizing it, she had activated her Byakugan, just so that she could get a better look at Uzume...and see what she looked like without the tantalizing costume in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm hand gripped her own, and through her sphere of vision, Ninata saw that Hinata was doing the same thing, leering at the dancing beauty with the full power of the Hyuga clan's pride and joy. And if she was anything like Ninata, which she very nearly was, she was likely feeling very warm down there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dang. I was trying to avoid something like that from happening</i>, she huffed, knowing she was beginning to feel the first tingling pangs of moisture in her lower lips. <i>Why can't we wear anything under these things anyway?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the goddess Amaterasu came out of her cave, looking confused and curious over what was causing the commotion outside. Her befuddlement gave way to shock and surprise when she saw the nearly naked young beauty dancing on an overturned washtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on Earth is happening out here?\" she said, absolutely dazzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUzume shot her a brief glance before throwing her head back in a dismissive laugh, her voice carrying a happy lilt. \"What is happening out here, you say? Why, we are merely celebrating the arrival of our new goddess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What new goddess?\" Amaterasu asked, her face and voice betraying a sense of offense at that notion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, this one!\" said Uzume. And in a single flourishing spin, she dove off the washtub, spreading her legs wide to give her captive audience an even more teasing glimpse of the treasure she held between them, prompting even hoots and hollers from around the stage, and presented to the sun goddess a decorative bronze mirror held by two stagehands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmaterasu gazed at her reflection, and let out a theatrical gasp at the sight before her. \"Long had it been since she had seen her reflection,\" the narrator explained. \"Long had it been since the sun goddess beheld her own glory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Amaterasu asked, cautiously approaching the mirror. \"Do you seek to steal my domain?\" Step by step she drew closer to her reflection. Reaching a hand forward, she dared to touch the woman before her, only to be met by cold glass. And that was when realization sunk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here to welcome our new goddess,\" said Uzume, embracing Amaterasu from behind, pressing her almost nude form into the goddess' kimono. Ninata and Hinata exchanged a knowing glance. This scene was looking oddly familiar for them. \"That is...if she will accept it,\" she added, her voice dipping to a husky whisper that was still loud enough for everyone to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will,\" said Amaterasu. \"She will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the play wrapped up. Emboldened by her marvelous radiance, Amaterasu resumed her duties as the goddess of the sun, brighter and stronger than she ever had been before. The actress and her fellow thespians joined her on the stage alongside the musicians, who all stood up, and gave a bow to everyone in the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Tenraku Players thank you for your patronage,\" said the actress who played Amaterasu, \"and we wish you all a festive new year!\" And amidst many cheers and applause, she embraced the actress who played Ame-no-Uzume, who was wearing naught but her skin and a few strategically-placed plant-like adhesives, and gave her a deep kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I wasn't expecting to see anything like that,\" said Tenten as she and the other girls floated away from the stage to continue touring the sites of the festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I liked it,\" said Ino. \"Especially that dance. If they had more things like that at the shrines, I just might become a more spiritual person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\" said Ninata. If she had still been a boy, she likely would have been decked by at least one of the girls present for displaying such pervy thoughts. But instead, she was met with a round of giggles from all of her girlfriends. Coming out of her sweet little mouth, they all thought it was funny. Though she liked to at least think that all of them agreed that the world would be a better place if it had more naked or nearly naked women in it. But that was just another fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura, however, was oddly silent. \"Is something the matter, Sakura-chan?\" said Hinata in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...no, it's nothing,\" said the pinkette. \"It's just...the play, it took a whole lot of liberties is all.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At Tenten's words, it was obvious what they needed to do: hurry over to the village square and play some games. All kinds of stands and canvas lean-tos of vibrant colors were stationed there in rows, circling down to the center of Konoha in a spiral. There was a goldfish scooping game, a number of fortune tellers, some betting wheels and slots, and most prominent of all, signs that read \"Absolutely no ninjutu allowed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rats, they thought of everything,\" muttered Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n However, one particular stand stood out, or at least, it did to Tenten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betcha' I can knock all those down,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour pairs of eyes followed where her hand pointed, and one of them crinkled in amusement. There wasn't anything special about it; it was a target-throwing game, which naturally would be the kind of thing that would appeal to Tenten. That wasn't what caught Ninata's interest though: it was the targets themselves, all of which were identical-looking dolls that looked very familiar. Sure, they were plush, chibified and button-eyed, but she recognized that red sleeveless jacket and immense white mane. <i>Looks like someone besides me and Obachan has a bone to pick with Ero-Sennin.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on!\" she said, rubbing her hands together with anticipation. \"In fact, I wager that I can knock 'em all down before you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata could not knock them all down. Even with her superior Hyuga vision, the Jiraiya dolls were too fast for her, capable of dodging her throws with as much nimble grace as the mechanical conveyors that slid them back and forth were capable of giving them. She could almost hear them mocking her sad performance in the old pervert's voice, saying how she had absolutely no talent at all. But they did compliment her on having a lovely rack and a nice butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you, Ero-Sennin,\" she muttered when her last ball disappeared into the void that was the back of the lean-to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten fared much better. The weapon specialist's aim was deadly accurate. Every time a ball left her hand, a chibi Jiraiya was sent screaming into the void! Or at least Ninata liked to imagine they were, especially considering how Tenten was currently wearing her steel face of determination and looked like she was throwing to kill. It looked so out of place when juxtaposed against her elegant doll-like appearance. Kind of hot too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there seemed to be one doll that proved to be very evasive. It moved much faster than the rest, and flipped out of view more erratically. Even Tenten's skilled marksmanship was no match for it. Her previously perfect streak of scoring nothing but hits came to an end when it was the last doll standing, for all three of her throws sailed harmlessly past its brilliant white mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second she lost her last ball, Tenten immediately slammed another bundle of ryou down on the counter, not giving the other girls a chance to try their luck. Not that any of them would have wanted to; if looks had destructive capability, all those Jiraiya dolls would have burst into flame, the tent would have caught on fire, the game's attendant would have been rolling on the ground screaming in agony as he burned to death, and everyone present would have grown a few shades tanner. Even Sakura, who was the absolute scariest girl Ninata had ever known, was stepping away from Tenten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Tenten's second attempt fared as well as her last one. Her first miss sailed by the final Jiraiya doll by a mile. Her second whiffed right over its hair. The third only just barely managed to graze its side. It was a hit, but not one that was hard enough to qualify as a knockdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten was not pleased. \"DAH, FRICKEN GERDFRAGGIN DERH BER!\" she roared. At least, that's what it sounded like to Ninata's ears. The former boy had no idea what language the brunette was speaking, but she assumed it had to be some litany of curses. Tenten was too pissed to stand the sight of the game regardless, as she spun on her heel and stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenten-san, what's wrong?\" said Hinata as she ran after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what gives?\" said Ino. \"It's just a game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't even claim your prizes,\" said Sakura. \"Not that anything up there looked all that good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prizes may not have been interesting,\" said Ninata, \"but I wouldn't have minded negotiating for one of those Ero-I mean, Jiraiya dolls. Personal reasons.\" They looked like the kind of things you would poke with needles to cause endless torment to a person that drew your ire, and nothing would have delighted the boy-turned-girl more than the opportunity to aggravate the old man from a remote distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" groused Tenten as she kicked some dust in the street. \"I don't really care about winning some dumb bean-stuffed toad or whatever he had to offer. But it's the principle of the thing! I couldn't hit that last stupid target! And I don't have the money to spend on more games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls tried to cheer her up, Hinata took a moment to discretely activate her Byakugan. Ninata raised an eyebrow at her. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking at the game,\" said the blunette as her brow furrowed with thought at what she was seeing. \"Tenten-san, you wouldn't have been able to knock that doll off no matter how good your aim was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" said the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rigged. The doll is connected to a magnet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That son of a bitch!\" growled Sakura, punching a fist into her palm. \"We can't let him get away with that. How many kids could he be scamming today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's call shenanigans!\" cheered Ninata. \"Let's all grab a broom and trash the place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa, I like random destruction as much as the next girl,\" said Ino, \"but do we really need to resort to that so soon? It's not even noon yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn impish smile began to spread across Hinata's face. \"I have a better idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no customers to attend to, Goro was free to start counting up his earnings for the day. They weren't bad so far. That group of five gave him a nice stack of cash, though if that raven-head didn't have such a short fuse, he might have made even more off them. Then again, maybe it was for the best; she was clearly an expert thrower. Given enough tries, she might have actually hit the last target and found out his dirty little secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up to see them approaching his stand once more, the brunette in the lead. \"One more game, please,\" she said stoically, laying some bills down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, maintaining his poker face to keep the greedy grin from seeping in and giving the game away. \"All right, then. Good luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro stepped aside as the teen did her thing, hurling each ball with expert precision at his targets. As usual, she was accurate and didn't miss. However, the rest of her companions didn't seem interested in her performance. The blonde and pinkette moved to one side to chat about teenage girl stuff, while the blunettes, who were clearly twin sisters, sidled to the other end. The one in the orange kimono stood in the front, and she looked a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her frightened squeak, Goro realized why. Her sister had loosened up her obi and pulled the folds of the garment away, exposing an ample amount of her chest to the world. Goro's eyes nearly bugged out. The girl was so young, so small, and so fair-skinned...but she sported a very impressive bust! It had been so cleverly hidden beneath the fabric of her kimono, but now that it was loose, it was all she could do to keep the ivory orbs from bouncing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a cutie!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly, he wondered what color the girl's nipples were, but before he could catch so much of a glimpse of areole, the hands of her sister suddenly glomped the orbs and gave them a tender squeeze. The girl squealed again as her sweet feminine flesh bulged tantalizingly between her tormentor's fingers. \"Mmmm, you feel so good,\" the young seductress said, whispering into her sister's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi-Hinata-chan!\" the nearly topless girl protested. \"Is it...really a good idea to do this here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than answer her, the girl, Hinata, merely took a deep breath to inhale her sister's perfume, and brought her lips down upon her neck. The more demure twin gasped half in fright and half in pleasure as Hinata began to lightly suckle on her sensitive flesh while she continued to gently massage her boobs, rolling, squeezing and molding them in her hands like clay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis...this wasn't right. Goro shouldn't be looking at this. These girls were <i>sisters</i>, and they were broadcasting their incestuous relationship to everyone in broad daylight! What was wrong with them? But he couldn't look away. They were both just so gorgeous. And the fact that they were sisters, twins even, just made their display all the more enticing. The attendant could already feel a warm trickle of blood on his lip and a slight taste of salt on his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh darn,\" came the deadpan voice of the brunette. \"Lost again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, that's too bad,\" said Hinata in a husky tone as she pulled away from her sister's neck with a pout. \"Come on then, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let go of her sister's chest, and for an instant, before she desperately got her clothes back on, Goro saw her tits. They were pert, hard, and toned a lovely shade of pink, just the way he liked them. Flustered and red in the face, the girl darted out of sight. Such a shame; he really would have liked to see more of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, um, come back anytime, ladies,\" he said when it was clear they were done with him. Realizing his nose was still bleeding, Gorou, turned around to get it properly cleaned up...only to freeze in horror at the sight that lay before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis targets...they were all gone!</span></div></div>",

If you stuffed a few into your kimono like I suggested, they wouldn't be stacked so high that your billboard-brow would keep knocking them off. You know as well as I do that you've got plenty of storage space in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, screw you and the boar you rode in on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno and Sakura were making their way to the designated meeting place, ducking through alleyways and hopping over rooftops to stay out of sight. It wasn't easy, not with the busy streets or the fat stack of Jiraiya dolls they were both carrying, but it was imperative. If anyone saw them with their stolen merchandise, there'd be a lot of questions, and Ino had the distinct impression no one would believe they fell off the back of a wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno felt her feet land on another rooftop, and with a heaving sigh, dumped the dolls where she stood. \"Alright, here's the place we agreed to meet at. You can drop them now, Billboard-Brow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura did just that. \"Phew! What a hassle. Just what's gotten into Hinata's head anyway? I never would've imagined that she'd ever have the guts to pull this kind of stunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worked pretty well though,\" said Ino with a grin. \"We pulled it off without a hitch. Tenten gives us an excuse to approach, Hinata and Ninata divert the guy's attention, and while he's drooling over them, we rob him blind! And admit it: you enjoyed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah. I did. It was pretty fun,\" said Sakura. \"But don't you think Hinata might have overdone it a little? I thought they were just going to make out, but she nearly stripped Ninata in public!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I liked it. Ninata looks so cute when she's embarrassed.\" And to be honest, Ino kind of wished it went further than it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll admit, she's cute when she gets like that. But she's such a sucker. She'll do anything if Hinata flutters her eyelashes enough. And sometimes, seeing the way they act kinda' makes me want to hurl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno huffed. \"Oh come off it, you prude! Leave them be. They're happy, which is more than you and I could say about ourselves and\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was stopped cold in her tracks when out of nowhere, Sakura's face twisted into a furious scowl. \"Don't even think about finishing that sentence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno nearly fell where she stood. What the heck brought that on? \"Sakura? What...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're going to say,\" growled the pinkette as she turned around and plopped down on the shingles. \"I know you're going to go on about how we both wasted years of our lives on Sasuke, and that's why we're both single and miserable now. I don't want to hear it! And I don't want to hear how much you want him dead now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince his desertion and defection, Sasuke had become an even greater point of contention for the two girls. Sakura believed he could be redeemed. Ino knew he could not. And in the week following that disastrous mission, they fought each other more viciously than ever before because of that one disagreement. It only ended after their latest tussle where, exhausted from expending so much energy, they just started laughing at the futility of it all. They were no longer competing for his affection, and yet he was still keeping them at each other's throats. In a way, it made the blonde hate him even more. But she and Sakura finally decided enough was enough. They agreed that they would start getting along from that point on, to work together, and maybe be nice to one another like they used to be before <i>he</i> ever entered the picture. But the two knew they would never budge on that issue, so they came to an agreement: they would never, ever, <i>ever</i> mention or even allude to the Uchiha in the other's presence. As long as they kept silent about him, they would get along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's how things were. The subject of Sasuke never again came up between Ino and Sakura, and things were at last good between them. It was like they were almost kids again, sitting carefree in the fields and making flower wreathes for each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno opened her mouth to say something, but whatever thought she had died on her tongue. The air was thick with silent tension. If she uttered the wrong word, whispered the wrong syllable, then everything she and Sakura had built up over the past few months would come crashing down. And Ino didn't want that to happen. She didn't want this rift to reopen. She didn't want to lose another friend. She didn't want Sasuke to ruin her life any more than he already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Sakura let out a defeated sigh, her head dropping as if the air had gone out of it. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, wiping her eyes at some tears that were likely streaming from her eyes. \"I shouldn't have said that. But the thing is...you're right. Ninata just fell into Hinata's lap, she has the love of her life now, and I...don't.  And seeing Hinata and Ninata be all romantic with each other, however inappropriately, just reminds me of what I don't have. And what I...don't think I'll ever have. And it makes me jealous. It's like everything is perfect for her, but it won't ever be for me. And it's just...it's not fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" said Ino, sighing with relief that their little spat managed to end before it was able to begin. She took a seat next to her friend. \"To be honest, I'm kind of jealous too. But for a different reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How so?\" said Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno took a deep breath. She was about to let something out, something she hadn't quite told anyone yet. \"I...it was a few months ago, but I realized that...I like girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura jumped back in clear surprise. \"Whoa, what...really? You do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I do,\" said Ino. \"And not only that, but...I 'm really attracted to them. To Hinata and Ninata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...wow,\" said Sakura. \"So, uh, when you said you liked Hinata's little display back there, do you mean you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno simply nodded her assent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...see. Huh. I can see why that can get awkward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, believe me,\" said the blonde. \"I have no chance to get between them, and I wouldn't want to. But I really wish Hinata would spawn another twin, one who I could have for myself. Or maybe, I dunno...if whatever happened to her would happen to me so I'd have a twin to love me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura wrinkled her nose. \"Wouldn't you find dating yourself kind of weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but it's been working out amazingly well for Hinata. She just has this glow about her when she's around Ninata, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, but it's different for them. They're...they're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura paused, the words fading before they could leave her lips. She swore she had a solid argument in her head, but she couldn't recall what it was. And now that she was thinking about it, she realized the oddest thing of all: even though Hinata was effectively in a romantic relationship with her twin sister, the pinkette never once equated it with incest. And she couldn't for the life of her figure out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" said Ino, \"I don't expect you to get me. But there's definitely something special between those two. And whatever it is, I want in on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pinkette sighed in defeat. \"Alright, I understand. I get this is probably not the easiest thing for you to deal with. Or to admit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno shrugged. \"To be honest, I'm surprised you didn't figure it out on your own. You might be the first person I've come out of the closet to, but it's not something I've been hiding either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that we've gotten that out of the way, we might as well get this out then,\" said Sakura. \"Nothing's changed between us. I have no problems with your attraction to girls, but I don't share it. So don't bother asking me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno snorted playfully. \"Oh, don't you worry. I prefer my girls to have a much smaller melon on their shoulders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smirked back at her. \"Oh, you would, would you?\" she responded with mock indignity. \"Well, I feel sorry for any girl who has to put up with a messy pig like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friends' laughter had only just begun to die down by the time Hinata, Ninata and Tenten caught up with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do with all these things anyway?\" said Tenten as she examined the pile of Jiraiya dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm claiming this one!\" said Ninata as she proudly held a doll up in the air. \"This is the one you couldn't hit, which means it's cursed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want a cursed doll?\" said Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personal reasons.\" Ino, Sakura and Tenten crossed their arms, clearly not satisfied with the former boy's answer. \"Okay, fine. So I can turn it into an effigy and put curses on Jiraiya. Like give him hiccups or diarrhea, or make him impotent or something.\" <br>\r\n\"Why?\" said Sakura. \"What did he do to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he's a peeping dirty old man is why!\" said Ninata with a curt nod, as if that alone explained anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Ninata-chan, are you sure that's a good idea?\" said Hinata. \"He is Hokage-sama's friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she'd be the first in line for a chance to curse the old perv!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura massaged her forehead as if to soothe an ache in it. \"Ninata, you know those things are only make-believe. With some of the ideas you come up with, I swear you're really just Naruto masquerading in a Hinata-shaped henge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Ninata began to cough violently, prompting a distressed Hinata to rush to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" said Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm fine,\" sputtered Ninata. \"Just...some saliva went down the wrong chute is all.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That was a fun little trick you pulled,\" said Ino as she helped the Hyuga stash the stolen Jiraiya dolls. \"And real clever too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ino-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's just one thing I'd like to...no, forget I said anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" said Hinata with a quizzical tilt of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, I know this might sound weird, but,\" Ino trailed off, not really knowing if it would be a good idea to finish her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell me anything, Ino-san,\" said Hinata in that same gentle tone she always spoke in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno sighed. \"Okay...the next time you do anything like that...would it be okay if I got to fondle Ninata for a bit too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno expected a lot of things from the blunette. A slap to the face, a gasp of horror, or a silent glare for even suggesting she lay a hand on her girlfriend. And honestly, Ino wouldn't have blamed her if she did. But she was not prepared at all for the answer she was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mystifying smile curved its way up Hinata's face. \"I don't know if we'll get a chance to do anything like that again today,\" the Hyuga said in an equally cryptic voice. \"But tonight, if you're willing to come to our home, we can see where this goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You're going to try again? How much money are you going to put into that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you, Tenten, there's a trick to this. I've done it before, and I made a nice bundle in the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they waited for Ino and Hinata to catch up to them, the girls were currently busying themselves with a giant slot machine, one that seemed to be designed to look as if it was made out of bamboo. Or at least Sakura was busying herself with it. Tenten stood to the side, looking bored with her arms crossed, and Ninata was simply looking on with amusement at her former teammate's blundering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who woulda' thought Sakura-chan would develop a gambling problem?</i> she silently snickered. <i>Good thing Granny didn't take her as a student, or else they'd both drive the village to bankruptcy.</i> She had been learning a lot about the pinkette since she took on Hinata's form. To Team 7, Sakura always acted like she was above the foibles and eccentricities of her teammates, but looking at how she acted around her own sex, it was clear she was as above them as a hole in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all luck,\" huffed Tenten. \"There's no rhyme or reason to what will show up on those wheels. Give it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wrong. There is a method here,\" said Sakura. \"If you pull the level at the right moment, once you see everything line up just right for one millisecond, you can score a win. Just...like...THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ding-ding-ding!</i> The machine chimed happily as three chibi anime girl faces lined up on the slots and a nice shiny pile of chips began to pour out. Ninata's eyebrows just about grew wings, and she was certain Tenten's had as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELL YEAH!\" cheered Sakura as she pumped a fist triumphantly in the air. Grinning smugly at the brunette, she added. \"So what do you think about THAT, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Sakura-chan,\" said Ninata with a nod of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten rolled her eyes. \"Okay, fine, maybe there is a trick to it,\" she said, though she still sounded doubtful. \"But how did you figure it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a couple months ago. Me and my team went to a gambling town,\" said the girl in the red kimono as she gathered up her winnings. \"I was posing as a civilian and was playing around with one of these things in a casino, just to blend in, when I caught the eye of a handsome gentleman who decided he would explain to the pretty lady just what she needed to do to win. Let's just say that thanks to his helpful tips, I returned home with more than twice what the mission would have paid me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean they actually let you in a place like that, despite how...\" Tenten paused, realizing she had to weigh her words carefully. She had already seen what happened to anyone who alluded to the pinkette's not-so-sizeable chest. For that, Ninata was thankful her kimono hid her and Hinata's breasts. Much as she loved the big creamy fun bags they were both gifted with, she didn't want her pink-haired friend to feel inadequate around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How young you look?\" said Tenten, finishing her question as diplomatically as possible. \"And don't you think it's creepy that some older guy would hit on you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fine,\" said Sakura. \"I used a rather elaborate transformation technique to fool him and everyone into thinking I was older than I really am. In fact, don't you two say anything about this to anyone, but I kind of got the idea for it from Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" said Ninata with a quirked eyebrow. \"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My old teammate was a little perv, and he developed a technique where he would turn himself into a naked girl. Made guys' heads turn seconds before they passed out. I don't know the full story of where he got it from, but he apparently made up the form based on what he'd seen ogling women. I smacked him every time he considered using it, but...it at least gave me a good idea on how to make me look like a mature lady that could capture guys' attention.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Ninata with a wide grin. \"This Naruto had to be devilishly cunning and handsome to develop such a technique!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...had his moments,\" said Sakura, her eyes shifting to the side with uncertainty. \"But any guy who acts like that is doomed to die a virgin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata let out an unamused snort. <i>Big words coming </i>from<i> a virgin. If only you knew what 'Naruto' has been getting into, Sakura-chan.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you at least you have a method to this madness,\" said Tenten. \"Most people who play around with these things don't. I just don't have any respect for the kinds of people who throw all their money away gambling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think I see the Hokage over there,\" said Ninata with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOKAGE? WHERE?!\" Tenten exclaimed as numerous 8x11 glossy photos of Tsunade <i>materialized</i> in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata and Sakura sweatdropped. Tenten always had a serious hero worship of Tsunade, but it was getting more and more manic as of late. She seemed to be amassing a collection of pictures and she was making a habit of carrying them with her at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, you just missed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten's head slumped despondently. \"Damn. I was really hoping to get her autograph. You and Hinata are so lucky; you get to see her just about every week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not as exciting as you think,\" said Ninata. \"It's like getting a checkup from any other doctor. She just pokes and prods us, sticks us with needles, hooks us up to machines and asks all sorts of...personal questions.\" <i>About out sex life.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care!\" said the brunette. \"I'd kill for the chance to be touched by the Hokage. If she ran her hands all over my body, I'd never bathe again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow...she's <b>really</b> got a thing for the old woman. I think Tenten really needs to get herself a girlfriend. Or maybe Hinata-chan and I could help her with...oh no, don't think like that, Ninata-chan! Bad Ninata-chan!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata! Ino!\" cried a gleeful Sakura, who was clearly getting uncomfortable with the turn this conversation had taken and was happy to seize any opportunity to change it. \"It's so good to see you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we miss anything?\" said Ino as she and the blunette approached the trio with a visible skip to her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just won a little bit of money,\" said the pinkette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed the Hokage,\" sulked Tenten, who was pouting like a child who didn't get her ice cream..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeey, nice haul, Sakura! And, uh, sorry to hear that, Tenten,\" said the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenten-san, if you want the Hokage's autograph so much, Ninata and I could just get one from her the next time we see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want her to sign it for me!\" said the black-haired girl with a pout. \"I want to be there when she does it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about Hokage-sama, Tenten-san\" said Hinata gently. \"After all,\" she added in a sultry whisper, stepping closer until her lips were nearly touching the older girl's ear, \"you've got me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten turned red as a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours breezed by without incident. The girls spent that time exploring the village square and sampling the many diversions it had to offer. Oftentimes, they would embark on little competitions with each other to see who was the best at which games. To nobody's surprise, Tenten dominated anything that involved throwing things. Hinata, with her gentle grace, proved to be the most adept with the goldfish scoop. However, Ino surprised everyone when she soundly beat them all at the high striker game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata had to know her secret. \"What kind of jutsu were you doing, and how did they not catch you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wound me, Ninata-chan!\" Ino huffed in mock indignity. \"There's no jutsu involved. I've just been doing a lot of strength training is all. Here, feel my muscles!\" At this, she flexed her bicep and offered it to the transformed Hyuga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata obliged her. Wrapped up in the wide sleeve, it was impossible to see the tone Ino had developed, but the hard muscle rippling underneath was undeniable.. \"Wow,\" she whispered, very impressed. The blonde had always been a real skinny girl back at the academy, but if her arm was anything to go by, she was on her way to becoming a full-on amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you didn't notice. With your eyes, you can see what I look like under my clothes whenever you like!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ninata blushed. \"I-I wouldn't do...that wouldn't be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, no need to be bashful, Ninata-chan,\" said Ino, pinching her cheek playfully. \"If you want to see me naked, you totally can. I don't mind! I've already seen you naked, so it's only fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is anyone else hungry?\" said Ninata, clapping her hands together in an effort to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it,\" said Sakura, \"I'm feeling peckish too. How about we all get lunch, guys? My treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...want to eat <i>here</i>?\" said Ino incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is where I want to eat,\" said Sakura. \"Icharaku's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata grinned nodded with silent approval. Icharaku's was the greatest restaurant in the world, and as far as she was concerned, Konoha's greatest resource. If anyone outside the Land of Fire knew about the succulent taste of its noodles or the masterful talent of Master Teuchi, Konoha would undoubtedly be locked in a never-ending war against the entire world. So of course Sakura would want to eat there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But weren't you always complaining about how Naruto would drag your team over here every chance he had?\" said Ino. \"And how absolutely sick you were of ramen, never wanted to see another bowl of the stuff again, and prayed every night for a meteor to fall down and incinerate\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, you pig!\" cried Sakura, clamping a hand on the blonde's mouth. \"What are you trying to do, make everyone think I'm a heartless bitch? I was just exagger\u2013uh, Ninata, are you crying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't yet, but she was on the verge. Ninata could only stare with misty eyes at the bubblegum-haired girl who over the course of five seconds shattered her heart into a million little pieces. How could Sakura say such horrible things? How could she possibly hate ramen and Icharaku's so much that she'd wish ill upon them? Was everything Ninata thought she knew about Sakura a lie? Could she really call her a friend anymore? Looking at her now, it was like...she was a complete stranger. She knew nothing about this girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear rolled down her cheek. <i>Everything's different. Nothing with Sakura-chan is going to be the same anymore. I don't know if I could possibly...oooh, is that chashu pork?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweet aroma of soy sauce mixed with the spicy iridescent scent of ginger and just enough garlic to give it a kick was unmistakable, as was the rich salty smell of pig belly turning white in the heat. It was enough to make a girl wet...in her mouth of course. Ninata licked her lips hungrily, her depression vanishing in an instant. \"No, I'm fine,\" she said, flicking her tear away disinterestedly. \"Just caught a whiff of some onions is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Eat now, angst later!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if you say so,\" said Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five girls took their seats and their orders from one of the two girls who were currently manning the restaurant. Teuchi and Ayame were nowhere to be seen, but that wasn't unusual. In keeping up with the increased business the holidays brought in, the old man would usually sequester himself in the back of the shop where he could work undisturbed, while the temporary help he hired for the day would handle the customers. Meanwhile, his daughter was probably out and about enjoying the celebrations, as he often let her take holidays off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I admit it,\" said Sakura, picking up from where she left off in her conversation with Ino. \"I did get sick of this place. But now that I don't get dragged here so often anymore...I actually kind of miss it. I miss coming here, hanging with my old team. I miss being trained by Kakashi, even if he was a pretty lousy teacher. And I miss Naruto. So being here...just kind of reminds me of those days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are your orders,\" said a woman as she served each girl their hearty bowls of ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura took a deep breath of the new scents in the air and stole a glance over at Ninata's bowl of miso chashu pork ramen, which was right next to hers. \"Especially that. Of all the ramen in the world, I think that was his favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata split her chopsticks up, trying her damnedest not to look the pinkette in the eye. \"You...don't say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" Sakura sighed wistfully, breathing the scent in again. \"Ahhh...it's just like the dunce is sitting here right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata shifted uncomfortably in her seat. This was not a line of conversation she wanted to pursue or listen to. And from the corner of her vision, she could see Hinata didn't like it either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to go to the bathroom,\" she said, quickly slurping up some noodles. \"Guard my ramen, okay Hinata-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Ninata-chan,\" her twin said with a warm smile. They exchanged a kiss and the boy-turned-girl ambled off for parts unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't really need to use the restroom. She just needed some time to herself for a moment. If she stayed near the girls for too long while they got sentimental about her past self, she didn't know what would happen. Since turning into Hinata and spending so much time with the normally reserved girl, Ninata had been getting a lot better about lengthening the distance between her brain and her mouth, but she still didn't trust that oversized oral cavity with her secrets. If Sakura kept on bemoaning about how much she missed Naruto, then it was only a matter of time before Ninata blurted out something she'd regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata sighed. She hated having to keep this transformation of hers a secret. She wished she could just tell everyone that she was Naruto and get on with her life already. She wanted to say the whole story about Hinata's yin and yang chakra splitting up was a load of BS, that she had no idea how she transformed, no idea how she could change back, but was happy with it regardless. But she couldn't, not yet. It wasn't safe for her if so many people knew, and it wouldn't be safe for them either. So for the good of everyone, she had to stay quiet, no matter how much it frustrated her. Or hurt Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a chill ran up Ninata's spine. Someone was watching her. Giving a cursory glance all around, the former boy found herself looking directly into the wide lavender eyes of a fellow Hyuga across the street. It was a little girl around Konohamaru's age, possibly younger, with chocolate-brown hair cut into a bob, a plain grey kimono, and a stick of dango in her hand. Ninata would say she appeared pretty cute all things considered...if it didn't look like her eyes were boring deep into her soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hello,\" said Ninata with a slight wave of her hand. The girl didn't grace her with a response. She just continued to stand there, staring at Ninata with an unreadable expression. Her gaze did not shift even as people passed by between them. \"Is there something on my face?\" the former boy asked as she stepped closer to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not Hinata,\" said the young Hyuga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata blinked. That was not the answer she was expecting. \"I...never said that I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? And why do you look like Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ninata. And I'm...her clone, you could say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clone?\" said the girl, taking a bite out of her dango.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Her Yin chakra split from her Yang chakra, and formed...me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl didn't look convinced. \"Your chakra looks normal to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's what happened!\" said Ninata, who was really starting to feel the urge to punt the brat across the village. \"Ask the Hokage herself if you're so curious. And who the hell are you to start questioning who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Hanabi,\" said the girl. \"Hinata's sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Ohhhhh! So this was her girlfriend's little sister. Hinata mentioned her, but never really talked about her much. This was the first time Ninata ever saw her. \"Well then, a <i>pleasure</i> to meet you, Hanabi,\" she said with as much artificial pep as she could force between her teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi responded by just taking another bite from her dango stick, eating what remained of the dough ball. This experience was clearly not very pleasurable to her either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata groaned with annoyance. Was this going to go anywhere, or did this kid get her kicks out of wasting other people's time? \"Do you have something you want to tell me?\" she said, crossing her arms in a way she hoped would make her look authoritative despite her small delicate frame. \"Or to your other sister, Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly the girl's expression changed. Her eyes shifted away from Ninata's, her head turned to the side, her mouth curved downward into a frown, and she looked...almost sad. \"No,\" she answered in what could only be called a quiet mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. See you,\" said Ninata, thankful that this awkward encounter was finally reaching its end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Hanabi called out just as Ninata started to walk away. The former boy turned to give her a questioning look. The little girl shifted uncomfortable on her feet, staring off to the side to avoid her \"older sister's\" gaze and actually acting like her age for once. After a moment of awkward silence, Hanabi finally shut her eyes and extended her hand out, offering the last couple balls of dango she had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...want me to take this?\" Ninata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi gave her a very small nod, so slight that Ninata had a hard time telling she even moved at all. It honestly reminded her of Hinata when she tried to offer Ninata medicine after her duel with Kiba back in the Chuunin exams. <i>Guess I'm starting to see the family resemblance.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...alright. Thank you, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi merely nodded again as Ninata plucked the stick from her hand. Then without another word of acknowledgment, she scurried away, disappearing into the crowd of festival goers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" Ninata mumbled as she took a bite of dango. \"Weird kid.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...but by the time she got there, the whole place had burned down, and she no longer had a stitch of clothing to her name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm-hm-hm-hm-hm!\" Hinata slapped a palm on her mouth to keep the loud guffaw from escaping. She couldn't take this much longer; she had to suppress so much laughter over the past 15 minutes that it hurt. If Ino told one more story, her ailing lungs were very likely to burst into flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH-HA HA HA HA!\" <i>Ffffshhhhh!</i> \"Ahhhh! What the hell?!\" Meanwhile, Sakura had just learned the hard way that she was not capable of such restraint. \"Ewwww, I think noodles just sprayed out of my nose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was happy. While Ninata went to get away from the uncomfortable conversation that was ensuing, the blunette was able to steer things to more pleasant subjects. And more importantly, Hinata was able to ask the rest of her girlfriends the question she had been mulling over in her head all day. And the answers she got so far were very promising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm back,\" said Ninata as she slid onto her stool. \"I take it my ramen is...uh, Sakura-chan, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dun wanna tok aboud id,\" she huffed, furiously wiping her nose with a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just telling everyone here how my first B-rank mission went,\" said Ino, who was sitting on the other side of Hinata. \"And Sakura laughed so hard, noodles blasted out of her nose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sed I dun wanna tok aboud id, pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Ninata said, bursting out into laughter. \"I've done that with milk before but...hee hee hee! That's so gross! You better not have gotten any of that in my bowl, Sakura-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Ninata-chan,\" said Hinata as she planted a kiss on her twin's cheek while Sakura mumbled some indistinct biting remarks in the former-boys direction. \"I bravely protected your ramen from the...the fires of the dreaded pink dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata clasped her hands on the center of her chest in an exaggerated feminine gesture. \"Oh! My heroine,\" she giggled, swooning happily into her lover's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, ha, ha, very funny,\" muttered the unamused pinkette as she finished cleaning herself up. \"What is this? 'Pick On Sakura Day?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh course not,\" said Ino, whose face looked to be made entirely of teeth. \"Since we started doing it on this specific day, it's 'Pick On Sakura <b>Year</b>!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to tell me this story, Ino,\" said Ninata as she started to gather some noodles in her chopsticks. \"But not now. Wouldn't want to waste good ramen. Oh, by the way Hinata-chan, Hanabi says 'hi.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's heart froze up. That...was not a name she expected\u2013or wanted\u2013to hear today. \"You...saw my sister?\" she whispered, setting her chopsticks down on the counter, her stomach suddenly feeling very full right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Uh, she seemed a little troubled though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She would be</i>, Hinata thought with a frown. Hinata led a life of constant disappointment. She disappointed her father for not being the firstborn he wanted. She disappointed the clan elders for not being the strong leader they needed. She disappointed Neji for being born to a position she did not deserve, and for being the reason his father had to die. She disappointed her instructor, Kurenai, for her poor performance in missions, as well as her teammates for failing them when they were depending on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata made peace with those disappointments. Kurenai was forgiving, and Kiba and Shino were understanding. It took her time to realize it, but they never hated her for failing. And those that did, the Hyuga clan...ever since she emancipated herself from the compound to live with Ninata (by the Hokage's orders, of course), she just stopped caring what they thought anymore. If they didn't think she was worth their time, then they weren't worth hers either. And she didn't miss a single one of them, not the ways they looked away from her dismissively, or shook their heads whenever she did something they disapproved of. If anything, their disregard for her was a blessing in disguise; when no one expects anything of you, there's no need to impress them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut disappointing Hanabi...that was something that still gnawed at Hinata. She remembered their fateful duel, she remembered how eager and excited her little firework was to tussle with her big sister. Hinata bit down on her lower lip. She also remembered the shock on the child's face when Hinata went down seemingly without a fight. She remembered the look of bewildered realization that the bigger, older and more experienced girl was such an incompetent ninja. And she especially remembered the days of silence that followed, the child's refusal to look her in the eye, and the mornings where Hinata would wake up without the little bundle of Hanabi's tiny form cuddling next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the first time Hinata truly began to understand loneliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata-chan?\" Hinata was shaken from her thoughts by the delicate hand of her double waving inches from her face. \"You alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Oh, yes. Yes. I'm...I'm fine,\" Hinata stammered, darting her gaze away from Ninata. \"Perfectly fine.\" She dabbed at her face as she spoke, wiping away the sensation of wetness growing in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the corner of her vision, she saw Ino lower her brows with suspicion. \"Are you sure? You kind of spaced out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm fine!\" Hinata snapped. Her voice cracked like a whip, and all the girls present recoiled as if it struck them. Hinata flinched too. She raised her voice so rarely that it just sounded so wrong coming out of her lips. It was something she'd never get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hush fell over the group. Everyone fidgeted around uncomfortably, looking like they had something to say, but couldn't find it in themselves to be the first to break the silence. Blushing deeply, Hinata sank into her seat, knowing it was all because of her. And though it shamed her to fall back into old habits, the only thing she could think about was how much she wanted the ground to swallow her up right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Ninata finally spoke. \"Did...did something happen between you and Hanabi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Hinata was not going to cry. She was not going to bawl like a child, not today. Squeezing her eyes tight to block the oncoming tears, Hinata took a deep breath, exhaled, and breathed in deep again. She felt the palpitations in her chest slow down, and for that, she exhaled again with relief, knowing she had successfully calmed herself for the time being. She opened her eyes. They were wet and her vision was misty, but Hinata was at least confident that she wouldn't start crying if she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...don't have to say anything. If you don't want to,\" said Sakura, who wore a look of complete understanding on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shook her head. \"Yes, something did happen between imouto and I. I...I will tell you what it was, when I'm ready, Ninata-chan. But not now. Someday, but not today. I just...ask that you forget about it for now. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata nodded with understanding. \"Okay. I understand, Hinata-chan. And I'm sorry for bringing it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Ninata-chan,\" said Hinata wiping the moisture out of her eyes. \"You...\" she paused uneasily, realizing what had happened. She and her girlfriend had just touched on a subject that by all rights, they both should have known, but that Ninata had just revealed she clearly didn't. That put them into a delicate situation as far as the rest of the girls were concerned. She needed to measure her words carefully, or else she'd give the game away and start exposing the lie to her friends. \"You weren't there.\" That seemed to be a safe enough thing to say, and it was completely true..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls returned to their food, slurping up their noodles in awkward silence. \"So, Hinata,\" said Ino, clearly trying to get some conversation going, \"is that thing we talked about off now, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shook her head. \"No, unless you want it to be. I still want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What thing?\" asked Ninata, glancing at the two girls. \"What's going on?\" Suddenly, a realization dawned on her. \"And where did Tenten go? She hadn't been here since I got back and her ramen's getting cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here,\" said the black-haired girl, appearing seemingly out of nowhere to slip back into her stool. \"I needed to go...get something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What?\" said Ninata as her eye fell down onto the shopping bag the older girl was carrying. \"Is that a book you've got there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing important!\" said Tenten in an embarrassed tone that was unbecoming of her. \"Just eat your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, wait, I can make it out with my Byakugan. 'Everything You Wanted to Know About Sleepovers (But Were Too Afraid to Ask)?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Shut up, Ninata!\" the brunette hissed, her face turning red as a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, Tenten's never been to a sleepover before?\" Ino giggled. \"Don't worry, it's not that hard. We'll go nice and slow for you, let you ease into how us girls have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it your answer is yes then, Tenten-san?\" said Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older girl sighed, completely defeated. \"Yes, it's a yes. I just...never did one of these before, okay? So I thought I'd do a little reading in advance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will someone tell me what's going on here?\" said Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I invited Ino-san, Tenten-san and Sakura-san to come spend the night with us,\" said Hinata. \"As one last celebration of the new year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALL of them?\" Ninata cried, completely blanched. \"But, but...Hinata-chan, we can't...how are we going to...y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata giggled at her twin. Oh, Ninata looked so cute when she was confused. It warmed her heart to know just how innocent her girlfriend still was, even after all their many nights together. \"Don't worry about it, Ninata-chan. We'll handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...if you say so.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a magical day for the five young kunoichi as they toured the village, sampled the fine sugary cuisine, and enjoyed the festivities. As the sun set and night fell, it all came to a close with a grand firework show that lit the sky up with brilliantly-hued flowers of flame. Another year had passed for Konoha, one of the toughest in recent memory, but the village endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the celebrations wrapping up, it was now time for everyone to go home. But Ino, Sakura and Tenten wouldn't be going to their homes just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, this is so exciting!\" said Ino as she eagerly rubbed her hands in anticipation. \"It's been so long since I got to do anything like this. Just a night in with us girls, and no adults to tell us what to do! Ohhh, it'll be like we're kids again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there, Ino,\" said Sakura. \"We still haven't confirmed if that that yogurt soda you drank wasn't spiked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Sakura, I am <i>not</i> drunk! It was just clumsiness that caused me to roll down that flight of stairs, thank you very much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ino and Sakura bickered, and Tenten was fervently reading her book to figure out all the ins and outs of girls sleeping together in one room, Ninata was a little less certain. \"Hinata-chan, are you sure this is a good idea having everyone together in one place? What if we can't...hold it in all night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata only gently smiled at her. \"I told you, Ninata-chan, it'll be fine. We'll manage. Just don't think about it and relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but I can't relax! You know how we get! And I don't know what to do on a sleepover either! I'm clueless, and Tenten won't let me look at her book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata placed a reassuring hand on her twin's shoulder. \"Just do what you always do, Ninata-chan. Follow my lead, and you'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll...I'll try,\" Ninata stammered, though the fidgeting with her purse showed she wasn't convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me take that,\" said Hinata. \"In my experience, full hands only make you more nervous. And try not to clasp them. Just let them swing naturally at your side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" Ninata nodded with understanding, handed her purse over to her double, and walked on ahead, taking a few deep breaths to calm her fraying nerves. Hinata took this time to fall behind her, just to take one last moment to admire her beautiful girlfriend's form. She looked positively enchanting in her kimono, elegant and ladylike in a way she'd never imagined, and under the illumination of the moon, she almost seemed to glow. To think, only a few months ago, Ninata had been a rambunctious blonde boy with an admittedly poor sense of fashion. It was nearly impossible to imagine that he would eventually turn into this, the perfect embodiment of feminine grace. It boggled Hinata's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as much as the thought that Hinata would use such terms to describe herself. <i>How many girls would improve their self-image if they just had a twin to love them as I have?</i> Not for the first time in weeks, the born-Hyuga considered herself the luckiest girl in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as gorgeous as Ninata looked in her fancy traditional garb, Hinata much preferred how she looked in <i>another</i> kind of outfit. And seeing the way her girlfriend was walking now, her hips swaying as much as they could in that silky wrapping held in place with only a single strip of cloth, Hinata really wanted to see her girlfriend \"in\" it right now. And more than that, she wanted everyone else to see Ninata in her best \"dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling back to where Ino, Sakura and Tenten were lined up, the born-Hyuga gave each of them a light pat to get their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Ino asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh.\" She fell silent when Hinata put a finger to her lips with one hand, and used the other to point quietly at Ninata, who was taking some deep breaths to try and coax herself into relaxation. Gracefully, the blunette sidled up to her double, moving with such light footsteps so as to not make a sound, took the knot of her obi in hand, and very carefully began to untie it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deep breaths, Ninata. Deep breaths,\" the former boy mumbled, completely oblivious to her girlfriend's mischief. As she always was, bless her kind heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fancy knot was loosened, and with a gentle pull, Hinata was able to take it off. The born-Hyuga had to cover her mouth to stifle her giggle. Ninata had no clue what was going on behind her, no idea that that she now had a captive audience of four very young and attractive girls, and that the only thing between her and the world was getting progressively looser with every step she took. Hinata watched as more folds and creases spread across the silk garment, as the cloth swayed further and further into the air, and as the area around Ninata's chest grew wider until she was quite certain her twin's breasts were no longer being covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalling a bit of silk into her hands, Hinata gave it a very light, featherlike tug, so slight it hardly looked like she moved at all. And without missing a beat, Ninata stepped out of her kimono and into the cool night air, naked as a newborn.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ninata couldn't put her finger on it, but she suddenly felt...lighter somehow. One moment, she had been all tightly wound up. The next, she was completely boundless and...free. It was mystifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Hinata was right. Perhaps she had just been fretting too much. Why should a whole bunch of girls coming over mess anything up for either of them? If she and Hinata wanted to have sex, they would. They were ninjas, they knew how to be stealthy! They could always take a nice long bath or shower together to do their thing, and with some properly-placed seals, ensure they wouldn't make any noise. Or maybe Hinata would get a kinky idea, and they'd both steal away into the night and make love somewhere outside? Ninata shivered in delight at the thought. It wouldn't be the first time, and cool night air always felt delightful on her naked skin. And now that all her anxieties had been cast aside, it was like she was running around wearing nothing at all right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former blonde resisted the urge to rub her thighs together. Now was not the time to get herself hot thinking sexy thoughts; she didn't have any panties on after all, and her friends would definitely notice if they saw anything dripping down there. It just wouldn't be appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata swiftly but silently retreated back to her friends, stifling her giggles the entire time as she held Ninata's kimono up in a bundle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" whispered an awestruck Tenten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know,\" said Hinata with a not-so-innocent shrug, \"just easing Ninata-chan of some...burdens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls watched the blunette as she walked, naked save for her dress sandals. Under the moonlight, her normally alabaster flesh glowed an ethereal silver, which especially helped to bring out the contours outlining the muscles in her body. The gentle indent of her back. The shifting ripples of her shoulder blades. The dark cleft between her buttocks, full, round, heart-like, and tantalizingly jiggling ever so slightly as they swayed back and forth with her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was immensely amused, her hands clasping her mouth as she literally fought tooth and nail to keep her laughs from getting out. \"She...she doesn't notice...d-d-does she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata simply shook her head as she took in the lovely sight before her. \"No. She doesn't. She never does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno, meanwhile, was completely transfixed. \"Wow,\" she all but mouthed with her lips. \"You get...to see <i>that</i>...all the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm,\" Hinata nodded, feeling an odd sense of smugness about her. \"Every day. Every night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So lucky,\" the blonde mumbled, pouting in jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten clapped her book shut, her expression enigmatic, as if she was trying to decide whether she should laugh at Ninata's obliviousness to her nudity, or burn the image of her naked moonlit form to memory. \"Beautiful,\" she whispered, her voice dropping to an uncharacteristically feminine whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA breeze picked up. For Hinata, Ino, Tenten and Sakura, it caused their kimonos to flutter up in the air. But for the sole naked girl among them, it prompted her to turn slightly into it, arching her back with a moan of pleasure as the cool air washed over her body. The act made her spread her legs apart, giving the four clothed girls a deeper look between them and at the bare womanly slit within, as well as a preview of what awaited them on the front, as they could now make out curve of her breast jutting up to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is it just me, or did anyone else feel a chill just now?\" Ninata suddenly asked, spinning around to face her girlfriends, her breasts jiggling sideways in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gagged at the sudden shock of movement, and very nearly fell on her butt. \"I-I-I have no idea what you're talking about, Ninata-chan!\" she cried as she desperately hid the kimono behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata tilted her head to the side quizzically. \"Oh, don't tell me you're now starting to feel nervous, Hinata-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I'm fine, Ninata-chan! Really!\" Hinata chuckled nervously. She was starting to understand how Ninata must have felt every time an adult caught her pulling a prank in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Ninata began to walk towards them, her breasts bobbing up and down the whole time. How she failed to notice that sensation was a mystery to all the girls present, with the possibly exception of Sakura of course. \"I can see you're blushing, even in this light. You can't fool my Hyuga eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's absolutely nothing to worry about,\" said Tenten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah!\" said Ino, as she wiped off a few stray droplets of drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata approached Hinata, coming in so close that her body pressed against her girlfriend's silk-wrapped form. Close enough so that her <i>breasts</i> pressed into her girlfriend's silk-wrapped form. How they flattened and bulged against her twin escaped nobody's notice. Placing a hand on her cheek, the former boy said: \"You feel awfully warm. Maybe we should call it off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Hinata, Ino and Tenten all shouted at once. The reaction startled the concerned naked girl, who stumbled back in surprise, which only caused her lovely lady mounds to bounce around some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry, Ninata-chan,\" stammered the nervous Hyuga. She was walking on a tightrope about now, and if she said or did the wrong thing, she'd be busted. \"Ino-san just told a really funny pants-down story is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did?\" said Ino, whose eyes were clearly drawn to Ninata's boobs. She could clearly see that her nipples, shining blue in the moon, were very hard and erect. \"Er, I mean, I did! Of course. If you heard it, you'd be blushing too. It was so embarrassing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata pouted at her, which made her angelic face look absolutely adorable. \"How come I'm always out of earshot whenever you tell your stories? Make sure to let me hear it sometime, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course, Ninata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four girls all stood in awed silence at the naked girl standing before them. She was so close, brushing her bare skin against their garbs. And she didn't even realize it! It took all of Hinata's willpower to not just hug her girlfriend and run her hands over every square of delectable female flesh, lest she reveal to how bare and beholden Ninata was. From out of the corner of her eye, she could see Sakura completely red in the face, looking about ready to burst from laughter. And she could see the hands of Ino and Tenten, reaching forward to get a touch, if not a taste, of what Hinata got to enjoy. Every. Single. Night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA subtle kick to their shins was all she needed to get them under control. They'd get their chance to touch Ninata's flesh soon. Just not now. Ino retracted her hand just fine, but Tenten dropped her book which, with a little help from the wind, blew a ways down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it,\" said Ninata as she scurried away after it, letting her friends get a lovely view of her wiggling derriere. She then gave them all an even greater view when she reached the fallen object, bending over and letting everyone present get a very good look at her butt, the slightly parted lips of her vulva, and a faint glimmer of something in there that was threatening to just drip out. Hinata took a deep breath through her nostrils; she could almost smell the heavenly scent of her lover's essence just now. And she could see both her blonde and brunette friend were utterly transfixed by the show Ninata was inadvertently giving them. That was good. She wanted them to be impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura, meanwhile, was starting to look a little uncomfortable. She didn't have any laughs to hold back now, but her gaze was turned in such a way to avoid looking at Ninata. Seeing a girl naked was clearly one thing for the pinkette, but getting a firsthand look at her more intimate parts was way too much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We'll need to work extra hard on her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer task done, Ninata got up and ran back to the group, her boobs wobbling playfully all the way. \"Here you go, Tenten. Uh, why're you all looking at me like that? Is there something on my face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there's nothing,\" giggled Hinata. \"There's nothing on you...your face. Nothing at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, if you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued walking on in silence, Ninata just ahead of everyone else, which was fine as far as Hinata, Ino and Tenten were concerned. The blonde and brunette's eyes were glued to the nude blunette's shapely rear, and there were a lot of girlish giggles to be had from everyone present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Hinata?\" whispered Sakura. \"How long are you going to keep this up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as it takes, Sakura-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She won't be mad at you for this, will she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" said Hinata. \"I didn't do anything at all! The kimono just slipped off her. You won't tell her otherwise, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no, no, I won't,\" said Sakura. \"Don't get me wrong, this is really funny, it's just...is she <i>always</i> this clueless?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said,\" grinned Hinata, \"Ninata-chan is just very bad about wearing clothes. Ask her yourself, if you like. She'll tell you the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Ninata spoke up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Our apartment's up ahead. I hope you girls don't mind sleeping on futons because that's all we have as far as bedding goes. Hinata-chan, can you get the door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said Hinata. She shoved the kimono she was holding into a surprised Sakura's arms and went to unlock their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone stepped into the apartment amidst a chorus of delighted chortles at the oblivious Ninata's expense, the still bare girl stretched out. \"Whew! I'm glad to be back in here. Now to get out of this kimono. It's nice and all, but I have to say, it's not really good at keeping the chilly air out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pawed at her garb, but the only thing the former boy felt was bare skin. Confused, she looked down, saw two lovely female breasts swaying beneath her, and realized the cold, hard truth. \"EEEK! I'M NAKED!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone burst into laughter as the naked Hyuga fell to her knees to cover herself up. While Sakura and Tenten were able to find a soft couch to safely collapse on, Ino had no choice but to fall on the tatami floor, clutching her sides in mirth. Only Hinata kept her poise, standing tall in the middle of the room, hand covering her face as she giggled devilishly like a noblewoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't funny, guys!\" Ninata cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yes it is!\" cackled Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it isn't!\" said Ninata with a pout and a blush. \"What if somebody saw me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, heh, heh...why do you care so much?\" said Tenten. \"You didn't seem to mind running around naked in the woods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was...distracted. By more important things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then distract yourself like this, Ninata-chan,\" said Hinata as she knelt down to her naked twin and placed a comforting hand on her bare shoulder. \"Set up the futons while I prepare some tea for out guests.\" Edging closer, she added, with a sensuous lick on Ninata's earlobe: \"And don't put anything on. Let everyone enjoy you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata demonstrated that full-bodied blushes were a real thing, and sheepishly pushed herself up at her girlfriend's command with a whimper. As she stood up, Hinata let her hands trail along her double's form. She ran a delicate finger along her collar, traced the side of a creamy breast, cupped it gently, and gave it a nice squeeze. Rewarded by a startled moan from her lover, Hinata let go and continued running her hand down Ninata's body, letting her fingers trail the circumference of her twin's breast before flattening them against her bare stomach. She pressed firmly as the flesh slid against her fingertips, soft to the touch, but firm with well-toned muscles underneath that were invisible to the naked eye. As Ninata's body began to curve outward, forming that wondrous hourglass figure her maturing body was developing, Hinata molded her hands along her lover's hips and gently massaged the skin as her digits found their way to the creamy globes of Ninata's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata moaned again and shuddered as her girlfriend's fingers dug into her sensitive flesh. Hinata in turn smiled as her hands shook with her girlfriend's vibrations. She would never grow tired of her twin's lovely derriere. Ever. She could just hold it forever. Alas, Ninata was almost completely on her feet now, and they both had things to do. Loosening her hold on the round, fleshy orbs, Hinata ran her hands down the length of her double's legs, giving her calves, hardened from months of intense exercise, a tender squeeze each, and hooked her fingers into the heels of Ninata's sandals. Hinata pulled them off as Ninata stepped away, removing the last things her double was wearing and leaving her naked as the day she was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The way she should be.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nodding in satisfaction, and stealing one last glance at her twin's sumptuous rear end as it sashayed away, the blunette sauntered off to the kitchen, confident that her guests would be entertained while she made their tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno's eyes never left Ninata's form as she did her work, pulling the futons and quilts out of the closet and preparing them for the night in her birthday suit. She was blushing like mad, and every time it looked like the redness would start to subside, her eyes would meet Ino's, Sakura's or Tenten's, the girl would remember she had a captive audience, and every inch of her pale skin would turn cherry-red all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite her obvious embarrassment, she made no efforts to dress or cover herself. All because Hinata told her not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hinata's got that girl in the palm of her hands.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange how much of a difference a few months made. Ino knew of Hinata when they were kids in the academy, but she never really <i>knew</i> her. She was just that quiet little girl with the weird eyes who always seemed to be staring off into the distance. Who would have thought that underneath that demure exterior lurked a cunning and mischievous mind? It was a good thing she and Naruto never joined forces, or else they would have been unstoppable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't Hinata's mind that interested the blonde; it was the body she and her double sported. Ever since she saw the twins running around the woods butt naked, her nights were filled with the image of their bare forms in her head, and her fingers in her pussy. She masturbated over Hinata and Ninata. Hell, she experienced her first ever orgasm because of them! But imagining was not enough for her. Ino wanted to touch Ninata, run her hands over her perfect skin again, just as she had when she possessed her in the woods. Became her. Experienced what it was like to be in her natural state in the natural world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And tonight...I just might!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata shivered when she felt a hand graze her back. Ino was getting very touchy-feely with her. Not that the blunette could fault her. Hinata had the former boy sitting on her lap on the couch, with Ino to the left, Tenten to the right, and Sakura on the far right, making things awfully cramped. It was all but impossible for someone to not touch Ninata, though she had the distinct impression that Ino's groping wasn't exactly accidental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a baby,\" the blonde whispered as she ran another hand down Ninata's back, giving the still naked blunette another shiver. The boy-turned-girl really should have told her friend to knock it off already, but...hell, she didn't want to. As embarrassed as she was to have her bare-ass naked body touched by a girl who wasn't Hinata, Ninata would be lying if she said she didn't like the attention. She was a sucker for cute girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten, however, she didn't know what to think of. The older kunoichi was eying her body up and down, and making no effort to mask it. Ninata supposed she couldn't blame her either; naked people were just naturally attention-getting. If Tenten was sitting naked next to her, Ninata would have gawked too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder if she likes what she's seeing?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Hinata, what's in this tea?\" Sakura asked as she took a sip from her cup. \"It tastes sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sweetness comes from the marigold flower petals I blended into it,\" said Hinata as she lightly stroked her girlfriend's stomach, running a finger delicately along the V-shaped contour of her groin, edging ever closer to Ninata's own 'petals.'. \"And the slices of peach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tickled Ninata's mound lightly, causing the naked girl to involuntarily laugh and wiggle in her grasp. Her back brushed into Ino, who hummed appreciatively at the touch, her breast pressed against Hinata's cheek, sparking a small laugh from the girl as the nipple prodded onto her face, and her legs spread wide open, presenting everyone with everything she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your vagina's so pretty,\" Tenten whispered in a faraway voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer comment sparked a flurry of reactions from everyone. Sakura let out a startled cough as her tea suddenly went down the wrong way in her throat. Ino murmured an intrigued \"Oh?\" Ninata, predictably, clamped her legs shut with a squeak. Hinata giggled with amusement. And Tenten, suddenly remembering where she was, what she was doing, and that she was talking out loud, slapped a hand over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what I meant was...I was going to say, uh...damn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's laughed kindly and squeezed her friend's shoulder reassuringly. \"It's okay Tenten-san. Ninata-chan has a very pretty vagina indeed. You should enjoy it while you can. It's why she has it out after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata wanted to protest, but Hinata shut her up when she ran a dainty finger down along the groove of her sex, causing the naked girl to tremble and squeak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is very pretty,\" said Ino. \"The smoothie look goes very well for her. Ninata, how do you get it? Do you shave or wax?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata blushed. Why did everyone have to be so focused on her pussy right now? \"Er, well, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither,\" said Hinata. \"Ninata-chan and I are naturally hairless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you two have all the luck,\" huffed Ino. \"Shaving can be such a pain. But on the other hand, I guess it means you don't get to do something like...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped up, put her teacup down on the floor, grabbed the front panels of her kimono, and pulled them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura could only slap her forehead in exasperation. \"Oh, kami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, everyone else could only stare transfixed at the lovely sight before them. Ino was giving everybody a full frontal view of her lovely mound, as well as the blond bush that was trimmed in the shape of a flower, her slit as its stem and its petals spiraling in a circle above her <i>other</i> petals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty cool, huh?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata smiled and nodded in silent approval. Tenten looked on with eyes the size of saucers. And Ninata...Ninata could only squirm around uncomfortably. She was hot and bothered enough after prancing around naked in front of her friends for so long, but seeing Ino bottomless with her stylized bush was just...just...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a faint squelching sound between her legs. And so did Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it too, don't you Ninata-chan?\" she whispered huskily into her ear. \"You don't need to say anything. I can tell.\" And with her usual sense of grace, Hinata scooped her naked twin up in her arms, and carried her bridal style to the futons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, what are you doing?\" the former boy cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see, Ninata-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she set her nude twin down on one of the beds, she heard a slightly miffed Ino call out: \"Hey, don't pull the entertainment away like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not,\" said Hinata. \"We're just moving on to the encore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-encore?\" cried Ninata. \"What encore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this where we play spin the bottle?\" said Tenten as she scurried over with perhaps a bit more eagerness than she intended to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost,\" said Hinata as she looked the brunette's kimono-clad body up and down and resisted the urge to lick her lips. \"But not quite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the couch, Sakura sighed. \"Okay, seriously guys. This was fun for a while, but don't you think it's gone a little too far now? I think Ninata would really like to be decent again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninata-chan is fine,\" said Hinata as she knelt behind her naked twin, who was sitting on her knees on a futon. She wrapped her arms around the girl in such a way to make her impressively-sized bust jut out. \"Ninata-chan may not admit it, but she likes the attention. She likes to be naked. Don't you, Ninata-chan? Don't you like to be naked and exposed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I,\" Ninata stammered. Did she like to be naked? Well, yeah, after she transformed into Hinata. She liked the feminine body with all its smooth curves, and now that she had one herself that was especially attractive, she liked to look at and admire it aplenty. But she also enjoyed all the various sensations that being naked brought. She loved the feeling of the wind washing across her bare skin, and the rush of air as it blew into her sensitive inner folds. She loved how things felt on her butt when she sat on them, how soil and cloth alike rearranged itself to mold itself within the contours of her cleft. She loved the unrestrained jiggle of her breasts as she moved whenever she wasn't practicing the arts of Zenrajutsu. She loved practicing Zenrajutsu itself under Kurenai's tutelage and a part of her couldn't wait for the time when she would put it to practical use. And all things considered, her current nude situation wasn't anything unusual; Ninata seldom ever wore anything at home nowadays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most of all, Ninata loved lesbian sex. Making love to Hinata was her favorite thing to do in the whole world. More than playing games, more than pulling pranks, more than growing flowers, more than eating ramen. She loved how her double spanked, groped and held her ass, flicked and licked her nipples, massaged her womanhood with every body part she could imagine, fingers, toes, tongue, breast, clit, and the electric tingles it invoked in her body before her loins burst in a watery explosion of gynic ecstasy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd clothing simply had no place in that activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she breathed. \"I love it...I love to be naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata pulled her closer, squeezing the girl's bare back against her chest. \"Do you like the touch of a woman, Ninata-chan? Do you like the feeling of a girl's hand kneading your delicate skin?\" To accentuate this, she lowered a hand down to Ninata's firm stomach, lovingly stroking the firm muscles as she trailed her way down to her twin's open and most assuredly moist sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Ninata. And she jumped as she felt a finger slide along the cleft of her rump, tickling the baby-smooth flesh within. \"Yes! I love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno and Tenten took a seat in front of her, their eyes focused on her body with laser-guided fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's voice sank to a whisper so sensual it almost dripped with vaginal wetness. \"And would you like...to feel the hands of another girl on your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean\u2013\" said Tenten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" gasped the excited Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata looked at her two friends. And they looked back at her with wonder, curiosity and lust. At her slender neck that begged to be marked. At her ripe and supple melons that jittered with every shallow breath she took. At her rosy nipples erect with needle-like sharpness. At the little indent of her navel on her slender abdomen, so cute and fae-like in how small and innocent it made her look. At her blooming pink rose, dripping with sweet-smelling nectar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wanted her. Ino and Tenten desired her, Hyuga Ninata, once Uzumaki Naruto, in a way no girl ever had before, besides Hinata. And right now, she desired them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would,\" said Hinata as she gave her a tender kiss on the lip. Then turning to her friends, she added: \"Take her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were on her in an instant. Ino had one hand on Ninata's stomach and another on her collar, while Tenten was busy exploring her right thigh and her chest, just underneath her boob. And from behind her, Hinata was rubbing her back and shoulders with both her sensual fingers, as well as her silk-bound chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So soft,\" whispered Ino. Her hand strayed low, squishing into the expansive and bouncy flesh of Ninata's breast that molded itself like clay between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does feel like a baby,\" said Tenten. She slipped her hand up, cupping Ninata's other boob and brushing her hardened tit with her finger. It elicited a full-body shudder from the naked girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm.\" Ninata could only murmur. Six hands were exploring her body. Stroking that muscle, tightening that other one, tickling that stretch of skin. A hand cupped her boob, another squeezed her thigh, gentle fingers massaged her tense shoulders, a palm rubbed against her abdomen, all at once, all at the same time. And then, two mounds of something large, warm, squishy and familiar began to rub against her bare back, flowing into its delicate contours like syrup. So many sensations were going on at once, it was impossible to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lavender eyes met Ino's pale-blue orbs. They were glimmering with joy and hunger. All for her, Ninata. The blonde liked the feeling of Ninata's body. And Ninata liked her touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss her,\" Hinata whispered, though the former boy couldn't tell if she was talking to her or to Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it mattered, for Ino was quick to oblige, pushing forward so that her lips would capture Ninata's. Ninata did not resist. She parted her lips and let the blonde descend upon her, welcoming her tongue inside. Ino lightly pinched her lips with her own, as if trying to lock the blunette in place as she explored her mouth. She prodded at her teeth, tasted her gums, and coiled wetly around Ninata's own tongue. It was different from all the kisses she had shared with Hinata in the past, faster and more eager, but it was still as hot and wet as a kiss from one girl to another should be. And the girls' constant kneading and caressing of Ninata's naked flesh never once stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Ino pulled away, breathing heatedly on Ninata's lips as she looked deeply into her eyes with full satisfaction. \"My very first kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, mine too,\" said Tenten to the side. Hinata must have tended to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm honored.\" Ninata struggled to get the words out. Her mind was still reeling. It was hard for her to think, with all the roaming hands touching, feeling, groping, squeezing and loving her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft hands pushed down on her shoulders, gently but firmly forcing her onto her back. \"Lay her down,\" said Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata did not resist. She flattened her form down on the futon at her love and her friends' urging, vulnerable and completely exposed to all of them. She stared upward, saw the want in their eyes, heard it in their breaths. They desired her. Never once in all her years did Ninata ever imagine she would be an object of desire for so many girls at once. It was a fantasy so many boys and men imagined, but she was one of the few who would ever get to experience it for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And I only had to become a girl like Hinata to do it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then her eyes roamed down to see that Hinata's kimono was open and her breasts were spilling out. Great big creamy orbs that seemed larger than anything she had ever seen before in her life, at least at this angle. And she wanted them. Oh Kami, how she wanted them. Ninata raised her trembling hands upward, hoping to roll the soft and gooey girl flesh between her fingers, when Hinata then took hold of her wrists and lowered them back to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata whimpered in protest. It wasn't fair! They got to touch her, so why couldn't she have something in return? Hinata's bosoms were close, hanging just centimeters above her, and Ninata couldn't...she struggled feebly to reach them, opening and closing her mouth in a weak attempt to capture the pink nubs of her nipples, hard and erect, in her mouth. But it was no use. They were just...out of...reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata giggled as her girlfriend struggled and writhed in her grasp, jiggling her lovely mammaries around as she bit empty air like a gasping fish. She was so cute when she was desperate for pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" said Ino, whose voice was shaking with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" said Hinata, \"we have our way with her.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ino looked hungrily down at Ninata's quivering form. Kami, the way she seemed to lean her form into Tenten and Ino's hands and mewl like a kitten was sexy as hell. Just looking at her was enough to make Ino want to cum right there. And her breasts, how they bounced and jiggled even as they lay flat on her chest, bigger than they had any right to be...she wanted them. Needed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave the blunette's boob a nice firm squeeze, reveling in the sensation of soft mammary flesh oozing on and between her fingers. Ninata arched her back and moaned sensually from the contact, enjoying the touch immensely. That moan soon turned into a startled (and adorable) yelp when Ino followed up by firmly pinching her nipple between her forefinger and thumb, causing the girl to nearly jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's so hard. So erect. I didn't know tits could stick out this far</i>, she thought as she rolled it between her fingers causing Ninata to squirm around some more. <i>I wonder how it'll taste?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one way to find out. Leaning forward so that she was nearly hovering over the nude Hyuga, Ino moistened her lips with her tongue, extended it out as slow as a shy turtle, and gave the little nub a nice lick. She had to suppress a giggle. It was so hard; it very nearly tickled the soft organ in her mouth. She didn't even know that was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno licked Ninata's nipple again, running her tongue around the nub in circles so she could taste every millimeter of areola. She did this many times, again and again until the entire circle of pink flesh was coated in a shimmering coat of saliva. It was...good. Like eating raw cookie dough complete with a hard chocolate chip in the center. Just thinking about it made Ino's own nipples harden against her silk kimono in anticipation <i>I should have brought food for this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't enough. Ino wanted more of Ninata's tit flesh in her mouth. No longer content with just licking her, the mind walker took the liberty to pucker her lips up and draw the whole pink circle inside them with a slurping motion. She shivered as Ninata's nipple was pulled into her mouth, feeling all angles of her nub on both her lips. She bit down on it with her teeth, lightly so as to not hurt her little lover, and began to suck it like the sweet confectionary treat it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's moans were getting louder now. From the corner of Ino's eye, she could see Tenten was looking closely at her, seeing what she was doing to pleasure the blunette. And then she began to mimic it. Licking Ninata's other nipple with those same circular motions, marveling at how hard the nub felt against her wet tongue, enveloping it in her mouth, sucking it firmly. Ninata twitched and jumped again, hard enough to squish Ino's head into her breast and nearly fling her off, and elicited a startled cry that sounded slightly pained. Tenten likely bit too hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette let go and shot an apologetic look at the girl, mouthing a quiet \"I'm sorry\" before she went back to suckling, moving slower and more carefully this time. Ninata answered with a quiet and more happy murmur, as if to let her know that all was forgiven and she was doing things correctly now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno felt a hand caress her back. Looking up from her suckling, she could see it was Ninata's, who was using her now free arms to hold both the blonde and Tenten closer to her. Briefly, Ino wondered where Hinata had run off to. But then, she felt somebody behind her, loosening the obi around her waist and the kimono covering her form. She made no effort to resist as the sash went limp and flew away, nor did she resist as the whole garb began to pull away from her body. Rather, she simply let go of Ninata's breast with her hands to make the stripping easier, letting the kimono flow off her like it was made of water until it was completely off, leaving her just naked as the pearl-eyed angel beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot once did Ino release Ninata's tit though. She kept it firmly in her mouth, locked between her teeth, flicking the nub back and forth with her tongue whenever she wasn't sucking. She continued her work, enjoying the taste of young nipple even as she felt a gentle hand grace her buttocks. She only stopped her ministrations when something warm, wet and boneless caressed her ass, just on the edge of her cleft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmfff!\" she moaned in complete surprise, using every ounce of willpower to keep Ninata's nipple between her lips while her whole rear end shivered at the contact. Did Hinata...did Hinata just lick her ass?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely,\" the Hyuga cooed from behind, giving one cheek a firm squeeze as she hugged Ino's behind like a lover. She kissed that same cheek, marveling at how firm it felt against her lips. And then, she slithered up Ino's form, feeling the blonde's naked back with her large breasts and bare stomach. Ino couldn't see her, but the lack of fabric and feeling of warm skin told her the blunette was nude now as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing well,\" Hinata whispered in her ear, so low and seductively, the blonde swore a finger slid up her vulva. It was <i>that</i> arousing. She then nibbled Ino's ear playfully, planted a kiss on the mind-walker's neck, and withdrew, her form almost seeming to peel itself off the blonde's body like it was stuck to it. Ino stole a glance to her side to see what the blunette was going to do next. She was rewarded with the sight of Hinata crawling on all fours around her twin and straight to Tenten, breathing huskily and moving so slowly and gracefully, she reminded the blonde of a housecat. A pink, hairless housecat with a sumptuous rear end that swayed huskily with every step she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the older girl, the Hyuga repeated her previous action, untying Tenten's obi and pulling her kimono off. And though Tenten released Ninata's nipple in response to the action, she made no attempt to stop Hinata. She too was more than happy to let the little sexpot strip her bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the kimono off, Hinata flung it away dismissively and embraced the brunette, who seemed to be in a half-kneeling, half-lying position, from behind, smiling widely as her boobs flattened into the older girl's back. Tenten quivered from the contact, her body responding positively to the Hyuga's nude proximity. Her eyes squeezed tight and her mouth parted slightly as Hinata followed up with a kiss, starting on her shoulder and traveling up to the crook of her neck, leaving a trail of lipstick markings on the girl's flesh as she went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That means there's an impression of her lips on my butt.</i> Ino couldn't help but giggle at that, which felt weird with Ninata's tit still in her mouth. Weird, but in a good way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now grind,\" said Hinata in that same sultry whisper of hers. \"On her legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrind...that sounded like good idea. Ino's sex was burning madly now. She knew her clit must have been peering out from between her lips, and she could feel the telltale sensations of moistness dripping out of her opening. She needed to stimulate it, rub it, hard, raw, furiously. And she had the greatest sex toy ever conceived that would allow her to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno finally released Ninata's nipple, which flung back to its breast with an amusing snap and sent ripples across the tantalizing expanse of mammary flesh. Pushing herself up, Ino shifted her position so that she was sitting on her knees, which were splayed wide enough to allow Ninata's thighs to come right between her legs. To her side, Tenten mirrored the position over Ninata's other thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing what they were going to do, Ninata bent her knees, raised her thighs, and pressed them firmly into the sexes of her two friends. And as one, they both began to dance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata took a seat on the floor. She was hot, wet and horny, but for now, she was content to just watch her naked girlfriends turn her twin and lover into a screaming, squirming mess on the futon. While getting a clear view of their asses too of course. Ino's was considerably rounder and more voluptuous, comparable to her Ninata's, which meant it would make for an excellent handhold. But Tenten's was nice too, with taller, more oblate cheeks that looked hard and firm to the touch. The fact that she was sporting a pair of womanly dimples just above them only accentuated her toned musculature. Hinata licked her lips. Squeezing the older girl's butt with her fingers would make for an interesting change of pace than what the Hyuga was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to spread her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls started off slow, bucking their hips front and back carefully to ease themselves into a groove. Ino weaved her nether regions from side to side as well, which made her ass jiggle a whole lot more, while Tenten pressed herself deeper and firmer into Ninata's legs, which caused her cheeks to spread a bit and give the born-Hyuga a more intimate look into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gave her right breast a nice hard squeeze with her left hand, while her right crept its way down to her moist pink flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the girls began to pick up speed, gyrating faster and faster on Ninata's legs as they grew slicker and shinier with lubrication. Their throaty breaths deepened into husky moans as the pleasure flared up in their cores, growing hotter the more they raked their folds across Ninata's baby-smooth skin. Ino's ass cheeks were bouncing around like rubber, splashing droplets of liquid love all over the place. Meanwhile, Tenten's butt almost seemed to clench shut as she clamped her thighs down hard on Ninata's leg, holding it firmly in place. Hinata could no longer see what she looked like down there, but she could hear it; moist, squelching noises sounded off as the brunette grinded into her beloved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wet tingly feeling that was Hinata's nightly companion began to return as her fingers brushed against her folds and her thumb pressed gently down on her clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno's head tilted upward as she cooed ever higher to the sky, her eyes likely closed tight in ecstasy. Meanwhile, Tenten was staring intently at Ninata, likely looking uncharacteristically unsure of herself even as the ecstasy overtook her, wondering if she was doing everything right as her arms clasped tightly over her heart. Hinata would have loved to see that look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first...she had an orgasm to coax out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't believe...I can't believe I'm actually doing this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten never felt more on fire in her life, and she had taken a few explosions to the face in the past. The feeling of Ninata's skin sinking into her pussy was just...was just...she couldn't describe it. But it was better than every masturbation session she ever indulged in before. Her fingers were nothing compared to the smooth, slippery leg of the Hyuga beneath her, and seeing how the naked girl writhed and moaned under her and Ino's assault was positively tantalizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ninata's face worried her. The blunette looked distressed, and her moans almost sounded like pained cries. Tenten couldn't help but wonder if she was doing something wrong again. She still felt bad about biting the girl's nipple so hard. But just as she was about to cease her grinding, she felt a delicate hand paw at her ass. It tickled the brunette, and she couldn't help but thrust her butt into the appendage to press it deeper into the taut girl-flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of another girl touching her was...more electrifying than she imagined. It just made her want to stoke the fires blazing in her loins even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's hand slid around her butt for a few more seconds, stroking and massaging the muscle that held her in place as if she was searching for something, before retreating back. Tenten was just about to gasp \"keep going,\" when she felt the same hand suddenly start crawling around her stomach. It patted the abdominal muscles she had trained for so long, ran down to her groin, and poked and prodded at the sensitive flesh on her Venusian mound until the fingers found themselves tangled up in the older girl's dark pubic hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Does she...like the bush?</i> Tenten thrust her pelvis forward, shoving the girl's hand even deeper into her crotch as she let out another moan while her clit squelched against Ninata's drenched thigh. Perhaps that would improve her mood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it didn't. Ninata still looked distressed, and her mewling sounded less like she was having fun and more like a kitten begging for food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, ahhh, uh! Pl-plea-please...I...AHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tenten could ask what she wanted, she noticed a flicker of movement from the corner of her eye. Ino was sliding a hand over to the blunette's hairless crotch. Both Ninata's legs and vulva were splayed wide, her clit was swollen and in full view, and her pelvis was bucking wildly into the air as though she was trying to get something, anything, to touch it. If Tenten wasn't busy groping her own breasts, she would have smacked her forehead. Of course Ninata was distressed; no one was giving the poor girl the relief her burning womanhood was so desperate for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Ino figured it out. She gave Ninata's clit an affectionate rub, and in response, Ninata's mournful expression morphed into a pleased smile as she threw her head back on the futon and moaned adorably, happy to finally get some stimulation. Tenten followed suit, dropping a hand just under Ino's and sliding a finger into the velvety folds of Ninata's womanhood. It was wet, wetter than she imagined a vagina could ever be, and very hot. So hot, Tenten wondered if she would get burned. She didn't have much time to ponder as Ninata's hips began to buck around, not in want, but in wild ecstasy. She bucked up and she bucked forward, and Tenten could feel the muscles in her legs tighten against her folds as the girl involuntarily tried to kick the air. Every spasm had more force put into it than the last, and before the older ninja knew it, she was struggling just to stay on top of and inside the girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she inserted another finger into Ninata. And then another one. And then she curled them all up in a desperate attempt to maintain a grip on the blunette's crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Need to stay on. Still haven't cum. Need to stay on...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAHHHHHH!\" Ninata cried in pure bliss and bent her knees so fast, she nearly threw the two girls straddling her thighs off. She thrust her crotch up and down multiple times. Her vaginal muscles squeezed around Tenten's fingers so tightly, the older girl swore they pulled her whole arm deeper inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Something's coming...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lips in anticipation. Hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M CUMMING!\" cried Ninata with orgasmic excitement. \"I'M CUMMING...I'M CUMMING! I'M\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's orgasm came out hard and fast. The blast of her juices very nearly popped Tenten's hands out of her hungry sex like a cork, and they squirted far. How far, the brunette couldn't tell, but the fact that her outer thigh was starting to feel additional warmth and moisture that didn't come from her said enough. But it wasn't the only one; more juice spurted out of the girl, and with every liquid eruption she emitted, her whole body quaked with violent force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UHHH! UHHH! UHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither the girl was packing more muscle in her form than her slender frame implied, or her orgasm granted her super strength. Either way, Tenten was having a hard time staying on top of her. By the third orgasm, Ninata just about kicked hard enough that it sent Tenten tumbling backward until she landed with a soft thump on the adjacent futon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten pouted with disappointment. She had been getting into a good rhythm riding on Ninata like that, sliding her sex on the blunette's naked thigh while it was soaked in her own juices. It was so decadent in a way. So unlike her. And now, she was lying here with a burning wet pussy of her own and no one around to\u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe upside-down image of a Hyuga girl's visage interrupted her thoughts. Tenten had no idea who it was, Hinata or Ninata, just that she was wearing a big predatory smile and nothing else. The blue-haired girl licked her lips hungrily as she locked eyes with the older kunoichi, and then proceeded to crawl over her. Tenten froze up as her face disappeared from sight to be replaced by two massive mammary glands. Large orbs of creamy flesh with rose-hued tips that bounced and wobbled as they hung in the air just inches above her face. Tenten liked breasts. She liked them a <i>lot</i>. They had been the subject of her dreams, especially the pair that belonged to a certain busty Hokage. But these breasts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>These might be my new favorites!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the brunette ejected her tongue to taste those orbs of motherhood again, but alas, they too vanished from sight. Tenten very nearly let out a groan that a child would make when she had her favorite toy taken away, but she was able to keep herself in check as the rest of the girl's form slithered over her. Like her trim stomach with the faintest outlines of abdominal muscle rippling underneath, her belly button that looked so adorable up close, the V-shaped contours of her mound, the poofy lips of her vulva, the shiny pink nub of her clitoris...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few drops of fluid dribbled onto Tenten's face and before she knew it, she was staring directly into the glimmering wet folds of the blue-haired Hyuga's greatest treasure. A scent of musk with a hint of tea and cinnamon flooded her nostrils, filling the young ninja with a hunger for something she had never tasted before. And as the warm, boneless and wet tongue of the Hyuga began to stroke her crotch and trace the outline of her slit, Tenten knew exactly what she had to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata shivered with delight as she felt the warm caress of Tenten's tongue slide within her slit, though it did little to make the Hyuga cease her own oral ministrations. Tasting the older kunoichi was definitely a different experience than what she had gone through with Ninata countless times in the past. The thick dark hairs on Tenten's crotch tickled her chin, and the smell and taste of sesame was absolutely overwhelming. Which came as no surprise; Tenten's pussy was sopping wet, with sweet nectar dribbling all over her thighs and down into the crevice of her buttocks. No matter where her tongue slipped or what her face brushed against, some part of the brunette's essence found its way onto Hinata's face. And she loved it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm!\" she murmured excitedly as Tenten's tongue slithered deep inside and licked her moist folds, sending tingles so strongly up her core, they rattled her teeth. Tenten licked differently too. The black-haired girl had no grace whatsoever. She didn't tease her lover, savor the silky flesh of her lower lips and the sweet scent of her essence. The older ninja simply dove right in with complete gusto. She licked Hinata again, running her tongue a full circle along the inner walls of the Hyuga's core, pressing the organ firmly on all sides of her lover's womanhood. The flesh only pulsed that much harder against it. The girl was very excited, but Hinata did not mind. Her touch, while unconventional, still made her shudder, and while it may have been forceful, it was borne more out of simple naivet\u00e9 on bedroom manners than any need to be aggressive. Tenten just needed a little...guidance on how to properly pleasure a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And I can't wait to teach her everything I know</i>, the born-Hyuga thought with a smirk and a purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked sensually into the crook where the weapon master's leg met her mound, catching a few salty, slightly nutty drops of love on her tongue and suppressing a giggle as she heard Tenten moan happily at her touch, her voice smothered within the pink folds of Hinata's sex, still wet from a fresh orgasm. She lapped even more fluid dripping from the girl's open lips, and took care to massage the exposed pink flesh with her tongue. Tenten's whole groin rocked at the contact. She did not know how to restrain herself like Hinata did. And when Hinata came across the exposed nub of her lover's pleasure center, she enveloped it within her lips and began to suck, gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmphhh! Mmmpphh! Mmmph!\" Tenten cried out in arousal as her clit vanished into the Hyuga's mouth, her own face still buried in Hinata's baby-smooth crotch. Her hips bucked wildly with every sound she made, bobbing Hinata's head up and down playfully, but it did little to shake her lips away from their prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was happening. Tenten was on the verge of losing her virginity. And after spending so long fantasizing about seducing and deflowering the older girl, Hinata was not going to pass up the chance to taste lost innocence for the second time in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata did not in the least bit feel exhausted. On the contrary, her orgasm filled her with a surge of erotic energy. The pressure valve within her was blasted wide open, her inner fires were burning red hot, and the only way to quench them would be to cum again. And now that she was relieved of the two weights that were bearing down on her legs, she was ready to do something she didn't get a lot of chances to do in the bedroom: take control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced over at Tenten and saw her very naked double crawl over her like a cat, eying the older girl's hairy snatch with hungry lust. Looks like she had been claimed. Which left Ninata with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno was lying on the floor, looking dizzy as the events of the past few minutes caught up to her. Her legs were spread wide and her thighs were slick with musty-smelling femme-juice leaking from her exposed pink tunnel. Leaking, but not yet spurting. Ninata would change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaaggghhh!\" the blonde yelped as Ninata seized her ankles and dragged her form across the floor and back onto the futon. Kami, she looked so lovely lying limp like that without a stitch of clothing on, her straw-colored hair in complete disarray, a dull sheen of perspiration highlighting the toned muscles she was starting to build up. It was so different from Hinata, but still enticing nonetheless. Ninata was really going to enjoy sexing her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former boy shuddered as she sat herself down over the mind-walker in such a way that their legs criss-crossed and their clits touched. She loved that tingling sensation every time something brushed against that divine organ. It was probably her favorite thing about being a girl. But if there was one thing she learned about girl bodies, it's that a single brush was <i>never</i> enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll show Ino how you really grind on a girl!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gyrated. She thrust. She bucked. She swayed. She performed every physical action necessary to rub two clits against one another, wiggling her hips in tight circular motions to rub and mash her crotch against Ino's. And she didn't take her time either; Ninata was too warm and wet to be gentle. She went in hard and she went in fast. And in no time at all, she had Ino crying out in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huhhhh, huhhhh, huhhhh, huhhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ohhh, ohhhh, yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata's breathy grunts contrasted strongly with Ino's sensual moans. The blunette couldn't help but grin at how the tables turned. Just moments ago, Ninata could only lie helplessly on the ground as Ino humped her leg. Now the blonde was at <i>her</i> mercy, her blue eyes glazed over and her head thrown back as she moaned wetly against Ninata's assault. All she could do was buck her hips in tune with Ninata's and keep her folds perfectly entwined within her lover's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all she could to stay in place. She was shaking wildly from Ninata's tribbing, gripping the cushion of the futon for dear life. It did little to stop her trembling. She was working up a sweat writhing around on the mattress, her bosoms jiggling beautifully as she moved. Up and down and left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes! Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the mind-walker's girls bounce around like that stoked Ninata's flames like nothing else. It reminded her of one simple fact: she was fucking a new girl. Bringing another girl to orgasm! Hearing a new voice cry out in pleasure, seeing a new face smile in ecstasy, feeling a new clitoris with her own womanhood, and watching a new pair of bare breasts wiggle and bounce. They weren't as big as hers or Hinata's, but Ninata liked them all the same. She could sense tingles everywhere in her being. In her crotch, in her core, in her toes, in her tits, on the tip of her tongue. If she wasn't careful, she just might...she just might cum again real soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\" It was a whisper, so light, it could tickle the flesh. But to Ninata's trained ears, it might as well have been a thunderclap. \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ino...loves me?</i> the former boy thought with a pause. <i>Is that just bedroom talk or does she really mean...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I LOVE YOU!\" Ino bellowed. And for just one second, the completely stunned Ninata froze in place as those three words, that Hinata told her countless times in the past, and that she was now hearing from Ino, sunk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne second was all she had. One second was apparently all Ino needed. Because once the blunette paused, the blonde flashed a devilish grin that wordlessly said \"You've fallen into my trap!\" And before the former boy knew it, she was on her back, Ino was hovering over her, and they were tribbing all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata squeaked in surprise as she landed with a soft thump, but before she could get another word out, her whole face was suddenly engulfed in between the jiggling mounds of her blond-haired lover's chest. She saw nothing, just the expanse of rippling girl flesh as Ino pressed into her and became her whole world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't need to see to know what was going on. Because her other four senses were in complete overdrive. She could hear the moist squishy sounds of pussy grinding on pussy, of girls moaning, purring, crying and loving. She could feel the tingling sensations all throughout her body, and the enveloping warmth emanating from both herself and her partner. She could taste the salty perspiration that Ino's boobs were coating her whole face in. And she could smell the intoxicating aroma of female arousal that permeated from every corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...love...you!\" Ino gasped! And in another second, Ninata felt a few more things. The familiar release of pressure from her being, and the torrent of boiling moisture that she knew didn't just come from her.</span></div></div>",

But it was a familiar pair of lips and a familiar tongue that was prodding at the back of her teeth, for there was never a day when either didn't find their way into boy-turned-girl's mouth. But there was something different about them this time, a taste that wasn't quite like anything Ninata had ever experienced before. It had the familiar tang of femininity that the former boy recognized from her many bouts of oral pleasure with Hinata, as well the occasional times she tasted herself. But it didn't have her distinct flavor of girly sweetness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't pay it any mind. It didn't taste bad at all, and any kiss from the girl she loved was never worth thinking about. It was only worth relishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata relished the taste of Tenten. It felt so nice and so amazing to taste another girl for once, especially one she had been lusting over for such a long time. She loved how it splashed on her tongue, and she loved how it felt going down her throat. And she especially loved how her own loins erupted in honeyed goodness all over Tenten's face. She only hoped that the older girl enjoyed her as well, and that she would continue to be Tenten's favorite. She was her first after all; it was only natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo eager was she to take in every drop of her new lover that she didn't notice that her double had fallen down so close to her until her lips were clean. Ninata was screaming in arousal as another orgasm wracked across her body, courtesy of the blond girl straddling her from above, who was howling just as loudly while she thrust her pelvis into the blunette again and again and again, mashing their sopping wet flowers against one another in the telltale dance of sapphic love. Hinata shivered at the sight of it. Seeing her lover get tribbed by another girl made her want to get moist all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling away from Tenten's crotch, Hinata crawled over to her twin's spasming form. Seeing her mouth, opened in a wide smile of orgasmic bliss, she wasted no time in smothering her lips in an upside-down kiss. Ninata stiffened for an instant, to the point where even her orgasm seemed to go on hold, but she relaxed immediately, and allowed her cum to flow out as she turned to butter at her girlfriend's touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nibbled tenderly at her double's lips, even as both of their orgasms subsided. From the corner of her eye, she could see Ino was settling down as well. Her legs were still entangled with Ninata's, her skin was flushed, but her breathing and pose were more relaxed. And she was looking down as the twins made out beneath her, and if the position of her hands was anything to go by, with one groping her medium-sized boob while the other slid down to her groin, she was enjoying the show. It was going to be a matter of time before the mind-walker was ready for another round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt a sudden jolt of electricity as something soft, warm and velvety mashed into her own groin. She was just about to activate her Byakugan to see what it was, but a familiar sensation of wet flesh grinding upon her velveteen innards in circular motions told her everything she needed to know. Tenten had shifted position and was now starting to scissor her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm!\" Hinata half-moaned and half-gasped while her lips were still engulfed in Ninata's. Oh, this evening was getting better by the minute! She didn't think Tenten would be ready so soon after getting her cherry popped. She was being a little rough, but that was okay. It just meant Hinata would have to respond in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to gyrate her hips, grinding her crotch into the older girl's in a way to match their movements. She shivered as she felt her swollen clit squish and fold against Tenten's. And she moaned even more as the brunette's taut glutes slid against her thighs. True to form, they were lean, toned and hard, a testament to the amount of training she put herself through. If Tenten ever learned Zenrajutsu, her butt would most certainly be her most dangerous weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste of Hinata was still fresh on her tongue, and the fires in her core were flickering, but still very much alive. Tenten wanted more. Much, much more. And when Hinata stopped licking her pussy, she knew she had to take matters into her own hands. Or into her own folds as the case may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she rubbed herself against Hinata. Hard and in rough circular motions. She came only a few minutes ago, but Tenten was ready to cum some more. She couldn't help it; lesbian sex...was...<i>good</i>! Better than masturbation could ever hope to be. To think how in denial she was about it so many months ago. How reluctant she was to admit to how the thought of feeling another girl's naked body pressed against her own drove her wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thrust her rear backward excessively hard and gasped at the wonderful sensation it brought forth. She could feel her swollen clit fold in on itself against Hinata's. She could feel how Hinata's did the same against her own. Hot tingles erupted within the sensitive nub and all the way to her hardened tits. Were those sensations all hers, or did some come from Hinata? And if so, could Hinata feel what she felt? Oh, it didn't matter. What mattered was that Tenten...felt...wonderful! And she was going to rub herself raw tonight! She ground against Hinata's crotch again, grinned at every fiery shock that pulsed across her form each time she pushed herself into the lavender-eyed goddess behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! Ahhh! Yes! Ahhhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten's mouth was open wide now, her tongue was hanging out, and...she was looking directly into the glazed eyes of Yamanaka Ino. The mindwalker's face was a near perfect reflection of her own; she was moaning and panting happily, and the frantic motions in her body, complete with her wildly jiggling breasts that were impossible to miss, gave the impression that she was drowning. Not in a sea of water, but of pure, unadulterated bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She looks...so hot...like that. I wonder...how she would taste?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno gave her an answer when she suddenly pulled forward and planted a kiss on Tenten's welcoming lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaven. Ino had to be there. She just had to be. She was losing her virginity to the girl that convinced her girls were alright. And she was loving it. She loved feeling Ninata. Seeing Ninata. Smelling Ninata. Tasting Ninata. Hearing Ninata. And most of all, she loved fucking her. Rubbing her lady flower all over the girl's succulent skin, into her inner working, coating her body with her juices, feeling her desperate twitching and thrashing motions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, this was Heaven. And just like a person who found Heaven, Ino wanted nothing more than to stay like this forever. Grinding and kissing and sucking and licking and sweating and moaning and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA face appeared in her vision. The pale flesh and black hair meant it could only belong to Tenten. But she looked so different from how Ino remembered her. The older kunoichi was always so utilitarian in her appearance, with her natural features and bunned hair. But now, with her never-before-seen makeup starting to smear, her hair loose and in complete disarray, and her bare naked body working up a sweat, she looked like a wild animal. Especially with how she was nearly on all fours with her current pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno couldn't help but be amused by that. Both she and Tenten were in the exact same sexual position! Parallel to the floor, one knee on the ground, the other leg stretched out, hands flattened down to prop their torsos up in the air. Boobs flailing about with their spastic movements as they tribbed a lovely Hinata twin behind them. Even their facial expressions had to be the same. Glazed eyes, flushed cheeks, wide smiles, constant panting moans, tongues hanging out. Two different girls reflecting each other like a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is this...is this what it's like to make love to your twin? Is this...what Hinata and Ninata get to experience every night?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought spurred Ino on. She went straight for Tenten's lips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour girls kissed. Four girls licked. Four girls caressed. Four girls rubbed. And very soon, four girls cried in orgasmic delight. All at the same time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura was sitting in the kitchen, drinking her tea while trying to ignore the noises coming from the living room. Once the clothes started to fly off, the pinkette knew it was time to get off the couch and away from sight before things got too steamy for her. And judging by how loud the moans and cries of pleasure were growing, things were getting as steamy as a bathhouse out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl sighed. \"This was not how I wanted to spend my evening.\" Sitting all by her lonesome self while everyone else got to have fun. This was supposed to be a sleepover! They were supposed to do typical girly things, like watch a movie, do each other's nails, try on each other's clothes, or play a game like Truth or Dare or Spin the Bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch that, she wouldn't want to play Spin the Bottle. There weren't any guys here. Not that that would have mattered to those sluts in the other room; seems like everyone in this little group was gay except her. And now, here they were, having a lesbian orgy and leaving her to twiddle her thumbs. Acting like she didn't exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to think, Sakura actually thought things had changed. That she now had an active social life again. Ever since she graduated from the academy, she barely ever spoke to girls. Most of her interactions were reserved for her two male teammates. But even then, she was the outlier, the unwanted third wheel. Sasuke and Naruto were far more interested in their stupid rivalry than they were in her. They did everything together. They trained, they competed, they sparred, they argued, and they fought. Sakura didn't do any of those things, and they never invited her. And as far as she was concerned, by the end, they didn't even know she existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the faces changed, but everything remained the same. Sakura was still the outlier. Hinata and Ninata were a loving couple, Ino was head over heels for them both, and by the looks of things, even Tenten had an attraction to them. But Sakura...once again, it looked likes she had no place in the group dynamic. She was just an extra wheel, nothing more. And that's all she would ever be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, fuck their orgy, fuck their sleepover, and fuck them!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that bitter thought, the pinkette knew it was time to go. Her tea was done and there was no more reason for her to be here anymore. <i>Or to be around these people.</i> Resisting the urge to hurl her cup into the nearest wall, Sakura deposited it into the sink and trudged out into the living room, where she could get the hell out of this apartment and out of her so-called friends' lives forever. <i>What a waste of time.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nose wrinkled as she stepped into the new room. The stench of sweat and...female arousal was overpowering, and the chorus of moans was so loud that she couldn't even hear her own thoughts. It only reminded Sakura of just how unwelcome she felt being here. The bubblegum-haired girl shot a glare at her \"friends.\" She hoped at least one of them would notice how insensitive they were being, how uncomfortable they were making her feel. But not a single one of them did. They were all lost in a world of their own, writhing their completely naked bodies against one another. Light reflected off the four girls' bare skin, so sleek and shiny from perspiration, it almost hurt to look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata, Ninata, Ino, Tenten...they all looked so happy together. Sharing in each other's warmth, bathing in their collective love, rubbing and caressing their sensitive womanly parts. How wonderful it must have been to be in that circle of heaving female flesh, to be held and kissed and squeezed and told that you were loved. And how unfortunate it was that she, Haruno Sakura, could never be a part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould she?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura knew she should just leave. This lesbian orgy wasn't any business of hers and she wanted no part of it. Yet for some reason, her feet stayed glued to the floor and her eyes remained fixed on the four girls as they went at it like rabbits. There was just something hypnotic about that heaving, rippling mass of female flesh in the center of the room. Something about it just made the pink-haired girl reluctant to look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I...suppose I could stay a little while longer. Just to see where this goes.</i> Taking a seat on the now empty couch, the pink-haired girl folded her arms on her lap all prim and proper like, and watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were lying in a ring-shaped formation. Ino and Tenten were engaged in a wet tongue war with each other, their legs were entangled with Hinata and Ninata's, though the pinkette couldn't tell who was who, and their hips were bucking around furiously, as if they were trying to...what? Rub their vaginas together? Could girls even do that? It just seemed like a crude imitation of guy-on-girl sex, at least what she understood of it (from her academy textbooks). And Hinata and Ninata were giving just as much as they were taking, grinding their crotches with just as much force into their respective partners while lavishly making out with each other in turn. The fact that they had to give each other an upside-down kiss did little to hinder their passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kissing steadily slowed down, the moaning grew louder, and the motions became faster, more intense. Soon, the girls were out and out screaming and they were bucking so hard into each other, Sakura couldn't help but wince from the pain she imagined they had to be feeling. But there was no pain to be found on their faces; Ino, Tenten and the Hinata twins couldn't have looked happier. Their heads rose skyward, their forms trembled, and their breasts, whether they hung freely in the air, jutted up to the ceiling, or laid flat on their chests, bounced and jiggled as something within their nethers stirred, heated up, and erupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were orgasming. Sakura was watching four girls orgasm right before her. All at once and at the same time. Was that even possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno fell into a heap on the futon and rolled onto her back, panting with an immensely satisfied grin on her face. But she didn't have much time to rest, for the Hyuga twin who had been previously grinding on Tenten suddenly grabbed the blonde and hoisted her into a sitting position. \"I want my turn on you now!\" she hissed in a husky whisper. Wrapping her legs around the mind-walker, the blunette began to grind her crotch into Ino, who could do little more than wail in ecstasy as the lavender-eyed girl had her way with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Hinata twin who had been lying on her back suddenly flipped over and crawled upon Tenten. Lying atop of the older girl and positioning herself between her splayed legs in what Sakura knew was the traditional missionary position, she began to sway her hips, wiggling her sumptuous rear end in circles as she grinded into the weapon-master's crotch. As she moved, she buried her face into Tenten's neck, and did...something to it. What, Sakura couldn't tell, but Tenten was liking it, because the older genin was letting out some very uncharacteristically girlish giggles. Her fingers quickly snaked their way onto the Hyuga girl's swaying rear end and gave it a very seductive squeeze. The lightly jiggling girl-flesh was clearly very sensitive, for the blue-haired girl emitted a few approving moans at the contact and leaned her...admittedly cute derriere even tighter into Tenten's roving hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WHAP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura jumped as a sudden wet slapping sound interrupted her thoughts. Darting her eyes over to the other pair of girls, she could see the twin that was seducing Ino was enjoying her butt as well. She was holding the blonde tightly against her frame, gripping her ass in an effort to push the girl even closer into her body, and more importantly, her groin. Ino was writhing furiously into her, her plump butt wiggling in tight circles. And every now and then, the Hyuga girl would release her grip on the blonde's cheek and spank it! The flesh would ripple like water from the contact and Ino would let out a small gasp of excitement as she threw her head back in surprise and delight. If it stung at all, she made no indication of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, the moaning grew steadily in volume and one by one, the girls erupted in another explosion of musky-smelling orgasmic bliss. Ino immediately went limp and fell on her back, but the Hinatas were not about to give her a break. Both of them went for her breasts, enveloping her nipples within their gentle lips and suckling them like newborns. Ino gasped in surprise but offered no resistance, allowing one Hinata to a slip a hand over, and likely into, her dripping wet flower. Even from the couch, Sakura could hear the wet schlopping sound of moist girl flesh. And while she did her thing, Tenten got on all fours, crawled behind the second Hinata and began to...she couldn't see, but she swore the older girl was licking the girl's groin, lapping up whatever nectar she could gather around the lips before going for the sweet center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on they went. Shifting positions, changing partners, but always kissing, licking, rubbing and climaxing. Sakura should have been disgusted at the sight. She had no personal problems with lesbians, but she really had no interest in ever watching them do...their things before. But she couldn't help but be curious about all the ways they...gave and received pleasure. <i>How is that supposed work? Does that really feel good? That looks like something you'd do with a guy. Do lesbians typically do that? That seems like it would hurt. I wonder if that tastes good? Is it really that easy?</i></span></div></div>",

The pinkette just couldn't look away. Something about those jiggling, bucking, squirming murmuring shapes just called to her, drew her in like a moth to a flame. She circled it, took in its constantly changing, contorting form from every angle imaginable. The shadow of a girl reared upward, throwing its head back and crying out before it seemingly melted into the blob. Two legs kicked out from one end as another voice screamed for release, only to be pulled back into the mass as though to keep them from running away. Two heads rolled against one another as their lips locked together, until two large circular mounds of flesh appeared from nowhere and completely enveloped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was terrifying, it was alien, but there was a strange sense of animalistic beauty to it that compelled Sakura to come even closer. She couldn't resist. It was like gravity; she had no choice but to hover over the mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sea of shifting bodies greeted her. Of thrashing limbs, hardened nipples, smiling lips, lolling tongues, roaming hands, and clenching muscles. They were so close, she could reach out and touch them.

The pink-haired girl barely had enough time to utter an \"Eep!\" before it pulled her into the squirming mass of flesh below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof!\" Sakura grunted as she fell upon the soft cushion of a futon, which was absolutely drenched in bodily fluids. She was able to push herself onto her knees before a warm pair of lips found her own and pried them open. The pinkette could only let out a muffled gasp, which did little but give the intruder an opening to invade. Sakura tried to close her orifice, but all her lips came down upon was the moist and curious appendage of a tongue and a hungry pair of lips that did not belong to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the kisser pulled away and Sakura was finally able to see who it was. \"I-Ino?\" she sputtered. She might as well have spoken to a wall. Ino was awake, but clearly not there. Her eyes were clouded where they weren't hidden under her lids, and she didn't seem to be looking at anything in particular. Besides Sakura's soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...\" Sakura had no idea what to say or how to react, but she couldn't help but notice that the normally restrictive kimono she had been wearing all day was suddenly starting to feel loose around her frame. Before she knew it, a sharp draft of air was hitting bare skin all over. Hinata and Ninata had untied her obi and were now pulling the garb away from her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait a minute,\" she cried to no effect. The twins had a similarly hazy look in their eyes as well. They couldn't hear a word she said. There was no spark of reason to be found anywhere in their expressions. Only pure, unbridled lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFingers wormed around the waistband of Sakura's panties, the only article of clothing she still had on her body, and slid them down the length of her legs. Sakura squealed as the garment reached the heels of her feet. She kicked desperately to ward off the thief, who was Ino, but all she managed to do was fling her underwear away and into the great beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was naked now. Naked and alone and surrounded by four equally naked girls Naked, breathy, horny, hungry girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to move she had to get out she had to escape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand fluffed the cropped field of pink hair between her legs. A soft pair of lips gently kissed the silky flesh of her mound. A warm, boneless thing brushed against the swollen wet nub that was beginning to protrude from her lower lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are...what's happen...ing? Ahhh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hands gently caressed her body. Her stomach, her shoulders, her hair. Gently. Gracefully. Lovingly. It made Sakura shiver, even though she was feeling quite hot now from all the body heat radiating around her. And from the nerves boiling deep in her loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour pairs of lips descended on her. One took in her clit. That made Sakura want to gasp again. Two swallowed her nipples and suckled them between her teeth. That made Sakura want to scream. The last went straight for her lips. It ensured she made no sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was trapped. Held down by these four bodies, unable to do anything but writhe. Feel. And revel. In the stinging, tingling sensation burning in that little nub in her crotch all the way up her spine. In the soft fingers that were massaging her skin. It the silky lips and stony teeth kissing and sucking her meager little nips. In that warmth flooding her mouth. In that radiance permeating all around her that told her she was loved, that she was cared for, that she had a place she belong to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat she was drowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmppphhhh!\" Sakura half-moaned and half-screamed as Tenten nibbled on her lower lip and licked her tongue from inside her mouth. As Hinata and Ninata gleefully fed on her tiny, boyish chest. As Ino almost seemed to crawl into her personal flower, as pink as her head. As her heat grew, as her skin dampened, as the fabric of the futon and comforter atop it molded themselves into her butt, as she bucked and squirmed vainly against the assault. Hotter, tighter, wetter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to simultaneously speed up and slow down. Sakura had the distinct impression that she was being pulled and pried and rolled over. Sometimes she was on her back. Sometimes she was on all fours. Sometimes she was on her side. Sometimes she was on her haunches. And sometimes, it felt like she was being held aloft in the air. But at all times, she was never not being touched, kissed, caressed or licked. It was like she was sinking into a sea of womanly flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't escape it. Everywhere she looked, everywhere she felt, female anatomy was closing in on her. Thighs would clamp down around her head, her neck, her stomach, her legs to keep her from escaping. Hands rubbed, pinched, and massaged every private nook and cranny of her sensitive flesh, even in the places her own hands dared not go. And if a pair of lips was not smothering her own, it was leaving marks elsewhere on her naked body, kissing, licking and nibbling. Breasts of various sizes appeared in her vision and obscured all else, especially as they converged upon her and cushioned her head in their softness and nourishing warmth. And her flower...oh Kami, her flower! It was absolutely on fire! Tingles erupted on her little nub, into the pulsing, pounding walls with, all the way up into her core, up every single vertebrae of her backbone, on the tips of her hard pink nipples and the roots of her hairs as they stood on end on her head and between her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh....ahhhhh...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt about ready to burst!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura didn't know how many times she experienced that sensation. She lost count. And all her attempts to break out, to crawl free from the writhing mass failed. Because it was too strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd maybe because she didn't want to.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata wasn't sure why it mattered to her so much but, for some reason she really wanted Ninata to give a strait yes or no answer. Making what would likely become the first in a long line of impulsive decisions, Hinata suddenly spun around. Grabbing the back of the tub wall for support, Hinata positioned herself so se was practically shoving her butt into Ninata's face. Sufficed to say, the boy-turned-Hinata was very surprised at having a girls butt nearly shoved into her face, not to mention how dumbfounded she felt at that moment knowing it was Hinata's butt. \"I-I want you t-to tell me. Do you think my butt is big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither girl moved for what felt like an eternity. Ninata was shocked at having Hinata act so forward about this. And of course about there being the creamy-white skinned behind of a cute girl, who was currently naked and in the bath tub with her, shoved into her face and said girl demanding an answer about the size of said butt. Hinata however, was wide-eyed and blushing as she realized what she was doing. She closed her eyes just waiting for the negative reaction she was sure would soon follow. After all, who in the world wants to have some girls butt shoved in their face when they are bathing together? Sufficed to say that Ninata's response surprised her greatly would be an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gasped as she felt soft and delicate hands grasp her rear end and squeeze it. Hinata had expected many things to be Ninata's response but, not this! The Hyuga girl moaned in barely restrained delight at feeling her double grope and fondle her rear. \"I just told you Hinata. I've never gone and compared yours to others but, I can safely say that I quite like yours.\" Hinata panted in response as her body grew hot and tingly all over. She wanted more and so she started wiggling her hips trying to get more of her soft flesh into Ninata's pleasure inducing hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata watched Hinata curiously as she started pushing her rump against her hands, as if to say she wanted more. As Hinata continued to give lewd moans she noticed something. The folds of flesh between Hinata's legs seemed to be leaking an odd but, clear fluid. Ninata could also pickup a scent that smelt as sweet as honey. Curious, Ninata released one of Hinata's soft cheeks and ran her finger along girls folds, causing the poor girl to quiver in ecstasy. Ninata paid this no mind and examined the fluid that Hinata had released from her girl parts. It was thicker then she had thought it would be and slightly sticky, but it also smelled wonderful. Deciding to just go with her first impulse, Ninata brought one of the fingers covered in Hinata's liquid to her mouth and popped it in. She started sucking on the delicious nectar before she even realized it. It was easily the best thing she had ever tasted! Ninata would go so far as to give up ramen if she could sample this more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing upon Hinata's flower, Ninata realized that she might very well get her wish as the horny girl was dripping wet now from the pleasure she was experiencing. Not wishing to waste her time scooping it up with a finger, Ninata decided on a more direct approach to tasting more of this wonderful honey that Hinata seemed to be producing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's breath caught at feeling something warm enclose her arousal. She soon started screaming in joy as she felt what could only be Ninata's tongue run up and down the closed lips. She tried to squirm away, knowing that if Ninata went any farther then there would be no stopping what would surly happen. Ninata however, simply thought she was wiggling around in pleasure rather then to get away before she lost her hold on her lust. So, Ninata wrapped her arms around Hinata's legs, placing her elbows right where the thigh and hips met. This effectively locked Hinata in place as Ninata's hands retook their position on Hinata's butt, groping the soft full flesh once more. With this Hinata knew she had no escape, not that she had truly wanted to. So she instead chose to make herself more comfortable by bringing her legs up so that her thighs pressed on either side of Ninata's head. With her feet now behind Ninata, Hinata quickly channeled her chakra down to her toes and formed a thin string that attached itself to the bath plug. With just a quick curling of her toes at feeling Ninata slowly pressing her tongue to go deeper, Hinata managed to pull the plug free, allowing the bath water to start draining out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinata noticed the sudden drop in warm bath water but, pushed it aside as she was to concerned in lapping up every last drop of Hinata's wonderful nectar. She was soon left feeling rather gob-smacked when she suddenly found herself on her back with her head trapped firmly between Hinata's thighs and the horny Hyuga literally sitting above her with the girls dripping folds pressed against her mouth. Oddly, Ninata found this as an amazing turn-on as she quickly grabbed Hinata's butt once again and continued on her quest of tasting Hinata's honey-filled center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata sat above Ninata's head, she shamelessly started to touch herself, fondling her own breasts or pinching the little bundle of nerves that was her clitoris. She could feel the invader of her body that was Ninata's tongue, as her abdominal muscles clamped down upon it. She wasn't sure if her body was trying to push the invader out or pull it deeper in. And in truth, she didn't care as she hit her peak when she felt Ninata hum against her. It was the first orgasm Ninata ever gave her and she knew it wouldn't be the last...</span></div></div>",

Both Hinata and Ninata walked out butt-naked save for the towels wrapped around their young developing bodies. The two girls shared a glance before turning away. Neither wishing the other to see how hard they where blushing over what had happened in the tub. That wasn't to say they didn't enjoy it, they simply felt a bit overwhelmed at how quickly things had turned from what they originally set-out to do, to an unrestrained girl-on-girl 69 session. The fact that they could pass themselves off as identical twins only made it that much more awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe we sh-should get dres-ssed.\" Suggested the blushing Hyuga as she snuck subtle glances at her one-time-Uzumaki counterpart. \"Y-yeah! That sounds like a, um, g-good idea.\" Admitted Ninata as she tried and failed to stop remembering how... exciting, it felt to have Hinata on top of her, panting loudly as she tongued the girl. They both walked into Ninata's room before they realized something, Naruto never had any girl clothes. Resigning themselves to wearing the boys old clothes for now, Ninata dropped her towel and walked to her dresser stark naked. Hinata of course went wide eyed at this as she felt the compulsion to continue their escapades from earlier in the tub.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata gulped as she stared at the beautiful creamy curves of her beloveds blossoming young body. The fact that Ninata was physically identical to her meant nothing to the young Hyuga girls screaming hormones. Her eyes traveled over the creamy white skin of her love, drinking in her form and trying to burn the sight of those delectably jiggling mounds of round kissable girl-flesh that was her soft and perfectly pliable buttocks as they quivered slightly with every movement their owner made. Hinatas\u2019 cheeks burned as her instincts demanded the shy girl to grab her new lover and throw her on to the nearby bed before ravishing the poor girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDispite how badly she wanted to do just that and turn Ninata into a quivering, moaning mess again, Hinata managed to hold herself back through sheer force of will. It truthfully scared her at just how sex and pleasure crazed she had suddenly become. She had never been like this before, not even when it concerned Naruto. Admittedly, she did have some very naughty thoughts about the boy and what she had wanted him to do to her but, she had never had to hold herself back from simply jumping him like she was for Ninata. She briefly wondered if she and Ninata really where connected in some way? It would surly explain why Hinata was now fighting with herself and trying to keep from giving in to this almost overwhelming desire to stay in constant physically intimate contact with Ninata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Hinata\u2019s eyes traveled over her lovers body. Long, smooth and deceptively powerful legs running up to firm, yet soft and pliable rump that just begged Hinata to fondle it. Well proportioned hips that were not to wide yet wide enough that one could clearly see they\u2019d be well suited for carrying and birthing young one day. These lead up to a thin but, fit waist and a firm stomach, which was more obvious now that one could see the gentle curve in the girls back. These curves moved up to a chest that Hinata knew had a set of breasts that were larger than one would expect on a girl her age yet, managed to fit perfectly with her build to give an enticing hourglass shape. The fact that they were both firm yet, soft as marshmallows only added their appeal and that wasn\u2019t even mentioning how sensitive they were if one knew what they were doing. The arms were thin but, showed hints at the muscle that was under its baby soft skin, while her hands were soft to the touch yet held a firmness in them that could only come from long hours of hard work. Her neck was small but, so much so as to make it look disproportional to the rest of her body or too small to hold up her head. Many would never even take the time to see it but, Hinata saw the allure it held. It begged to her, calling for her lips to press against it and tempting her to give it soft but, noticeable nibbles so as to leave her mark. Her face, though looking away from her, was soft with some roundness to it. Just enough to retain that childlike innocence while still managing to look like a beautiful angle. Her lips, though not overly large or full, were soft and drew one in for a kiss without any thought on the others part. The look of innocence was only strengthened by the cute nose and large lavender eyes. Once Hinata had only loved eyes of a particular cerulean but, now she could safely say that she felt like she was swimming in the gorgeous pools of lavender.<br>\r\nBlushing again, as she realized that she was staring and getting aroused and excited for nothing, Hinata turned her head away and tried to focus on finding some clothes to wear. Feeling a bit awkward about wearing her own clothes while Ninata tore through Naruto\u2019s old belongings for something that wouldn\u2019t simply slip off, Hinata only put on her white panties; a part of her hoping that Ninata didn\u2019t find the little fishcake designs on it to childish. She only wore them because of one translation for the name Naruto was fishcake and she had wanted to have signifying her devotion to the boy on her person. With Naruto basically gone and Ninata in his place, Hinata now found the pair of panties rather childish and a source of potential embarrassment. Still, she slid them on and moved to help the still naked Ninata in her failing search for clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Minutes Later*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata exited Ninata's room dressed in her old clothes and sporting a light blush on her cheeks. There were in fact, two major reasons for this blush. The first was from Hinata giving up her chain mesh shirt, leaving her with nothing to support her breasts as they bounced and jiggled under her thin dark blue shirt and baggy tan jacket. The second cause was the person that was refusing to leave her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninata get out here already so we can go shopping.\" Demanded a much bolder and assertive, not to mention horny, Hinata. While Hinata was pleased that she was being more open and direct, at least with Ninata, she still felt a bit uneasy at how strong her sexual urges towards Ninata were. Ninata had also clearly changed personality wise since changing from Naruto. The most obvious being that she was a lot more submissive, at least towards Hinata, then she had ever been as a boy. The other clear change was... \"No! I can't go out like this! I'm practically naked!\" ...Ninata was a lot more self conscious then Naruto had ever been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninata. Get out here right now! I will not have you running around with no panties on any longer then absolutely needed!\" 'Not unless we are alone at home where I can enjoy you without I nutrition that is.' Thought the previously shyest girl in Konoha while imagining all the dirty and kinky things she wanted to do to her double. Ninata stuck her head out from behind the sliding door that led to her room. \"C-can't I just stay here? I mean, we have the same b-bod-dy. Can't you just...\" Ninata plea was cut off prematurely by the annoyed gaze of her friend/lover/twin. When Hinata added the finger that made a <i>'come-hither'</i> motion, Ninata hung her head in defeat and stepped out from her hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that Hinata had already seen her lover naked and had seen her in these clothes only moments ago, it still took everything she had to simply not start drooling and jump the heavily embarrassed girl for a quickie. Ninata, by Hinata's suggestion and unspoken order, was wearing practically nothing. Her top was nothing but, the chain mesh shirt that Hinata had been wearing and it truthfully did nothing to keep Ninata's impressive breasts hidden from view. Thankfully, it did keep people from seeing the creamy white skin underneath. Her legs however, were only covered by a pair of old tan shorts that she had worn when she was still a boy. Naruto hadn't worn them however since he was nine, meaning the shorts were a very tight fit on poor Ninata and the leggings stopped at about mid thigh. As far as anyone else would be concerned, Ninata was wearing a pair of very bold short shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata licked her lips as she watched Ninata desperately trying to cover her chest with her arms while shifting around uncomfortably in her much too small shorts. Hinata was very tempted to <i>'help'</i> Ninata out of those painfully tight shorts, as well as everything thing else the girl was wearing but, she forced the desire back as she had a job to do. Get them some girl clothes.</span></div></div>",

Like her brother, her hair flares out on the sides and she has an ahoge (\u30a2\u30db\u6bdb, Literally meaning: foolish hair) on the top of her head, which resembles the stem of a leaf. She has blue eyes and a pair of whisker markings on each cheek, which she inherited from her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarada Uchiha:<br>\r\nSarada has a fair complexion, straight shoulder-length hairstyle that she inherited from her maternal grandmother and onyx hair and eyes that she inherited from her father. From her mother, she inherited the shape of both her eyes and face, which is framed by a pair of red-rimmed glasses. Her outfit consists of a pink jacket over a yellow vest, underneath a high-collared white shirt with a red tie and black open-toed boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCh\u014dch\u014d Akimichi:<br>\r\nCh\u014dch\u014d is dark-skinned with amber coloured eyes like her mother. She inherited her father's brown hair which she wears in two spiky ponytails, with the rest flowing into her back, and a bang at the front which covers her left eye. She wears a sleeveless red shirt with white pants, and like all members of the Akimichi clan, she's chubby.

Is it the younger one we see as a genin? Or is he turning into the older Kushina, the same adult form that gave birth to him? So in order to help people chose, I've decided to make a small bio page so you can know what each Kushina looks like. So let's start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotes on Kushina:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her childhood, she had a round face, which, with her red hair, caused many people to call her a tomato. Her attire was a sleeveless kimono-style blouse that was yellow in color and held closed with a green obi over a short-sleeved mesh shirt with a pair of dark blue shorts and brown shinobi sandals. In her adolescence, she wore a short-sleeved, tan kimono-like blouse with a dark embroidered border, held closed with a black obi, a dark skirt and stockings that stopped at her thighs along with the village's forehead protector and brown sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPics of younger Kushina:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://shinoharaa.deviantart.com/art/Kushina-Uzumaki-283522292\" target=\"_blank\">http://shinoharaa.deviantart.com/art/Kus...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dakcar.deviantart.com/art/Commission-Kushina-Uzumaki-207980542\" target=\"_blank\">http://dakcar.deviantart.com/art/Commiss...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/kushina-uzumaki/images/30276137/title/shes-beautiful-3-fanart\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/kushina-uzum...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn contrast, Kushina was a woman well-known for her beauty when she got older. She had a slender, but feminine build, fair skin, violet eyes, fiery red hair with strands that framed both sides of her face and a black clip that parted her hair to the left. As an adult, she generally wore the same outfit consisting of a high-collared, sleeveless blouse under a long, loose-fitting dress. The blouses have been depicted in slate blue as well as white while the dresses have ranged from tan to green. She also wore a wristband that ranged from black to dark blue on her left wrist and shinobi sandals that have ranged from black to lavender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPic of the older Kushina:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/241/5/4/kushina__smile_for_me__by_omar_sin-d5cx33b.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/2...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPics of older pregnant Kushina:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/051/f/8/kushina_pregnant_by_kushinastefy-d4qelrg.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/0...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.zerochan.net/1035564#full\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.zerochan.net/1035564#full</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s3.argim.net/files/w/240x400/kushina_pregnant.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s3.argim.net/files/w/240x400/kush...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the databook(s):<br>\r\nKushina's favourite food was salt ramen, while she disliked coffee and anything bitter.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto stared fearfully at the reflection in the mirror showing a young girl that he did not know. She had fair skin and beautiful violet eyes but, the thing that really caught his attention was the long fiery red hair. The sight of those red tresses fascinated him so much that he completely forgot everything else for a moment. His current predicament was the furthest thing from his mind as he raised his hands up and ran them through the amazingly soft locks of red, watching curiously as the girl in the mirror did the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small part of himself knew that he should be panicking or questioning why he was looking at the reflection of some very pretty girl that he had never seen before in his mirror. Yet, he didn't. He had no idea why but, for some reason the sight of the pretty red calmed him. It was an odd feeling, one that he only ever remembered having when standing close to that weird girl Hinata from his old class. She always seemed to have this aura of peace around her. In truth Naruto would like nothing more then to feel that feeling all the time but, every time he tried getting close to Hinata, she had turned bright red and would either run away or shrink into herself like she was scared of him. Not wanting to frighten the girl Naruto had tried to keep his distance despite wanting to stand close to her and bask in the wonderful sensation she gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Naruto's mind started to function again. He poked and probed at himself looking for something that would tell him that this was a dream or some kind of jutsu at work. But everything felt and seemed perfectly real to him; even the girl parts hidden under his pajama top felt real, or at least more real then his Sexy jutsu's parts did. Yet, even with the prospect that this was all real and that he had suddenly woken up in a girls body with no idea on how to change back, he felt no panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unbuttoned his, or is it her, top and checked for the seal, taking a small peak (he is a guy deal with it) at the girl as he did so. He was happy to see that the seal was still there and as much as it may shame him to admit it, he did take the opportunity to experience what feeling a girls breasts was like. He quickly learned that they where sensitive as well as large. The girl couldn't be much older then 14, 15 at oldest and her chest was still the largest he had ever seen on a girl this age. He groped one in one hand, noticing how the girls hand couldn't even hold the whole thing. <i>'Whoever this girl is, if she keeps growing like this then she might beat out old lady Tsunade in a couple of years.'</i> He idly thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nice a body as this girl had, he still wanted to get his own back. So Naruto quickly dressed his new and hopefully temporary body as fast as he could before shooting out of his apartment. His only hope was to ask Tsunade, he just hoped she could actually help him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto ran through the streets as fast as he/she could while doing his/her best to avoid being seen by others. He may not know who this girl was but, he knew that letting the villagers see her in his orange jumpsuit would only cause the young girl trouble. \"Baa-chan. . .I hope you know what happened and how to reverse it. . .\" The red head blushed as she felt her rather large bosom rubbing against the strained fabric of the coat. It was clearly too small for the red head to wear, not to mention how odd it felt as they bounced and jiggled. <i>'I guess this is why girls wear bras. . .'</i> She thought, trying but failing to ignore the new and slightly uncomfortable feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ran, Naruto was debating if he should be referring to herself as a he or a she. <i>'I'm in a girls body so it would be weird to think of myself as a boy...'</i> She thought. <i>'Then again I still have a boys thoughts. I mean I clearly like girls so I must still think like a boy, right?'</i> She couldn't be sure as she did remember hearing how some people liked their own sex more then the other. It truthfully confused him on how that could be possible till a rather random thought came to her. <i>'Unless the girls who like girls are really boys that turned into girls! And I bet the same is true for the boys that like other boys!'</i> It explained a lot but, also made any hopes he had of getting back to his own body dim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo busy was Naruto thinking on this new revelation to pay any attention to his surroundings. Just as she reached the corner that she needed to turn another person stepped out. Even if Naruto had been paying attention she would not have been able to avoid the collision she quickly found herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*WHAM*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling down to the hard ground in a mess of tangled limbs Naruto opened her eyes to a sight that she found quite beautiful. A pair of soft lavender pools stared back at her with shock swimming in them. <i>'What is this soft thing on my lips?'</i> She wondered. It was soft and warm, pressed gently against her own. When she felt the girl under her gasp  it quickly became clear what those warm soft things where. <i>'Oh, Shit! I'm kissing her!'</i> Despite the panic in her thoughts, Naruto made no move to get up or release this girls lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata Hyuga was having a somewhat harder time with the fact that she had just lost her first kiss to some girl that she didn't know. The fact that the girl was a bit bigger then her and laying on top of her was surprisingly not what was keeping the shy girl from breaking into tears at the loss of her first kiss. No, that went to the beautiful violet eyes that where looking back at her with a mix of amazement, appreciation and curiosity. Those eyes where so expressive, just like her beloved Naruto's wonderful blues. She couldn't help but, think of Naruto and for a moment her mind replaced the gorgeous redhead with the image of the blond boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was caught by surprise when she felt the girl, who she now knew had to be Hinata, bring their hands up to her sides and grab a fistful of her jacket while pushing her lips harder against hers. Naruto couldn't believe what was happening and gave a blushed so hard that if she were any redder her face would match her hair color. Naruto's wide eyes soon softened and closed like Hinata's as she soon joined the shy heiress in enjoying the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I could get use to this.'</i> They both thought. This boldness didn't last long however as Hinata seemed to suddenly realize what she was doing causing her eyes to snap open in shock. She soon turned as red as the other girls hair before fainting there in the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Naruto long to realize that Hinata had stopped kissing her, leaving the confused and concerned red head to figure out what she was suppose to do about this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The red-haired and now female Uzumaki sighed, feeling slightly disappointed at the end of the kiss but couldn't for the life of her figure out why. Still, she couldn't just leave Hinata here in the middle of the street and it was her fault it happened anyway. If she had just been paying attention, then she wouldn't have run over poor Hinata or stolen what she was sure to be the girl's first kiss. She wasn't certain about the why, but Naruto knew that most girls seemed to value their first kiss and having it stolen would likely upset them greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing again at her luck, Naruto carefully got off of Hinata and picked the unconscious girl up so she carried her bridal style. Naruto just had to make sure that no one but Baa-chan and Shizune-n\u00e9e-chan saw her carrying Hinata like this. Taking a moment to make sure that Hinata was properly secured in her arms, the redhead pushed off and started roof hopping to her destination. She would have continued through the streets and alleys if she was alone but having Hinata in her arms would make being sneaky and inconspicuous nearly impossible. Roof hopping might not be as sneaky, but as long as she moved quickly she wouldn't need to worry about people getting a good look at her or Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-8 minutes later-</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at what would be her most difficult foe yet: stairs. While Hinata was as light as a feather, something that surprised her, the girl's size still made the idea of climbing stairs a less than appealing task. Naruto would silently admit that she was half tempted to simply lay Hinata down nearby and go on her own, but every time she considered this she'd catch a glimpse of Hinata's sleeping face. Outside of the calm and peaceful feeling being near Hinata always gave her, Naruto had truthfully always thought the girl was rather plain. Standing here with said girl sleeping peacefully in her arms made Naruto reconsider that view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her own way Hinata was truly a beautiful girl, if only she'd show this smile more often. Glancing at the girl now had Naruto's heart flutter oddly in her chest and a weird burning sensation creep up into her cheeks. She felt her attention suddenly focus on the sleeping girl's lips, the memory of having kissed those same lips not long ago both made the burning in her cheeks worsen and urged her to kiss them again. Shaking her head to drive such Pervy thoughts from her mind, Naruto forced her eyes forward and began the climb up to Tsunade-Baa-chan's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-5 minutes later-</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto cursed whoever it was that created stairs. She hoped the bastard burned for making such a contraption rather then figuring out a way to use chakra and jutsu to float. Her cursing was cut short however, by the princess in her arms making a small noise and snuggling harder against her. Naruto blushed a bright red at feeling the girl unintentionally bury her face against one of her new boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying her best to ignore the oddly pleasant sensations Hinata was causing her to experience, Naruto power walked, as running might jolt Hinata around. Moving towards the large double doors of Baa-chan's office with as much sense of purpose as she could muster; fully intent on busting in and calling for help like only she knew how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What happens?</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto didn't spare Shizune a glance even as the older woman rose to try and stop her. It didn't matter right now. Only getting help from B\u0101-chan and returning to her male self mattered. She'd apologize to Shizune-n\u00e9e-chan later, she'd understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't slow her pace as the large double doors approached. Instead, she used her momentum to strengthen the kick she let off, causing the doors to violently swing open. The redhead paused in her movements only long enough to give Hinata a quick glance and see the girl still soundly asleep, though she did try snuggling deeper into her new bosom. Ignoring the blush on her face and the odd fluttering sensation in her stomach, Naruto pushed forward into the room, only to nearly sweat-drop at seeing B\u0101-chan sleeping at her desk, an empty bottle of sake in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it B\u0101-chan! Stop being a drunk and wake up!! We need help!!!\" She hadn't meant to snap and yell, really she didn't. However, after waking up and finding she had not only changed genders, but bodies with some girl she hadn't known, she was having a harder time than usual showing patience. In truth, holding Hinata as she was in her arms was the only thing keeping the now red-haired beauty from throwing a near hysterical fit. Naruto had never been quite so grateful for the sleeping girl's naturally peaceful aura as she was right at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Tsunade finally begin to stir made Naruto anxious. She was so tempted to try and speed up the waking of her village leader, but she knew that could lead to her getting the drunken woman's fist. As much as she had been able to handle those sort of hits before, Naruto wasn't as confident in her new female body. It just didn't feel as sturdy as her old self. Most of all though, she didn't want to risk causing harm to Hinata. Strong as the girl might be, Naruto simply refused to do something that had such a high chance of hurting one of her most precious people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Naruto vaguely thought she heard a voice mutter something that sounded suspiciously like \"gaki (brat).\" Taking this as a sign that Tsunade had woken up, Naruto opened her mouth to speak, but was interrupted by a certain assistant walking in right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady, you can't just go barging into...\" Shizune quickly trailed off at seeing Tsunade seemingly wake up. \"Tsunade-sama! My apologies for disturbing you, m'lady.\" Tsunade simply gave a small gesture in return, effectively saying not to worry about it. Deciding that it would be best to let Tsunade deal with the oddly familiar-looking young redhead, Shizune quickly slipped out of the office, closing the doors on her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the distraction was out of the way, Naruto was quick to turn her pretty violet eyes back on target. \"B\u0101-chan, we need help.\" Unconsciously she gently shifted Hinata around in her arms, making sure the girl was comfortable as Naruto honestly didn't want to relinquish her anytime soon. However, Tsunade had caught sight of the two just before Naruto finished speaking. Squinting, Tsunade's intoxicated gaze caught the subtle shifting of the girl in the redhead's arms. While it might have been enough for a civilian to overlook, she was the Hokage. Drunk or not, she could still pick up on subtle movements. Her drunken mind putting what she thought to be two and two together, Tsunade nodded and pulled out some papers to write out a marriage contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I'll get you two fixed up,\" she said, her tone holding no sign of drunkenness. A lesser woman might have been unable to prevent her voice from slurring, but Tsunade was not just any woman; she was one of the most powerful ninjas in the world! And one didn't become one of the most powerful ninjas in the world without learning a few ways to hide how absolutely plastered you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked too. Naruto could only sigh in relief, as it looked like B\u0101-chan wasn't nearly as smashed as she initially thought. The old woman was still clearly in control of her facilities and appeared to know what she was doing while she filled out the forms on her desk. While Naruto couldn't help but wonder what the Hokage needed all those papers for, she quickly dismissed it with a light shrug. This was clearly a medical procedure of sorts, and Naruto knew that paperwork went hand in hand with those for one reason or another<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade finished writing with a small flourish before turning back to the red-haired girl. \"Need both of your fingerprints next to your names, in blood to make it binding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at the papers in confusion. Was this really all it would take to change her back? She guessed that B\u0101-chan was more awesome than she had given her credit for, likely having run into this little mess before. It stood to reason that she'd know exactly how to undo this then. Still, what did Hinata have to do with changing Naruto back to her boy self? It wouldn't hurt Hinata would it? She needed to ask, just to be sure. \"Signing this will really fix everything? And it won't hurt Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. When I stamp my seal, not even the Fire Daimy\u014d himself can easily undo it. And no, she's safe, just need some blood and her fingerprint.\" Tsunade could feel herself slipping. She needed to finish this before she passed out. Thankfully for her, the redhead was quick to bite her lip just enough to bleed and apply the fingerprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow came the hard part. The unconscious girl, Hinata, still needed to sign next to her name. Though her hold on consciousness was slipping, Tsunade could still focus enough to perform a simple jutsu. Quickly making a small superficial wound on the girl's finger, the redhead gently but firmly pushed the girl's blood-coated digit against the paper. With a quick stamping of her Hokage seal, the marriage between one Kushina Uzumaki and Hinata Hy\u016bga was complete and binding. With another quick jutsu, a copy of the completed contract was made for archiving later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice to see such strong love between two so young. Now she felt it was about time for that nap. \"Congratulations, Kushina. I hope you two are very happy together,\" said the blond who was noticeably swaying in place, her eyes and posture slouching. \"Now out!\" she commanded just before her head hit the desk with a loud bang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether Naruto wanted it or not, Tsunade was out like a light. The only thing on the young redhead's mind was a question. <i>'Who's Kushina?'</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto wasn't about to get any answers anytime soon. While she and Tsunade has been having their little \"talk,\" a sizeable crowd of people was starting to gather outside the latter's office, and it was all Shizune could do to keep them out and tell them that no, they couldn't speak to the Hokage, and no, it didn't matter if they scheduled an appointment, for the Hokage was very busy now and dealing with top-secret matters of utmost importance concerning village security that had just come up. She was clearly lying and trying to cover up the fact that the village leader was passed out drunk at her desk, but that wasn't important to Naruto. What was was the fact that the only other person who could explain to her just what this paper and the name \"Kushina\" meant was too occupied to deal with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Naruto decided to just go home with the still unconscious Hinata in tow. It didn't seem proper (or safe) to leave the girl in the old bag's place, so the blonde-turned-redhead opted to just carry her back home instead. If the dark-haired girl woke up on the way, great, they could go their separate ways and Naruto would have one less headache. But if she didn't, then at least Hinata would have a safe place to rest until she came to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into her apartment, Naruto wasted no time in depositing the Hyuga onto her bed. \"Whew, what a workout,\" she huffed. Light as Hinata was, hopping from roof to roof both ways across Konoha with her in Naruto's arms was more exhausting than anticipated. \"I could go for a light nap after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that sounded as good an idea as any, Naruto set about preparing herself. She kicked off her sandals, threw her orange jacket into the closet, slipped off her matching pants, and sauntered over to the bed to lay down wearing only a T-shirt and boxers, when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, Hinata-chan's still here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left the redhead in quite a predicament. She really wanted to lay down for a bit, but sharing a bed with Hinata didn't feel appropriate. Then again, it was <i>her</i> bed, so it's not like Hinata was in any position to complain. If Naruto deemed it fine to say they could both sleep in the same bed, then sleep in the same bed they would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're both girls, for now anyway, so I guess it wouldn't be that bad. But then I may not stay this way for long. Hmmm.\" Pulling out the piece of paper Tsunade made her sign, Naruto tried to read it over again. It made just as much sense to her now as it did the last time she went over it: not at all. There was too much fine print, legalese, and combinations of big words she didn't understand. Was it a document she signed for a medical procedure that would cure her of her \"turned-into-a-girl\" syndrome, was it some kind of a jutsu that would restore her original form, or what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Oba-chan did say she fixed everything. Whatever it is, I'll find out eventually.\" Tossing the document aside, Naruto crawled into her bed, gently so as to not wake her guest, and laid down to let the tiredness take over. As she closed her eyes, she couldn't help but steal one last glance at the blue-haired girl lying very close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hinata-chan looks really cute when she's asleep.</i> In a moment, so did Naruto.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Naruto stood above Hinata, looking radiant as the sun like he always did. \"Hinata-chan,\" he whispered, extending a hand to her. \"I finally found you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs always, Hinata froze. Was it happening? After all these years, was he finally returning her feelings? \"Naruto-kun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata-chan,\" he repeated. \"I want you. I need you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing those words set the blunette's heart aflame. It <b>was</b> happening! He <b>was</b> returning her feelings. \"Naruto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be with me, Hinata-chan?\" he said. \"Forever? Until the end of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, Naruto-kun!\" Hinata cried, taking his hand in her own. \"Until the end of time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled her to her feet and immediately seized her lips with his own. She opened her mouth and welcomed him inside. Tears streamed down her face, but there was no sadness in them. Only relief and contentment. Finally, after so long, all her wishes had come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey parted. Naruto looked directly into Hinata's lavender orbs, and she stared back into his cerulean pools. Nothing was said between them. Nothing needed to be. And then Naruto began to unzip his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's breath hitched up as the zipper oozed down the field of orange and more of her love's flesh exposed itself to her. Slowly, so slowly, he parted the fabric away, showing off more of his tanned flesh, his sculpted muscles, his cute navel, and his very generous bosoms. They bounced out, two great mounds of flesh, each lightly tanned and capped with a dark red nipple that stood erect, begging to be suckled. Hinata couldn't resist licking her lips upon seeing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like them, don't you?\" Naruto said in a voice that was growing distinctly more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" said Hinata, not caring for an instant. She looked into her love's eyes, and saw they had changed. What were once two beautiful spheres of blue were now two striking balls of violet. And yet, Hinata couldn't help but love them all the same. No, it was more like she always loved them, and that they were the eyes she always wanted to lose herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe very nearly did lose herself, but thankfully, Hinata was able to break contact, just briefly, to take in the rest of her love's form. It was changing too. Naruto's face was becoming and softer and girlier before her very eyes, and his ruffled blonde locks were turning redder, becoming smoother, and growing longer, cascading down her bare shoulders like a deluge of liquid fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person who was Naruto giggled in response. After tossing the jacket aside like a piece unwanted trash, she hooked her fingers into the waistband of her orange pants and pulled them down, slowly, sensuously. Her movements were fluid, and she swayed her hips seductively as she slipped the garment off them, showing off her sumptuous but strong-looking thighs, the bell-shaped curve of her hips that were ready to bear good, strong children, the curve of her bubbly but firm buttocks, and the sacred womanly treasure that awaited between her legs, guarded under a thin landing strip of crimson hair that burned just as brilliantly as the mane spilling from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPooling the garments around her feet, the girl that was Naruto stepped out of them, naked as the day she was born. Her breasts jiggled with her movements, her hips swayed seductively with her steps, and her hair fluttered as a light breeze blew across her form, caressing every lovely nook and curve of her perfect body. Light did not illuminate her form, it <b>radiated</b> from it and bathed her in a perpetual aura of gold. She was less a person and more a living work of art, a statue come to life, a goddess in mortal flesh, beautiful and pure in a way no human could ever hope to be. And she was staring at Hinata with nothing less than raw love and emotion in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me, Hinata-chan\" she said, spreading her arms out, thrusting her chest up in the air, displaying everything, hiding nothing, beckoning Hinata to feast upon her form with every sense she had. \"Love me, Hinata-chan! Love me with every fiber of your being!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata could do nothing less. She pounced upon the girl like a tigress and bit hungrily into her flesh.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's eyes fluttered open and for a moment, she could only stare blankly ahead of her. She was in a room. An unspectacular room. There was no gleaming sunlight, there was no comfortable light breeze, and there was no beautiful naked girl anywhere in sight. There was, however, a pillow wedged between her teeth that she appeared to be chewing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl spat it out and wiped the drool off her face with a sheepish blush. What just got into her? It was so unlike Hinata to act that way in bed. But that dream...it was so vivid, so real! It was the most erotic dream she could ever remember having. Most dreams were so easily forgotten, but that one...she could still see that gorgeous woman standing naked and unashamed before her, could still see her brilliant red hair blowing in the wind, and she could still taste the succulent flesh of her breast in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata paused as she fidgeted, detecting a few new sensations in her body. Her own nipples were poking deeply into her bra, and there was a telltale feeling of dampness between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sat up with a start, blushing even more furiously and slapping a hand over her mouth to suppress her startled gasp. Just what had come over her? She never thought this way about another girl before. She wasn't that kind of person...she liked boys! Didn't she? But closing her eyes and imagining that gorgeous female specimen, Hinata couldn't help but shudder. Something about that girl's beauty warmed her up from the depths of her soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess maybe I </i>am<i> that kind of person. Oh, why did she have to be a dream? Why couldn't she be real?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought brought Hinata to another realization. It was a dream. She had been asleep. And looking around at her surroundings, she realized she wasn't at home. She was...she had no idea where she was. How did she get here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I was walking down the street, when someone crashed into me. It was a girl, she was around my age, and she had...red hair...and she was...she was...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm,\" a feminine voice murmured behind her, breaking the Hyuga out of her reverie. With a startled jump, Hinata whirled around and nearly fainted at what she saw. It was her! It was the red-haired girl who kissed her in the street! And the very same one from her dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata should honestly have been creeped out, but for some reason, all she could feel was...joy. She was real. The girl was real! She really existed! She wasn't just a figment of her imagination!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But why did she do that to me? Why did she bring me here? And why are we sharing the same bed while she's so...underdressed?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething brushed against Hinata's foot, a sheet of paper of some kind. Giving it a cursory glance, the blunette gave pause when she caught her name written on it. <i>What is this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking it up, Hinata read the document, carefully absorbing every kanji character that passed by her lavender eyes. She read it again, just to make sure she read it correctly the first time and wasn't mistaken. Then she pinched herself just to make sure she wasn't still in a dream. Then, just to be on the safe side, she read it a third time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no denying it. It was a contract. A <i>marriage</i> contract, signed and notarized by the Hokage herself. Hinata was married. She was a wife now. To this redheaded person she never met. This...beguiling redheaded stranger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen?\" she whispered, not knowing what to think. People didn't just up and get married like that! Not unless they were really drunk, and Hinata was quite certain she had been very sober all day. Did this girl kidnap her and get her hitched? No, that couldn't have been it...this was carried out by the Hokage! The premier ninja of the Leaf wouldn't sign a marriage contract, not unless it was a political marriage between two great clans\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...Hinata remembered something. It had been a couple of weeks ago. She and her team had just come back from a long mission abroad, and they were all tired and exhausted. They barely took two steps outside the Hokage's tower for debriefing when Hinata was suddenly called to see her father and the clan elders. What they had to say to her, she had no clue. She was half-asleep and hardly heard a word they uttered. At the time, she figured it was just as well; they never had anything good to say to or about her, and it was always better to just tune them out and nod her head. That was what she did, and by the next morning, the whole thing was swiftly forgotten about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that she was here, in this strange place, with this strange person, holding this legally-binding contract for marriage, it dawned on Hinata just what the significance of that meeting must have been. The elders were informing her of her own arranged marriage! Her future had been decided and outright told to her right then and there, and she was too tired to realize it had even happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How could I have been so <b>stupid</b>?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait...if they were going to marry her off, why would they give her to a girl of all people? Wouldn't it have made more sense if her intended was a man, so she could produce heirs for him as a wife was expected?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, now that she thought about it, that wouldn't make sense either. She was the disgraced firstborn daughter of the Main House. She had been disinherited of her birthright. Bearing children was politically unsound for her and for the Hyuga clan as a whole, so perhaps giving her to a woman was perhaps the most reasonable course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over at the redhead, who was still fast asleep, Hinata remembered how the girl just tackled her in the street and kissed her. <i>She must have been looking forward to this. She was so excited to finally meet me, her intended wife, that she couldn't contain herself. She...wanted me. She wanted me really badly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata walked over to the small table in what had to be the apartment's kitchen and took a seat. She had a lot to think about...and honestly, she didn't know what to think. \"I don't want this!\" she quietly wailed. \"I don't want my life decided for me! I don't even know this girl! The one I want to be with is...is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart sank. Naruto always seemed so far away as it was, but now, it was impossible for them to ever share their lives together. Even if Hinata found the courage to tell him how she felt, it could only ever be a pipedream now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But would I ever find the courage to tell him how I felt?\" She shook her head. No, of course not. That was the one thing she was quite certain she never would find the strength to achieve. Maybe she could become a strong ninja in her own right, maybe she would one day impress her father and the clan elders, maybe she would one day regain her sister's respect...but she would never be able to tell Naruto her feelings for him. And she was quite certain that even if she did, he wouldn't return them. He only had eyes for Sakura. Hinata...she was just a weirdo to him, nothing more, nothing less. That is all she would ever be to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she...this girl...she <i>does</i> want me,\" Hinata said, turning around to steal a glance at the sleeping redhead. The absolutely gorgeous redhead. Even in her slumber, she was absolutely enchanting. The way that great crimson mane spilled all around her...how her chest rose up and down with her breathing...how her nipples were poking through that T-shirt that was at least one size too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could...probably think of worse fates than to be married to this girl. This...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUzumaki Kushina. That was what her name was according to the document. Hinata had to wonder if that was a coincidence, or if perhaps, maybe, she was a relative to Naruto? If that was the case...then maybe Hinata could be a part of Naruto's life after all. Not as his wife or his lover, but maybe they could actually become friends? They had to be. She and him were now family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that was a distant concern. Right now, Hinata had a more immediate one: how should she greet her new wife?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When two people join each other in holy matrimony, it's important for them to consummate the marriage.</i> Hinata blushed as she realized what that meant, but she couldn't hide the smile that was starting to creep its way up her face. She could still see her, Kushina, naked and offering herself to Hinata in that dream. And Hinata could still feel the hardness in her nipples, which were still standing tall and erect in her bra. Just as she could feel a strong tingling sensation in her core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, that was what she would do. Hinata would consummate her marriage to Kushina, and make her the happiest woman imaginable.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto woke up with a loud yawn, some wide stretching arms, and a big smile on her face. She knew it had only been a short nap, but she still felt nice and refreshed. The afternoon sun warmed her bones, the soreness in her muscles was gone, and the bouncing sensations in her chest felt wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait...bouncing sensations in my chest?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also confirmed she was still a girl. Naruto couldn't help but pout as that realization sunk in. She was really hoping she'd wake up in her old body, but it looked like that just wasn't going to be the case. Whether she liked it or not, she was going to be stuck as a girl for at least a little while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well. That was a problem that would sort itself out another time. Right now, Naruto had to deal with the other problem concerning Hinata, who was currently\u2014she glanced to her side\u2014not in bed with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder where she went? Hope she didn't get too creeped out sleeping next to me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...ahhhhhhh...ohhhhhhh...ahhhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto would have jumped if the shiver that slithered up her spine didn't hold her firmly in place. Hearing something as unexpected as that in her home would have startled anyone, but what really got to her was...that voice...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Haaaahhhhh...haaaahhhhhh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't have been...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, yessss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...It wasn't true. It was impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Mmmmm! Haaahhhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was. Naruto tried to deny it as those sounds, those...<i>heaving, heavenly</i> sounds flooded her ears. She tried to deny it as she turned around, feeling a quiver all over her form. But she couldn't deny it now that she was looking at it. For it was as real as it was unreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyuga Hinata has standing there, in her apartment, on her floor, by her bedside, completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything about her was exposed. Everything. Not an inch of her was hidden from Naruto's eyes. The former boy could only look on in stupefied awe. Under that baggy coat Hinata typically wore was a body that was absolutely nothing short of svelte. It curved in all the right places, inward around her stomach and outward towards her hips to form that perfect hourglass figure she always found attractive. Her skin was as fair as cream and looked like it tasted just as sweetly, and though she was small in size, she was far from weak and childish. Naruto could pick up the muscles rippling subtly under her flesh, and could see plain as day that the girl trained and worked out regularly, enough to give her a healthy tone without sacrificing her natural feminine grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more than anything else, Naruto was absolutely transfixed by the Hyuga's movements. Her waist swayed back and forth in a way that was almost hypnotic, and if she looked closely enough, she could make out the curve of the girl's dainty derriere and see just how far it extended. Naruto desperately wanted to wrap her arms around Hinata and plant her hands on either side of it, just to see how those delicate globes felt in her fingertips. But as her eyes trailed upward, the visions of Hinata's butt disappeared as she took in the sight of her breasts. They were the only part of the girl that had any sort of covering; both mounds of flesh were neatly encased in her hands, but that did little to hide how massive they were for a girl her age. They were bigger than Sakura's, hell, they were probably the biggest in all their graduating class. And Hinata was pinching and squeezing and rolling them in her hands like two balls of rice. It was enough to make Naruto's mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhhh...ohhhhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what truly held Naruto in place were <i>those sounds</i>! They were so...so...so absolutely heavenly. When Hinata spoke, she always sounded so quiet, like she was barely whispering and struggling to squeeze the words out of her lungs. But there was absolutely no struggle in the wordless vowels this Hinata was enunciating. Her voice had both risen in volume and paradoxically sunk to a husky tone so sultry, it moistened the air around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of pure electricity sparked in the area right between Naruto's legs. And all of a sudden, even they started to feel moist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi-Hinata?\" She didn't so much whisper her inquiry as she breathed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready, my love,\" said Hinata in the most clear and forward voice Naruto ever heard her speak in. \"Let us consummate our union!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consummate? Wha\u2014!\" Hinata snatched the words out of her mouth when she leaned forward without warning and kissed Naruto squarely on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's head completed exploded on the spot, her mind alight with a trillion thoughts and emotions. She was being kissed. A girl was kissing her. A girl without a stitch of clothing on her body was kissing her. A shy and timid girl without a stitch of clothing on her body was kissing Naruto on the lips, prying them open, exploring the inner recesses of her mouth, stroking, caressing, tasting. This should have been a dream. This should have been the moment Naruto woke up. But she didn't. She was still here, still on her bed, still in the body of a girl, and still being kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was liking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only lasted a moment, but it honestly felt like it lasted for hours. But when Hinata finally pulled away, slowly enough to look at Naruto with eyes filled with absolute lust, she had a feeling it was far from over. She was right; Hinata wasted no time in shoving her so that she was lying on her back on her bed. No sooner had the soft mattress thumped at her fall did Hinata follow after her, crawling on the cushion and over the redhead's body with a hunger that was equal parts graceful and animalistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaahhhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot breath blew on the bare skin of Naruto's thigh. Naruto shuddered at the sensation. Something wet and boneless brushed against it and trailed upward, stopping only at the hem of her boxers. Naruto murmured as goose bumps flared up all over her. Two great mounds squashed themselves against her thighs and slid upward over her pelvis, each large and soft as a pillow, save for a pair of hard little nubs that prodded into her flesh a lot more firmly. Naruto had to bite her lip to keep herself from gasping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, she braved a look forward to see what was happening, and the first thing she saw was a face. A familiar face, round and heart-shaped, framed by a curtain of dark blue hair that clashed strongly against a sheet of ivory. But it was twisted into an unfamiliar expression, with closed eyes and a beaming smile that was visibly screaming in delightful bliss. But Hinata was not screaming; she was breathing. Deeply. Heavily. Wetly. With every serpentine back-and-forth motion she made as she crushed her bare breasts deeper on either side of Naruto's crotch, rubbing herself into the redhead like a cat that turned into a snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata rose, and the second thing Naruto saw were her breasts. They were just like she imagined, large, full, and bouncy, jiggling in the air like two balls of uncooked dough, rich, creamy, and promising endless sweetness. Naruto couldn't help but salivate at the thought of touching them, of holding them in her hands, enveloping them in her mouth, and tasting all they had to offer. From the great mounds of girl flesh, to the rosy pink circles within them that stood tall at attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started to grow bigger. Not in the literal sense, but in the sense that they were beginning to take up more of her visual space. Hinata seemed to detect Naruto's desire to feel her breasts, and she was more than happy to oblige her. She slithered up the former boy's form, rubbing more of her body, her completely naked, beautiful body, up against the redhead's, and brought her great, jiggling domes of pleasure closer to her face. Naruto knew she should say something, but words completely failed her as her entire vision was flooded with the sight of that rich creamy skin enveloping her, a sea of slender muscle and ivory nestled between two great orbs of flesh. And soon, the orbs were the only things Naruto could see, the only things she could feel on either side of her head as they bounced and brushed against her cheeks. The orbs and the hard, erect nipples that just begged to be suckled...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ahhhhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata reared her head back and purred as her wife's mouth suddenly latched on her boob. Kushina's lips felt as kissable as they looked, her inner recesses were soothingly warm, the way she sucked on the sensitive girl flesh and lightly nibbled it with her teeth sent tingles down Hinata's spine, and the absolute moistness within told the blunette everything the redhead thought about her. That she was beautiful, that she was attractive, that she was desired. Descriptions she thought no one would ever apply to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only made her want the scarlet-haired beauty even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a light pop sound as Kushina released the breast from her mouth, only to immediately inhale another breath of mammary flesh. She kissed the creamy dome, sucked in another stretch of tender femininity, and lolled her tongue around to taste its goodness while massaging it with her teeth. Hinata moaned and moaned again as her wife repeated the process, sucking in more of her succulent femininity, switching from one breast to the other, nuzzling them softly, and emitting quiet \"mmm\" sounds with every new inch of girl flesh she tasted. And then her mouth found one of Hinata's sensitive little nubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh!\" she cooed, pushing herself upward as her nipple found its way between her wife's teeth. Kami, it felt so good, feeling another woman suck her tits like a newborn babe. Hinata always fantasized about Naruto doing that to her during her many nightly sessions of self-love, and even attempted it a few times with her own lips. To finally experience that sensation, to feel that boneless little thing lick circles around her areolas, flick her hardened nipples, and pull them ever deeper inside was...was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh hell, Hinata could already feel her sex dripping. She had been watching Kushina for some time now, playing with her breasts as she envisioned all the things they were going to do together...and resisting the urge to touch herself. Even as her loins tingled, even as her core moistened, even as she felt her innards contract wetly with want, she fought the temptation to jam her fingers inside herself and bring herself to a climax as she stood by her wife's side. But Hinata couldn't fight it anymore. She had to...she had to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFront, back, front, back. She slid her form up and down the length of her wife's thigh, rubbing her crotch on the expanse of skin. She could sense the tensing muscles in the girl's legs through her pulsing folds, feel them slicken as she rubbed more and more of her essence all over the redhead's leg. It was enough to make Hinata shudder, which caused her breast to jiggle and mold itself against Kushina's face for just an instant. Kushina and Hinata both let out a muffled gasp, but neither slowed down. Kushina continued sucking Hinata's nipple, and Hinata continued rubbing herself on Kushina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other breast,\" Hinata breathed as she quickened her rubbing. \"Other breast, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina heard her pleas and complied, releasing her wife' nipple with wet pop, and seizing the other one in her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, yes!\" Hinata moaned, feeling a jolt from the sensation of experiencing an oral bath for both her girls. \"Do that...do that! Keep doing that! That feels so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickened her pace. Forward, backward, forward, backward. There was virtually no friction to be felt, her engorged clit folded this way and that on the slippery skin, sopping wet sounds of moist flesh on moist flesh sang through the air, and fire erupted in her loins, spreading across every pulsating fold of her inner self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kush...Kush...Kush...!\" she cried. She tried to say her wife's name, but couldn't find the remaining syllables. The whole world was becoming a blur to her. All Hinata could think about was the sensation of fiery wetness growing hotter in her core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm? Mmmm...\" Kushina could only moan in response as she rolled the flesh of her newlywed wife in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kush...I'm going to...I'm going to...I'm going to...AHH! AHHH! AAHHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata fell down. Her butt jolted up. Her bare legs stiffened. Her toes curled. And very soon, more of her heavenly essence spilled all over Kushina's leg.</span></div></div>",

Her form bucked with every sopping gush, and her breasts jiggled with every full-bodied tremor. They slapped against Kushina's face, molded into her features, sent more ripples of pleasure across her body, and evoking even more wet pulses of sexual energy to her loins, again and again until her nethers were dry and only able to emit a small trickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hyuga never felt more alive than she had in this moment. She experienced plenty of orgasms in the past, always by her hand, but this, this was different. To orgasm in the arms of another, to actually have sex with another person, and a girl of all people...that was different. That was <i>better</i>. It was like a whole new world had opened itself up to her and she was seeing things more clearly now, more clearly than even the most trained Byakugan eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she wanted to experience it again. Not tomorrow. Not in a moment. <i>Now</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing herself back to a sitting position to take a fuller look at her lover, her <i>wife</i>, Hinata couldn't help but inwardly sigh. Kushina was dressed. Barely, but dressed. That would not do at all! She wanted to see everything her wife had to offer, feel all there was to be touched, taste all it had to give. She wanted there to be absolutely nothing in between them. So she seized the hem of the redhead's shirt and yanked it off her with great force, practically pulling the girl up to almost eye-level in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!\" Kushina squeaked in surprise. Her breasts jiggled as they popped free from the garment, and for an instant, all Hinata could do was stare at them, marvel at their size, at how juicy and round they were, and imagine how sweet her cherry-like nipples would taste in her mouth. It was enough to make her mouth water. She licked her lips as her eyes trailed down past Kushina's breasts, at her fit stomach that showed off just enough abdominal muscle to imply she spent a lot of time working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder what kind of a ninja she is?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi-Hinata?\" Kushina meekly whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her eyes fell upon the boyish boxers she was wearing, and Hinata remembered her mission. Scooting away from her wife's form and wincing slightly from the lost feeling of warmth Kushina's now lubricated leg gave to her throbbing sex, Hinata took hold of her underwear and pulled it off. Kushina didn't resist. She folded her legs to hasten her stripping, allowing Hinata to slide the garment down her thighs more easily, and flashing her privates in the process. Seeing folds of pink flesh within the parted lips was enough to make Hinata take a deep breath. She could almost smell the ecstasy emanating from her wife's inner depths.</span></div></div>",

But not with her hands, oh no, that was far too mundane. She wanted to feel Kushina's growing pleasure with <i>her</i> growing pleasure. And there was only one way to do that. Only one way to experience that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was still trying to catch her breath. Everything was moving a mile a minute, too fast for her to keep up, too fast for her to comprehend. It was like a surreal dream where anything could happen and everything was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing the former boy could think about were breasts. Large, soft, squishy breasts demanding to be nuzzled and squeezed and tasted and suckled. They bounced upon her, bounced <i>into</i> her, smothered her until they were all she could breathe, became her whole world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then they were gone. Floating away like two beautiful balloons. She had the distinct impression that her leg was utterly drenched in <i>something</i>, that she was feeling some altogether electric tingles in her nethers and even her own breasts, and that her clothes were slipping off her body and leaving her completely naked, but she couldn't be bothered to care. The breasts were gone, they were no longer in her face, and would she ever get to see them again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breath hitched as two sharp points poked into her stomach and began to creep along its surface, rubbing the sensitive skin that grew warmer as two great mounds of flesh poured into them. It was enough to tickle her, to make the hairs stand on the back of her neck, to send shivers down her back. Only two things could possibly do that to her, two things in the whole world. And for an instant, she saw them again, hovering over her, just in reach, each as white as a full moon and just as round. Hinata's breasts. They bounced up in the air, the hardened pink nubs at their tips almost directing her attention to the sky before they sank back down, lower and lower. For a moment, Naruto could only feel despair again at the thought of not being able to see them. It ended the second she felt them on her own breasts, just under them to be specific, pushing up against them like yins to yangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Hinata's lips completely enveloped them. Her nipple was pulled into the girl's succulent lips, licked at vivaciously by the girl's tongue, scraped against her teeth in a way that tickled her being. Naruto could only buckle as a jolt of pleasure rang through her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH!\" So that was how it felt...when she sucked Hinata's tits...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne nipple was suckled, the other was tweaked and massaged by the blunette's hand, rolled daintily between her fingertips while she kneaded the delicate flesh around it like clay. Naruto cooed and rolled her head back, content to bask in the sensation as her nubs sizzled, her flesh raised, and something deep within her began to heat up. Especially as Hinata rose to a higher sitting position, rolling her breasts higher atop the mounds of Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wet smack, the Hyuga released Naruto's tit, letting it jiggle in place back on her chest. Naruto glanced up, curious to see what she was up to, and was greeted to the sight of Hinata pulling her legs up. Spreading them out. And pushing them forward. Towards Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi-Hinata,\" she whispered as if to beg her to stop. The naked blue-haired girl was about to effectively fold her in half! She wasn't that flexible! Except it turned out she was, in this body at least. She watched in stunned silence as her own feet were splayed on either side of her head. She imagined this would hurt, she imagined this would be a very uncomfortable position to be in, but for reasons she could not fathom, she didn't feel the least bit of discomfort at all! The only thing she could feel was the sensation of air rushing into her now blooming flower. This body...whatever girl she had turned into was an insane contortionist! The things she could do would likely drive men like Ero-Sennin absolutely mad with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't have much time to ponder the physical potential of her new body before another jolt rattled its way up her spine. Hinata had just about sat on her spread-eagled form in a way that lined their bodies up so they were positioned crotch to crotch. Slit to slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClitoris to clitoris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kami!\" Naruto cried as the storm of pleasure began to rage in her core. \"Kami!\" she cried again once Hinata began to move, swaying her hips in serpentine motions that pushed her ever deeper into the redhead. Naruto could feel <i>everything</i> going on down there, every little movement, every minute shift, so vividly she could practically see it in her mind. She could feel her lover's heartbeat through every pulse of those womanly muscles. She could feel the Hyuga's velvety petals fold against her own. She could feel the lavender-eyed girl's wetness dripping into her being. And she could feel Hinata's moist, fleshy love bud slide its way up and down her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp every fold. Down the groove of her lips. Against her engorged clit. And along every fold once more. Again. And again. And again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kami!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her inner muscles clench. Clench around Hinata. The knees of her outstretched legs bent. She was on the edge. If she so much as twitched, she would fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kami!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands slapped on both cheeks of Hinata's dancing rump, swaying and wriggling as she ground herself harder into Naruto. In the corner of her vision, the former boy swore she could see the blunette's breasts jiggle as she unleashed a happy cry from the sudden touch, but she couldn't be sure. The redhead was dizzy, teetering over the edge of a cliff in her mind, holding a storm inside her virgin womanhood that was going to rush out any moment, and oh, by all that was holy, did Hinata have such a wonderful ass! Soft, tender flesh that just seemed to ooze between her fingers, that grew hotter with warmth and a thickening layer of shiny perspiration that made her slippery all over. Naruto beamed; she had never touched a more sumptuous thing in her life. She didn't ever want to let it go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tightened her hold, squeezed Hinata's buttocks even harder, marveled at how the tender muscles clenched tighter against her. And in doing so, she pushed Hinata even closer into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kami!\" Naruto cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kushi!\" Hinata gasped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata grinded harder and harder into her. Naruto pushed her tighter and grinded back. Their hips circled and bucked into one another, their boobs bounced up and down and side to side, and a chorus of wet squelching sounds accompanied their rising duet of ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto knew she wasn't going to last, not for much longer. There was too much in her, too much heat, too much pressure, too much excitement. \"Hi-Hinata, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna\u2014OHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muscles tensed. Her hips bucked, once, twice! Her legs spread even wider. And she burst! Liquid fire erupted out of her, spilled out of her like a geyser, crashed upon her lover like waves on the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KUSHINAAAAAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Hinata quickly followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHHH! AAHHHH! KAMI! YES! OHHHH! OHHHH! AHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither girl even knew who was even moaning what anymore. Neither girl could tell who was jolting, who was bucking, and who was gushing. And when they were done, neither girl could even tell whose sweet-smelling essence was dripping between their legs and seeping into their crevices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata just about fell to Naruto's side, naked and wet as a fish and breathing like a marathon runner. Naruto joined her, letting gravity carry her legs back to their natural place: under her and around Hinata. Neither girl said anything; they only looked in each other's eyes, smiling breathily, amazed at the experience they had just shared with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Hinata cooed as she pulled Naruto closer to her and planted a gentle kiss on her lips. \"You were wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't...so bad yourself,\" Naruto breathed. She couldn't believe what had just happened. She had sex. With a girl. <i>As</i> a girl. And she loved it! Maybe being in a female body wouldn't be such a bad thing after all. If this is what being a girl was like, she was certain she could get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you married me,\" said Hinata as she embraced her red-haired lover. \"I promise, I'll make you the happiest woman ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Hinata-chan. I think I'd\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute. Did Hinata just say what Naruto thought she said?</span></div></div>",

That's how unfamiliar his reflection was. The girl who looked back at him, and he could tell she was clearly a girl, had skin much paler than his own, and it was absolutely flawless; the whisker-like marks he bore since birth were nowhere to be found. Her face was heart-shaped with round cheeks narrowing down to a slim jaw line and pointed chin. Her nose was both thinner and shorter than his, and it split a pair of slanted eyes. They were blue like his, but they were cold, icy and tinged with grey as opposed to his large cerulean orbs. A very neat and evenly-trimmed fringe of hair that was almost as fair as her skin hung over them and covered her entire forehead. And from what Naruto could see in his reflection, it looked like it extended well past his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How did-\" he said, only to gasp and slam his hands over his mouth. That wasn't his voice at all. His voice, while always a tad high-pitched, never sounded so...feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His face was that of a girl's. His voice was that of a girl's. Which had to mean...Naruto dreaded what he would see if he dared to look down. But he had to. And when he did, he nearly fainted at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh no. No, no, no, no, no!\" he murmured. It wasn't true. It just couldn't be! But indeed, there was something jutting out of 'his' chest just beneath 'his' shirt. It was big enough to nearly block the sight of his feet. Panicked, Naruto pulled off his pajama shirt, which he was finding very difficult to do as the obstructions on his chest were making it a fairly tight fit. But he did it, and upon throwing the garb to the floor, Naruto realized that his worst fears were confirmed: he had two very large and very bouncy breasts. Well, that may have been an exaggeration; they weren't nearly the size of old lady Tsunade's. But they were still bigger than any girl Naruto knew at this age!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon seeing the large female mammaries in their full naked glory, panic truly started to set in as questions were fired off too rapidly for her mind to fully process. <i>'What's happened to me? How did this happen? Who is that? How are her boobs so HUGE? Is this a henge? Was it something I ate?'</i> These questions and so many more shot through the busty blonde's head, the mental stress, plus the fear and panic running rampant in her quickly became too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart started beating wildly in her chest, the sound thundering in her ears as the world around her seemed to start spinning. Her hand latched on to her bathroom countertop, hoping her death grip would help to keep her steady. This ultimately failed as she stumbled about before nearly collapsing to the ground, only just managing to stop herself from face-planting against the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being on her hands and knees, the spinning only seemed to grow worse. Suddenly she felt sick and she started to gag as her body started dry-heaving. <i>'Air! I need air,'</i> thought the blond as she desperately tried to force down the dry-heaving with limited success. Somehow managing to stand, she started stumbling around her apartment, not that she realized this as the only thing on her mind was her desperate need to turn her shallow, panicked gasps into deep, life-giving breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow managing to stumble her way to her balcony, Naruto felt the world lurch out from under her. Instead of her hands catching her like last time, Naruto found her forehead slam against something hard. Her head had collided with the metal handrail, the force knocking her around and forcing her to land painfully on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lied there for a few minutes, in nothing but her pajama bottoms while cradling her head in her hands as she curled up, whimpering pitifully to herself from the pain. It wasn't until after she managed to uncurl herself and simply lay completely on her back that she noticed she wasn't having such a hard time breathing anymore. Taking a few deep breaths, she relished the feel of the cool, crisp morning air traveling to her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit better, the blond slowly stood back up, nearly falling over again due to how badly her body was still shaking from that experience. \"Just what was that about?\" She asked herself in but a whisper. If she had actually been expecting some sort of answer, she would have been seriously disappointed in the lack of receiving one. Still, she did enjoy the cool morning breeze against her naked to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, she remembered what had caused that odd episode. She was a girl, which meant she had boobs. Boobs that were currently being caressed by the cool morning air; where nearly anyone could see her. As if to drive this point home, a particularly chilly gust of wind chose that moment to blow against her front, causing some interesting things to happen with her new female parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a bright red and suddenly feeling horribly embarrassed about her chest showing, Naruto wrapped her arms around herself and ran back inside, silently wondering if it was possible to die from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what does our now feminine hero plan to do next?</span></div></div>",

She went outside and exposed herself for all Konoha to see. What had she been thinking? If someone had been hanging around out there, they would have seen her boobs! Her large, luscious, sensitive boobs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde shook her head. Damn it, she was mixing her priorities up. Naruto's problem wasn't that everyone had potentially seen her breasts. Her problem was that she <i>had</i> breasts for everyone to see, period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How,\" she said, flinching at her own voice, which sounded nothing like her old male self, \"how did this...happen to me? Where...did these things come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whimpered sadly and cupped her breasts with her hands to confirm that, yes, they were real, and no, this was not a dream and she was not going to wake up. Her eyes would have watered as that realization sunk in, but looking down at her new womanly bosoms, the former boy couldn't help but quell the curiosity that was starting to rise within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They're...big</i>, Naruto mused as she pressed her fingers into the large fleshy mounds. <i>Like...really big. Bigger than all the other girls my age that I know of.</i> Indeed, her slender, uncalloused hands could barely fit around the things. And they were squishy too, like a couple of dumplings growing out of her chest. Pressing her hands into them, she couldn't help but think how surreal it looked to see her boobs almost flatten into her palms and sink into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sure enough, upon letting them go, they immediately returned to their original shape and size with a bounce and a slight bob. Naruto couldn't help but jump at that. She could...feel her breasts move, feel the air slide across her almost ticklish flesh as they jiggled. How messed up was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gripped them again, and this time, gave each once a tender squeeze with her fingers. Naruto couldn't help but elicit a moan before letting them go again with another startled jump. That felt...good. Unexpected, but good. Tentatively, she brought her hands up to her breasts again and gave them another squeeze. A mild wave of pleasure swept over her, but Naruto this time was able control herself. So she squeezed them again. And again. Against her chest, into each other, up, down, in and out. The skin on them was so smooth, like a baby's, and they were as soft and warm as the most luxurious pillows Naruto remembered sleeping on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have boobs,\" she whispered as though she was having an epiphany. \"I have boobs!\" Resting her fingers on her nipples, she gave her chest a little shake and watched in amazement as her breasts jiggled. It looked hot to see them quiver and shake like that, and it felt even better. For the moment, Naruto had completely forgotten about her previous apprehension and fear. She had boobs! How awesome was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder how this'll feel?\" Naruto asked herself, giving one of her red nipples a pinch. It looked longer than she remembered when she first laid eyes on it, and she couldn't help but be curious as to why. \"Oh.\" It was...hard, like a little pebble jutting out of her flesh. But it was very sensitive, more so than all the pale girl flesh encompassing it. Just touching it sent a jolt of electricity through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think that's enough playing with myself for one day,\" she muttered. She couldn't just sit in her apartment all day, feeling herself up. Naruto had things to do. So she was going to stand up, take her hands off her breasts, and get on with it. And she was going to do that immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs in soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnytime now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood up on her feet, her hands still clutching her feminine mounds. Slowly, she slid them down the vast expanse of her boobs, gasping as her nipples flicked once the last finger trailed over them. She continued to trace her slender digits across the vast expanse of mammary flesh, tracing her winding womanly curves as they slid down the undersides of her boobs. Soon, Naruto's breasts were completely free of her hands, but they had not yet left her body. They instead trailed down her stomach, which was flat, curved inward at the navel, and hard with a subtle muscular tone that couldn't be seen by the naked eye. In fact, now that she was looking at it, her midriff looked remarkably thin compared to her large breasts and widened hips, but not unhealthily so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good,\" she said, running a hand to her side and down to the round curve of her waist. The rest of her body might not have felt as nice as her breasts, but it was still amazing. She had no words to describe it. However, she stopped when her hand ceased to feel warm skin as it came upon the more familiar cloth of her pajama pants. Naruto looked down at them with a frown. How dare they get in the way of her fun! Hooking her thumbs into the elastic waistband, she flicked them off and let them fall to the floor, exposing her whole naked body to the morning air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice,\" she said, running her hand down her rear, marveling at how taut and firm it felt in her grasp as her fingers followed its gentle curve. She stole a glance behind her. \"Wow,\" she murmured. Her buttocks were so round, each cheek glimmering like a large pale bubble. And like the rest of her new body, they were so smooth, round and sensitive. She gave the globe she grasped a firm squeeze and felt a shudder overcome her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this body does have its perks,\" she said turning her head away from her bare butt. Her gaze, however, stopped when she came upon her crotch. The sight that greeted her was not surprising. Truth be told, Naruto sensed the change the very second she found out she had grown a pair of breasts overnight. But now that she was looking directly at it, the finality of the blonde's situation began to finally sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto Junior was gone. In its place was a thick forest of curly blond hair, a flat womanly mound, a thin slit creeping up between her legs, and the hint of a pink...<i>something</i> peering out from within. It was absolute; Naruto was fully, well and truly a girl now with what appeared to be a completely functional vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former boy frowned, staring at her new set of genitals as that thought  circled its way through her head over and over again. <i>I'm a girl now. I have a vagina. I'm a girl now. I have a vagina. I'm a girl now. I have a vagina...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...wonder how it will feel,\" she said. Licking her lips nervously and reaching a trembling hand forward, the blonde brushed her fingers through her bush, fluffing the wiry hairs as she pushed them aside, and came to a stop in the clearing where her personal valley awaited. She twitched as her nails pressed into the smooth flesh surrounding her womanhood, but she kept her resolve. The last of Naruto's womanly parts awaited, and she had only a few centimeters left to go before she took the plunge.</span></div></div>",

I'll convince her that it's me Uzumaki Naruto! DATTEBAYO!!' Naruto thought with new vigour and walked up to Sakura's front door. When she did she knocked gently and she heard Sakura \"in a minute\".

Oh crap this was a bad idea after all! she'll beat me up to a pulp!' Naruto mentally yelled as she was having double thoughts.

After a few minutes of getting it through her head that Naruto didn\u2019t even know that he had no recollection of what had happened the previous night she had invited Naruto inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder normal circumstance Naruto would have been the happiest guy in the world if he was invited into his crushes house. But the issue at hand was that he was a girl, a cute girl but a girl none the less and it was bothering her that she didn\u2019t know how it happened or why he can\u2019t take the transformation off. Naruto had been told by Sakura to sit down while she brought some snacks for them to eat. Naruto wasn\u2019t hungry as she wanted answers. While Sakura was drinking tea without a care. <br>\r\n\u201cSakura tell me why I am stuck in this form?!\u201d Naruto yelled. Sakura began telling the story:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What was the story?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>1.Naruto and Sasuke made a bet with Sakura that being a girl was easy. So Kakashi had set up an illusion with the two being a girl with a timer and they had been hitting night clubs after night clubs partying like wild girls. (P.S. Since being a ninja means entering adulthood they can drink). But the illusion was supposed to wear off when Naruto had woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.The team happened to go to the hot spring. And Naruto was trying to peek at her. Only luck was that Kurenai and Hinata was there along with Sakura and he had peeked on them instead of her causing Hinata to faint and Kurenai to go in rage mode. Kureai had done something as Sakura had not seen her after Kurenai had taken Naruto somewhere.  The only thing she remembers was the current form Naruto was in as Kurenai had shown her presentation when they were in the female changing rooms. Hinata had fainted again.</b></i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aoi-chan suddenly spasmed but then slumped over and Sakura noticed in shock that Ino began shitting herself while Aoi-chan drooled with a blank look in her eyes. Sakura saw Aoi-chan begin to do the same without a word and she called out to her friend when she saw Aoi-chan\u2019s eyes begin to cross and Ino still not returning to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey ino what the hell, are you still in there? I don\u2019t know why you are making Aoi-chan crap herself but you did the same in your own body and this is weird. Are you okay?\u201d Sakura demanded from the cross eyed blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...am...here.\u201d Ino replied emotionlessly from Aoi-chan\u2019s body while Sakura looked shocked at her friend\u2019s response noticing the slurred way she talked. Sakura began to wonder if while deleting Naruto, Ino deleted herself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIno this isn\u2019t funny, what did you do?\u201d Sakura worriedly asked her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was deleting Naruto as you said and i made a mistake and deleted my personality along with Aoi\u2019s.\u201d Ino replied without hesitation. Sakura looked her with shock but she began to smile knowing that for once Ino would listen without a thought in the world. Sakura realized she now had a mind controller who would do whatever Sakura told her to, and a jinchuriki who existed only how Sakura told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIno if that\u2019s true then install a slave personality inside Aoi that has no thoughts free will or opinions and return to your body. I kinda wanna see if it stuck.\u201d Sakura told Ino who immediately did as she was told and retuned ti her body while Aoi-chan stayed the same even as Ino mindlessly returned to her body and awaited further instruction. Sakura ordered the two to stand side by side and looked at her new slaves with a huge grin on her face knowing they had no problem serving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls stood at attention even though their panties were completely soiled and just stood at attentions.

She did wrinkle her nose though at how both of the girls mindlessly let a dump in their panties but she knew she could definitely enjoy seeing both girls humiliate themselves for her entertainment whenever she wanted and without complaint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura finally arrived at Aoi\u2019s home and both slaves mindlessly shuffled behind her with drool pouring out if their mouths and their minds having been cleaned of free will. Sakura glanced at Ino and saw the embarrassing position she was in even ifgnring her soiled panties. Ino mindlessly drooled and waited for her mistress to command her, same with Aoi as Sakura ordered Aoi to unlock her house for them and she rushed to obey her owner without a sound and once she finished Sakura led the girls to her soaves bedroom and immediently noticed how unbelievably uncomfortable it was and ordered Aoi to tell her how much money she had saved up, same with Ino. Sakura listened shocked to hear Naruto hadn\u2019t been able to save much money at all, while Ino mindlessly reported to have a fair chunk of money saved up over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura decided that Aoi\u2019s apartment needed to be given a massive upgrade so that she could enjoy her slaves in comfort and ordered Ino to fetch every ryo and she enjoyed seeing Ino mindlessly march out to obey her master Sakura while Sakura ordered Aoi to start giving her a foot massage. Sakura realized she forgot to tell Ino to change her clothes but just grinned with a shrug knowing it was kinda hilarious seeing her vain rival just walking around with a dump in her pants and having lost her mind. Sakura enjoyed her massage for an hour until Ino returned with all of her ryo with a blank look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura marched out with her girls and spent every bit of Ino\u2019s money furnishing her slave Aoi\u2019s apartment and getting clothes for both Ino and Aoi with a grin on her face not letting her slaves be seen too much for obvious reasons. Sakura after a few hours noticed her girls pants would probably rip if they didn\u2019t change so she finally let the two clean up which both quietly did as instructed and once they finished, the trio began to clean up Aoi\u2019s apartment and put the new furniture and luxury items Sakura bought in good places. Sakura did enjoy seeing her pets so loyal to her but she was pretty tired by the end of it so she laid on her stomach and ordered Ino to give a foot massage while Aoi would give a back massage using only her new boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sighed in relaxation while the two diligently served her with an empty look in their eyes. Sakura noticed that Aoi was adorable even as she was using her body in a way that her old self would have hated even if it was sexy, all while Aoi was wearing a beautiful dress and even panties and a bra. Sakura smirked though knowing that both of her slaves panties had \u201cproperty of Sakura Haruno\u201d written on the back and their bra\u2019s had the same written on the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smirked and decided that she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura ordered her pets to get up and follow her to recruit the girls she decided to recruit. Aoi mindlessly got up off Sakura\u2019s new bed and stood at attention while ino was using the bathroom but instead of finishing she just got up and pulled her pants up and finished up using her panties instead of the toilet while reporting to Sakura. Sakura cracked up seeing Ino humiliate herself like that but enjoyed the obedience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura lead her girls around konoha until she found Hinata and Hanabi knowing the sisters would make great servants. She finally spotted Hanabi arguing with a boy she had seen Naruto with a few times, Konoharu or something but she decided to wait while ordering Ino to prepare to possess the girl. Sakura finally saw Hanabi storm off and ordered Ino to wipe her mind and give her a copy of Aoi\u2019s mind. Sakura watched ino finish up and saw the new Hanabi walking up to report to her new owner but stopped her and ordered Hanabi to go to Aoi-chan\u2019s house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura groaned knowing that Hinata would still need to found and upgraded but began to walk around flanked by her pets. Sakura amused herself eventually by walking behind Ino and Aoi and seeing the mess the girls had in their pants without minds of their own to help them control it. She was kind of debating how fun it would be if she let Ino convince her she was someone else for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the girls spotted Hinata at an udon restaurant just eating on her own. Ino mindlessly possessed Hinata and finished up payibg with the money that she had found in Hinata\u2019s pockets. Ino quickly brought Hinata\u2019s body to her mistress instead of just reprogramming it because Sakura wanted to watch Hinata be reprogrammed. Sakura walked her girls home while Aoi silently carried Ino in her arms. Once the girls arrived at Sakura\u2019s new apartment, Ino quietly walked Hinata to the middle of the room and installed several triggers that Sakura ordered. She also made Hinata not notice Hanabi. Hanabi herself was just standing at attention stripped of her very sense of self but more than happy to do whatever she was told. Sakura gave Hanabi a maid outfit and ordered the girl to become a new servant 24/7 for the new household. Sakura had every intention of expanding her new apartment by moving the tenants of either side out using Ino and tearing the walls down and giving the new giant apartment a major upgrade but that could wait until later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked at Hinata\u2019s still form with a smug grin knowing that in a few moments the old Hinata would be gone forever replaced with a pleasure bot that would obediently do whatever it was told. Finally Sakura ordered Ino to return to her body after she noticed Ino had messed Hinata's pants and she now had to buy new outfits for new slaves. Hinata stood still as Ino left her but began to groan miserably with a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh what happened? Last i remember i was eating my food and suddenly...EWEWEWEWEW WHY DO MY PANTS FEEL LIKE THAT?!?\u201d Hinata groaned before shrieking while her face turned beet red. Sakura cracked up laughing and Hinata finally noticed Sakura and her pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura? Whats going on? Where am i? W-w-w what d-did you d-do?\u201d Hinata stuttered as Sakura continued laughing while the other girls just sat down blankly. Hinata looked around finally saw Ino shocked figuring out what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHinata hehehe that was greaaaat i haven\u2019t laughed like that in awhile. Where are you? Well you are at your new home Hinaaaa-chaaaaaaan\u201d Sakura grinned at the shocked but angry Hyuuga. Hinata looked confused not understanding until she saw the eyes of the other girls completely blank. Hinata was getting more than a little scared but desperate to escape not noticing in her fear she was filling her pants even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-S-Sakura w-what are you t-talking about? I live with my f-f-family be-because father wants me to. I c-c-cant just move out because of y-you. This is starting t-to make me f-f-feel nervous so l-l-let me g-go Sakura.\u201d Hinata stuttered trembling as she looked at the girls who both looked brain dead. She did NOT want to become like that. She desperately tried to think of a way out but she also knew that Sakura was not alone and didn\u2019t stabd a chance against Sakura AND Ino. She could beat Sakura but would definitely be possessed by Ino eventually but she didn\u2019t see a way out since the blonde girl mindlessly stood in front of the only door and considering most ninja homes had very hardened glass she didn\u2019t have much of a chance at escape but she was more than willing to beg. While Hinata was being terrified Hanabi mindlessly walked between the girls cleaning not that Hinata was capable of seeing her sister anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura put a finger at her chin still grinning and watched the trembling Hinata stumble on her words and figure out what was happening. Sakura crossed her legs in her new fancy chair she bought and crossed her arms. She noticed Hinata looked pathetic at that moment and she enjoyed every bit of it. Suddenly Sakura noticed Hinata\u2019s pants expanding and figured out Hinata was having an accident to her amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHinata it is pretty obvious you are not getting away, may as well relax and let my magic roll right through you hehe don\u2019t you think my lil bot.\u201d Sakura taunted to the terrified Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-N-No w-w-way this c-cant be happening, please let me g-go Sakura! I-I d-dont want to-ACK\u201d Hinata begged before a flashed went through her brain and she began to spasm desperately trying to resist even as her mind was very rapidly going dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSAKURA P-P-PLEASE MAKE IT STOP! IT HURRRRRRRTS! UGH agh agh agh\u201d Hinata shrieked before suddenly she lost consciousness and began to gasp as she was systematically deleted along with all of her free will. Sakura watched Hinata with a huge grin knowing that the shy girl would just become a brainwashed pleasure droid only. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata suddenly gasped one last time and then she started to drool while her eyes crossed and her body slumped over even as her pants started expanding again. Hinata was finally gone and was replaced with her new mistress\u2019s commands. Sakura ordered Hinata to strip to just her panties and watched Hinata do that with the same blank face. Once Hinata finished up she stood at attention with her breasts thrust out and her body standing straight. Sakura looked amused at Hanabi who just ignored her big sister being erased and kept cleaning silently even though it was obvious she was having an accident herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura decied she wanted to...</span></div></div>",

She had a hand pinning both of Hinata's above her head by the wrist while the other fondled one of the previously hidden mounds of soft, firm girl flesh Hinata had been hiding with her baggy jacket. If watching Tenten fondling Hinata's surprisingly bountiful chest wasn't shocking enough, then the sight of said former girl sitting between the laters spread legs and rubbing her pelvis against the younger girls was certainly a sight to see. Then there was the hot kiss Tenten was attacking Hinata's mouth with. Ino swore that she could see tongue involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tenten seemed more then eager to continue or even go further, Hinata seemed of a different mind. The youngest girl of the group was wiggling and squirming around in what could easily be mistaken for pleasure. Ino's trained eye for juicy gossip could easily pick out the signs that Hinata was trying to get away, though her reluctance to hurt Tenten was keeping her from getting away from the older, stronger and clearly more knowledgeable girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno felt her breathing quicken and deepen as she found herself growing turned on by the sight of one of her friends dominating another. Ino had half-a-mind to try and join in on the sexual domination. Still the image of Aoi-chan lingered in her mind making the blond realize that this could be the best chance she'd get to alter their memories of Naruto. Tenten was one thing as the girl had little to no memories involving the previously blond boy, so Ino could easily change what few were there as she pleased. Hinata on the other hand had a lot of memories involving the boy so she'd need to be careful about how she went tampering with those. It wouldn't do to completely change who Hinata was just because Ino was on a mission to remove or lessen Naruto's lingering influence on others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she could just continue watching and see how far Tenten is willing to take this 'training' with Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What does Ino do?</b></span></div></div>",

Once settled she took and and whispered, \"Mind Transfer.\" Her body fell limp as her mind transferred itself deep into the conscious of Tenten who was just taking that moment to break the kiss and breath for what seemed like the first time in minutes. Tenten never felt a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside Tenten's mind, Ino quickly began changing, adding and deleting the girls memories of Naruto. While she was there Ino also took a peek into the older girls thoughts and memories involving her current situation. Thinking for a moment Ino was struck by an idea of how she could alter even this. Instead of trying to actually seduce the younger girl while using the excuse of 'training', Tenten now believed she was helping Hinata learn how to be the dominate force in a lesbian relationship. Ino did not however, mess with the memories of Tenten's secret desires for the young Hy\u016bga girl. She simply felt it would bring more entertainment into this if Tenten was secretly trying to make Hinata hers as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping out of Tenten's head after making the changes, Ino immediately shot herself at Hinata the moment she returned to her body. She had thought it would be somewhat harder to make the needed changes to Hinata, but what she found surprised her. It seemed that memories of Naruto played a key role in who Hinata was as a person. This meant any changes Ino made would affect Hinata's personality so she'd have to be very careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSet on making the needed changes without changing Hinata to much, Ino began by adding memories of Hinata and Naruto either spending time together, or of Hinata as she observed Naruto from a distance. In these memories Hinata learned about Naruto's secret second personality that was a shy young girl. Ino added how Hinata quickly became close with this second persona who she gifted the name Aoi-chan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA genius idea came to Ino then and she made Hinata believe that she was the one who came up with a way to change Naruto into Aoi, reenforcing this by putting the plan to make Aoi her lesbian lover directly into Hinata's head. With that Ino altered the lead up to the current happenings by making Hinata think that she had asked Tenten for teachings on how to be more aggressive and dominating so she could make Aoi hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over her work Ino felt satisfied in knowing that Hinata would remain mostly the same shy and kindhearted girl they all knew, though with these changes she'd also have a more aggressive manner to her when it came to claiming 'her' Aoi-chan. Ino made one last additional memory to make the girl believe she had recruited Ino and Sakura's aid in properly <i>'feminizing'</i> Aoi-chan's new life. Finally finished Ino ended her jutsu and returned to her own body to view the fruits of her recent labors.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't use to the balance of her new body, especially with the tails. Though Naruto had to admit one thing, the tails were a bit useful. They seemed to respond to her thoughts since they moved themselves to keep herself covered. Two draped over her shoulders and rested over her breasts, two more wrapped loosely around her arms, two around her legs, two around her waist and the last tail wrapped around her hips letting the tip rest lazily in front of her womanhood. It was helping to keep her mind focused on the task at hand and warm as well since her clothing didn't fit anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto sat down with her legs crossed, the tails unwrapped themselves and moved to act as a robe. Naruto closed her eyes and focused. She soon found herself inside of her mind scape in front of Kyuubi's seal, \"Kyuubi! What's going on?! Why am I a woman?!!\" Naruto was so focused Kyuubi she hadn't noticed the usual water in her mind was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? It happened already?\" A sweet sultry voice answered from the darkness of the seal. Instead of the usual large red eyes and teeth, Naruto was greeted by a lovely lady walking out of the shadows. D-cup breasts with an almost identical body type as Naruto. Her hair was a crimson red and went down to her nine tails. \"I was wondering when the change would show.\" The lady looked over Naruto, \"I like it, though... I want the breasts to be bigger.\" The lady says pointing at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened her mouth to retort only to be silence as an intense amount of pleasure came from her breasts as a red glow over took them. Naruto dropped to her hands and knees, moaning as the lady smiled. The lady watched as Naruto's breasts grew, going from a B-cup to a C-cup. \"Much better. Not too big, but not too small. Leaves room for you to finish growing too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyuu... Kyuubi! What did... what did you do?!\" Naruto said between pants as the feeling faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically, nothing. This is a result of using my chakra.\" Kyuubi said as she crossed her arms, \"I was sealed in two females before this. That influenced my shape and gave me a humanoid female form, essentially making me a female. Since I was already modeled as a female, your male chakra didn't affect me, however since my chakra is stronger then yours, it steadily started to convert yours. I noticed this and held off any changes to your body until it would all hit at once. Make things less awkward for you. You're welcome.\" Kyuubi said with a smile in a sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto slowly stood up looking surprised and annoyed at once. For one, Kyuubi was seemingly being genuinely nice. For another, she had never said anything about this. \"... You're enjoying this aren't you?\" Naruto said as she walked closer to the seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit. Though this does present an interesting proposition. You now have all the chakra based powers I do but no knowledge to control it. I have that knowledge, but I want to be free. I can teach you if you take off the seal, and I'll even give you my pledge that I will not do any harm to your village.\" Kyuubi said, laying out her terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm going to trust you?! After all you've done to me?!\" Naruto yelled, only to flinch at how loud her voice sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't yell please... Geez I'm surprised you haven't made yourself deaf. As for how I treated you... I was on my period. I apologize.\" Naruto face-vaulted at this. All the anger and hatred... due to a period? \"Yes they're that bad.\" Kyuubi added seeing the look Naruto was giving her, \"Either way you're stuck like that so my offer is the only help you will get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't trust you...\" Naruto said as she stared down Kyuubi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi shrugged, \"Then enjoy explaining your new appearance to the village, your precious people, and trying to remain a shinobi.\" Naruto froze. She hadn't even thought about that yet. All her friends, her family... they would turn on her if they saw this. Kyuubi smirked, \"I can help with that too. Make it to where they don't leave you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked up at Kyuubi, her once defiant eyes now filled with desperation, \"...Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\" Kyuubi answered.</span></div></div>",

Kyuubi smiled and gently embraced Naruto, \"It's going to be okay. I'll take care of you. I promise.\" Kyuubi whispered into her ear. Something about these words brought comfort to Naruto. Perhaps Kyuubi wasn't so bad after all. Naruto was then surprised when she felt Kyuubi kiss her forehead. Kyuubi pulled away and looked into Naruto's violet eyes,\"Now then, we'd best get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, speechless as Kyuubi let her go. She exited the cage and looked at the seal. Her feet lifted off the ground as she floated up to it. With one easy pull, she peeled the seal right off. Kyuubi smiled as she felt her powers channel freely. It felt so nice... She pushed the gate open gently so to not hurt Naruto as she walked out, \"Thank you Naruto. Now it is my turn. First we should meet in the real world.</span></div></div>",

She turned to see Kyuubi sitting on the floor with a red aura around her as she formed ninja hand signs. Before Naruto could ask however, Kyuubi finished, \"Multiverse jutsu!\" A intense red light came from Kyuubi, engulfing Naruto as well. Naruto blinked as the light died down, \"Kyuu... what did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi smiled as she stood up, \"I used a jutsu that swapped our reality with another. In this one, everything that has happened is the same, only everyone knows about me. They all accept you for keeping me safe from another village. They don't know about your change yet however, so we'll still have to explain that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... everything is okay now?\" Naruto asked with joyful tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi walked up and stroked Naruto's cheek, \"Yes dear, everything is alright now. Though we should give you a new name to match your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stopped and thought about what her name could be before replying, \"Naomi Uzumaki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then Naomi.\" Kyuubi said with a smirk as she walked over to the closet and pulled out every orange jumpsuit and pair of sandals Naomi owned, \"Time for your first lesson. Since we don't need these clothes you're going to learn how to use chakra to weave and alter thread.\" Kyuubi said before using her chakra to unravel one jumpsuit completely and have part of it reform as simple underwear before the rest covered in, turning into a Chinese style dress. She then did the same technique on two pairs of sandals, reforming them into a pair of simple heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa....\" Naomi exclaimed as she watched<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll want to imagine your chakra picking the clothing apart thread by thread, then reforming into something else. You can even change the type of texture the outfit will have. Example, this is silk now.\" Kyuubi explained. </span></div></div>",

As they made their way to the Hokage Tower, Naomi noticed she had no problem in the heeled boots she was wearing. She could feel a natural sway of her hips as she moved and actually enjoyed the slight bounce of her breasts that the corset allowed. Perhaps... she was meant to be a girl all along?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she also noticed another feeling as they hopped from rooftop to rooftop. A small warmth below her stomach she couldn't explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi however knew what this feeling was and was using it along with her plan.

Instead Tsunade seemed in awe of Kyuubi's presence and even treated Naomi herself slightly differently. Granted, Naomi was glad it was too different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Kyuubi was finishing up with Tsunade, \"So I'll need some time to teach Naomi here everything she can do now. I hope you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. We don't want her to be in any danger from untrained powers.\" Tsunade says as she starts to fill out a leave of absence form for Naomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now then, I have a personal proposition for you Lady Hokage. May we start a new program?\" Kyuubi asks with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade raises her eyebrow a bit, \"What kind of program?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One where people can become fox demons. I've watched how your village behaves and feel that that some have earned the right to join the ranks of my kind.\" Kyuubi responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm not sure. Something like that could cause...\" Tsunade starts to say before she stops as she looks into Kyuubi's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi's eyes held a strange glow to them as she counters, \"It won't be a problem. It would be completely voluntary for them and I will be the final judge of if the person is allowed to become a demon fox. No other will become the same level as myself or Naomi, but their power will increase exponentially. Thus they will be much more helpful to the village. Will you not consider it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Very well. A trial basis first. If the first few turn out well then we can expand it. They will be your responsibility however.\" Tsunade responds as Kyuubi's eyes stop glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Thank you very much. One thing to know about this however. Since myself and Naomi are both female, any male we turn will become female for the same reason my chakra turned Naomi into a female. So be sure to put that in the obvious print.\" Kyuubi adds before she taps her cheek, \"I believe that is everything. Oh! Can you send that pink haired teammate of Naomi's over in a bit? I'm a bit out of touch with some things and having her around may help Naomi adjust more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can arrange that. Sakura should be having a slow day at the hospital based on her reports. I'll have her meet you there shortly.\" Tsunade says as she leans back, \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope that is everything. I'll be returning back to Naomi's apartment with her now. See you another time.\" Kyuubi says before she walks over to Naomi, \"Time to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi snaps out of her thoughts and nods. She stands up and says quietly, \"Kyuu... I feel strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange? Hm... I may know what it is but we have to return home before I can help you. Come on.\" Kyuubi says as she takes Naomi's hand.
