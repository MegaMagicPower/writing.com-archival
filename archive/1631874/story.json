Must would think a ninja village would be more alert to this, especially after the Kyuubi attack around 7 years ago.<br>\r\nThe shadowed humanoid peered out upon the quaint, sleeping village and let out a dark eerie chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u201cSleep my puppets. Sleep you filthy human worms. These may be my final moments in this realm, but I give you a parting gift. It\u2019s a big one, and it\u2019s sure to cause some chaos.\u201d</b> He said in a hoarse, demonic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dark stranger sat cross-legged in mid-air and began chanting what sound gibberish. Very demonic and dark gibberish. Black fog hovered over Konoha, dimming the moonlight somewhat. The two chunin guards on duty noticed it, but carelessly dismissed it a large cloud or such, and not anything to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Little did they know they had just dismissed an event that would very soon become the biggest news in the history of Hi no Kuni (Land of Fire), maybe even the whole world. None would be able to reverse the spell that had been cast, and would make itself known in a few short hours, for two reasons (1.) They all rely of jutsus, and had dismissed the are of magic years ago after it mutated in to the <i>\u2018stronger\u2019</i> art of jutsu as some arrogant historians might say and (2.) They were all human mortals. It was likely to be permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The figure grinned and spoke to the wind, <b>\u201cFarewell, you insects! I can\u2019t and won\u2019t return fore a long while, but rest assured that I, Giga no Ma\u014d, will be watching you use my \u2018gift\u2019. Sayonara whelps!\u201d</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next morning around 5:00 a.m., everyone in Konoha was awoken by the banshee scream that only one of the Haruno clan could achieve. That was followed by several other screams from different points in the village. About an hour later, there were several exasperated parents in the Hokage\u2019s office. Somehow, four little girls around 6 to 8 years had, at some point during the night, grew to almost twenty feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <i>'That\u2019s not the worst of it,\u2019</i> thought the Sandaime (the third hokage), <i>\u2018Why in the great word did it have to happen to the children of the most over-reactive parents in Konoha!?\u2019</i>   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He was right this strange event had occurred in Haruno Sakura, Yamanaka Ino, Hyuuga Hinata, and Tenten. However, the worst part is that it was Wednesday, meaning they had to go to their Academy classes today. One can only imagine the amount of dread that Sarutobi would feel when he realized that he\u2019d not even make a dent in the amount of paperwork that this strange happening would result in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Choice 1: At the academy; Girl\u2019s P.O.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: At the academy; Boy\u2019s P.O.V.</i></span></div></div>",

So naturally he decided to just go ahead and go early. After about an hour, all of the class was there except for four of the girls. Iruka walked in and began class. Sasuke was brooding over by the window. Kiba was talking with Akamaru. Shikamaru was, what a surprise, sleeping. Choji was munching on a bag of chips. Shino was being...well Shino. <br>\r\nThere were three guests in the room. One was a strange....umm....i guess it was human, so a strange man in green spandex and orange leg-warmers, a bowl cut, a what appeared to be caterpillars for eyebrows. Next was a 'mini-me' of the strange man, complete with 'caterpillars'. The final guest was obviously a Hyuuga, judging from the pearly-white eyes and \"stick-up-the-ass\" attitude.<br>\r\n\"Okay class, sit down and shut up! We have guests today, this is Team Gai. They are one year ahead of you, and have been given the honor of talking to this class.\" <br>\r\nThe strange man, Maito Gai, jumped in front of Iruka and yelled for all to hear, \" GREETINGS YOUTHFUL STUDENTS!! I AM KONOHA'S LEGENDARY GREEN BEAST, MAITO GAI!!!!!  MY YOUTHFUL TEAM WA PICK TO TALK TO THE SELECT FEW OF YOU ABOUT THE POWER OF YOUTH!!! However, my youthful kunochi student, Tenten, is apparently sick today... BUT THAT IS OKAY FOR AS SHE FIGHTS THE UNYOUTHFUL SICKNESS, WE WILL INFORM THE YOUNGER GENERATION ABOUT THE POWER OF YOU-\"<br>\r\nHe was interrupted by a knock on the door, which opened to reveal the Sandiame Hokage.<br>\r\n\"H-Hokage-sama,\" Iruka stuttered with a salute.<br>\r\n\"Now, now Iruka. I came make sure a couple of your students were safe.\"<br>\r\n\"Umm...If I may Hokage-sama...what do you mean?\"<br>\r\nThe old man sighed. \"Well last night due to some unexplainable event, four of your kunoichis-in-training have gone through MASSIVE changes.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I still don't fully understand what you mean, Hokage-sama.\"<br>\r\nThe Sandaime sighed once again. \" I had a feeling you wouldn't. Ok girls, come in\"<br>\r\nThe door opened and in walked the missing girls. The hokage was correct when he said they had gone through changes. THEY WERE 20+ FEET TALL!!!!<br>\r\n' Holy S***!!!', thought our young six year old protagonist. Naruto looked at them and shocked at the beauty that caught his eye. He'd love to play with her, despite the risk of 'The Cooties'. He might even try and ask her out. He didn't care that she was now twenty feet tall, all he cared was that she was beautiful! Unfortunatley he knew he couldn't ever have a romantic relationship with her. He wasn't completely a moron, so he knew that the villagers would begin to hate her for dating the 'demon brat'. So he decided he would try to be a best friend to the ,in his eyes,stunning beauty that was know as....</span></div></div>",

Nobody's life changed too much, infact two lives in Konoha had got better. These two were Uzumaki Naruto and Hyuuga Hinata. The two were best friends.They talked when possible, ate luch together, and sat together in class. The one person who both thought would disagree with their friendship the most, Hiashi, Hinata's father, had neither objected nor approved of it. This due to him abandoning the heiress training of his \"Giant Freak of a Daughter\" and began focusing on Hanabi. She had become more shy and withdrawn around all but Naruto.<br>\r\nWe join the two sitting under a tree, eating lunch...well Hinata was sitting next to the tree with Naruto sitting on her lap.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hinata-chan, Can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\nHinata looked down at him. \"YesNaruto-kun?\"<br>\r\n\"D-Do you think I'll pass the genin exams tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course you'll pass Naruto-kun,\" she answered reassuringly, while picking him up into a friendly hug, looking much more like a little girl hugging a doll.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Hinata-chan! I love your hugs!\"<br>\r\n Just then a group of kids came up to the giant girl and her small friend. They start laughing and pointing at the two.<br>\r\n\"Hahaha....Look the dead-last and Hyuug-mongous are a couple! They were made for each other! They're both freaks after all!\", one of the kids said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah dead-last finally found someone! you know, my mom told me that he's a demon! (Elsewhere: Two ANBU carried of an woman to her execution for breaking the Sandaime's law of not talking about the Kyuubi to anyone of the younger generation.) Since he is a demon, I guess that makes Miss Hyuug-monous his mate and bitc-\"<br>\r\nHe didn't finish that sentence as he was sent flying by a fist thrown by Naruto. With Slitted red eyes, he glared at the bully. \" Listen hear you asshole! I don't give a damn if you make fun of me, I'm used to being hated, but ifyou ever make fun of Hinata-chan or call her names again I will hunt you to the ends of the world and kill you. I don't care who I have to fight! If you rips my arms out, I'll kick you to death! If you rips my legs off, I'll bite you to death! If you rips my head off, I'll stare you to death! And if you gouges out my eyes, I'll curse you from the grave! Even If I'm torn to shreds, I will kill you! So don't you dare do it again!\"<br>\r\nHinata was surprised that Naruto would do that for her. She sawone of the other kids from the group about to stab him with a kunai and had her hand between the two before either realized it.Naruto turned to his giantess friend to fing her hand was bleeding, not much kind of the amount you get if you got stabbed by a needle, but bleeding non-the-less. \"Don't you dare harm Naruto-kun!\" <br>\r\nAfter a glare from Hinata, suprisingly, they ran away.</span></div></div>",
