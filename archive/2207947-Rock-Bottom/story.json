            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Amelia Tucker; I\u2019m the Director of Public Relations for Benson Financial Services, a company was started by my dad George Benson.  I live in a quiet neighborhood with my husband Garrett and our twin sons, Jamie and Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy am I telling you all of this?  I\u2019m telling you this because I wasn\u2019t always a 26-year-old married woman with two, soon to be three, children.  In fact; up until about 2 years ago, I wasn\u2019t even a woman.  My name used to be Andrew Benson; and I was a spoiled, misogynistic bastard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything that I had in my life had been given to me; I never had to work for anything.  But that was nothing compared to how I treated women \u2013 not even close.  I thought that I was God\u2019s gift to women and that I could do whatever I wanted with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought everything was going great for me; I had an amazing girlfriend and a well-paying job at my dad\u2019s company.  That was until I slipped up and made a complete ass of myself at a company party.  As a result, I was forced to live as a woman for a year; working as an assistant to a man that I\u2019d recently hired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey say you have to hit rock bottom before you can build yourself back up.  That was certainly the case for me; as it took losing everything that I thought was important to find out that I actually had nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following is a chronicle of everything that changed me from the man I was to the woman I became.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was in a great mood as I walked out of my condo that Monday after the July 4th weekend.  After going to a company party, I spent the weekend with some old frat buddies; we drank, got some girls \u2013 it was a blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I entered the parking garage, I walked towards my recently purchased 2019 BMW 3 Series.  <i><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">When I bought that car, I told myself I was doing it to get girls.  Now whenever I see some guy driving around in one, I can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s just overcompensating for something.  None of my single girlfriends found guys who have them to be very attractive.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing into the car, I heard my cell phone start to ring.  A quick look at the dash showed it was my girl, Heather.  With a smile on my face, I answered it and said, \u201cHey babe, I missed you this weekend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you really miss me, Andrew?\u201d angry, Heather said, \u201cSeems to me like you had plenty of fun without me this weekend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea what Heather was talking about as I pulled out of the parking garage.  \u201cWhoa babe, what are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw Danny\u2019s Instagram, you bastard; you were making out with that blonde slut at his condo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst off, she\u2019s not a slut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s supposed to make it alright?\u201d scoffing, Heather said, \u201cI\u2019m tired of being treated like I don\u2019t matter; I deserve a real guy who loves me.  We\u2019re through!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather ended the call before I could respond.  <i><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">With the benefit of hindsight, Heather was right; she did deserve a better guy.  I\u2019m happy to say that she did; having just gotten engaged to a great guy who treats her better than Andrew ever did.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe abrupt end of my relationship with Heather put a damper on my spirits as I continued the drive into work.  But it didn\u2019t last long, because within minutes I\u2019d already decided to go to the bar tonight and find some girl to bring home.  \u201cThere are plenty of girls out there for me; I\u2019ll have a new girlfriend by the end of the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>I hope that my sons won\u2019t treat women like that when they\u2019re older.  I also hope they\u2019ll protect their sister from men like that \u2013 that\u2019s right, Garrett and I just found out we\u2019re having a girl.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled into the Gateway Business Park ten minutes later; driving up to my reserved spot outside the building that housed the family business \u2013 Benson Financial Services.  Getting out of the car, I walked into the building; waving at the receptionist as I walked by.  I was a bit confused when I saw her simply glare at me as I walked by, but I brushed it off as I took the elevator to the 3rd floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked down the hall I came across my secretary, the beautiful Ms. Jessica Robinson, standing in front of the filing cabinet with her back turned to me.  <i>Maybe I\u2019ll ask her out for drinks tonight.</i>  Walking up behind her, I grabbed her by the waist and said, \u201cGood morning, beautiful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica reacted by squealing in shock as she pulled away.  Turning to look at me, her a mixture of fright and anger, she said, \u201cGood morning, Mr. Benson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking past her, into my office, I said, \u201cWhat do I have on the schedule today, Ms. Robinson?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father wanted to see you as soon as you came in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I could make time for the old man.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWhen I get back, I want to see the paperwork on the River Freight account.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>I want to stress that I now have a good relationship with my Dad; he\u2019s been nothing but supportive with everything over the last few years.  I know it sounds clich\u00e9, but I likely wouldn\u2019t be the woman I am today if it weren\u2019t for him.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went down the hall and took the elevator to the 4th floor.  As I got out of the elevator, I walked by a small number of women standing by the copier.  It was then that I started to notice a pattern; a lot of women were giving me angry looks today.  <i>What did I ever do to them?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped outside of my dad\u2019s office; seeing his secretary, Helen Potts, sitting at her desk.  Good morning, Helen; I\u2019m here to speak with my father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo right in, Mr. Benson; he\u2019s been waiting for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking passed her; I opened the door and walked into Dad\u2019s office.  I found him sitting at his desk with Michelle Harding, the company lawyer, standing behind him.  \u201cHey, Dad, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClose the door and have a seat, Andrew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door, wondering what was going on, I took a seat across from him.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Dad?\u201d looking at Michelle, I said, \u201cWhy\u2019s Michelle here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve dug yourself into quite a hole, Andrew.\u201d Sighing, Dad said, \u201cHalf the secretarial has threatened to file a sexual harassment lawsuit because of your actions at the party Friday night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What\u2019s wrong with how I acted at the party?</i>  \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal, so I had a couple of drinks and had some fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve received complaints from eight women who said you were behaving inappropriately towards them at the party.\u201d  Opening the file in her hands, Michelle pushed it towards me and said, \u201cWhile most of the complaints state you harassed them with flirtatious behavior, some of them stated you touched them inappropriately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, that\u2019s all bullshit.\u201d Scoffing, I turned to Dad and said, \u201cI\u2019ve always been nothing but a gentleman to the female staff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would keep your mouth shut if I were you.\u201d Sighing, Dad said, \u201cYou\u2019re in enough trouble already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Dad...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe quiet Andrew!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went silent as Michelle went back to her file.  \u201cI\u2019m afraid these aren\u2019t the first complaints we\u2019ve received about your actions towards women.\u201d Rifling through the file again, Michelle said, \u201cIn the last year alone, I\u2019ve had to quash three sexual harassment lawsuits; one from a client who said you made sexist remarks towards her regarding her pregnancy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think it\u2019s only to note that I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of pregnancy-related harassment a few times.  Mainly from older clients who think a woman should focus on her family instead of her career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what happens now?\u201d with a cocky chuckle, I said, \u201cDo I have to issue some apology and promise to treat women better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to participate in sensitivity training after which, yes, you\u2019ll have to give each of the women an apology.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I have to sit through some stupid class; that\u2019ll be a piece of cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExchanging a look with Dad, Michelle turned to me and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a little more complicated than that.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cIn order for you to get the most out of the training; you\u2019ll have to live as a woman for one year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in disbelief; there was no way Michelle was serious.  \u201cIf that\u2019s your idea of a joke, Michelle, it needs some serious work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not joking, Andrew.\u201d Stepping around the desk, Michelle sat in front of me and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll live as a woman for one year; experiencing the same harassment that other women experience every day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Michelle, I turned to Dad as panic started to settle in.  \u201cDad, please tell me you\u2019re not going along with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a problem, Andrew; one that practically writes its own hashtags.\u201d Sighing, Dad looked at me and said, \u201cThankfully this is a problem with a solution.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s abundantly clear that you don\u2019t respect women the way you should; based on the complaints and the contempt your showing Michelle.\u201d Getting up, Dad leaned across the desk and said, \u201cI can only imagine how you\u2019d be having this conversation if it was with your mother or sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was becoming abundantly clear that the conversation was turning against me.  If Dad was willing to turn me into a woman, what would he do if I resisted?  Dozens of worst-case scenarios started to play through my mind \u2013 chief among them the idea that I\u2019d be cut off.  Trying to improve the situation, I said, \u201cAlright, so maybe I do have a problem with women.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a problem with women, Andrew; you ARE a problem with women.\u201d Gesturing to Michelle, Dad said, \u201cThankfully Michelle has given us a solution to that problem once and for all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, you\u2019re talking about turning me INTO a woman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Sighing, Dad said, \u201cMaybe then you\u2019ll realize how terrible you\u2019ve treated them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>I wish I could go back and tell my past self not to worry; that what was coming wasn\u2019t the end of the world.</i></span>  Getting up, I headed towards the door.  \u201cYou\u2019re crazy if you think I\u2019ll let you get away with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you go out that door I\u2019m cutting you out of my will.\u201d Sighing, Dad said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be left with nothing; no job, no inheritance, nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached out to grab the doorknob, only to stop and pull back.</span></div></div>",

I may not have believed that he was serious about turning me into a woman, but I wasn\u2019t about to risk being cut off.  Turning around, I walked back to the desk and sat down.  \u201cLet\u2019s say I believe you; what happens to me now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecurity will be asked to escort you from the building; we\u2019ll come up with some reason to explain why you had to leave.\u201d  Looking at me, Dad said, \u201cAfter the procedure, you\u2019ll have one day to adjust and then you\u2019ll be back here on Wednesday for your first day as a secretary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t believe this was really happening.

After making a stop of the liquor store, I drove back to my condo.  With a 6 pack of beer in hand, I walked out onto the enclosed porch and looked out over the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I took out a bottle to drink, I started thinking about the absurd punishment I was given for something I didn\u2019t do.  <i><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">I did later realize that what I\u2019d done to those girls was wrong, but at that point, I wasn\u2019t ready to accept it.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was looking out over the water, drinking my 3rd bottle of beer, when I heard a knock at the door.  I wondered who could possibly be at the door; since, as far as anyone knew, I was supposed to be at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBottle in hand, I walked through the main room.  Opening the door, I found my younger sister Emily standing there; an inter-office envelope in her hands.  Emily and I both worked for Dad; while I worked in the Accounting Department, she worked in the Legal Department.  Looking at her standing then, in her neatly pressed skirt suit, I said, \u201cWhat do you want, Emily?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsidering the trouble you\u2019re in, Andrew; I\u2019d drop the attitude.\u201d Walking through the door, Emily said, \u201cDad sent me over here to have you sign a contract saying you agreed to do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was pressured into agreeing with this.\u201d Closing the door, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not signing anything that involves me becoming a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily made her way towards the kitchen area; helping herself to a bottle of water from my fridge.  Bitch doesn\u2019t even ask; she just goes right ahead.  \u201cLook, I\u2019m not happy about this either; I can\u2019t stand the idea of both of us sharing the same gender.\u201d Placing the envelope on the counter, Emily said, \u201cBut it\u2019s either this or you\u2019re cut from the will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would\u2019ve thought you of all people would love to have me out of the will.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWith me gone that would mean more for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>To this day I regret saying that; because Emily is one of the hardest working people I know.  She could\u2019ve gotten a job at a major firm in the city, but she decided to work for Dad instead.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile that does appeal to me, I still think it\u2019s in your best interest to sign this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou realize what they want me to do, right?\u201d scoffing, I said, \u201cDad and that bitch Michelle think that forcing me to be a woman will help me?  What can I possibly learn from being a weak, pathetic woman that I don\u2019t already know from being a guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about learning what it\u2019s like to be on the receiving end of sexual harassment?\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201cThen just maybe I could have my older brother back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">Emily and I used to be inseparable as kids, but we slowly grew apart.

Putting the beer down, I said, \u201cJust give me the damn thing so I can sign it and get you out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, once you sign it, I\u2019m supposed to bring you to the hospital for the procedure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI begrudgingly signed the papers; while doing so, I looked at Emily said, \u201cTell me the truth; how long have you known about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad and Michelle came up with this idea months ago; after it became clear you were becoming a problem for the company.\u201d  <br>\r\nLeaning against the wall, Emily said, \u201cBut if you\u2019re talking about what happened at the party; I found out that night.  One of the girls that you harassed happened to be my assistant.  After she told me what happened, I told her to file the complaint.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis was your idea?\u201d slamming the pen down on the table, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re the reason I have to spend the next year living as a woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsettled by my outburst, Emily said, \u201cAs I said, this is for your own good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d Shoving the contract towards Emily, I said, \u201cThere\u2019s your stupid contract; now let's go to the hospital and get this over with.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But in light of the fact that I\u2019d already had 3 beers before noon, I wasn\u2019t going to make a big deal about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily drove down the road, I turned to her and said, \u201cSo what does Mom think of Dad\u2019s plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was hoping it wouldn\u2019t come to this.\u201d Sighing, Emily said, \u201cBut she agrees with dad that it\u2019s for your own good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let me get this straight; everyone, including the bitch Michelle, knew about this plan except for me?\u201d my head suddenly pounding, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think I should have been told about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad thought it would be better if you were kept in the dark.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s say, for argument's sake, that I do mistreat women.\u201d looking at Emily, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think I would\u2019ve changed my attitude if I knew this could happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we\u2019ll never know now, will we?\u201d coming to a stoplight, Emily retrieved another envelope from her back seat.

The first thing that caught my eye was a birth certificate that said \u2013 Amelia Renee Sullivan.  There was also a social security card that said the same name.  I started to wonder how they could create these documents when I realized they\u2019d found a way to forcibly turn me into a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until I found a small envelope containing keys; to both an apartment and a car, that I had to question what was happening.  \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with these keys, Emily?\u201d looking at her, I said, \u201cI already have a condo and a car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot anymore, you don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really think a secretary can afford to live in a $50,000 condo and drive a BMW?\u201d turning to me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the best you can afford is a fourth-floor walkup and a 2003 Camry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is bullshit!\u201d throwing everything on the ground, I said, \u201cWhen Dad and Michelle forced this on me, they said nothing about me living like a poor person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I feel I should mention that my dad\u2019s company pays its secretaries very well.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, Amelia; that\u2019s all you can afford on your salary.\u201d Pulling into the hospital parking lot, Emily said, \u201cPerhaps if you\u2019d focused more on classes in college instead of sleeping around, you would\u2019ve gotten a better job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us got out of the car, I turned to Emily and said, \u201cJust so you know, I\u2019m going to make sure everyone regrets doing this to me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She must\u2019ve called ahead or something; because upon stepping out of the elevator, we were met with two nurses.  They gestured for us to follow them down the hall; in doing so, I noticed them giving me looks of disdain.  <i>Do they know what\u2019s about to happen to me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing me into an empty room, her disdain evident in her tone, one of the nurses handed me a hospital gown.  \u201cTake off your clothes and put this on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d barely had a chance to put on the gown before a doctor walked into the room.  She looked to be in her mid-30s; part of me imagined asking her out if I\u2019d seen her at a bar.  \u201cAre you Andrew Benson?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess she\u2019s not one for pleasantries.</i> \u201cYeah; for a while longer at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease lie down on the bed.\u201d Walking towards me, with two syringes in her hand, she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a muscle relaxer first; it\u2019ll help make the procedure easier for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[i}Lady, you\u2019re talking about turning me into a woman.  Nothing is going to make that easier for me.  After I lied down on the bed, she injected me with the muscle relaxer; followed by the other injection.  \u201cSo how is this supposed to work, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe procedure involves nanotechnology.\u201d Removing her gloves, the doctor said, \u201cI should warn you; if you should become pregnant, we won\u2019t be able to reverse the procedure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Believe me lady; I have no intention of getting pregnant.</i>  \u201cI\u2019ll try to keep that in mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying another word, she left the room.  I wanted to wave goodbye but suddenly found that I couldn\u2019t move.  I wanted to ask why, when my skin started tingling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I laid the table, unable to move, I became aware of two different sensations: a growing weight on my chest followed by an unnerving, diminishing feeling below my waist.  <i>Sorry girls, this wasn\u2019t my idea.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*For the record, women aren\u2019t as interested in the size of a man\u2019s package as they think we are.  What we really care about is whether they have a good personality.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes the tingling subsided and I got the feeling back in my limbs.  I tried sitting up but found my sense of balance was off.  After some trial and error, I corrected for the difference and sat up on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes passed and I felt confident enough to try walking.  I made my way across to a full-length mirror and got my first look at my new reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was now a hot blonde.  Almost on impulse, I took off the gown and checked myself out.  I had D-cup breasts and an hourglass figure.  On top of that I couldn\u2019t have been more than 5\u20195\u201d; a far cry from just minutes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving my boobs a squeeze, I said, \u201cAt least I\u2019m a good looking girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily must\u2019ve walked into the room at that point.  \u201cCongratulations; you\u2019ve finally found a woman you can grope without her reporting you to HR.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Part of me was tempted to just walk out in the hospital gown, but that wasn\u2019t a very good idea.  With little recourse, I begrudgingly changed into the outfit.  I stumbled a few times as I walked down the hall but thankfully I didn\u2019t fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked past the nurses\u2019 station, one of the nurses said, \u201cMs. Sullivan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost continued walking until I remembered that was my name now.  Turning around, I walked back to the desk and said, <br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a purse on the counter, along with the set of keys from earlier, the nurse said, \u201cThese were left for you; along with a note.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging through the purse, I found the note:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ms. Sullivan,<br>\r\nYour car is parked on Level 4, Spot 110.  Try not to be late on your first day.<br>\r\nMs. Benson</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thanking the nurse, I grabbed everything and started towards the elevator.  Once I was on the ground floor, I made my way out of the lobby; noticing some people looking at me as I walked past.  If only they knew I wasn\u2019t always a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the parking garage, I quickly found the 2003 Camry that was now my car.  Looking at it, I couldn\u2019t believe the piece of junk before me was my transportation for the next year.  *The car was actually quite nice; I just didn\u2019t want to admit it at that point.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into the car, I spent a few minutes making myself as comfortable as I could.  <i>Damn seatbelt keeps squishing my breasts.</i>  Once I was settled, I turned the car on and drove out of the garage.  Stopping at the hospital exit, I wondered where I should go first.</span></div></div>",

Settling on making a complete fool of myself in public, I decided to go to the mall to buy some outfits for the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a quick 10-minute drive to the mall; I parked close to the entrance so I didn\u2019t have far to walk.  As I made my way to the door I noticed a man, probably a few years younger than me, standing by the door.  <i>Why\u2019s this guy just standing there?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to ask what he was doing when he suddenly reached over and opened the door for me.  Surprised by the gesture, all <br>\r\nI could manage was a quick \u2018thank you\u2019 as I walked by.  The man smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked into the mall, I turned around and caught a glimpse of the guy staring at my ass before I rounded the corner.  <i>If only he knew the truth about me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly made my way through the mall to Macy\u2019s; where I found myself looking through the dresses they had on the wall.  I was looking at a black dress when a sales clerk walked up to me.  \u201cCan I help you, ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning in the direction of the voice, I saw a young girl standing there; probably no more than 18 or 19.  If I had been a guy, I totally would\u2019ve been flirting with her right now.  \u201cYeah, I\u2019m looking for something that I can wear to the club.\u201d  Putting on a fake smile, I said, \u201cI just broke up with my boyfriend and I could totally go for some rebound sex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you definitely have an eye for fashion.\u201d Smiling, the girl said, \u201cI wear a dress similar to this when I go clubbing with my girls.  With this dress and your figure, you\u2019ll be very popular in the club scene.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was just what I wanted to hear; if my family caught wind of me hanging out the clubs with a bunch of guys, they\u2019d quickly decide to change me back.  *I can\u2019t believe how na\u00efve I was back then.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the advice.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll take this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled and walked off; giving me a chance to check her out as she did.  Taking the dress off the rack, I went over to a mirror and held it up to my body.  <i>Damn girl, you\u2019ll look hot in this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the dress in hand, I went to the register to pay for it.  It was only then that I wondered how I was going to do so; Emily had mentioned I no longer had access to my bank account.  Digging through the purse, I found a debit card from a local bank.  <i>I guess that\u2019s better than nothing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying for the dress, I decided to get something to eat at the food court before leaving.  I can only imagine what people were thinking when they saw me scarf down a huge cheeseburger.  *I thankfully rarely eat fast food now; mostly when I\u2019m out shopping with the twins.  Otherwise, I try my best to maintain my figure.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was done at the mall, I walked back out to the car.  As I got inside, I quickly realized I was close to my mom's art gallery.  Emily had told me Mom knew what Dad had planned for me, but I had to find out for myself.</span></div></div>",

I was slowly getting the hang of walking in heels, but each click-clack on the tile floor served as a reminder that I was no longer a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I generally try not to wear heels if I can avoid them; they\u2019re terrible on my back.

The only saving grace that I could see was that it was in a relatively quiet area; other than that, the place was rather dingy for my tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter parking the car in front of my building, I grabbed my things and went inside.  I silently cursed Emily for making we wear heels; because I wasn\u2019t ready to walk upstairs wearing them.  I eventually reached the apartment, #405, and let myself inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I hated what the place looked like on the outside, my opinion of the inside wasn\u2019t that far off.  The apartment consisted of a small living area; with a detached kitchen to one side plus a hallway leading to a bathroom and bedroom.  The furniture, from what I could tell, was rather old; reminding me of something you\u2019d see in a retirement home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*The apartment wasn\u2019t actually all that bad; I just didn\u2019t want to admit it at the time.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the bedroom, I noticed the closet was filled with an assortment of dresses and skirt suits.  Throwing the dress I\u2019d just bought on the bed, I collapsed onto the mattress.  \u201cThis has to be a dream; this can\u2019t really be my life now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lying there for a few minutes, I sat up and found my attention drawn to a series of picture frames on the dresser.  Going over for a closer look, I saw there were pictures of me; or at least the blonde bitch that I\u2019d been turned into.  That wasn\u2019t the only thing that caught my attention \u2013 the photos were of me with other people in a variety of locations; college graduation, on a beach wearing a bikini, and what looked to be some formal dance with other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If they can turn me into a girl, I suppose it\u2019s not too hard to make some fake photos.</i>  Leaving the bedroom, I realized that I hadn\u2019t used the bathroom yet in my new body.  I was about to walk to the bathroom when there was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to the door, I looked through the peephole and saw some brunette standing there.  For some reason, she looked very familiar to me.  Opening the door, I said, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Marcy, I live across the hall.\u201d Extending her hand, Marcy said, \u201cI heard some movement inside and thought I\u2019d come to introduce myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Marcy.\u201d Shaking her hand, I said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat brings you to town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you.</i>  \u201cWork.\u201d Trying my best to look cordial, I said, \u201cI just got a job as a secretary at Benson Financial Services.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d looking at me, Marcy said, \u201cI work in the Accounting department there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That\u2019s how I know her!</i>  \u201cTalk about a small world, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right!\u201d chuckling, Marcy looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m going out clubbing tonight with some girls from work.  You want to come along and get to know some people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would play perfectly into my plan to force my parents to change me back.  \u201cSure, I\u2019d love to.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI just bought the perfect dress for the occasion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to that new club, Elysium that just opened up on 5th Avenue.\u201d Smiling, Marcy said, \u201cHow about we meet down in the lobby at 6:30 and we can go together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time today, I was surprised by the kindness shown me by two women who I didn\u2019t know.  \u201cSounds like a plan to me, I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Having never taken a shower in a woman\u2019s body, I had no real clue about what to do next.  All I had to go on was memories of what Heather and Emily would do \u2013 the first step was to dry my hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I rummaged through the cabinets for a hairdryer, I made a mental note \u2013 if I was going to be stuck in this situation for the foreseeable future, I\u2019ll need to learn how to take care of myself.  Once my hair was sufficiently dried, I put the hairdryer down and walked across the hall to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning my attention to the dress I\u2019d purchased, I decided it was time to put it on.  It ended up being a little snug but it wasn\u2019t uncomfortable.  If anything it was snug in just the right places \u2013 exemplifying my breasts and my figure.  <i>Boys won\u2019t be able to keep their hands off me tonight.</i>  At that moment I realized what exactly I was doing; I was making myself look sexy to attract a guy\u2019s attention.  Having recently been a guy myself, the notion wasn\u2019t something I was comfortable with; but it was something that needed to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back into the bathroom, I finished working on my hair before proceeding to the makeup.  Having been one, I knew what boys liked; so I simply put on enough makeup to make myself look good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I never really bought into the idea that a girl has to make herself look trampy to attract a guy.  Garrett would tell you that it was my personality that drew him to me.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after 6:00 when I walked out of the bathroom; feeling satisfied with my appearance.  Remembering that Marcy said to meet her downstairs at 6:30, I went to the closet to find some shoes to wear.  <i>I need to have a word with whoever filled this closet.</i>  After finding a pair of shoes that seemed to go with the dress, I quickly put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my purse in hand; along with my keys and my cell phone, I left the apartment around 6:25.  I barely made it five feet before I heard a voice behind me say, \u201cGirl, you look amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, I saw Marcy walking towards me wearing what appeared to a mini-dress.  I had to admit that she looked great as well.  \u201cYou look amazing too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe boys will be all over us tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This all better be worth it; because I'm not psyched about having to flirt with guys.</i>  \u201cI can\u2019t wait!\u201d</span></div></div>",

At the very least I wanted to drink enough so Dad, Emily, and Michelle meant as little to me as I did to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Yeesh, old me, dramatic much?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she parked the car, Marcy and I walked around the corner to find a long line of people waiting to get into the club.  We stood on the sidewalk for a moment before Marcy waved at someone she recognized. \u201cHey, Robin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Marcy as she walked up to a brunette a short distance from the front of the line.  Marcy and I maneuvered under the velvet ropes; I was surprised when there weren\u2019t any complaints about us cutting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marcy hugged the girl, I realized that I recognized her as well; but couldn\u2019t place her.  *And I wondered why women had such a problem with me.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, the girl said, \u201cSo who\u2019s your friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobin Hartland, this is Amelia Sullivan; she just moved in across the hall.\u201d Smiling, Marcy said, \u201cShe just got a job at Benson Financial.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking my hand, Robin said, \u201cYou got in at the right time, Amelia,\" Robin said. \"Let's celebrate, girls: Andrew Benson is G-O-N-E, gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering why you decided to hit the club, after what that creep did to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, here, whatever loser tries to force me into a lip-lock isn't my f**king boss, so I can tell him what I think of him. Plus, I've got my girls looking out for me. Besides, if I let him keep me out of places, then it's like he won, and he doesn't deserve to win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a shock to me.

As I said, we\u2019d been inside for two hours; we were already on our 3rd round of drinks.<br>\r\nI had to admit it was somewhat sobering to hear Marcy and Robin talking about me in such a negative light.  I hadn\u2019t realized just how poorly I treated women until I heard them talking about their experiences with me.  The worst part was seeing Robin shaking as she described what I\u2019d done to her at the party.  It was all I could do to keep from crying as I heard her recount what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*While this wasn\u2019t a turning point in my life; this certainly gave me something to think about.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcy had just gone off to use the bathroom; leaving me alone with Robin.  Moving closer to her, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what that asshole did to you, Robin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize for him, Amelia.\u201d Looking at me, taking a sip of her drink, Robin said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like you were the one forcing yourself on me in the hallway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You have no idea, Robin.</i>  \u201cStill, I\u2019m sorry for what happened to you.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cHe violated you; made you feel weak.  No man should make a woman feel that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis may sound crazy, but I would like nothing more than for that asshole to experience what I went through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I sincerely hope that doesn\u2019t happen to me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything, Marcy returned with three guys.  Pointing to each of them, Marcy said, \u201cLadies, I\u2019d like for you to meet Michael, Simon, and Jacob.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was the alcohol, or maybe it was the fact that I was in a girl\u2019s body; whatever the reason, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how cute Michael was.  Having totally forgotten about my plan until that moment; I stood up, stumbling a little bit, and said, \u201cHi Michael, I\u2019m Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s just say that I\u2019m glad no one in the bar knew who I really was; because I was starting to realize I hadn\u2019t thought my plan all the way through.  The plan was good on paper; get myself good and drunk, then find a guy to flirt with.  In practice, however, it was totally different; I was a guy, inside a woman\u2019s body, making out with another guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael and I hit things off pretty quickly; we moved from talking to making out in short order.  I was sitting on his lap, my arms wrapped around his neck as we engaged in some passionate face-grinding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued that for a while; until Michael\u2019s group, unfortunately, had to leave to catch an early flight.  Once they left, I sat back down on the couch; still thinking about the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was pulled from my thoughts by Marcy tapping my shoulder, \u201cGirl, I know that look.\u201d Smiling, Marcy said, \u201cYou were so totally into him; you should\u2019ve given him your number.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just got out of a pretty intense relationship; my boyfriend was cheating on me with a girl from his office.\u201d Grabbing my drink, I said, \u201cMichael was cute, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for a relationship just yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I\u2019d told them was somewhat true; considering I\u2019d just been dumped by Heather for my actions at the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>********************************</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was well after midnight before the three of us left the club.  With neither of us in a condition to drive, we hailed a cab to take us back to the apartment.  It was a challenge walking up the stairs; after all, we were three very drunk girls wearing heels.  But we eventually made it up to our floor; where we said our goodbyes.  Marcy and Robin went inside Marcy\u2019s apartment while I went inside my apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into my room, I barely had a chance to take my heels off before I collapsed onto the bed.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d never been so bored in my life; I was usually at work right now.  After sitting on the couch for a few minutes, I got up and walked into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered seeing a pool as I drove into the complex yesterday.  I wasn\u2019t psyched about the idea of going to the pool in a woman\u2019s body, but it sure beats sitting around the apartment all day.  That was my attitude until I realized the only bathing suits provided for me were bikinis.  What kind of lesson will I learn from this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI briefly considered going out to buy a one-piece but stopped when I realized I was still a little hungover.  Grabbing the least feminine of the three options, I walked into the bathroom to get changed.  As I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, admiring my appearance, I looked at my reflection and said, \u201cDamn, boys are going to be all over me in this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped when I realized what I just said; although after a minute I decided to chalk it up to last night\u2019s drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Yeah; keep telling yourself that, past me.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a towel in hand, along with an old iPod, I made my way to the pool area a few minutes later.  Walking onto the pool deck, I saw it was mostly empty; except for two other girls, a blonde and a dark-haired girl, working on their tans and a trio of boys splashing around in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the intent of keeping to myself, I went to an empty corner and made myself at home.  After putting on some sunscreen, I lay back in the chair and started to work on my tan.  I was relaxed within minutes of doing so \u2013 making me wonder why I never tried this as a guy.  No wonder girls spend do this so much on vacations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so had passed since I got to the pool; I must\u2019ve dozed off for a few minutes while I was working on my back.  Large breasts don\u2019t make lying on your stomach comfortable.  Without opening my eyes, I reached over to where I\u2019d left my bikini top \u2013 only to find it wasn\u2019t there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it had fallen, I opened my eyes to find that it was gone.  What the hell?  Who would take a bikini top?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*To be fair, Garrett thought it would be funny to hide my top while we were on our honeymoon.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the towel to cover myself up, I started looking around for the top.  Suddenly something out of the corner of my eye grabbed my attention.  I turned to find one of the boys waving my top around.  \u201cAre you looking for this, sexy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d walking over, I grabbed the top from his hand and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you grow up?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pot calling kettle.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot waiting around for his response, I turned to walk off \u2013 only for him to smack me in the butt.  Before I could stop myself, I spun around and smacked the guy in the face.  I quickly realized that was a mistake \u2013 if only because of the fact the boy was a good 5 inches taller than me.  It was only then that I realized how close I was to the pool edge; as the boy shoved me into the pool.</span></div></div>",

You three will get yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person who got me away from the boys soon helped me out of the pool.

I sat in the living room and drank, thinking of all the people who had wronged me in the past 24 hours. <i>Well, actually, I was thinking of all the people I'd blamed for my problems.

Higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised my hand to my neck, and felt the same resistance as before. Now, though, I noticed that I also felt something touching my chest. I looked down, and saw it. Or, rather, them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had breasts. Big breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, I saw a full-length mirror. Standing before it, I came face to face with a woman. \"Son of a bitch,\" I said. \"He did it. He actually did it.\" I was standing there naked, so I couldn't pretend it was anything else. I had breasts, wide hips, and a vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panic, I ran straight into the living room and searched for a phone so I could call my dad, or maybe my mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Amelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned.

It seemed that my name was now Amelia Sullivan; a 24 year old woman with a less than impressive resume.  Looking at Michelle, I said, \"How am i supposed to find a job with this resume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, Amelia.\" Looking at me, a smile on her face, Michelle said, \"Mr. Benson has gotten you a job as a secretary at his company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Shocked, I said, \"You really to expect me to be some dumb secretary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that's your only option, honey.\" Pausing, Michelle said, \"Maybe if you'd focused more on your grades and less on sleeping around in school.\"</span></div></div>",

Placing my things on my new desk, I grabbed one of the lighter boxes and followed him into the other room.  \u201cIf I may ask, sir; how did you get this job?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about who you know, sweet-cheeks,\u201d looking at me, Mr. Lewis, \u201cThe last guy and I were in the same Frat; we went to different schools and graduated in different years, but that didn\u2019t matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was suddenly remembering why I\u2019d hired this guy; he was right, we had been in different chapters of the same Frat.  We all looked out for each other no matter what.  \u201cBeing frat brothers qualified you for this job?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot on its own, no; but yesterday he left me a voicemail, something about going into rehab and taking a \u2018voyage of self-discovery.\u2019\u201d Pausing, he said, \u201cApparently he hand-picked me to run the department while he was gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike hell I did;  Dad and Michelle must\u2019ve worked out a way to get him the job without him questioning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took us several hours to get the office to his liking.  It was just around 2:30 when we finally finished.  \u201cWell I think that\u2019s all for today.  I\u2019m going to leave early; you can too, sweetheart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all I could do not to the guy a new asshole when he slapped my ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Guess you can dish it out, but you can't take it, huh, old me?*</span></div></div>",

I think my initial reaction to the apartment was because I was shocked to find I\u2019d turned into a woman.  The complex and the unit itself weren\u2019t all that bad; it wasn\u2019t up to my standards but it wasn\u2019t that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking up to the 4th floor, I fumbled with the key for a moment before finally getting inside the apartment.  The first thing I did once I was inside was take off the heels; which immediately made my feet feel so much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I still don\u2019t know why women wear heels.  Sure they make us look good, but was it really worth all the joint problems later in life.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the middle of the room, I said to myself, \u201cI suppose I should look around this place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apartment consisted mainly of a small living area; with a detached kitchen plus a small hallway leading to down to the bathroom and bedroom.  Feeling an urge to get out of the skirt suit, I rummaged through the closet until I finally found something that wasn\u2019t remotely feminine \u2013 a pair of paints and a shirt.  Getting dressed was a hassle; apparently I had no problem taking bras off but had trouble putting one on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was satisfied with my outfit, I turned to leave the room; only to stop when my attention was drawn to some photos on the dresser.  Going over for a closer look, I saw there were pictures of me; or at least the female me.  That wasn\u2019t the only thing that caught my attention \u2013 the photos were of me with other people in a variety of locations; college graduation, on a beach wearing a bikini, and what looked to be some formal dance with other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If they can turn me into a girl, I suppose it\u2019s not too hard to make some fake photos.</i> Leaving the bedroom, I decided now was a good time to get drunk.  Thankfully whoever stocked the fridge had the foresight to provide me with some beer \u2013 it wasn\u2019t the brand I typically drank, but it would still get me drunk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was starting to get hungry when I heard voices outside in the hallway.  For some reason they both sounded familiar; so I got up to see who they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, I two woman standing there; a brunette and a red-head, both wearing skirt suits.  The brunette took one look at me and said, \u201cWe weren\u2019t making too much noise, were we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re fine.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m just not having the best day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoin the club, girlfriend.\u201d Gesturing to the red-head, she said, \u201cI\u2019m Marcy and this is Robin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still couldn\u2019t place where I knew them from; but they both looked familiar, particularly the red-head.  Shaking Marcy\u2019s hand, I said, \u201cI\u2019m Amelia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute, you look kind of familiar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh crap; could they know I\u2019m Andrew?</i>  \u201cYou guys do too, I\u2019m trying to figure out why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Robin said, \u201cWait; aren\u2019t you that new secretary that started today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s where I know them from \u2013 work!  \u201cYou guys work at Benson Financial?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah; I\u2019m in Accounting and Robin\u2019s in the Legal Department.\u201d Looking at me, Marcy said, \u201cYou\u2019re Mr. Lewis\u2019 new secretary, <br>\r\nright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Thinking back to the butt slapping, I said, \u201cHe\u2019s kind of grabby, isn\u2019t he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s nothing like the last guy.\u201d Shuddering, Robin said, \u201cAndrew Benson was the worst man I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn Robin, what did I ever do to you?</i>  Looking at me, Marcy said, \u201cI apologize for Robin; she\u2019s still upset about the July 4th Party \u2013 Mr. Benson tried to force himself on her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh crap.</i>  Trying to play it cool, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s terrible, Robin; I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault; it\u2019s not like you did it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, why don\u2019t we change the subject here.\u201d Looking at me, Marcy said, \u201cRobin and I are going to clubbing tonight, you feel like joining us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing clubbing wasn\u2019t exactly my idea of fun, but it would get me out of the apartment.

Halfway through her second Long Island Iced Tea, Robin was feeling talkative, and the subject she wished to hold forth on was none other than yours truly, Andrew Benson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what that rat bastard said to me after he gave me a tonsilectomy with his tongue?

They were there, acting like buying a woman a drink in a bar was a feat akin to curing cancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we?\" asked Marcy, already standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us walked over to the guys. I don't know what Marcy had in mind, but it probably wasn't what I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause I picked out one of the guys, walked right up to him, and gave him a deep-mouth kiss that brought him to his knees.
