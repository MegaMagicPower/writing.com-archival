She seems pleased, which puts you at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice,\" she says, \"have you tested them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your majesty, I didn't have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can't use them before testing them, can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she unstoppers the bottle and pours the glowing blue potion over you before you have time to object.  The spell starts working immediately.  Your vision goes from her waist to her knees to her toes as you shrink.  You look up to see her face smiling brightly down at you from far above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done.  I didn't expect it to work that well,\" she says as she raises her foot.  \"This will definitely win the next war for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you doing, your majesty?\"  you shout up as her giant bare foot hovers over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to finish testing all the way through, just as though you were an enemy.

You close your eyes and brace for impact as her giant, soft foot comes crashing down with a thud, flattening you to the ground.  She leaves her foot there for a moment, then removes it and looks down at you, flattened to the floor, admiring her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the effects of the spell wear off, you begin to get bigger, back to your normal size, and get unstuck from the floor, and unflattened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look shamefully over at the queen, who is still smirking.  \"Well done, Razdak.  I'm promoting you to level 6 for this.  Just remember, with a higher level comes higher responsibilities, and graver consequences if you fail at those responsibilities.  Now, you may take your leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run out of her chamber and out of the town hall.  Your whole body is aching from being squashed.  How could the queen be so cruel, after what you did for the village?</span></div></div>",

We'll take it into battle right away.  Ready the troops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush out of the town hall with the queen following close behind and begin rounding up troops of all kinds, giants, archer, barbarians, Valkyries.  When you finally have a sizable army, you begin marching to the next village.  As you approach the wall, the queen stands back with the king and sends the giants first, followed by the wizards, including you.  The giants begin pounding on the walls, taking all the heat from the defenses, while you vigorously hurl fireballs at them.  The wallbreakers further demolish the walls and you make your way in behind the giants, arrows and cannonballs falling all over.  It's total chaos.  You hear the sound of a spell drop behind you, but unfortunately, you are out of it's aura.  You are too busy to turn around, but you wonder if it was one of your growing spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead, troops come rushing out of the clan castle.  Your heart sinks as you see it is mostly bowlers.  If you get hit by one of their giant rocks, you'll be smushed for sure and your fireballs won't help.  You cower as one lumbers toward you, holding his giant rock up, about to hurl it down at your head, when all of a sudden, FOOM!  A giant bare foot slams down, completely pounding the bowler into the ground, the force knocking you off your feet.  You look way up to see the archer queen smiling down at you, \"Looks like your spell worked.  Stick close to me little man, I'll protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run along with the queen, under her cape, being careful to avoid her giant footfalls that are crushing the enemy troops left and right.  She is powerful enough when she is her normal size.  Now she is unstoppable.  The enemy troops, bowlers, valks, and barbarians can do nothing but stare up in horror as she raises her giant foot to stomp them and grind them into the ground.  Next to her you can see the barbarian king crushing the enemy buildings to rubble under his giant, sandaled feet.  Before long their entire village is flattened.  Then the spell wears off and the king and queen return to their normal size.  The king hoists you up on his shoulders and the entire army cheers for you.  Then you all return to your village with all the gold and elixir to have a party to celebrate the victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party is held in the town hall, and they spared no expense.  There is feasting, music, dancing, and entertainment.</span></div></div>",
