Most of your classmates are hanging out and there aren't many people in the classroom: the only people are a guy and some girls playing phones on their seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize Ashley, a tall blonde cheerleader, Frank, your goofy friend who recently got addicted to the stupid game \"Ballz\", and Zoe. Probably the hottest cheerleader at school, Zoe made it publicly known that she just broke up with her last boyfriend. It is undeniable that Zoe is one of the most popular girls here and you, despite having a girlfriend, have some fantasies about her. She's sitting diagonal from you and you peek at her phone: she is texting someone. Who could she be texting to? Hmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Ryan!\" Your thoughts were interrupted by a accented female voice. \"Where are you looking at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...nothing.\" You look up and see Rebecca, a Norwegian exchange student. It's been less than a full year since she came to your school yet everyone knows her pretty well. \"Well, Mr. Gray is looking for you. You better hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Gray? That's some bad news. You hate his classes. Yesterday during his physics class he asked you to state Ohm's Law, which you utterly forgot. He then went on ranting how irresponsible it is for a high school senior to not knowing something as easy as that and how unlucky it is for him to have you as student, which led to an explosion of laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. Time to brace yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">A Minute Later</font>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Gray?\" You hear the sound of door closing behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here you are.\" He look up from his aged desk. \"Listen, I have something for you.\" He reaches into his drawer and pulls out something that looks like an iPod nano. \"Here, it has the power to merge people.\" He hands the device to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...okay?\" What is he doing? Is he crazy? \"It has the power...to merge people?\" You ask in doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Go try it yourself. I just finished this fantastic device and I would be glad if you could...experiment with it. Don't lose it. Give it back to me next Monday along with your feedback...NOW LEAVE. You've already occupied too much of my time.\" His complexion suddenly changed to that of impatience and his hand raise to signal it's time for you to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">After School</font>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s been some ten minutes since school was over, and you are waiting to cross a road on your way home. You fondle the device in your pocket, wondering what to do with it. Although it sounds crazy, you kinda want to test it out\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do next?</span></div></div>",

Giving you another hug, you rocked her. The sweet smell of her hair made you content. You let her go. She pokes your cheek before sitting on the couch. With the device in your hand, you studied it. It's a bonafide iPod nano. Lucky for you, it's the seventh generation model. Mr. Gray was known to re-purpose electronics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Okay, how do I use this?</i> With the screen turned on, you can see several apps.

Two arrows pointed away and toward a dot in the middle: its color is purple. You shrugged. If this device works the way it should, Mr. Gray will be pleased. It was now or never. Tapping on the app, it showed you a radar. You pressed the onscreen button and scanned the area around you within 10 meters. A list of names appeared, including your own. You've already decided. Selecting yourself and Hannah, the device asks you if you would like to merge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Not in here.

Meanwhile, Olivia walked passed you waving at Hannah. After a short greeting, Hannah jumped onto your bed. You locked the door. <i>Okay, let's see if Mr. Gray wasn't lying.</i> You still had your doubts. There was no way a simple machine like this can merge people together. Crawling into bed, you laid on top of her.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hannah wrapped her arms around you, not knowing your plan. You gave the device the OK. Closing your eyes, you and Hannah were in a deep kiss. A pleasurable feeling spread. You and Hannah moan. Bodies morphed and twisted. All sense of self faded. Soon, the sensations resided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You opened your eyes. You felt satisfied. The cool air made you shiver. Going to a window, the sunlight showed off an incredible sight. Tanned skin. Dark brown hair hung below the shoulders. Olive-gray eyes complimented a wonderful face.

Tanned skin, slender legs, dirty blonde hair and c cup breasts\u2026 You can\u2019t help but admire her bare body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for her outfit to appear. Olivia\u2019s grey dress has merged with Ashley\u2019s athletic outfit, producing an orange low-cut tank top printed with the school\u2019s name. On her bottom is a grey miniskirt, followed by a pair of white slip-ons. The woman moans and opens her eyes. They are an enchanting light blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA buzz from the device interrupted the view. You take it out and read the display:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t\t\tMERGE COMPLETE<br>\r\nSUBJECT #1: OLIVIA JONES    SUBJECT #2: ASHLEY TURNER<br>\r\n\t\tPRODUCT: ALISON \u201dALLIE\u201d JONES-TURNER<br>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAGE: 17<br>\r\nOCCUPATION: HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR/CHEERLEADER<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill goes down your spine.

You decide to try complete reality merge. After all, surprise is what you are after for. You input Gina and Olivia\u2019s names and select the setting before the merge commences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014* * *\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia is wearing a grey dress today, coupled with a pair of flats. Her brown hair is tied to a bun, and her blue eyes shine with innocence. You assume her teal JanSport backpack is filler with books and homework as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina is wearing a red T-shirt with jeans, in addition to a pair of flip flops. She is near-sighted and is wearing her glasses as usual. Her blonde hair is tied to a rather long ponytail, which modestly swings around as she walks. Gina is known to hate backpack and she carries a white canvas tote bag as a substitute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Olivia drops her backpack and Gina drops her bag before they start sprinting towards each other. Within seconds they ended up crashing on the sidewalk on the other side of the road. Olivia\u2019s fair skin melds with Gina\u2019s toned flesh the moment they collide, together with their clothing. Two girls twist into a single being like mud, and moments later it takes shape of a young woman Ryan has never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her feet is a pair of black and white ballerina flats. Going up, her slender legs are well exposed by a pair of grey jean shorts. A pink tank top is next, tightly covering her B-cup breasts. As she opens her eyes, you found them to be a charming deep blue, which is an apparent fusion of Olivia\u2019s blue and Gina\u2019s brown. Gina\u2019s glasses are gone. Her dirty blonde hair is tied to a short ponytail, which well complements her slightly tanned complexion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new woman\u2019s head was facing up as if in a trance. You could only watch in awe as she suddenly recovers from such state and walks over to get Olivia\u2019s backpack. The moment she touches the teal JanSport, the backpack transforms into a tote bag just like the one Gina had, only teal in color. She puts the straps over her shoulder and starts moving, towards the direction of your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still shocked by the sight of what just happened. You nervously look around and found Gina\u2019s bag has disappeared. Numerous thoughts cross your mind as you try to sort out what you saw. At this moment, you feel the device emitting a buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily take out the device. The following is shown on the display: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t\t\tMERGE COMPLETE<br>\r\nSUBJECT #1: OLIVIA JONES        SUBJECT #2: GINA MORRIS<br>\r\n\t\t\tPRODUCT: OLGA JONES-MORRIS<br>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAGE: 16<br>\r\n\t\tOCCUPATION: HIGH SCHOOL SOPHOMORE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a chill goes down your spine.

Deciding to play it normal for now, you call out if Sarah is in the barn and if she's alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the barn you soon hear Sarah call out, \"Go away!\" loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But its me, Mark\", you replay back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Mark, its you, i'm sorry.\" She says, soon continuing ,\"I'm just dealing with something right now, you should probably just head back home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill trying to act like you don't know what she's referring too you ask ,\"Sarah, just tell me whats wrong, maybe I can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You possibly can help me, let alone see me right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Sarah, its me. I don't care whats wrong with you, I just want to help you and be there for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? Ok, just please don't freak out.\" She replies, before opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large barn doors open to reveal, you now massive horse girlfriend in the barn, probably hiding. She begins to pull herself out from the barn and stands up to her full 80' height. You now can get a good scale of her size to you, as you barely as tall as the bottom of her ankle! She stares down at you, looking nervously at you. You still see her clothes on her as well her tail, now slightly waving causing a small gust in the air due to its size. You must now figure out if you should be honest to her or continue to act that you don't have a clue.</span></div></div>",

You see the top fin of the shark out in the water, and watch as it head down the shore, towards the girls. They seem confused looking around not understanding whats going on. As the shark approaches, one of the girls scream and they all try to make it back to shore! As they head back you notice the brunette isn't fast enough as the shark seem to close in on her. She stops moving in fear the shark will think she's food. Worried what will happen, you decide now might be a good time to use the device and save her, but how. You soon get an idea, and you aim the iPod at the girl, ready to fire. When the shark closes in and goes for her, you fire the device and watch as the ray hits the girl and shark, creating a blinding light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the light dissipates, you look back to see the outcome. You see the girl is safe and the shark gone, but soon realize why. The Brunette now looked a lot different. For one it looked like she now had the facial structure of a shark, with large blue eyes, though still had eyebrows and hair. She now also had a large shark fin and tail on her back and butt, as well as small fins on her elbows. Also, her skin look now glossy and shark like and was a gray, with a white torso and highlights on her tail and inner thighs! It looked as if her outfit she was wearing, a two piece yellow bikini, still remain on her, still retaining her F cup breast and modest butt figure. For all intensive purpose she had combined with the shark in the water. She continue to stand in the water, looking around confused. People all look back confused as well. You now had seen the device work, but what was going to happen next.</span></div></div>",

He soon apologies to the shark girl and runs back down the beach. Soon people go back about enjoying the beach, as well the girls rejoin their changed friend seeming not to be phased in the slightest. The confuses you, as you wonder why people seem fine and calm and you soon discover the reason as you look down at the iPod. inspecting the merge app, you find a slider setting and its set to \"Complete Reality Change\". This starts to make sense, as when you changed the girl, you must have  changed reality to where she must not be surprising to the people on the beach, and maybe the entire world? You now continue to watch the girls continue to enjoy the waves, the brunette now using her shark like body to swim in the water more effectively. Things now settle back to how they were before.

Messing with the setting you first just set the power to 2x and fire at the shark girl. Soon you watch as the girl in the water begins to grow, all the while her and her friends don't seem to notice. Soon her torso rises above the water, as she continue to talk to her friends. She now looks double her height, maybe close to 10 feet tall in stature, yet everyone seems not phased by the large shark girl in the water, even herself! You soon realize that the reality setting must effect everything! You decide you want to see how it handles ludicrous change. And so you take aim again, but this time you set the power to 6x and fire at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, yet again the shark girl begins to grow. You see that her yellow bikini is still growing with, meaning clothes must be effected as well. Her waist soon passes the height of her friends as they continue their conversation un-phased. She soon reaches somewhere in the range of 60 to 70 feet in size! Her breasts now massive, bigger than you or anybody for that matter. At her towering size she bends down and still talks with the girls as normal. looking at the iPod, you are impressed with who ever made this device. putting it down for a second, you continue to watch the 65 foot tall shark brunette socialize as normal, before the girl stands back up to her full height and stretches. She then signals and says to her friends that shes going back to shore to relax, though due to her size, you could hear a lot of what she was saying. It only take her one too two steps to be on the beach, people still acting as everything is normal. She walks over to a group of towels and chairs and crouches down to inspect them. She soon looks frustrated and grabs a towel with one of her fingers and lays it in the middle of open beach. Though obviously too small, she still lays it out and plops down on her chest onto it. The towel becomes covered by her massive chest. She lays their as people awkwardly move around the massive shark girl as she stares out to the ocean smiling and enjoying the sun. You see her back fin is a bit bigger that you are and her massive shark tail now rests on the edge of the beach, blocking some rinse off stations, frustrating people trying to leave the beach. You can't help but marvel at what you've created! But now what?</span></div></div>",

Making sure to put your device away deep into your bag, you get up and begin to walk over to her. As you walk over you notice some kids are playing around near her, and some start to play on her. The girl notices and starts telling the kid stop and shoo off. As shes looking back frustrated at the kids, now walking away, you approach the front her and try to come up with a greeting. She soon turns her head back around and instantly notices you and waits for you to say something. All you can muster is a hey and a nervous wave, man you fell like an idiot right now. She responds respectfully back to with a hi and asks what do you want. Thinking for a second you decide to ask her about her current size and race. She soon sighs, rolls her eyes and says again begrudgingly. She soon begins to tell her story, as she talks, you notice all her teeth in her mouth are now razor sharp, terrifying you a tiny bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Some time later...]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo from what you can gather from her story, she says that for as long as she can remember she's been a shark woman for her entire life. She doesn't seem to question as to why her parents and siblings were normal, while she wasn't. She just said she was just the special child. She soon went into how it was hard fitting in at school and with her peers as a shark girl, but she eventually got over it. Her growth on the other hand, she says didn't start till high school are when she hit puberty. She was up to that point normal and started high school at around 5'7'' in height, but by the end of her freshman year she had soon reached the size of 10'1''! Over the remainder of her high school years she continued to grow. She laughs as she remembers some poor guy who had nervously asked her to the senior dance, though by that time she was close to 28' tall! That must have been a very awkward dance. She says she did't stop growing till just a few months ago. She said its been tough but that she has her friends and family to support her. Finishing her conversation you thank her and ask her any remaining questions you had. You notice she laughed when you tired to make some witty remarks about her story, continuing to smile, enjoying this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you now realize the iPod did effect people's memories and some how made her being a 60' shark girl seem \"normal\". You soon thank her as you get ready to go back to your stuff. However she soon turns to look at you and asks you something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hope you wouldn't mind if I asked a favor of you?\" she continues \"could you help me put some sun screen on me? Please......\" she finishes, giving a small pout face towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze, and nervously try to figure out what to do...</span></div></div>",

Walking over to their stuff, you soon spot a large bottle of sun screen next to the back, though your not sure if its enough for her entire body! Picking up the bottle and bring it back over to the shark girl. You ask her how does she want you to put this on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well rub it onto my body, you doffus.\" She sarcastically retorts, \"Come on don't be afraid, I don't bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with that response, seeing her massive sharp teeth don't fully put down that concern, but she asked you to do it and you obliged to do. So carefully, with lotion in hand, you climb onto her back and proceed to put lotion in your hand and begin to rub it in. Upon doing so you hear her sigh in satisfaction and begin to relax. You eventual rub in what lotion you can, and continue to slather more onto her massive body. After a few minutes, you start to make progress as you get most of her back and neck. While working, you decide to ask her what her name is, confused that you nor her have asked or told names. She act surprised as well, realizing the awkward situation. She soon replies that her name is Julie, and you in return tell her you name. Chuckling, you continue to finish her back only soon to realize that you had to get her leg and part of her butt. Moving off her back to her lower half, begin on them. You easily fit between her massive legs, as you continue to put lotion on. When reaching the butt, you also realize you have to probably get her long Shark tail as well. When you begin to lotion it up, you begin to fell nervous as here you were rubbing a massive ass of a 60' shark girl. upon your rubbing, you hear her make a sigh and a muffled \"mmmpphhh\" revealing she was felling quite pleasured with you actions. After a while you manage to get her entire back, though struggling with her massive tail, revealing it to be her tickle spot. Surprisingly you found the bottle to only be half empty. You walk around to her front and reveal to her that you finished her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks so much for getting my back, it felt so nice to not have to lumber around to try to get some lotion on me!\"  She expressed happily, however she continued but now with a slight slur to her words, \"You know, It felt so nice in fact, I wonder if you could do my front side for me as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that sentence made you face flush for a second realizing what she was now asking of you. You guess since you had already done her back for her, and she seem happy with you doing it you agree. Upon agreeing she ask to hold on for one second as she shifts her massive body onto her back. Laying on her back you now can see her massive breasts in the full glory now, still held in place by the massive bikini that still fit her. She looks over at you and gives a grin. \"Like what you see?\" she says seeing her staring at her 60' form. Again, you nervously answer that she defiantly looks beautiful, she giggles and responds for you to get to it then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting at her feet first, you notice unlike her hands, which still looked like a humans, her feet now looked slightly different. They now only had 3 toes and looked a bit more animistic, though still had the silhouette of a normal foot. This time the lower half wasn't the hard part. Now it was her upper body, and more specifically it was her massive F size breasts. Continuing to her torso, you almost step you foot into her massive bellybutton. Getting to her breasts, you see her staring back at her smiling. You realize she's finally enjoying this, either from messing with you or pleasure, though you think a might be a bit of both. Deciding to go around, you get her massive arms slathered up and move back to the top of her chest and neck. Setting down and getting ready to continue, you now can fell the breaths from Julie's face. You stare nervously at the massive gray orbs in front of you and begin. Soon you get a reaction similar to earlier, as she begins to muffledly moan at your contact with her \"sensitive area\".  Finishing and turning to her neck, you see her have the look of exhaustion, probably form trying to hold in her pleasure. Upon meeting eye contact she smiles and watches you put on the last bit of lotion on her lower neck. You soon see that the bottle is now empty. You tell her that your done and that all the lotion has been used. Julie smiles and thanks you. As your about to hop off, Julie stops you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, since you did this for me and have been very nice, how would you like to lay her with me, or more specifically on me?\" She ask, before continuing ,\"Don't act like you've not enjoyed this experience and haven't been eyeing me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there shocked and not knowing what to do.</span></div></div>",
