His own father and mother were *VERY* gluttonous and were very fat.  Templeton and his seven brothers and sisters liked to snuggle in thier parents' big fat bellies, for they were nice, soft and warm.   Templeton's fondest dream was to be the world's fattest rat...and he wasn't doing a very good job at it for the moment.   That's because Zuckerman's Farm had no pigs, and therefore, no slop.   Templeton lived on what little food he could steal from Zuckerman's kitchen...though he was nearly caught once.   At that time, Templeton didn't know who Charlotte was...he saw that there was a spider living in the doorway to the barn, but the spider hardly spoke to him (and neither did most of the animals on the farm, for that matter).   Templeton once found a whole apple on the ground and ate all of it (leaving behind the core) , and that was his largest meal to date...and that had been about a week ago or so.   Templeton's dream about becoming the world's fattest rat was only known to Templeton himself.  Once, he had dreamed about getting so huge and fat,  that he was the size of a barn.   There was a junk yard half a mile down the road where Templeton could find his food.   In fact, he was in the junkyard right now, with early evening coming on.  </span></div></div>",

As he finished the inside, he began to eat the much tougher exterior.  Templeton gorged upon the large fruit, and made sure he had eaten every last piece of the melon.

The newcomer was female and skinny, just the opposite of Templeton. Templeton got to his feet.   \"I've never saw you before\" said Templeton to the stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"My name is Charlene and I'm new to ther area\" said the female rat.  \"I just found this junkyard earlier today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"This junkyard is a rat's paradise\" said Templeton, patting his pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Charlene looked unconvinced.   \"Clearly, you haven't been at a fair\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Templeton had heard of fairs;  full of humans and noise.  Not really his cup of tea, to be honest.  Templeton liked to  be a loner and the quiet.  Anyway, the nearest fairgrounds was a good 20 miles from the Zuckerman farm.  Templeton had been all over the county, moving from place to place, never staying very long,  He was probably going to move out of the Zuckerman farm in a couple of weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"And I suppose you have?\" asked Templeton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Oh, yes\" said Charlene.  \"humans leave behind lots of food at fairs.  Enough food to feed an army of rats\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"Really?\" asked Templeton.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Yep\" said Charlene.   \"I'm a big eater, even though it doesn't show\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"I'm a big eater, too\" said Templeton.  \"Just ate a watermelon someone left behind\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"I can see that\" said Charlene.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"This junkyard is a good place to look for food\" said Templeton.   \"though, not enough food for my liking\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Well, there's a county fair every fall\" said Charlene.  \"maybe you could go to the fair and have all the food you could eat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Maybe\" said Templeton, just imagining how fat he could get at a fair with enough food to feed an army of rats.   His mouth began to water just by thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"I'm here to eat\" said Charlene.  \"I don't suppose you found more food here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Templeton sniffed the air for more food in the junkyard.  </span></div></div>",

He knew after a bit of rest, his distended belly would disappear, as watermelon, although being an ample supply of food, was not likly to help him gain any weight, other then the initial bloating.  With this knowledge, Templeton continued to massage the tightly pact belly of his, claws gently scratching his bloated sloshy belly.  He closed his eyes, entering a state of food stuffed euphoria, which was however interrupted by a twitching of whiskers, which led Templeton to slowly open his eyes.  What he saw would neither please him, or soothe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw the fluffy face of a hungery cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton gulped, realizing he was in quite a comprimising situation.  So he did the only thing he really could in such a situation; he ran.  The cat pounced at him, and Templeton ducked out of the way just in time.  Normally, Templeton was quite agile, and cats would quickly give up the chase, but he soon found out his gorged stomach would cause him some difficulty.  He ran passed junk heaps, not daring to look back, and as the cats shadow began to loom over him, he knew it was all over unless he found another escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he looked all around him, hoping for something, anything.  Then he finally saw what he hoped would be a feasable escape.  A pile of garbage appeared in front of him, in which there was a hole, big enough for a fat rat to squeeze into but small enough to escape his unwanted friend.  So he took his chances and leaped into the hole, legs scrambling to help fit his bloated end through.  He managed to pull himself into the pile just as the cat leaped up again to grab him, but to no avail.  The cat hissed at him, but Templeton did his best to ignore it and crawl further inside.  It was in here that Templeton found something he didn't expect.</span></div></div>",

Inside a paper bag was a half-eaten cheeseburger with everything that had become grimy from being left in the garbage. There were also three cartons of curly fries, and what must have once been a milkshake, now melted into chocolate milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton stared at it. Then, he hobbled and jiggled over towards the bag, and he managed to chew through it with his teeth. When he picked up the half of burger, he found it to be about as big as him. He sunk his teeth into it. It was juicy from being soaked in grime. He began gobbling it down as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was down, Templeton held up one of the cartons of stale fries, and they slid down and into his mouth, and he managed to swallow them whole. He did the same with the other cartons as well, and soon, he was feeling much more full than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Templeton struggled over towards the cup with the milk in it. He found a straw and placed it inside. He began to guzzle the milk straight down his throat and into his stomach. He could hear it gurgle now, and it was stretching out a bit more. It took a couple of minutes to complete it, but finally, he got the warm, almost sour, liquid into his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a sigh of relief and satisfaction, Templeton collapsed onto his back, and his stomach rolled back over his face, and then it settled back into place. Belching loudly, Templeton pat it gently, listening to his gut gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he smelled something else...</span></div></div>",

Falling over onto his fours, his indulgent belly caressing the ground, Templeton made his way near the delectible scent, at least as fast as his bloated body would allow.  Templeton soon found himself at the foot of something truely amazing; a pile of half eaten goodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small basket of fruit, an unopened pack of hotdogs, some moldy cheese, a few old looking pieces of bread and box containing some unwanted Chinese take out.  What a day it was for Templeton.  He rubbed his hand's together in anticipation, and without further delay began to gorge himself on these treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst the fruit.  He gobbled it down without halt.  Next the bread, and after that the cheese.  Templeton belched, his comicly bloated stomach groaned a sloshed, unwanting to take in any more.  Templeton grinned, as he gnawed open the six pack of hotdogs.  Lying back on some trash, Templeton eat the hotdogs casually, saverouing them as if the most delicous treat he'd ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, soon they too vanished into his gullet, and Templeton moaned in pleasure.  Never in his life had he been so stuffed, and yet more food lay right before him.  His belly bulged infront of him, his arms only able to reach halfway around it.  But he wouldn't let the food go to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching, Templeton wobbled over to the last of the food, slurping down noodles one by one, until at last his feast came to an end.  He grinned, and belched again and again, but Templeton felt no pain from being so full, only the pleasure's of the feast.  And Templeton being the true glutton he was only wanted more.  If given the chance he would eat like this nonstop, but alas, he had never had the chance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassaging his engorged belly, Templeton closed his eyes, stomach churning in discomfort of having so much food.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't long until he sloshed from side to side, groaning and moaning in his sleep, the fat lump was dreaming again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton looked around, then looked at his middle, it was back to normal, but he'd just eaten...he shook his head as he noticed now that he was surrounded by foods, more hot dogs, watermelons, sandwiches, grapes...and they all appeared to be moving of their own accord.  Rolling, wobbling, turning themselves closer.  And not only that, but growing each time!  Each item swelling, plumping, getting larger than before...the rat blinked and shook his head, drool beginning to form.  And as if the food knew his desire, it flew into the air and above his head, first the grapes pulled themselves from their vine and swelled to the size of oranges before shoving themselves down Templeton's awaiting gullet.  \"Delightful!\"  He gulped down another.  \"Stupendous!\"  And another.  Soon his belly had distended over two feet from the engorged grapes, Templeton belched louder than he'd ever had before, covering his mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and soon the thick hot dogs flew into his face, somehow this seemed familiar to him, all too familiar, he opened his mouth with glee and the ripe dogs worked into his body, his mouth distending as if he was a snake, gobbling and allowing himself to distend into a sausage shape.  The watermelon rolled ominously over to it's new home, Templeton looking up over his snout and opened wide.  An unseen force shoving the enormous fruit into the rat's body.  Templeton groaned and accepted the bounty, he felt lumpier than before, and as his body adjusted itself as if by magic, immediately digesting the foods.  Before Templeton had time to think, thick layers of fat began to swell on his face, limbs, and middle.  Even his scraggily tail had thickened to the size of the previously eaten hot dogs.  He looked, almost horrified at the oozing bulk hanging from his frame, he could not move, and he could barely believe how far ahead his flabby belly hung before him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the cool air, away from his dream world the tubby rat wobbled and groaned.  His feet kicking as he gripped his swollen belly in discomfort, eyes squeezed shut, mumbling to himself.</span></div></div>",

But thankfully, his soft swollen belly provided him the warmth he needed so he wouldn't have to freeze. But the amount of cold was different as well as the layout of the back of the truck. It wasn't just any ice cream truck, but a storage truck, which was possibly taking its shipment to a grocery store or ice cream shop until the driver stopped for some unknown reason.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nNow this shipment had a new destination, thought the rat. My stomach. He rubbed his soft and less swollen belly with excitement and set off to work. He started at the top of the stack of boxes so he could work his way down. The added girth from overeating he was so anxious to obtain, would definitely make climbing an arduous task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUsing his fangs he bit through the tape of the sealed packaging to unlock a treasure trove of Klondike ice cream sandwiches. The rat lounged at the corner of the box, taking a relaxing position as he knew he would enjoy this immensely. He unwrapped the first and a second with his tail quickly. While his tail unwrapped the foil covering with lightning speed his greedy little paws stuffed as much of the sandwich as he could into his mouth. He grunted in pleasure as a large chunk slid down his gullet. And within three bites the first sandwich vanished and found a new home within the rats belly which growled with joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWithin a few minutes he had consumed about twenty five ice cream sandwiches, with the corpulence around his large stomach now doubling in size. Still lounging with his legs relaxing lifeless at his sides, he couldn\u2018t help but giggle in euphoria; his belly wobbling some. His stomachs digestive acid had turned the once solid blocks of ice cream he swallowed into a melted chilling liquid. Templeton paused momentarily from his gorging to savor his newly obtained girth. Pressing pleasurably upon his burbling and robust abdomen, he allowed the cold contents to jiggle and slosh around; like a furry pile of gelatin. But why should it stop there. He still had this box and the others to go. Humans were fat enough as it is, just look at Zuckerman and his wife. If anything Templeton was being quite the humanitarian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis righteous act to help humanity further added to his delight. Unwrapping more of the sandwiches, he was determined to finish what he had started. Gorging, filling his fat face with more and more until the box now laid empty. He had to move from his lounging position in order to eat the sandwiches he sat atop of which were partially destroyed from his immense weight and melted from the warmth of his engorged back. But he didn\u2019t mind, he licked up what remains of melted vanilla there were. Now in the center of the box he groaned with delight at all the ice cream he just ate. He laid flat on his body with the immense tub of fat from his stomach shaping into his back, lifting his behind in the air and sending a roll of fat onto his head. With what strength he had in his chubby arms, he attempted to stand up, but the weight was too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBoy,\u201d he said aloud, extending a paw to pat his now rounder back. \u201cI certainly know how to pack it all.\u201d His back jiggle and sloshed with mirth. Using his tail as counter weight, he began to shift himself back and fourth, back and fourth. His fat shifted with him, until it dragged the fat rats body backwards. He tilted his head back as well to aid himself to stand. Finally, as he got back up to his two foot paws, he took stock of his newfound bulk. A large furry stomach which he couldn\u2019t even wrap his arms around now laid in front of him; relaxing on the ground and burbling contently. He patted it in delight and waddled his way to the boxes edge while using his excess weight to tip it over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLucky for Templeton, as he pressed his stomach against the box the single wall of cardboard fell down. Which allowed him to remain in his upright position, allowing his body to relax and inspect which box to open next. So many boxes left to gorge off of, but which one was to come next. As was his plan, he climbed down gently with the tip of his foot paws touching the box. He was managing his girth real well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat lies inside this box, he thought, vats of chocolate or strawberry ice cream. Or possibly some vanilla fudge bars. He couldn\u2019t wait to find out. But suddenly a memory came back to him. The dream he had of all the food. Though he was quite delighted to over indulge himself without end. The fact of being immobilized in the dream frightened him, and what\u2019s worse, it was a dream. This is real life, as heavenly as it was to realize his dream at becoming the fattest rat in the world was, there are predators to think about. What about that cat in the junkyard? He was barely able to escape him, and he wasn\u2019t even near the size he was now. If he would try now, doom would most definitely be spelled clearly for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe was left with an enormously difficult decision. \u201cWhat should I do? What can I do? Eat and die by predators or this human who might discover me and I\u2019ll be too fat to escape? Or take what stomach I have out of benevolence to humanity, and run to eat another day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not wasting another moment, he hefted his bulk to the back of the truck to not be discovered. If he were to possibly die (in the safety of an iron vehicle), he would go out doing what he loved. Tearing through a nearby box, he found four rows of pitchers filled with Vanilla ice-cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoody,\u201d he cheered, \u201can excellent parting gift.\u201d If it were to be so. Still outside the box, he removed the lid and took a hard bite. Still solid frozen, he added pressure to take a huge chunk out of the pitcher. Feeling the cold moist treat slither down his warm throat, his body wobbled as he giggled, and finally, the chunk made a *glopping* sound as it bounced in the pit of his stomach. Continuing the procedure, he took more and more bites, reveling in the cold goodness. As soon as he finished, he moved on to the next one, and the next one, and the next one. His stomach, becoming more fuller, rounder, and larger; along with his expanding rump. With his bulbous stomach keeping him hunched over, he saw a place within the box he could relax, and so, jumped inside and landing with a loud squelch; the shivery contents bouncing around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tighter fit than he thought; being squeezed between the box and the ice-cream. But no matter. Leaning over as best he could, he carried another pitcher over, resting it on his cold, round, burbling belly which called for further appeasing. While chowing down on the sweet, he placed a paw across his cold belly. His small digits scratching across such a numb-wide surface tickled him from his footpaws down to his chubby face. The digestive acids in his stomach have done a good job in melting the ice into a melted creamy coating, which served as a soft layer of fat under Templeton\u2019s fur. With each large swallow, his paw would slowly rise as another slab of ice-cream found its home within his cavernous stomach. And strangely, he was able to feel it glorp within him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of voracious gorging, Templeton hefted his body up the side of the box, a humongous gray orb of shivering blubber. With gallon upon gallon now refuse in his large belly, Templeton couldn\u2019t stop shivering; causing his body to slosh every second. He somewhat regretted his decision, but didn\u2019t think of it for long after hauling half his body up the box, and using his small legs to pull the other half up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging himself to the next box, he opened it and found stack upon stack of Crunch Ice-cream Bars. Templeton literally fell for the bars, crushing a few with his massive liquid like belly, which persistently gurgled and bubbled. Quickly, he devoured the bars two at a time, not even bothering to chew. As he stuffed his face, and relaxed on his soft back, more fat started to develop under the large valley of fur. Being the messy little pig he was, some of the ice cream landed atop of his stomach, and soon melted from the now warm heat. Finishing the two bars, he gave his burbling swell a congratulatory pat to adapting to the cold. Like a bear getting ready for hibernation; only the rat would eat more than sleep. Continuing his treatment, his belly grew more sticky and icky with each trickle of ice-cream landing on it. Which made it harder to rub and appreciate, but still a beloved sight to behold and appreciate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished he went to another box, and another, until he came across the coup de grace! A box, with the largest ice-cream cake his twinkling eyes ever did see. It looked so beautiful, so delicious, and so fluffy in his gaze. Then, looking below him, he saw something similar, his unbelievably over gorged stomach. It was just a mountain of soft fur and fat. Spilling gelatinously to his sides, and forming an arch at the front. Being a canister of liquid ice cream and adipose, his mirthful pat caused vibrations to ripple throughout his body. Cheerful about the pleasure that coursed through him, he didn\u2019t laugh aloud because of being too busy catching his breath. The untold amount of sweets he ate had pilled up from his now packed stomach--all the way up to his chest which now too started to expand (or form fat around the rib cage). His wide frame kept his paws from reaching at his chest fur to try and stroke some of the rising ice cream back down to his stomach. Now with this marvelous delicacy in front of him, he feared he would either throw up, or, not be able to get out of the box. The ice cream filled him like water, and so he was unable to belch for more room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he groaned, daintily patting his belly with what his paws could reach. \u201cThis is it, one last morsel to enjoy.\u201d His stomach groaned furiously, as if disapproving the proposal to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'd like to go on, but you need time to rest, so this is it!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his body with all his might and kicking with one footpaw still touching the ground, he was able to get to  the edge of the box and reach to take off the lid. But suddenly, due to his shifting weight, all the melted gorge that rested upon his back, slowly shifted up to his chest like a water bottle being tipped over with the cap still on. Noticing this, Templeton panicked and tried moving backwards, but it was too late. Inch by inch Templeton slid into the box. His titanic mass, as big and wide as an obese Welsh Corgi, started to rest upon the plastic cake covering. It was no contest of which would win, the cakes plastic shield or the wide, round, blob like belly. Within seconds, Templeton descended lower and lower, his plump cheeks grazing the side of the box, and the sounds of plastic snapping ringing in his ears. As pathetic as it was, Templeton held back tears. Upset that what could\u2019ve been the final meal he would ever feast on in his life, was now crushed by his monstrous swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, why did you do it,\" he moaned sadly, slapping at his bulbous mass as if spanking a child. But this only gave him small pangs of pleasure as his indigested gorge sloshed and slopped around; massaging his insides soothingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had grown too corpulent to care about his size anymore, but now, he would lie in this box, allowing his strength to return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohanson, get your butt out of the truck and help me unload these.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton\u2019s ears perked up at the sound of the voice. Humans! \u201cThis is it, I\u2019m done for,\u201d he sadly mused, tears now streaking down his face, and squeezing his furry massive bulk one last time. He didn't see the point in climbing out. Where would he run to? If he could indeed run? \u201cGoodbye world, and goodbye mountain\u2019s of food I haven\u2019t eaten yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, this is the place. Get the cakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his eyes, Templeton awaited the inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, hurry up we got a tight schedule here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Shut!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief moment of silence that seemed to last forever, but Templeton felt no pain from any type of attack, nor heard the humans reaction to a giant rat inside a box; only a shutting noise. Opening his eyes, Templeton\u2019s surroundings were pitch black, and looking up, he noticed the box was covered. Wiping away tears, his clogged heart slowing slowed down its pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere they actually too busy to notice me,\u201d said the rat. Perhaps he\u2019d be able to get away with his catatonic ice-cream binge after all. And then, his massive body nearly leapt with excitement at the next thing one of the humans asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this shipment going to a grocery store or ice cream parlor?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Grocery store,\" the voice replied. \"It's the one on Elm Street. Get a move on, will ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I'm going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton felt his heart do a backflip as he realized what this meant. He knew that a grocery store was the home of every possible piece of food food in the world. So many options, choices and decisions to be made swam threw his head, making him very excited. Resolving to get some sleep, he quickly pulled the box shut around himself and set about dozing off. He snored softly as he felt the truck drive along the freeway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours seemed to slip past like sand, and soon, Templeton was slowly regaining conciousness. He yawned and stretched a bit, and reached down to rub is belly. He looked down and was rather startled to find that his once monstrous belly had shrunken in size. He looked himself over and found that he'd digested most of the previous day's gorge and the fat had spread out all over his body. His legs had a great degree more blubber on them, and his face jiggled whenever he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he felt hungry. After stretching his stomach to the almost imaginable limits, it was empty again, and he needed to stuff himself again. He heard it growl with anticipation. He stroked it soothingly. \"Now, now,\" he said with a sickly grin. \"You'll soon be full again. I'll see to it you get so full I'll need extra suspension to move you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach growled with excitment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton listened carefully to the outside world through the cardboard. He could hear nothing so far. No sounds of workers. No sounds of trucks coming and going. No movement whatsoever. He decided to take a chance. He pushed hard against the flaps on the box and saw the most peculiar sight when they gave way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a ceiling. He wasn't sure if he'd been expecting that. A ceiling meant that he was inside a building. There were long steel girders holding the ceiling up, and long pipes running along the top. Curious, he reached up along the edges and pulled himself up to see what was out there. His eyes widened at the sight of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a grocery store all right. He was in the back of the building, but he could see all the various aisles of food. There were aisles with produce. There were aisles with cookies. There were aisles with chips. Long rows of drinks from milk to sodas to juice all lined the refridgerated walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton stared in pure ecstacy. \"I don't know where to start. An embarrassment of riches awaits me! This is it! Time for my ultimate feast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a new energy he'd never felt before, the bulky rat tore out of the box and headed for the first aisle his instincts told him to go to. There was an entire row of various types of potato chips. He ripped open a bag and shovelled the chips down his throat and into his waiting stomach. He tore into bag aafter bag until they got too salty and his tongue got a weird feeling. So he next ran to the beverages and pulled out a huge bottle of cola. He struggled with the top for a moment before he to open it and tip it forwards. He put his mouth on the top and poured the sugary contents down into his stomach. He elt himself swelling up in all directions as it filled him, and by the time he was finsihed, he was very large indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he wasn't done yet. He'd barely begun. He waddled and stumbled towards the cookie aisle. He ripeed open the packages of chocolate chips and shortbreads and poured them all in a pile, and he began shovelling them down his gullet, feeling himself get larger and lalrger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when he got tired of cookies, he took to the produce. He ate apples, carrots, corn cobs, potatoes and even downed most of a watermellon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw the bakery just calling to him. He felt his energy levels spike once again, and he waddled and stumbled over towards it. He found huge birthday cakes lining the area, put in boxes to be kept fresh. He ripped open the boxes and dove into the sheet cake, shovelling the bread and icing into his mouth and swallowing huge amounts. He ate several cakes in rapid succession, feeling himself grow more stuffed with sugar by the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he found one of the icing containers. He grinned and held the nozzle up to his mouth and promptly squirted a huge burst of green frosting into his mouth. Now he was *really* wound up on sugar, and he downed the whole thing, plus three more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went on like this for several hours. Every time he tired of one area, he'd go back and get another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon, it was getting late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton examined his surroundings. He'd polished off nearly half the store's contents. He let out a belch of the most intense satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he looked at the size of his stomach. It was even bigger than before. He looked like he had swallowed a bowling ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...,\" he sighed. \"Think that'll satisfy you for now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach just responded by struggling to digest his binge. It wobbled and shivered. He moaned softly from the pleasure of it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to rest. Come on, let's go find some place to hold up until night falls again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasier said than done. The gorged rat found he couldn't really move all that well. It wasn't until he manged to roll over onto his stomach that he found he could pull himself forward with his claws and spent the next fiffteen minutes struggling to climb back into his box. He pulled the flaps shut over himself and dozed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe expected this store would not be open for much longer if he kept this up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That early morning he was lulled to sleep by the rhythmic sounds of his own digestion.  Deep gurgles echoed through his huge belly and rang beautifully in his ears.  He knew every sloshing churn added up to another layer of fat to wrap his body, and it was never many churns before he felt himself grow a little softer.  Every couple minutes, his noisy belly became more comfortable to sleep on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was a national holiday, and as such, the store never opened.  No one knew about the destruction of the previous night.  As a result, that evening Templeton still found himself alone, save for his rumbling stomach.  His gut had managed to digest everything, and it certainly showed.  His arms had grown thick and a couple chins now rested heavily on his chest, which would be best described as an extension of his growling gut.  His cheeks had rounded out, and his legs...  Well, they'd been overwhelmed not just by their own fat, but by the adipose of his lower belly.  Templeton's tail had grown thick, but even it was beginning to be overtaken by the rest of his body.  It was only a matter of time.  To his belly, though, time was everything.  His intestines clenched and whined, and stomach acids swirled to entice Templeton to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rat didn't need convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting his belly around, he finally managed to tumble from his box.  His belly spilled across the linoleum like dropped jello.  Templeton kicked his legs, but to no avail.  He couldn't move that much dead weight.  After a few more tries, he moved himself a little, but he was burning more calories than he was consuming.  Digestion had left him immobile, since everything now sagged.  He gut became more and more demanding with increasingly loud rumbles.  Finally, he felt his own stomach shift inside.  Perhaps there was some strange combinations of foods that caused what happened next.  Maybe hormones packed into foods had caused something, or maybe it was preservatives.  No one would ever know, but his belly groaned and began to ooze forward.  Templeton blinked as his own stomach began to move him forward.  Laughing, he smacked is belly, causing it to jiggle more.  \"You really can handle anything!  Stomach, lead me to what you want to eat first!  What a glut this will be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton slid along the floor, grumbling away and turned a corner.  The rat's eyes widened as a huge section of the store he didn't know was there opened up.  A large deli was there, as well as the frozen foods section.  The fudge at the candy shop section made his mouth water as his gut wobbled over.  He made his way to candied apples, devoured caramels, gorged on truffles and glutted on peanut brittle.  Oh how his belly loved the sheets of fudge, rumbling continuously for more.  All the while, the sounds of hunger were joined by the sounds of overindulgence.  While on the third sheet of fudge, his belly glopped and bubbled, churning loudly as he headed towards indigestion.  After the fifth sheet, his gurgling gut glorped its way over to the deli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsliced cured hams were in the refrigerators along with roast beef, turkey, chicken, tuna and egg salad.  Each one slowly made its way into his moaning gut.  Pot roasts would have made for a fantastic pot belly, had his belly in fact been smaller.  It had long ago surpassed that title.  With each new sandwich he found, a new series of burbles squeezed its way from his stuffed stomach.  Indeed, he was huge, and the noises from his belly simply confirmed this.  Now hiccuping, Templeton would occasionally take a break from his glorious gluttony to rub his grumbling gut, stimulating digestion so that he could glut even more. \"Hic...HILP!!!  You doing okay there?  Hic...  HILP!!!  You're feeling pretty stuffed.  HIIILP!!!\"  Even his belly groaned at the amount it was being fed, but  it didn't want the binge to end.  It let out a low, low rumble that lasted for a long minute.  Templeton smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, his belly moved him away from the deli, both wanting to swell with something else.  In the frozen food section Templeton found where much of the ice cream from the truck had gone, or at least what hadn't gone to his middle.  Before him was a massive selection of ice cream delicacies, ranging from bars to cakes, just like before.  At the mere sight of it, Templeton's belly shook with a massive rumble, simultaneously gurgling with every shake.  The hiccuping rat swung doors open, pulling out anything he could and gorging himself on the contents inside.  After the first dozen cartons, his stomach began to slosh loudly with the melted ice cream.  The sloshes added up as he enjoyed tubs of the stuff and burbled with a few ice cream cakes.  Templeton was intoxicated by his own binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the rat went back to the main part of the store to continue the cycles from last night.  All the while, his gut groaned even more, wobbling continuously as it shifted its work around.  After downing several gallons of milk to wash down his gorge, he belched and massaged his sloshing swell.  The moans and groans were intense.  \"HIIILP!!!  Satisfied yet?\"  His belly twisted around, trying its best to growl, but it was so stuffed it couldn't manage more than loud gurgles.    Templeton grinned at his paunch's perseverance.  \"We'd better hole up for the night.  Hic... HILP!!!  Can't wait to see what we look like in the morning.\"  His belly whined, but finally slid its way towards a back door.  All the while, however, the glutton still reached for what food he could, adding to his obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob of a rat gurgled and sloshed through the door, finding an old dumpster that had partially fallen apart.  A huge hole was in the side of it, perfect for his bloated body to squish and ooze through.  Inside was a little bit of rotten food, the perfect way to top off his binge.  The dumpster was roomy, which meant he had plenty of room to grow.  Templeton settled in, once again feeling the sloshes of digestion underneath him.  He jiggled and moaned happily, slowly rubbing his gut firmly and causing it to glorp and bubble.  As he drifted off to sleep, he could feel himself fattening up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hours had passed in and out of Templeton's last glut, and Templeton took pleasure in his sleep, his scratchy paws pressed affectionately against his massive gut. He awoken at times only to hear his belly plop and bubble as his orb of fat slowly tightened around him, though no amount of digestion could return elasticity to the rat's once taut form. In just two days, he'd managed to triple in size, but the rat knew his days of glutting were limited. Sure, there was the trash heap, but that was nothing compared to this. And then there was the cat! Sure, humans posed an undeniable threat, but so long as he went on unseen, he could do as he wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe previous night had left him exhausted and pitted within the trash can. The humans had yet to clean up the store over the three day weekend, and though his feast was coming to a full stop, it wasn't over yet! Despite his exhaustion, the rat was energized with hunger. He awoke to loud gurgles and demands from his stretched, bloated paunch, and as night was about to fall, he had the whole evening to glut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More, you say?\" He asked his indulgent paunch, pressing his claws into the all-consuming fat. His short arms, who had converted to flap from the weekend's glutting, struggled to flap at the extensive belly in front of him, a massive appendage just yearning to be extended. \"Well, since you put it that way, I am feeling rather peckish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the rat slid from his comfortable position, slinking from the trash heap and on to the cool grocery store floor. Against his better judgment, he tried to stand, so much so that he waved and flapped his fattened up arms like a bird taking flight. Gravity got the best of him and he raced a foot in front of him, attempting to balance the unruly paunch. But the rat had nearly doubled in size from <i>just </i>night before, and though the weight on his rump was sizable and he'd widened to accommodate, nothing could compare to his wide stomach and its reach. Templeton spilled forward on to a cushion of rolls - his own massive swell. He gave it an affectionate pat and commanded it just as before, and to little surprise, it began to move. There was mobility in that old rat, yet. \"Very well, Stomach. Lead the way. You know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the rat had consumed much of the store over the course of two days, several sections of the store beckoned his return, from the sweet, succulent pastries to the bottomless array of cookies and shortbread. And then of course there was that pot roast, left untouched from nights' past. Before Templeton could have any say in it though, his belly led him toward a shelf of homemade jams. The rat gave his belly a pat of approval and maneuvered to pull one of the jars off the lowest shelf. It glided on to the linoleum floor, and with a pop, Templeton freed the lid from the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith zero hint of decorum, the rat began shoveling mounds of sweet and fresh strawberry jam into his gullet, his claws delightfully sticky from the experience. And oh, it was rich! He could still taste the strawberries as they slid down his eager throat, some whole from within the jar. His belly jiggled like a plate of jello as he consumed the jam in seconds, gurgling with excitement for more. He softened its pleas and reached for a blueberry jar, and before long, the rat had consumed three more jars. He slapped his now widened gut with pleasure and belched, thoroughly hyped up on all the natural sugars contained. With that, he allowed the groaning mass to lead him to his next destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned a corner, and awaiting him was a decadent array of candies, sweets, gummies, and more, each within their own plastic containers just waiting to be devoured. And devoured they would be. Making all sorts of clatter, Templeton leaned against the containers with his rump, dumping the contents of the bottom row on to the floor of the store. Hardly spoiled for choice, he began shoveling the decadent chocolates down his throat, from chocolate turtles to various flavored truffles and confectioneries. He devoured dozens, at one point cramming the contents down his anxious gullet. Thoroughly buzzed from the sugar, the rat slunk his way down the aisle to the breads in euphoric delight, consuming a cinnamon roll in one fell swallow. The flaky, doughy substance added considerable weight to his bottomless stomach, but he carried on, shoveling in one more before consuming two boxes of doughnut holes, several danish pastries, and a full box of slightly hardened - but no less delightful - assorted donuts, glazed to delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh on sugar and inching toward indigestion, the rat's stomach rippled and sloshed under it's master's corpulent appetite. In any other circumstance, Templeton would have been stretched to his limit already, but the weekend's glut had stretched him to grander proportions than ever before. And the further Templeton stretched, the more he simply had to consume. And so he carried on, letting his belly turn back into the soft drinks aisle. Reaching up to grab a bottle without discretion, he fell back against the floor in a glop of blubber. Managing to turn back on to his belly, he twisted the cap from the floor with his teeth, and much to his delight, the spray of cola gushed straight into his mouth. As the momentum of the spray weakened, he began to gulp it down into his widening frame, the cola burning down his throat. Templeton's small legs separated to support his ever-widening frame as he distended from front to back, so much so that as he finished consuming the cola, he bounced slightly atop his belly like a water balloon overflowing with its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rat recessed for a moment, hugging his arms to himself as his stomach growled like an aggravated feline. \"Now... HILP... now...\" He coaxed it, rubbing little parts of in slow, smooth, if not coaxing circles. \"I... HILP... know you want... HILP...\" He groaned and shifted forward, his mass of flesh and body moving as fluidly as a wave from underneath him. \"... More... HILP.\" His stomach groaned in protest, but Templeton took it to mean something else as he pushed his towering appendage forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made the journey to the next feast, he grabbed at a bag of chips, consuming the contents in handfuls, before he moved on to vats of ketchup and mayonnaise. He sampled his palette with crackers and various cheeses, each kept under wraps in layers of plastic, which Templeton painstakingly peeled away with his claws and teeth. Some he swallowed whole, while others demanded big, gratifying bites. He took pleasure in all of it, but preferred the creamiest of cheese, which slid down his throat like warm milk. This bided him more time, allowing his unrelenting mass of adipose to digest, if only for a few minutes. Too bottom heavy to climb produce fixtures, he settled for ground level foods, grabbing at tubs of coleslaw, potato salad, bags of marshmallows, sugared cereals, and whatever else he could get his bloated paws on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours must have passed in the rat's trek to consume everything in sight, and though he could easily be confused for a small dog by that point, there was one feat he'd yet to conquer: that pot roast, glazed and rotisserie'd to perfection. On any other day, the rat could consume an entire pot roast and feast for a week, but that night, there was no end to his incredible hunger. Templeton knew that the treck to the fridge could take ages at this rate, but with morning fast approaching, he didn't have much time to deliberate. </span></div></div>",

This was a feast, after all, and with hours still to spare, a feast would take no prisoners! Templeton strained to open the door amidst his sagging, unmerciful glut and useless arms. The door swung open, hitting him straight back in the rear, but Templeton paid little mind, for right in front of him laid the Holy Grail of glutting: his gloriously unconsumed, fully cooked pot roast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelirious and intoxicated with food, the rat scooped up only a small fraction of his belly from underneath his paws, and with several pushes and some effort, he hoisted himself into the refrigerator. His nearly spherical form slid back toward the floor against the cool, white interior plastic, but he hoisted himself again with a gasp and a groan. By then, he'd worked up quite an appetite! The wave of fat glopped over his widened rat frame as he used the pot roast for support, but inevitably, both Templeton and the pot roast fell from the fridge and back on to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fall was cushioned by Templeton's sprawling fat, but had pushed his stomach in a different direction, causing the contents to swish and slop with every movement. The glorious pot roast, glazed with a thick crackled layer of baked honey, was soon freed from its cooking net with Templeton's able teeth, and within seconds, the glut began chewing into the cold but juicy meat. Candies and pastries were fine, but here was sustenance! He felt like a king. The King of Rats, hah hah! He rubbed his belly ever more, consuming the pot roast that would once tower him in size. He rolled in all sorts of different positions as he ripped off bits of meat, stuffing them euphorically down his throat. At the size of a small Jack Russell, Templeton was utterly immobile and living the dream. Surely he was the most fortunate rat in all the land!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly an hour, if that, had passed, yet Templeton had consumed the whole roast down to just bone. He somehow knew at the back of his mind that morning was approaching, though the store was pitch black. His monumental belly, spilling on to the floor and jiggling erratically, was the size of a bowling ball, dwarfing Templeton's tiny little arms and legs to just appendages. He hadn't a clue how he was supposed to get back to his dumpster, but he'd have to try! The massive swell groaned without coaxing, and Templeton massaged it loyally. \"You... HILP... have been good, Stom... HILP... ach. Most... HILP... mmm, loyal.\" It groaned from underneath him with heaping signs of indigestion, but he just gave it a pat and coaxed it to move. It burbled and squelched and he let out a grunt, and there was no denying it at this rate. Templeton had gorged himself to immobility, and the pot roast, now just bone and grizzle, hadn't helped any. But oh, had it been worth it. \"So I see we have... HILP... a problem. Very... HILP... well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled to turn his head, his neck a thing of the past with the fat pushed straight up to his ratty shoulders. From just a couple feet away, he spotted a row of cupboards, which should be sufficient for the night. If he hid in the corner and kept quiet, surely he wouldn't be noticed. And so the rat, heaving with breath and dragging his massive rolls of fat beneath him at a snail's pace, journeyed to the cupboard. Without the lure of food, he was somehow less anxious, but a rat had to do what a rat had to do. With a heavy grunt, he pushed the door open with his teeth, before he slunk his way in at ground level. It was an arduous task, but the rat managed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to surprise, when he entered the cupboard, he couldn't help but notice the familiar smell of rich cheeses, coleslaws, that glorious egg salad, and so much more! He got a chill, and not just from the delight of his new find, but because he had in fact found an overflow refrigerator which reached further back than Templeton could have anticipated. His belly rippled and groaned in protest, which Templeton took to mean something else in his ratty little mind. \"You... HILP, just don't quit, do ya? HILP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even Templeton had to admit that if he consumed another bite, he'd surely burst. But then, he had found a safe place where he could gorge and be unseen, and with the amount of food in this fridge alone, he could gorge for a week! The rat scratched at his stretched, leniant fur. Morning hadn't fallen quite yet, and he <i>did </i>promise to gorge all night. But then, he was exhausted from hours of gorging, and surely with his heart racing, he would digest that much faster.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>How could Templeton truly resist the binge after such leavings awaited him? So long as he hid at the furthest point in the fridge, no human was bound to find him, and if so, what a glorious way to go! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing his claws against his walloping swell, he pressed on, going by nose as he reached for food in the dark. The gurgles and swirls coming from his stomach broke the silence, and no matter what Templeton did, the acids in his stomach went into overdrive as he reached his second bout of hunger. No amount of food could sustain the glutenous rat, and with so much more room to spread out and so much food at his disposal, the world was his oyster! He certainly had room to grow within that fridge, and grow ever more he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching blindly, he grabbed a whole plastic container of coleslaw, a massive vat that could feed a whole family reunion. He shoveled it in bite by bite, eventually sliding inside the whole vat and devouring the contents whole. He belched voraciously, his belly glorping and growling, before he rolled the container aside and reached for the egg salad. Struck with indigestion, the rat's corpulence shook with both hunger and pain, and the rat answered its pleas, sliding head first into the egg salad and shoving it down his gullet with his fatty arms. Templeton grinned like a fool in a catatonic state, feeling his belly stretching ever more, his rump rising even higher in the air. His ratty tail fattened and yet felt stubby in relation to his massive shape, and he rolled back and forward on his back like a seesaw, grinning as he hugged his Titanic-sized paunch. He nuzzled at it with his rounded, obese cheeks, causing ripples throughout his body which quivered and squelched and moaned ever more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... HILP... certain... HILP... ly can handle... HILP...\" He drummed his hands against the excessive paunch, lying flat on his back despite the waves of fat swirling underneath him, pushing against his arteries and impossibly stretched belly. \".... Nnnf, anything... HILP.\" Screaming for relief, his stomach gurgled and growled, his fur stretched to capacity as the rat's stubbed legs and tail spread out from underneath him. An orb in shape, Templeton was a true butterball. Yet somehow, the hunger switch had been switched on inside of him, and with so much more food at his disposal, how could he deny himself... nay, his hunger, an own entity in and of itself? There was no question that within the last few days, Templeton's <i>love </i>of eating had crossed the line into <i>need</i>. And with an appetite so very passionate, exceptional, and greedy, Templeton had reached newfound tolerances of food intake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rat heaved and rolled on to his side, his belly sloshing about loudly. He used an arm to crawl further into the fridge, his perceptive nose leading him toward the various cheeses stacked above and around him. He breathed a sigh of relief to find they were wrapped in paper instead of the pesky, flavorless plastic. Not even bothering to unwrap a wheel, he bit straight into the paper, devouring chunks of it away before he bit into a soft brie, sharp with flavor and cool to the tongue. He inched toward the wheel as he crammed the cheese in handfuls down his eager gullet. The wheel disappeared in minutes, and when he'd devoured one of them, he went for another... and another... and another, until he'd consumed a dozen, no problems asked. His ever-widening paunch only swirled and expanded to invite each wheel in, and when he'd finished cheeses, he moved on to produce. Awaiting him were several full stems of grapes, which he popped and shoved into his mouth quickly, barely giving himself time to swallow between each one. It was a miracle the rat didn't choke as they passed through his throat and into his gargantuan swell. He gave his stomach another affectionate, loyal pat as it growled. \"Oh listen-HILP-to you... HILP. If our family could... HILP... see us... HILP...\" He gave it a slow massage, heaving between breaths but not deterred. \"N... now... HILP, mmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rat's belly, now ten or so inches in front of him, quivered at his master's tenacity, but it was clear from the rat's bottomless pit of a stomach that indigestion was simply an occupational hazard. Filled to the literal brim with so many delightful palettes of food, how could Templeton possibly differentiate one gastric response from another? The swirls and pangs from within Templeton massaged against his atrophic arteries and the undigested food of the night, lulling the rat into an all-consuming hunger, as his mind blindly confused the cyclone of internal acids for cries of hunger, rather than cries for help. Maybe it was hormones from the preservatives, an internal imbalance, or just the rat's complete loss of reality, but nothing could stop him, not until he'd had his fill of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he would. With a complete lack of conscience, the ravenous rodent devoured the remains of the fridge, from custards to yogurts to cases of guacamole and sour cream. Plastic strawberry containers lined the back side, and he ripped each one open with abandonment, lying on his back as the fruit pummeled down his throat covetously. And just when the rat should have had his fill and called it a night, there it was in front of him, a sight to behold in the midst of dozens of empty containers: a gorgeous cherry pie, glazed with a thick layer of sugar and topped with a rich, calorific glob of whipped cream, five inches high. Without forethought, Templeton pummeled into the pie, now twice the size of the pan it occupied. He grabbed at the sugary delight in chunks, pushing and cramming it down his swollen and raw gullet until the pie was a thing of the past. Covered in whipped cream, the rat licked the excess off his paws and took in the sweet scents of his filthy mat of fur; badges for all he'd consumed over the course of the weekend, and especially that epic night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach gurgled and glorped ever more, and feeling short of breath, Templeton relaxed back into the pie pan, his expanse of fat spilling out left, right, above, below, and everywhere. The fridge hadn't been as roomier as he remembered. If anything, it had shrunk. Intoxicated with sugar and indigestion, he reached for an odd jar of curdled milk and tipped it toward his mouth to wet his palette. The sour liquid filled him up to in-explainable proportions, his head and limbs and fattened tail small in comparison to his now orb-like figure. His gut, stretched in every direction and nearly as wide as it was high, gurgled in defeat, and giving in to its fatigue, he hiccuped uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave his belly a few congratulatory pats, which had now merged with his chest, neck, and even back fat to become one spherical figure. The rat ravished in his new figure, if you could even call it that. He simply couldn't be bigger, yet somehow he'd managed, and what a proud rat he was. Despite his portly proportions, he could imagine himself even bigger, the size of a house cat... or even a cocker spaniel. And Templeton certainly had the appetite for it. Oh, a rat could dream, couldn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton sighed, taking in the pressing feeling against his lungs and arteries and fellow limbs as they negotiated around the various layers of fat accumulated throughout the night. Any more and Templeton's arms and legs surely would have disappeared from within his greedy bloat. He hiccuped again and rolled on this side, his stupendously vast abdomen glopping and groaning for a whole minute. He let out a loud belch and gave his paunch another tender rub. It would take him months, even years, for this to dissipate, and Templeton would surely be immobile (in the usual sense) for quite some time. But what glorious immobility it would be! If only his vast amount of brothers and sisters could truly see him in his full circumference - a true glut to be admired... worshiped, even! Even still, he had come from a long line of gluts, his own parents comparable in size to him for as long as young Templeton could remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these happy thoughts in mind, Templeton lured himself off to sleep, dreaming of his newfound infamy and the many gluts to come. He felt his stomach acids cyclone within him as he dreamed, and despite his massive glut, his paunch began to tighten, but not respectfully. When the rat awoke...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Templeton had slept like a baby the better part of fifteen hours, his overwhelming girth serving as the single best pillow and mattress a rat could ever ask for. Despite the cold fridge, his tower of fat kept him as snug and warm, and thankfully, no human had thought to check the fridges for a slumbering, overfed rat - or a whole team of rodents, for that matter. Needless to say, the staff of the grocery store had been in for a rude awakening when they arrived the next morning. The rat had managed to pummel through 2/5th of the store's inventory in just over one weekend, and each pastry, pie, roll, loaf, chip, produce, ham, chicken, roast, coleslaw, salad, condiment, chocolate, confectionery, and sweet had been crammed within his cavernous swell of a fat and adipose. A large army of rats could have accomplished what Templeton had in just hours, and no glut had been more astonishing than Templeton's last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill massaging at his enormous paunch even while dreaming, the rat felt his legs begin to stretch from his body as he woke for the day. He blinked and yawned, smiling in a drunk stupor as his body sloshed in salutation. \"Morning, yourself. Or evening, I should say. Let's take a look at you.\" He gave his paunch a few loving pats and marveled at its still excessive size. His fat had greatly spread across his body throughout the day as he slept, giving him far more proportion but little mobility, still. Rolls formed from his shoulders to the middle of his back, and from there and down, his wide rump and fatty tail were maxed out with fat. His stubby legs grew out of portly thighs, and what once was his chest conformed with his great belly, which had slightly tightened and rounded around him. Fully digested, he'd filled out to a truly spherical figure both front and back, and considerably wide, he sprawled out in each direction at least six inches. He wouldn't be able to stand on his legs even if he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the rat was elated. Hunched back in that pie pan, he leaned forward enough to press his claws against his paunch, and with a grin, he jiggled the mass from underneath him. He reveled and quivered in the wave of rolls that appeared. His whole body rolled with the movement as he had become a massive blob of flab, quivering and glopping and whirring even then. Fully digested, Templeton's stomach acids begged for more sustenance, but the fatty rat knew, despite his indulgence, that if he got any bigger, he'd never be able to leave the super market. He could pig out temporarily, but soon he would outgrow the fridge and maybe even the dumpster (sure, a rat could dream), and then he would surely be found. He had found a good home, but there were plenty of other stores and markets and dumps. And then there was a fair, which Avory's goose had insisted was a veritable smorgasbord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton's overflowing paunch grumbled at Templeton's lack of consuming, and to sate it, he grabbed at a few of the grapes he hadn't consumed from the night before and plopped them into his mouth, chewing them slowly. His stomach flexed and relaxed, before it bellowed for more, moaning on for a full minute. How hard the rat tried to think past the hunger as he rolled back on to his aching stomach, pushing himself back toward the fridge door. He huffed and puffed and for a minute thought he'd overdone it, but the thoughts dashed from his mind a second later. He pushed at the fridge door and landed back on to the floor with a glop like a bowl of jello. More uncomfortable than his size was his relentless hunger, which thunderously announced itself as Templeton began to push himself across the floor, arms first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For pete's sake, Stomach! You just can't quit, can you? You really can handle anything.\" And in a most ratty way, he grinned devilishly, slapping the side of his stomach, which crackled under his touch and reverberated. Well, one last morsel wouldn't hurt, really. With each glop and glorp along the way, the rat finally grabbed at a bag of whooping pies, which he emptied from the box and shoveled into his mouth with his tail, wrapper and all. Soon, his stomach acids switched from pangs of hunger to sounds of indigestion. Templeton sprawled out on his back, engulfed by his tower of blubber which had managed to expand more in just moments. \"HILP... better?\" Just to be sure, Templeton grabbed at a box of fig newtons and tore it open, but instead of plopping them in one-by-one, he emptied the cookies down his gullet in one fell swoop, both claws in his mouth cramming them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly seemed to quake and adapt to their new additions, which added a sizable amount of weight to his gargantuan appendage. The stomach acids were appeased for now, and so he rolled back on to his belly and began the trek back to the bin. The rat seemed to expand within minutes, and if his journey had been perilous before, it felt even worse then. Templeton spoke up again, struggling to move across the linoleom floor which squeaked from underneath him. \"Geez... HILP... we didn't even eat that much there... HILP... did we, Stomach?\" It gurgled again and he got another pang of hunger, which he attempted to ignore. \"We're almost... there... HILP...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his corpulence only gurgled louder from beneath him as he dragged it along further. It had become a cycle. With so much effort to move his stomach, his hunger grew. Yet as his hunger grew, it took more effort to drag himself along. Not seeming to realize this correlation,  the rat grabbed for anything he could get his furry claws on with abandonment. Tthis time, it was a jumbo size bag of potato chips, which even managed dwarfed him in size - but just barely. He ripped the bag open and crawled inside, shoving all the contents down his maw at an accelerated rate. He felt a \"plop\" in his stomach as he finished it off and he pushed the bag away from him, shaking off the crumbs. He licked at his cheesy and salty claws for a few moments before he carried on then, almost to the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few more... HILP... feet, Stomach,\" he assured it, giving it a slight rub as he crawled along, though he knew the only way to please it would be to stuff it with pies, custards, seasoned meats, fizzy colas, and so much more. Templeton's mouth began to water as he thought of all the possibilities, and along the way to the back door, he acknowledged his stomach's persistent demands and gave into a miniature feast (miniature for the rat). Barely stopping to breathe, the rat indulged in a half dozen cheeses, small tubs of coleslaw, potato salad, egg salad, four wrapped and pre-made six inch subs, and, finally - the piece de resistance - a half-gallon of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Templeton had made it to the back doors, he had blown up even larger than his size the night before. His belly dragged below him a foot back and he slowed ever more with his expansion as his paunch rolled and see-sawed across the floor. By some miracle, he was able to push himself through the doors and back toward his dumpster. He made his way back to the hole in the side to climb back in, and surveying it with a bit of suspicion, he attempted to crawl through it. Perhaps he'd overestimated the size of it, or he simply thought he could pop through the other side. Either way, it had been a long shot. His head made it in all right, but his obesity lodged mid-way and became stuck through the hole. Try as he might, he couldn't push past it or pull himself back out, and so the rat hung tightly from the hole like a fish on a line. \"What unbearable.. HILP... luck! You okay back there, Stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiggled his legs and felt his paunch gurgle in response. To make matters worse, mounds of trash had been emptied into the bin from the past weekend, teasing at Templeton's nostrils as he met his second bout of hunger. Surely if he ate another bite, he'd never escape the grips of the bin and choke, eventually being found by the humans. But on the other hand, he'd die in ecstasy, and what greater way for a rat to go? And then there was the possibility of digesting his glut and roaming free in the morning, which would allow Templeton to have his cake and eat it, too. Templeton was left with one two choices, and miraculously, he was stumped. What WAS a rat to do?</span></div></div>",

Let's go already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton's heart skipped a beat. An ice cream parlor! They were literally delivering him to the most perfect supply of chilled treats he could possible hope for! This was it: his chance to eat without constraint. His chance to become the largest rat there ever was. In his excitement, he completely forgot just how scared he was moments ago. All he could think of now was ice cream... an entire shop full of the stuff! He couldn't wait to see how much of the tasty treat he could fit in his belly; the mere thought made his stomach grumble with impatience... or maybe fullness, Templeton honestly couldn't tell. Either way, he now had some time to digest before arriving at his ice cream heaven. Laying back and using his engorged belly as a make-shift comforter, he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed, and Templeton awoke to darkness. He listened carefully for any sounds but heard only the whirring of some appliances. Peeking out of the top of the box he was still within, he found himself in none other than the parlor... and it was night time! The place was obviously closed: all the lights were off and there wasn't a person to be seen. Templeton crawled out of the box and landed with a <b>THUD</b> on his newly fattened butt. Looking at himself, he noticed he had plumped up nicely... his belly pressed firmly into the ground when on all fours and stood out proud and firm when on his back paws, forming a round orb of a gut that was almost completely spherical and barely sagged. He had grown a double chin, his cheeks had chubbed up, and even his paws and tail were now thicker. Looking behind him, his rear now consisted of two very distinct cheeks, each of which were about half the size of his gut. \"Woah... heh. Well, it's certainly a good start...\" he said, then looked around his current location and took in his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was currently standing on the counter where customers would order. Beside him was an ice cream fridge, though it was empty for the night. The front of the shop was mostly window, and the lamp post directly outside the shop was the only source of light that barely illuminated the shop. Behind him were a series of soft-serve ice cream machines, three in total. Beside them was a prep station filled with all sorts of goodies: sprinkles, candies and even some sort of liquid chocolate topping. There were a couple of tables surrounded by chairs at the front of the building, and the walls were decorated with a multitude of pictures depicting people enjoying the parlor's ice cream. The most curious thing Templeton noticed, though, was the fact that he was placed in the front of the shop instead of in the walk-in fridge behind the counter. Looking down behind the counter, he noticed a new shipment of ice cream on the floor... dozens of tubs! He hopped down and took a better look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the tubs was 5 gallons and stood taller than Templeton could reach. Climbing a nearby stool, he opened one and found the contents completely melted. \"What the... were they too lazy to put the new shipment in the fridge?\" he wondered. Speaking of fridge, he jumped off the chair and looked inside by standing on one of the nearby ice cream tubs and pulling the large door open. It took all his strength, but when it was accomplished he was met with a... well, disappointing sight: The walk-in was mostly empty. It was lined with shelves that, supposedly, should have been stocked with the now liquid-filled tubs that were left in the front of the shop. All that remained were five tubs, sitting on the floor near one of the racks. There were some other boxes laying on the counter beside the one Templeton exited from, but he recognized them as the boxes he emptied while still in the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Templeton muttered to himself, \"Ice cream <i>is</i> ice cream... but I was hoping for more of the actual cold stuff...\" Looking down at his plump body, he thought of where to start...</span></div></div>",

Templeton licked his lips as his stomach grumbled at him. \"I agree, stomach...\" he said while patting it, causing it to bounce and wobble like a rubber ball, \"...let's get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began by ripping the lid off of the closest one: a brand new tub of chocolate ice cream. It was tough removing the lid, but by positioning himself on the shelf above it and pulling hard he managed to get it open. Templeton's mouth watered as he dug in, using his paw as a makeshift scoop for a few minutes before becoming impatient and diving into the tub head-first. After tunneling his way to the bottom and surrounding himself in the delicious substance, his eating became ravenous. The ice cream tasted amazing, and Templeton could only think about how this was just the first tub... about just how much more of the sweet snack had been gifted to him. The better part of an hour passed as the contents of the tub disappeared, only to be replaced by the rat's sloshing body. It pressed against all sides of the tub by the time he was done. The melted contents of the container sloshed within him as he rocked back and forth, knocking the tub over and allowing himself to escape the plastic cylinder. Pulling himself out, his gut surged to its full size, no longer constrained by the size of the tub. Templeton regarded himself. He was now completely coated in the chocolate-flavored substance. The cold that both covered and filled him made him shiver, causing his entire body to undulate in waves. The first five gallons had bloated him even larger than his binge in the truck; He was now 95% stomach, and he was finding it difficult to prevent his limbs from getting lost in the blobby appendage. He belched and hiccuped as he walked, and despite movement being quite difficult he climbed back onto the shelf. With some difficulty, he managed to get the vanilla tub open despite his sloshy gut being an obstacle. \"Ohhhh... *uurrp* ..one... *HILP-urp* ...down...\" he muttered, continuing despite the fullness that was already hitting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton attempted to tackle the vanilla tub in the same way he ate the chocolate, but found that his method of tunneling was no longer possible. His body had bloated so much that he would need to eat his way downwards, consuming all the way to the rim of the tub. He dove head first into the ice cream, his relatively tiny legs and tail sticking up in the air while a large portion of his gut hung off the side of the tub and formed a muffin-top over the rim. His progress downward was sped up thanks to his body heat; it melted the ice cream into a sort of slurry that made it easier for Templeton to consume. After 15 minutes and half of the tub Templeton had run into a problem though: he was stuck. At this point he was basically upside-down, hanging from his own gut above the tub's remaining contents. His gut had blown up to the point of being wedged completely into the container's opening, forming a sort of dome-shaped cap on top of the tub whose top reached two feet above the opening and sagged around the container's entire rim by about a foot. Templeton squirmed and fidgeted, trying to loose himself to reach the remaining half of the now melted ice cream, but he was wedged in completely. His belly gurgled impatiently, wanting the rest of the tub. \"Urrrr- *urrrp* ...uh... let's try- *HIC* -this...\" He rocked back and forth until the container fell over and allowed the vanilla-flavored liquid to submerge his head. Gulping furiously, he managed to finish the entire remaining 2.5 gallons in under a minute. His final gulp was punctuated with a loud SNAP as the container burst outward from Templetons inflated girth. The rat panted; he felt like he was drowning in a sea of himself. No matter where he looked all he could see was his own body, sloshing an rippling thanks to its liquid contents... \"Heh heh he- *uuuorp-HIC* ...heh... *gurgle-HIC-HIC-URRRP* ...I can't w- *buurrp-HIC-urrrp* ...wait to see how b- *glorble-buuuooorpp* ...big all this makes m-me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Templeton didn't have to move much to reach the tub of strawberry. There was no way he was going to be able to get on the shelf anymore, so instead he used his weight to knock over the third tub and open it from the floor. Finding a position to eat from was starting to become difficult, but Templeton managed to get himself into a pose where his head and front paws could be used to tunnel into the container while his ridiculous gut took up space behind him. The progress was slower than the vanilla container since he couldn't melt the substance with his body this time, but after only slightly more than a half hour he reached the end of the strawberry tub. Because of his position with his stomach flowing out behind him, he was able to pull himself through and consume the entire tub with no issues caused by his belly. If someone where to see him now they would have been met with a very strange sight: a tub laying sideways with something large moving inside, and a bulbous furred sack with the appearence of a bean-bag chair flowing out of the container's mouth, completely filling the hole and shaking as the thing moved inside. \"*UUUuurp-gurgle-HIC* ...oooooohhh- *HIC* -maaan...\" he muttered to himself as he struggled to reverse his was out of the container, \"I - *GLLLUuuurp* don't kn-kno- *HIC* -know how long... *OOorrp-HIC-ooorp* ...I c-can keep thi- *BUUUurrp* -s up... *OOOUURP*\" Movement was starting to become a real obstacle now, and Templeton had to make use of various tactics to pull, move and maneuver his way to the next tub. His fear of becoming immobile had been completely forgotten, and it was almost as if his stomach was starting to take control over his body instead of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth container was filled with some sort of rainbow ice cream - Templeton was too fixated on his gorging to bother reading whatever name they decided to use. The massive rat found that by rolling onto his stomach he was now a bit higher up than the shelf he had used to open the first two containers. Positioning himself properly was quite the struggle, but eventually he managed to get into his fourth container and resume his eating. He dug his way downward and, like with the vanilla tub, became stuck around the half way point, his body clogging the entrance and the oddly-flavored ice cream mostly melted out of his reach. Once again, Templeton formed a living cap on the tub - though a much larger one this time. The top of his huge gut was four feet above the tub's entrance and stretched past the rim of the container just as much, forming a waterfall of fat that dipped all the way to the floor. Someone from the outside wouldn't be able to see the ice-cream tub at all, just an undulating mass of fur. Templeton planned on rocking the container over again, but as soon as he fidgeted the entire tub broke under his weight and he came crashing down. The melted ice cream splashed everywhere, and Templeton rolled himself out from under his own gut. \"Moooo- *HIC* -ooore... *UUUorRRP* ...I want- *UUURRRP-HIC-gurgle-OOORP* -m-more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final container in the freezer was odd - Templeton knocked it over and opened it from the side as to not repeat the events of the previous tub. Inside was a very thick chocolate ice cream loaded with what appeared to be cookie dough, peanut butter and chucks of chocolate. Templeton dug into the tub with more vigor than ever before. It was almost as if the rich ice cream awoke something in him, and he found himself less aware of what he was doing and more focused on consuming. The tub seemed to disappear almost instantly and after crawling back out of the tub, Templeton....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next events seemed to pass without any input from Templeton himself; he was now so lost in his binge that he was barely aware of what he was doing, only that he would keep going until his belly was satisfied. Loud grumbling and sloshing noises erupted from the mass as he moved out of the fridge and into the main shop where the liquid tubs were. How he was still moving with how big his gut was, and how he managed to get himself into a position where he was able to begin pouring the liquid tubs down his own throat he didn't know - his body was performing the gorging automatically now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTub after tub disappeared into his increasingly gelatinous gut. His gluttony urged him forward, screaming to make sure he filled his stomach ever fuller. His limbs started to be overtaken by the rest of his body - sucked into his overwhelming stomach... but as long as his mouth and front paws were still free, he would continue. So as hours passed and tubs were emptied Templeton grew and swelled, allowing his body to control him while occasionally muttering \"M-more...\" in between tubs and belches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final tub being poured into his mouth was the last straw - Templeton's stomach finally overtook him completely. His stomach sloshed loudly before rolling over the entirety of his body - including his head and front paws - leaving Templeton a massive sloshing blob. Having consumed more than five bathtubs' worth of ice cream, Templeton had finally reached his limit. His gut towered over him, it's curve cresting at the same height as the nearby counter where customers were served - and its length and width were both greater than its height. Templeton's tiny body was under it all, and he was completely lost in the greatest torrent of belches he had ever encountered. \"*BYOOOOOOO-HIC-UUURRRPPPP* ...Ahhh... *HIC-UUURRRRRROOORRRRUUPPP-HIC-HIC* ...I... *UUUUOOORRP-gurgle-OOOORRPPP* ...ca- *UUUUURRRRPPP-HIP-UUUUUUOOOOOOORRPP* ...can't... *HIIIIIIC-HIIIC-UUUUUURPPP* ...w- *burble-UUUURP-HIC-HIC-HIC-UUUUOOORP* ...w-wait... *UUUOOORRRUP-HIC-gurgle-URP* ...t-to eat... *HIC-UUOORP-HIC-UUUURRRP-HIC-OOOORP* ...e-even... *borp-OOOORP-HIC-URRRPP* ...mooooooore... *gurgle-UURRP-HIC-borble* ...ooohhh-OOOOORP...\" He mumbled to himself and fantasized about an even bigger feast as he pressed himself into his monumental over-filled stomach. His gut jiggled and trembled at every sound that exited his mouth thanks to its liquid contents. He closed his eyes and drifted off into a deep food coma, noises continuing to erupt from him even as he slept.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mmmmmm... *URRRRRPP* Wha...!\" Templeton's eyes shot open with a belch and was overcome with confusion. Looking upward, Templeton saw a clear blue sky obstructed by trees. \"Uhhh... *OOURP* ...wasn't I... *URP* ...uhh...in a building when I fell asleep?\" He also had the feeling he was being watched... leaning upward as best he could, he looked around to the best of his ability. \"Is... *UURRUP* ...someone there? *HIC*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton's heart practically stopped when he saw a tubby red fox emerge from a nearby bush, staring at him as it approached. Trying to get up and bolt, Templeton found that he was completely immobile. Alarms went off in his head: how could he have let this happen? He knew the risk of predators if he let himself get too fat, but he let it happen anyway. He got so lost in his feast that he let his gluttony consume him... and now he was going to pay the price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" the fox said as Templeton thrashed in an attempt to stand, \"Calm down. I'm gonna help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton stopped and stared at the fox for a moment. Still scared, but interested he asked \"Why would you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox licked his lips. \"Because then you'll help me... alright hear me out. I watched you last night through the parlor windows. I saw you demolish that shop's entire stock, and I'm the one who dragged you out of there so you wouldn't get caught. It's crazy... you were huge. You still are huge! Basically I want to help you get even bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton raised an eyebrow. \"You want t-to *URRP-HIC* help me eat more? *OOOURRPPP* Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox paused. \"...because I want to eat you... but I want to see how fat I can make you first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton's heart sank. \"What? *HIC* Eat me? Why- *OORUP* -why would I agr- *UUUORP* ..agree to this? *HIC* I can... *BUURP* ...feed myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox laughed. \"If you don't agree I'll just eat you now. Seriously, look at yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton did as he was told and observed his body. His previous meal had mostly digested, leaving him with a body that was composed of more fat than rat. Laying on his back, his front paws and head were now free but his back paws and tail were still buried - only now it was under a mountainous series of fat rolls instead of a massive ice cream-filled stomach. Even if Templeton re-positioned himself in an attempt to free his lower limbs, his rear was now large enough to hide his tail from view and his paws were completely enveloped in fat. Even his front paws - although visible - were not exactly usable thanks to the amount of adipose surrounding them. His head had been plumped up considerably as well, with tubby cheeks that were as big as oranges and a series of chins that transitioned well into his new tremendous gut. Said gut's overall size had shrunk since he fell asleep - digestion and all - but it still loomed a couple of feet over him at its thickest roll and took up all immediate space to his left and right. At the top of his gut - not that he could see - was a navel deep enough that his old skinny body could take refuge in it... a fact that was especially alarming considering his navel was normally not visible at all. Simply put - Templeton wasn't going anywhere. Lugging around what was, essentially, a big sack full of ice cream with his old body was one thing... but now he could barely move his body at all, with his paws being rendered completely useless thanks to the fat that had swallowed them. \"Ummmm... huh. *URRP* ...yeah I guess I didn't expect my... *URRUP* ...eating to have this big of a... *ORP* ...uh...an effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen...\" the fox said, \"I don't need to do this. Really it's a service to you. I fatten you up until you reach your limit... then I'll eat you. We both get to be happy. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenpleton sighed. \"I don't have much of a choice, so... fine. But I warn you, I'm not sure if my gut even has a limit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see...\" the fox said, \"I'm going to push you to an abandoned warehouse I know of on the outskirts of town. People never visit, so I can fatten you without any pesky humans stumbling upon us. I'm Red, by the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*OOOUUURP* ...Templeton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed grunted in acknowledgment as he began to push Templetons mass further away from town.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time they reached the warehouse it was night time; the warehouse was quite out of the way and hidden deep in a wooded area. Templeton had finally finished digesting, resulting in a new layer of fat on his body and a stomach that occasionally grumbled, wondering why it had stopped being filled. The building was quite large, with it's roof being three stories high, its width being larger and it's length being twice of that. Red opened the door and rolled Templeton in, giving Templeton a good look of the building. His eyes widened and mouth dropped when he saw the inside. It was completely crammed full of food of every kind: sugary treats, piles of meat, vats of milk and everything in between. \"What the- where did all this food come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all mine. I stole some... found some... I dunno. I've built up a collection over time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just eat this stuff? Why do you want to eat me?\" Templeton exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer my meals alive. I'm a hunter, not a scavenger who will eat anything like you rats. I collect this stuff because... well, you're not the first one I've brought here. I always bring my prey here to fatten before I eat them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... interesting.\" Templeton didn't know what else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most don't last long before their stomachs give out but... seeing how big you got last night. You were bigger than any animal I've ever fattened... I once stuffed a wolf and couldn't get him to that size. I'm... very interested to see how far I can take you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Again, Templeton could not think of anything better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lets start then.\" exclaimed Red, clapping his paws together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right now? After all that travel?\" Templeton was starting to lose faith in his belly's power and wanted to delay the beginning of his end, but his stomach had confidence to spare. At Templeton's objection, it let loose with a loud rumble, an obvious cry for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I agree with your stomach,\" said Red as he pushed a keg that was bigger than the both of them combined over to Templeton. \"Don't worry, we'll start with something familiar.\" With surprising strength, he lifted the huge keg and brought the hole on the top up to Templeton's mouth. \"Bottoms up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other choice, Templeton opened up and allowed the liquid from the keg to flow into his mouth - it was more melted ice cream! Once he began to gulp the sweet substance down, his fears and worries began to leave and his stomach started taking over again. Having Red feeding him allowed Templeton to eat at a much quicker rate, and it took less time to consume the entire keg than it did for him to drink one of the 5 gallon tubs on his own. After the first keg, Templeton had already swelled visibly. His full stomach pushed his belly out, smoothing his fat rolls into a more of a ball shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey - a whole keg!\" Red laughed, \"Believe it or not, most don't even make it that far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*gurgle-HIC-UUURRPPP* ...mmm- *ORP* Th- *glorp-OOURP* ...th-that's nothing... *HIC-UUUOOORP*\" Templeton replied, his stomach's cockiness getting the better of him, \"*UUURUP* It's g-gonna... *HIC-BUUURP* ...take a l- *UUURP* ..lot m-more than that to- *UUURUP-HIC-HIIILP-gurgle-HIC-OOORRRRP...*\" He trailed off, unable to finish his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed wasted no time, grabbing a second keg. Then a third. A fourth. Templeton couldn't see where he was pulling them from, but he happily gulped down all that Red offered, his stomach holding up beautifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't end until the tenth keg. With the last bit of the keg emptied out Templeton's stomach made a large gurgling noise and sloshed over his head, overwhelming him just like at the end of his ice cream binge. \"*BUUUUUOOOOORRRUUPPPP-HIC-HIC-HIC-HIIIIIOOOORP-HIC-gurgle-OOORP* Y- *URRRRUORRRUP-HIC-burble-HIC-HIC-BUUURP-BEEEEELLLLOOOOUUUPP* ...yo- *BEEEEELLLLUUUPP-UUUURP-BUUURRRUPP-HIC-HIIIIC-BELLLLLLURP* ...you... *OOOOOUUURP*\" Templeton tried to speak between the belches but was unable. Thanks to Red's assistance Templeton was able to push his stomach further than he ever would have been able to on his own. His stomach seemed to by responding to the amount of liquid that was being pumped into it with faster digestion - part of his current gorge was already digested and spread across his body in the form of an new wave of fat. His gut was taller than most humans, pushed so high thanks to a combination of blubber and over-filled stomach, and it covered almost 80 square feet of floor space. \"Hey, this is what I wanted to see.\" Red said as he leaned into Templeton's gut, his arm sinking in up to his elbow. \"...but why stop here? You have me now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*BUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRROOOPPPP* ...wh-*EEEEEUUUUUUUUURRRPPP*-wha?-*BUUUURRRRUPP-HIC-HIC*\" was the only response Templeton could make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed keeled down and grabbed the section of fat that had hidden Templeton's head from view. With a loud grunt, Red lifted the section of belly up off the ground. He then moved a couple of the empty kegs under the shelf of stomach, propping it up and exposing Templeton's head once more. \"There. Now you can keep eating. Don't worry, as long as I'm here I'll make sure you'll keep getting more until you're satisfied...\" He laughed as he turned and grabbed another keg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the binge continued. Red must have run out of kegs, because he started stuffing Templeton with all kinds of other foods. Templeton slurped down long ropes of sausages, tore into entire cakes, swallowed fruits whole... it was the longest amount of time Templeton ever spent eating, and he was enjoying every minute of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy morning Templeton had swollen to an insane size that was several times larger than when Red placed the kegs under him - in fact, those kegs where now bending a little under the new weight they were trying to support. Templeton didn't bother trying to speak - at this point his mouth was emitting a continuous string of burps, hiccups and gurgles that made any attempts at speech impossible. Templeton marveled at his size. He had no idea his stomach was capable of stretching this much - and the only reason it wasn't stretching even further is because Red was too tired to continue. \"...whew!\" he said \"See? I told you I'd help you.\" He turned toward the warehouse's entrance and started to walk away. \"I'm going to bed. I suggest you sleep too, digest all that stuff. And be ready tomorrow. I'm going to make today look like you were on a diet, heh heh heh...\" Templeton's mind exploded with excitement at the thought, and his belches increased in intensity. With the constant quaking of his belly, the kegs finally gave out and were crushed under his belly's weight. Head hidden by his belly once again, he fell into another food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RISE AND SHINE!\" Templeton was startled awake the next morning by Red. He was surprised to see his head was free again. This time, though, it wasn't free because of digestion: Red had constructed some sort of support system with some thick wooden beams to hold Templeton's immensity back. \"Sorry I took so long,\" Red said, \"I needed to restock a bit...\" He gestured toward some new, surprisingly large piles of food. Templeton's eyes widened. \"Heh... alright let's start then.\" Red chuckled, noticing Templeton's excitement. Grabbing some of the new food, another feeding session began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this new binge, Templeton thought back to his dream... his dream of various food items feeding themselves to him... his dream of growing larger and larger, out of control and into immobility. He realized how similar his current situation was to that dream - with Red feeding him massive quantities of food, his seemingly accelerated digestion, and his current size being far from mobile. He used to be terrified by the dream, but now he wondered why. Eating was always his favorite pass time and he had already far surpassed his goal of becoming the largest rat in the world... if ending his life early was the price for being the greatest glutton who ever existed, maybe that price isn't so bad. After all, what good would living a longer life be if he didn't enjoy it? Who knows, maybe his stomach really didn't have a limit...</span></div></div>",

Templeton was consistently stuffed to such a degree that his stomach was never empty and he was in a constant state of digestion. Every day was spent eating... and eating... and eating... while his body pushed upward and outward. After one week, Templeton had grown so fat that his eyes where forced shut with blubber and his paws had disappeared completely into his thick flab. After another, Templeton's stomach and mouth noises were so loud they rumbled the ground and shook the factory walls. After a third, Red's support beams finally met their match and succumbed to the weight of Templeton's immensity. It took several days for Red to construct newer, stronger ones. In that entire span, binging paused but Templeton still had so much in his stomach that, even after those several days, his stomach was still not empty. Red still made up for the break with an extra large meal that lasted more than an entire day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a month, Red seemed to perfect his food-stealing abilities. They celebrated the end of the first month with a week-long feeding session that left Templeton several times larger than when the week started. Templeton had no idea where he was getting all this stuff, but stopped caring about everything other than eating weeks ago. After another month, He felt the left and right-most sides of his body press into the warehouse walls. Another month and the farthest part of his gut reached the back wall. It took less than an additional month for the top of his belly to reach the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*<b>BUUUUURRRRRRUUUUUPPPP-OOOORRRRRRRUUUUOOOOOOPPPP-HIC-HIC-HIC-IIIIIUU UUUURRRRROOO-gurgle-OOOOOOUUUURRRRRROOOP-BUUUUUUUURRRRUUUOOP-rumble-UUUUUUURRRRR RUUUP-HIC-HIIIIIC-HIIIIIC-OOOOUUUUUUUURRRP</b>* ...ce... *<b>BEEEEEEEEOOOUURP-HIIIIC-HIC-HIC-BUUUUUUURRRUP-blorgle-UUUUUURRUUUUPPP-HIC-UU UUUURRRROOOORRRPPP-HIC-HIC</b>* ...cei... *<b>HIC-HIC-HIC-UUUUOOOORRRP-HIIIC-HIIIIIIIC-BUUUUUUUURRRRRROOOOPP-HIC-UUURRRRRO OORP</b>* ...ling... *<b>UUUUURRRRRRUUUUURRRP</b>*\" Templeton managed to express the occasion between earth-rumbling belches. He hadn't spoke in weeks, but he felt the new landmark needed to be expressed. Red laughed. \"Oh yeah? That's quite an accomplishment. How about we celebrate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Red a week to prepare, Templeton slept pretty much the entire time. His stomach still wasn't empty by the end of the week, and his belly had actually grown more rather than shrank despite the week-long fast. \"You ready to finish this place off?\" Red asked when the feast was ready. \"*UUURP-HIC-UOORP* ...yeah... I'm... *OOOURP-gurgle-HIIIC-BUUURUP* ...ready.\" Even after a week of constant gas release, speaking was still difficult. \"Let's... *HIC-HIIIIIC-HIIC* ...go.\" After a week of prep, the feast finally restarted. Red fed with such enthusiasm that Templeton thought he might finally overwhelm his gut. It wound up not being an issue of course, Templeton's stomach kept up with the intake perfectly. Large vats of tasty liquids, pounds upon pounds of meat, enough sugar for multiple schools-worth of children... all of it was crammed into Templeton at such a fast rate that it probably would have taken him weeks to eat what he was now eating in seconds. After a week, his belly went from simply touching the walls and ceiling to pressing into them. Templeton was sure that they would bust soon, but it seemed they were tougher than he thought. Several more weeks passed without the binge ending and pressure only mounted. His gut pressed so tightly into the builing's walls and ceiling that he was beginning to wonder if maybe his gut had met its match. After a couple months though, the ceiling finally gave way. Templeton let out a groan as his belly burst the roof off and surged to its true hight. The pressure exherted by his belly was so great that it sprung the roof upward into the air after blowing it to peices. His gut then formed a masive dome, stretching meters above where the roof used to be and rolling down the sides of the building. Templeton was brought back to his ice cream binge months ago - how it had felt like an accomplishment to outgrow a tub of ice cream... now he was doing the same to buildings. The feast continued though. It didn't end until one more week later when the walls of the factory crumbled, sending Templeton's gut crashing down to the ground. The impact shaked the earth. Red stood back and looked at his work. Templeton was monolithic. His belly arced so much higher than the trees that it almost seemed guaranteed to a human would see it at some point. His belly had actually managed to knock down more than a few trees when it freed itself from the factory walls - he took up a lot more space now that the factory wasn't holding him back. In fact he seemed to be about twice as big as the factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton meanwhile was in bliss. His gut smashing against the ground was the best belly massage he had ever recieved. The impact caused his entire mass to shake, sending tidal waves of fat across his belly. His mouth was stuck open, a constant sound erupting from it that was a strange mixture of hiccups, belches, gurgles and moans. It only just occured to Templeton what a surreal turn his life had taken... going from a starving rat to a literal mountain of a rodent so quickly. If he had seen himself those few months ago, he probably would have been horrified... but now he couldn't be happier with how things turned out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed approached Templeton's head. \"Well, from the looks of things, I'd say my side of this deal is done. There's no way you're going to be able to fit anything else in this body.\" He patted the front of Templeton's gut, prompting an especially large belch to erupt from the rat's mouth. \"I don't know how, but I think it's time for my meal to begin...\"<br>\r\n\"<b>BYOOOORRRUUUHgurgleHICBUUURRROOoohhhooOORPUURRRHICsloshOOORUUPMMMmmr rrRRUUUURRRPPP</b>-w-<b>HIILPblorpBEEEEEELLLCHUURRRRROOoooooohhoOORRRRRRPHIIIICU UUURRRRROOOORRRRRPP</b>-wait- <b>BUUUUUURRRRUUURRRPPPHIIIILPmmmmUUUUURRRRUPPPPburbleHIIICBEEELLLLLCHUUUURRRP{/ b}...\" Templeton managed to stammer out with difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?

Red could tell he could take even more. He stared at Templeton in silence for a few moments. \"Alright, this is perfect.\", he said, \"I'll be back in a week. I need to make some preparations.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone, Templeton suddenly noticed the feeling of rain hitting the top of his belly. He had spent more than half a year eating in the factory and it was now the beginning of spring. It was actually quite cold, but his massive body provided him with more than enough heat. The rain felt soothing as it pelted his over-sized gut; he couldn't move his arms to rub his stomach anymore because of the amount of fat that surrounded them, but the rain hitting his belly made for a great alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooooooo<b>ooOOOOOOOOOORRRR-HIIIC-gurgle</b>-muuuuuuuu<b>uuUUUUURRRUU UUUOOORRP-HILP-HIIIIIC</b>-mmmm-mmmuuuuuuch-<b>blorgle-HIIIIIILP-BUUUUUUUURRRRRO OORRUUUP</b>-f-fffffffoooooood-<b>UUUUURRRRRRRRP-UUUURRRRROOORP-UUUUURRRRUUUUUPP </b>-sssssssoooooo-<b>HIIIIIC-HIIIIILLP-HIIIIIIIIIIIC-BEEEEEEEELLLLCH</b>-sssss- ssssstuuuuuffffff-<b>HHHUURPP-HHHIC BUUUUUURRRRP</b>-ed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton's stomach ached with fullness. He had a lot of fat on his body, but the majority of his mass came from all the food he had managed to cram into that insatiable organ. His stomach currently held more than 10,000 cubic meters worth of cake, ice cream, steak, burgers, hot dogs, pork, eggs, watermelons... name it, it was inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-<b>HHHUUUUUURRRRROOOOORRRUUUUURRRUUUUUPP-BUUUURRRRPPPP-OOOOOOORRRgroo oaanoooOOOOOOORRRP</b>-III d-dessss-<b>HHHHUUURRROOORRRRPblorpUUUUUUUURP-HIIILP-HIIIIC-OOOOORRRRRRRRP</b>-t -t-trooooooo<b>ooOOOORRP</b>-troyed-<b>HHHHIIIIIOOOOooooOOOOOORRRUUURRRRP</b>-th e b-<b>BBBBBBBBUUURURRRRROOOORRRPP-HIIIILP-HIIIIC-HIC-HIC-HIIIIIIIIIIIC</b>-b-buu{ b}uuUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRPPPP-build-<b>OOOOOOOOOORRRRP</b>-ing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his mind, Templeton went over how large the factory was... It was impossible for him to know his current size by any accurate measure, but Templeton really didn't need a more specific measurement than \"big enough to destroy a building\". Templeton heard the supports Red built creaking. It probably wouldn't be long before they gave out and his head was buried under his own body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'mmmm<b>mmMMMMMMMMMMMOOOOOORRRRRUUUURRRPPP-HIIIILP</b>-ssssssoooo{ b}ooooOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRIIIICCgurgleHIIIIILPPP-huuuuu<b>uuuUUIIIC</b>-uuuuuge. ..<b>HILLLP</b>...sssssoo<b>oooOOOOOOOOOOORRRRPPP-HIIILP-OOOOORRRRP-HIIIIIIC</b> -fffaaaaaaaaaaaat-<b>HIIILP-OOORRRROOooooooOOOORRRRP</b>-sssssssssssssssssssssoo ooooooooo<b>oooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRPPP-HILP-HIC-HILP-HIIIIC-HIIIIIL P-HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLP-BBEEEEEEELCH</b>-FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATT-{b }BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRP...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton guessed at his current weight. He remembered Red mentioning on their second day together that he already weighed more than an elephant. Imagine that! A rat that ate so much he weighed multiple tons, and that was months ago! How many tons did he weigh now? 100? <i>1,000</i>? No, Templeton thought, that's too low... I must be at least 5,000... <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"<b>HIIIRPP</b>-I-<b>OOOOOOOOORRRRUUUUUURRRRP</b>-I c-caaaaa<b>aOOOOOOOORRRRPP-HIIIIIILP</b>-caaan't-<b>HHHHHHHILLP-HIIIC-OOOORR RRP-UUUUUUUUUUUUURP</b>-w-w-wait-<b>OOOOOOORRRRUUUURRRP-HHHIIIILLP-HIIIIIIC</b>- t-t-to<b>-HHHHHHHIIIIIIIILLLP-HIIC-BEEEEEEELLLLLLLOOOOOOOORRRRRP-HIC</b>-eeeeeea t-t-t-<b>OOOOOOOOOOOORRRUuuuuuuuUUUUURRRRRP-HIIIILP</b>-ev-v-ven-<b>HHHHHIIIIIII IIIUUUUUUUURRRRRRRP</b>-moooooooo<b>ooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORP</b>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to do anything else, Templeton slept while he digested. Fat packed onto his body in such large quantities that you could actually see his body change as he he grew increasingly more obese. Wide, meaty rolls would suddenly appear and grow, causing his body to lose what little form it had and become more gelatinous. The new fat appearing caused his entire mass to shake, making his belly wobble and bounce as it bloated further. His limbs and tail were sucked deeper and deeper into his body and more fat added itself onto Templeton's face, swelling it so it lost it's recognizability and became more blob-like to match the rest of his body. Pools of water began forming in various spots on his belly while rivers formed in the trenches between his numerous fat rolls. His belly-button filled up to hold more than 10,000 gallons of rain water before it overflowed and began rolling down his gut. Just as he thought, Red's supports broke and his head was hidden from the world thanks to his overwhelming blubber. At first it was only a couple feet of fat that separated his head from the outside, but as he continued to digest and fatten over the week that distance grew to to 5 feet... 10 feet... 30 feet... 40... 50... 60...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, no one ever noticed the over-sized rat. Humans just didn't seem to come to this area of the forest and animals were kept away by the frightening Earth-rumbling sounds of his digestion going into overdrive and digesting its backlog of food. By the end of the week his stomach had been emptied, and almost immediately started to groan in hunger. Red returned to Templeton while he was still in his food coma. The rat's snores were laced with hiccups, and every exhale he made was instead a long belch that shuddered the earth.</span></div></div>",

Between super-skinny and super-stuffed, they might be evenly matched. Throwing a quick glance to his right, he saw the path through which he had come, and he immediately began calculating mentally how to get to safety. There had to be something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Time to burn some calories</i>, he though ruefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShooting the fox one last winning smile, the fat rat turned and ran for his life, waddling unsteadily, but managing to maintain a decent speed on his hind legs. The fox gave chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chase was harrowing, but Templeton was still crafty. He ran around many trees and zigzagged as much as he could around various rocks and fallen branches. The fox did its best to keep up, but the rat was surprisingly light on his feet. Every time he thought he had his prey, the rat would suddenly swerve around something, slowing it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both running out of breath after about a minute, both of them woefully out of shape, and one was going to give up soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Templeton spied a tree with a hollow section that looked to be just wide enough for him to get through, even with a gallon of ice cream sloshing around inside of him. Taking his chance, he dove towards it, wedging himself into the hole. He stuck fast about halfway through. He didn't waste time cursing his gluttony. He furiously began to try shifting himself through. He could see the hole on the other side was slightly larger, and all he had to do was force himself through this one so he could escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he heard the footsteps of the fox coming closer and closer. With a frustrated shriek, the rat thrust himself forwards with one last desperate attempt, and just as he could smell the fox's hot breath on his backside, he popped free and flew through the other hole, just as a pair of jaws entered the hole and wedged in themselves. The poor fox had wedged his whole snout in and couldn't get out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton didn't linger to mock or humiliate his predator. He knew that the fox would be able to free itself in due time. He kept running, leaving the other animal behind. He didn't stop, even though his tiny rodent heart was pounding. He must've covered a quarter of a mile, but he soon made it to a desolate road at the end of the woods, and he saw a town in the distance. Panting heavily, he reckoned the fox wouldn't try to follow him through there. If he just kept to the backstreets and alleyways, he'd be able to sneak around until he found his way back to the Zuckerman's farm.</span></div></div>",

He gasped for breath as he made his way towards the mass of buildings. He knew he could find a way in if he could just keep going. The ice cream was bubbling uncomfortably from a greatly disturbed digestion. He was having trouble concentrating from how ill he was beginning to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard the sound of an automobile coming up the road from behind him. He skittered off the road and watched as the large dirty red pickup truck rattled by, and it came to a stop at the nearby intersection. Realizing it was heading in the same direction as the town, Templeton got an idea. He waddled forward as fast as he could, and he managed to grab onto the rear bumper just as it was rolling away. Yelping in surprise at the sudden movement, the fat rat heaved himself up onto the bumper and struggled up the slippery tail end of the cargo hold. He struggled until he finally found a foothold and pulled himself up and over the back end of the door, and he landed in the hold with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved to see the buildings coming past, he knew he was well and away from the fox now. Leaning against the door, he patted his stomach and got some rest, hoping to settle his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another fifteen minutes before the truck finally reached its destination. To the rat's surprise, it wasn't a shop of some sort, but a house. It was a rather nice-looking neighborhood with many homes lining either side of the street. It was nothing like the farm. Everything was really close together rather than scattered all over the place. The rat couldn't help but be impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the sound of the truck's doors opening and closing, and Templeton realized he would have to hide before he was found. Having lost some of his girth with all the exercise he'd been getting lately, the fat rat found it a bit easier to move around, and he staggered forwards towards the back of the truck, hoping to hide behind some of the debris. He heard footsteps coming in his direction, and closed his eyes and hoped that whatever happened, it would be over soon.</span></div></div>",

He struggled to hold it back, but it came up, and he couldn't stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>HEEEYOOOOP!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belch he let out startled him. He wasn't sure where it came from. His tummy felt better, but the rest of him wasn't. The person leaned against the truck, making it tilt slightly, and he was surprised to find the cherubic face of a young girl peering down inquisitively at him. He was frozen with fear. She didn't look frightened, so she wasn't about to run away. She didn't look angry, so maybe she wasn't going to hurt him either. Still, he would rather not have to deal with a kid right now. He wanted to run, but he was cornered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...,\" she said quietly. \"I've never seen a rat as big as you before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton ignored the compliment as best as he could.

His stomach was flabby but smaller than when it had been stuffed. He felt hunger calling out to him, and he was determined to see to it he was fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl entered the room. She was in her pajamas, and she was holding a bowl of oatmeal that smelled like honey and sugar. \u201cI can\u2019t stand oatmeal! It\u2019s so bland! I hate it! Why won\u2019t mom give me cereal or ham or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton simply blinked in response, surprised by the outburst. Humans were certainly fickle creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl set the bowl down on her desk, and she proceeded to open the door on the cage, allowing the fat rat to crawl out. He stretched his muscles before heading in the direction of the bowl. He smelled it carefully. Just the smell alone was pleasant and warm. Shrugging to himself, he proceeded to eat and slurp away at it, practically inhaling the meal set before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl watched in fascination. \u201cWow\u2026,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou don\u2019t care about taste, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton smirked between gulps. It was all about being full. His stomach began to swell bigger as he finished it off, and soon, it was so big around that his hind legs didn\u2019t touch the ground. He let out a hefty belch, pleased at being fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl couldn\u2019t help but laugh as she took the bowl away. \u201cThis gets me out of breakfast,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m going out to play. I\u2019ll see you later, rat!\u201d And with that, she left the room and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton belched again, trying to relieve the gas he had built up. Pleased with himself, he staggered back onto his hind legs and staggered along with a loud slosh as he headed back to the cage. His stomach hung so low that it pushed against the bottom of the hatchway, and he ended up toppling over, landing in the shredded paper flat on his face. Pulling the door shut with his tail, he rolled over, pulled the paper over him and promptly fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he had woken up, the girl was back, now working at her desk, writing on a piece of homework. He rolled over onto his back and checked on his belly, which was still rather round, but it had shrunk down to the point he could walk normally again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the shredded paper crinkling, she looked up and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m doing homework now,\u201d she said. \u201cLunch will be later. I\u2019ll split my sandwich with you if like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton smiled beatifically. He was starting to like this kid. He leaned back and got comfy, falling once again into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he next awoke, he found there was half a cheese sandwich sitting out for him, and the cage door was open for him. He eagerly hefted himself out of the cage and onto the desk. He proceeded to messily devour the sandwich, gulping it down as much as he could. It didn\u2019t take long to finish, and he stood to his full height, taking a moment to appreciate how swollen his stomach was before waddling back to the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo think children used to annoy me,\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cThis could be the start of a beautiful friendship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rested in silence for two hours, letting his meal digest, and before long, the little girl came back inside. \u201cMom\u2019s making pot roast for dinner tonight,\u201d she informed him pleasantly. \u201cIf there\u2019s any left over, I\u2019ll be sure to bring it up for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton\u2019s mouth watered with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl noticed the empty plate. \u201cWow! You ate the whole thing already? You sure love to eat, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton merely patted his stomach in reply, causing the girl to giggle. \u201cHow much can you even eat?\u201d she asked. \u201cWait \u2013 I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She ran out of the room.<br>\r\nTempleton sat up, entertaining the idea that she was going to bring him more food. He felt certain he could fit in a little more. He struggled until he was all the way on his rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned a minute later with some fruit. \u201cHere,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cMom says she won\u2019t buy more candy and cookies until I eat more healthy food. If you ate it for me, she\u2019ll think I ate it, and she\u2019ll buy us more candy and cookies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton couldn\u2019t refute that logic, and he was grateful for whatever was set in front of him. This included an apple, a banana and some grapes that looked very succulent. Licking his chops, the rat eagerly moved forward. She opened the cage and let him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rat made short order of the grapes, ripping them off the stem, juggling them briefly before letting them all fall into his mouth and into his stomach, catapulting it out further. Then he raced around the apple, gnawing at it until it was all the way down to the core. Then, to finish off, he pushed the banana off the desk, letting it land on the floor, and then he jumped off the desk and landed on one end, causing the banana to erupt from the peel, flip through the air and landed straight down his throat, causing his stomach to instantly expand two twice its previous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stared at the overstuffed rat in amazement. \u201cWow!\u201d she cheered, jumping up and down and clapping excitedly. \u201cYou did all that so fast! I may never have to eat icky healthy food again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton merely belched in response, collapsing onto his back. His stomach proceeded to roll on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling at the silly display, the girl picked up the bloated rodent and carried him back to the cage. Too sleepy to care where he was, Templeton snuggled up in the corner of the cage and promptly fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, his belly had shrunk back down as it had digested his earlier meal, and when he awoke he heard footsteps coming upstairs. He looked towards the door and saw the girl walk in carrying a plate full of food, causing his heart to leap with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI managed to sneak away some of the leftovers,\u201d the girl whispered. \u201cWe\u2019ve got pot roast, mashed potatoes and green beans. Are you still hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton immediately threw himself against the cage in a hungered frenzy, nodding in the affirmative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing at the sight, the girl opened the cage once more. Templeton stumbled out and landed face first in the mashed potatoes, which he immediately began to gobble down with all his might. He finished them, and then he slurped down the green beans, and then he proceeded to munch on the pot roast. They were small pieces, but he was just grateful to have anything to shove down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026,\u201d the girl said, now in awe. \u201cYou\u2019ve got quite an appetite. I hope your little rat tummy doesn\u2019t explode.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton ignored her and finished off the roast. He let out a hefty belch before rolling on to his back and patting his stomach sleepily. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was only table scraps, but she found other ways to keep him full. She gave him the fruits and vegetables that her mother was hoping her daughter would eat, and Templeton would devour those as well. This led the mother to the belief that her daughter was finally eating a well-balanced diet, and thus, she began to buy snack foods again. The little girl certainly made use of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsequently, as the days rolled by, eventually turning into months, the little girl began to put on weight herself. As she was feeding Templeton all her healthy food, she was pretty much solely getting by on junk food \u2013 cake, ice cream, potato chips and soda pop. The calories went right to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis finally occurred to her one day when she attempted to button up her overalls and found that the buckles didn\u2019t quite reach anymore, as they were stretched all the way around her bulging tummy. Struggling, she finally managed to connect them, but they were on very tight, and they were clearly straining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m getting fat,\u201d she moaned to Templeton one morning. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton wasn\u2019t exactly up for being sympathetic. He\u2019d been eating regularly for months now, and he was enjoying every minute of it. He\u2019d grown wider himself, and his stomach was so big around his hind legs almost never touched the ground. However, he\u2019d managed to find a way of walking upright, which improved his overall speed immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl sighed sadly as she left the room, pondering what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She laid out two cartons of chocolate ice cream and two bags of chips, setting them out for the rat to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m getting too fat,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo I\u2019ll need you to eat some of this stuff for me. I need to lose weight before mom stops buying them altogether.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton stared at the goodies that lay before him. She opened the door to the cage and grinned. She opened the lid on one of the ice cream cartons, and after waddling some distance over to it, he climbed on top and proceeded to devour it, slurping and chomping at it, enjoying every calorific mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl watched with sadness, disappointed she couldn\u2019t have any. She decided it was too depressing for her to watch, so she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton ignored her and continued his binge. He ate and ate with all his might, devouring the entire pint of ice cream, and by the time he was finished, the carton was empty, and his belly was huge, not to mention chilly. He burped with satisfaction before turning towards the next one. He ripped open the top and began to gorge away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the little girl decided to come back, she found both cartons empty, and a very stuffed Templeton was munching lazily away on chips. She could only stare in stunned silence at how big he was. His stomach was roughly the size of a watermelon, and his tiny little body was apparently stuck on to the side of it, practically pinned underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way he would fit in the cage now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we going to put you now?\u201d she worried out loud. \u201cWe need to put you somewhere for the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton merely belched in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl pulled a shirt out of her dresser that she knew would be too small for her now. She made it into a small nest and slipped it into her closet. She then picked up the bloated rat and carried him and his bag of chips over to it, setting him down inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully, I\u2019ll lose weight after this, and you\u2019ll still have plenty to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton smirked. With the kid on a diet, he would be getting quite a bit more to eat. He stuffed another bunch of chips down his throat and snuggled up in the shirt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every time she felt something was too fattening for her, she would sneak it up to Templeton to make sure it got eaten instead of wasted, and Templeton was definitely not wasteful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, as he was taking a stroll around the room, trying to make sure his muscles didn\u2019t simply waste away into nothing, he heard a lot of commotion downstairs. It sounded like there were a lot of people down there, and he was disturbed by how noisy it was getting. There was laughter and singing and cheering going on, much to his irritation. Annoyed with the noise, he dove into the very back of the closet and took a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up hours later, and he crawled out into the open to find the little girl wearing an outfit he\u2019d never seen on her before. She noticed him in the mirror and turned to show it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, rat! All new clothes, and they fit! I had my birthday party today, and all my clothes are bigger now! My tummy has room now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton could only stare in despair. If her clothes fit, that meant she would stop dieting, and all the rich calorific food she\u2019d been giving him would be devoured by her. Still, he reasoned, it would only be temporary. If she kept eating, she\u2019d outgrow these clothes as well, and she\u2019d have to give him more food again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he was very hungry after having not eaten all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, there\u2019s loads of leftovers,\u201d she said brightly. \u201cLots of cake and ice cream you could have. Plus the remnants from dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton\u2019s ears perked up. The remnants of a birthday meal were right downstairs. Tonight would be a good night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He saw that the girl was sound asleep in her bed, snoring softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning eagerly, he snuck over to the door and saw that it was slightly open. Hefting himself over, he pushed against the door and staggered outside. He had put on a great deal of weight over the months he\u2019d lived here, and he was going to make sure he got plenty to eat before the girl started dieting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the biggest problem was getting down the stairs. He found it was a long way down. Sighing heavily to himself, he proceeded to crawl down as carefully as he could, letting his weight pull him down to the next one. It took a very long time. He staggered all the way down, trying not to hurt himself in the process.<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, he found himself at the bottom, and there was an open door into the kitchen. Grinning with anticipation, he proceeded to waddle inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst stop was the trash can. He looked up and could smell the putridness waiting inside for him. He climbed up the side of a hutch and pulled open the lid once it was next to him. He found the remnants of chicken, hamburgers, steamed vegetables and various half-eaten sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, how beautiful!\u201d he swooned. \u201cAnd it\u2019s mine! All mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a clumsy leap, he dove into the trashcan, shoveling all the rotting food into his mouth, experiencing a richness and flavor that fresh food had been missing. Humans were so wasteful. He would be making sure none of this went to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took hours for him to finish it all, but long last, the trashcan\u2019s contents were reduced to old napkins and plastic cutlery. It took him at least ten minutes to heft himself out of the can, and he flipped the lid shut with his tail as he slid down the hutch to the floor. With a stomach the size of orange \u2013 which was pretty big on a rat \u2013 he waddled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext stop was the ice box. He pulled it open with relative ease before climbing inside. He found the pitcher of punch, which was nearly empty. He managed to tip the pitcher over enough so that most of it could flow into his mouth. He chugged it until the last drop was inside his gut, which sloshed and churned loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with himself, and proceeded to gorge himself on devilled eggs and mixed vegetables, mostly carrots and celery sticks. He finished up and climbed down, now the size of cantaloupe. He struggled over down to the floor and pushed the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found the table, and he climbed up a chair to reach the top. He was rewarded for his hard work by finding the remaining slices of cake. Licking his lips at the sugary confection, he peeled back the plastic wrapping and opened it up, finding it to be just a tad stale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy favorite,\u201d he said with a smile. And he proceeded to gorge himself as much as he could.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sun was peeking up over the horizon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cake was gone, and a bloated rat with a stomach the size of a basketball lay on his back, breathing heavily. He couldn\u2019t move. The cake had done it. Even though there hadn\u2019t been much left over, it was still enough to keep him dangerously overstuffed. He was pretty much pinned to the table, and he had had no choice but to fall asleep where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the sunlight shining on him got into his eyes, and he woke up, blinking and squinting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe previous night returned to his memory, and with a hefty grunt, he struggled to get up. He didn\u2019t have much time to get up and go before the family woke up. He pushed and struggled, ignoring the pleasurable sounds of the contents of his stomach sloshing and gurgling. Realizing he had probably gone too far now, he hoisted himself up and made it to a sitting position. His stomach stretched out ahead and towered over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sick groan, Templeton proceeded to reverse his way towards the chair, dragging his monstrous gut across the table. He made it to the edge, and when he went to jump, he found his body dangling off the side of the table while his full stomach remained where it was too heavy to move. He flailed helplessly for a moment before he pushed against the edge of the table with his hind legs, pushing as hard as he could. After three good grunts, he managed to reverse all the way off, and he landed flat on his back, with his stomach nearly crushing and smothering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to get upright again, and he reversed his way off the table and onto the floor, once again pinned by his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sized up his stomach, realizing he had gone too far. There was no chance of him making it up the stairs now. He knew the humans would be coming any moment. What could he do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no real options, he struggled into a hiding place. He wedged himself under a hassock in the living room, and it was a tight fit. His gigantic stomach was crammed inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few minutes, he heard footsteps coming downstairs that were too heavy to be the girl. He heard a woman\u2019s voice in the kitchen, reacting with surprise that the remnants of the cake were gone, and the she noticed that the punch had been consumed as well. Moments later, another pair of footsteps came down, indicating the father had arrived as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton listened to the conversation in the next room as they went about their business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up again, it hadn\u2019t been very long. He listened carefully to the noise outside, and he could definitely hear footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his stomach gurgled, and he felt something moving inside. Realizing it was gas, he let out a huge belch before he could stifle it. Covering his mouth in horror, he realized that someone else was coming. He closed his eyes tightly in anticipation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days after the party incident, the little girl put her plan into action. She put together a large meal while her mother was out in the garden and tucked it all into a woven picnic basket. Taking a deep breath, she summoned all her courage and went to the closet to pull out the cage that held Templeton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, little guy!\" she said as fake-cheerfully as she could. \"We're going on a picnic outside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton lay on the floor of the cage, awkwardly peering up over his enormously flabby belly. Pushing the fat aside, he got a better look at her eyes, seeing the childish enthusiasm that irritated him so. At first, he wanted no part of it, especially as she wasn't hear to give him food. But then, he saw the picnic basket, and he could smell salami and turkey and mustard and mayo and potato chips and... all sorts of goodies! Immediately, he rolled over and put his face to the cage wall, hoping he looked somewhat endearing as he drooled eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd like that!\" the girl smiled. \"Come on! While mom and dad aren't looking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the cage's handle and snuck downstairs, trying to keep herself balanced as the fat rat's weight nearly sent her toppling to the side. She tiptoed down the stairs and hid behind the couch briefly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the backdoor open, she popped up just high enough so her mom could see her as she came back in, done with whatever gardening she'd been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going outside to play, Mom!\" she said, hurriedly walking to the backdoor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom barely glanced at her as she got herself a glass of water. \"Okay, sweetie. Get some exercise. But don't go too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped out the door and shut it with her foot. She scurried off into the woods behind the house going as far as she could until it was <i>just </i>out of sight. Satisfied, she set down the cage and laid out a red-and-white checkered blanket. Then, she opened up the cage, allowing the obese rat to waddle his way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton took in the surrounding area. So many trees surrounded. Not unlike the woods he'd been lost in months ago on the day he met her. Something resembling dread began to fill his mind, but then, the smell of sandwiches overwhelmed him, and he was back in picnic mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl pulled out a huge turkey sandwich, thick with cheese, mustard and mayo. \"Okay, here you go!\" she said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton licked his lips and dove right in, ripping it from her hands as he greedily devoured it. He didn't care what it was as long as it was more food for his stomach. It was roughly the same size as him, but that didn't stop his desire. Once he'd finished, he was sad it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, he could still smell it. And it wasn't just the crumbs in his fur. He looked up, and there she was, holding an identical sandwich. Blinking in confusion, he looked past her and saw, in the basket, were several sandwiches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to contain his glee, Templeton took the sandwich and proceeded to gulp it down in a similar fashion. He ate the whole thing in thirty seconds, and then he took the next one. Then, he took the next one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere turned out to be seven sandwiches overall, and it still wasn't enough. He practically swooned when she handed him a huge bag of potato chips. Licking his lips, he didn't even wait for her to open the bag. He simply bit through it was his sharp teeth and dove inside, crunching away for a solid ten minutes. The bag slowly began to split across the front as he grew larger from his feast. By the time he finished, the bag was completely split, and he was sitting with a dazed expression in the middle of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want anything else?\" she asked, still smiling that cheerful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton's eyes blinked out of sync before he nodded dumbly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe responded with a large bottle of soda pop. She twisted off the cap and held it out. He lazily opened his mouth and let her pour the entire contents into his stomach. It churned and gurgled from its new load as it swelled like a water balloon. He gently rubbed it as it swelled beneath him, doubling in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she gave him three more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know what he had done to deserve such a feast, but he didn't care. As long as the child was willing to supply him with treats, that's all that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the fourth bottle was emptied, he sloshed and bobbed up and down like a buoy on the waves, his stomach making delightful sloshing sounds. He was so incredibly stuffed, he was certain he couldn't eat another bite and settled in for a very long nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dessert?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton's eyes sprang open. Was she serious?? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe presented him with an entire chocolate pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rat's stomach gurgled in protest. He really shouldn't. He mustn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at it a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, what the hell?</i> he thought, and he grabbed the pie tin out of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling over so he was on top of his stomach instead of under it, he rolled himself over and plunged face first into the pie, slurping it up and devouring the fudge-filling and the delectable crust. He let out moans of ecstasy he hadn't known himself capable. Who knew such joy and decadent pleasure ever existed?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, after five long minutes, the entire pie was gone. Even the crumbs. He licked the entire pan clean, and then rolled himself back until he was on his large rear. He looked like he'd swallowed a fairly large pumpkin. His little front legs stuck out comically as his feast rendered him immobile. He had a stupid grin on his face, covered in chocolate that he attempted to lick off. His enormous belly groaned mournfully, but it was music to his ratly ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mmmmmm, it hurts so</i> good<i>!</i> he thought blissfully. <i>What a feast! Ohhhhhh, I can't move a muscle! This is everything I ever wanted! To be so gloriously STUFFED and BLOATED!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to approach him again, and he felt a mixture of joy and fear all at once.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>NO!</i> he practically whimpered. <i>No more! I can't resist! I'll surely die right here and now if I eat one more glorious smidgen of food! Unnnnngh, this is the most heavenly hell I've ever suffered! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she simply rolled him off the blanket and gently laid him against a tree so he could rest. She began to tenderly rub his engorged abdomen, humming cheerfully as she soothed his gorge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton's eyes rolled up in his head as he felt great pleasure. So soothing. Just what he needed. Just what he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you could do it,\" the little girl said quietly. \"I hope you're happy. Mom will want to know why all that food is missing...\" She paused, and her smile turned sad. \"But I think it'll be worth the punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton was only half-listening. He didn't care for her reasoning. He just wanted to enjoy being so enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued. \"I imagine you won't be able to move for a long time, not with this great big tummy of yours. I hope you're comfy, cuz you'll be here a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in her tone set off an alarm bell in his head, but it didn't last. He was too stupidly food drunk to focus on anything but being fat and happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get some sleep,\" she whispered. \"Sleep off all that food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, she said something smart. The fat rat let out a hiccup, a belch, and then he let his eyelids fall, and he went into a deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came to, it was dark. He was still where he was, still as fat as before. He slapped his belly as much as he could and found it to be still jam-packed, but it had clearly been long enough to get a decent chunk of the meal digested. Feeling some mobility returning in this hind legs, he got himself moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the events that led to this returned to his memory, and something occurred to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was gone. The basket, the blanket, the cage -- they were all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton began to realize -- the gravy train was well and truly over.</span></div></div>",

I'm not about to let that buffet go so easily!<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nIt took a few tries, but he was so furious at being abandoned that he rolled himself over until he was sitting on his considerable rump. He got his hind legs touching the ground and then lifted himself up. He teetered awkwardly from side to side like a ship at sea before his belly finally caused him to surge forward with its increased gravity. Unable to resist, he stumbled through the woods. It was a very long walk, but he was determined. He'd make his way back into that house. He'd eat them dry. Ruin their kitchen in the process. That would teach her to abandon him like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he ever got there, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult to find his way in the dark. He kept tripping over twigs, which required him to get up and regain his balance. The novelty of being so large was, ironically, wearing thin. Still, he reasoned, it would be worth it just to destroy that kitchen and eat everything up. That fantasy of stuffing his fat face with all their food, ripping open the fridge and eating the entire contents, raiding their pantry to mere crumbs, it was just the motivation he needed to waddle awkwardly the several hundred meters towards the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, it loomed into view. He licked his lips greedily. The lights weren't on, so they'd all gone to bed, clearly. Heaving and hauling, he made his way to the door. He was just about to go inside when he remembered something very important that was crucial to his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was too short to open the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Templeton thought to himself. There had to be a way up to that doorknob. His eyes scanned the yard. Was there anything he could make use of?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he spotted a tall metal trash can. Taking a chance, he waddled over and tapped against the side with his paw. The hollow metal clang told him it was empty. Although briefly disappointed he couldn't raid it for a snack, he pushed that thought aside as he thought about the fresh feast that awaited him inside. He crawled his way over and pushed against it. It was difficult to move, even empty, as it stuck against the rough concrete of the back porch. With a hefty grunt, he slammed his massive self into it. He could do it. Using his enormous body as a bulldozer, he slammed up against it and pushed. He was rewarded with the satisfying sound of the trash can scraping loudly against the concrete. Smiling eagerly to himself, he continued to push, not really caring just how much noise pushing this can was making. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, he arrived at the door. A cursory glance up showed him that it was just tall enough. The only problem was that it was far too smooth for him to climb up. Not a single foothold. Sighing with frustration, he looked around again. There had to be something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an old wooden step ladder lying on its side by the house. Taking a chance, he waddled over and gave it a push across the patio until he finally got it next to the trashcan. Working hard, he managed to set it up, pulling the legs apart and lining it up. It was just high enough that he could reach a metal handle on the trash can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was exhausted and out of breath, but for once, he didn't care. The feast that awaited him was worth all this wretched exercise. Grinning to himself, he heaved his fatness up the three steps of the step ladder, then used said ladder to prop the trash can as he hauled himself on top of the lid. Panting triumphantly, he found the doorknob finally within reach. Just needed to turn it, open the door, climb down and start eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne problem -- the knob wouldn't turn. It was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it was. It was probably nearly midnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton hissed with disbelief, which was quickly followed by a squeak of fury as he furiously took his frustrations out on the doorknob, jiggling it so hard that he jiggled just the same, making the trash can rattle loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, his anger was spent, and he took a moment to catch his breath, sitting pathetically on the trash can. There had to be another way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the light behind the door came on, and the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton barely had time to react before he came face-to-face with the girl's mother, who, after taking a moment to register what she was seeing, let out a terrified scream. The rat jumped but was too tired from his exertions to do much at the moment but back away to the edge of the can. The mom suddenly reared back and gave the trash can a solid kick, sending it flying backwards across the back porch, carrying the poor rat with it. It crashed on it's side on the far side of the yard, and he landed flat on his flabby back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd just barely gotten himself out from under his flab when he heard a man's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?! What's wrong?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a big fat woodchuck out there! It was trying to get in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton gulped and realized he had to make a break for it. Ignoring his protesting muscles, he ran across the backyard and into the woods behind the house, seemingly unencumbered by his extra weight. It was amazing what fear could really do for him in times of crisis. He darted into the woods and listened as the voices of anger and fear faded into the distance, hoping they wouldn't follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce certain that they weren't, he stumbled to a stop behind a big rock and tried to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, payback didn't seem all that worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure how long he sat there, but then, he heard a twig snap, and he turned around just in time to witness a familiar set of sharp teeth smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well...,\" the fox grinned. \"What have we here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton let out a small terrified squeak. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few foxes hung out in the woods the following morning, just lazing about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Jeff?\" asked one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't seen him since yesterday,\" said another, dozing contently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know what he's like,\" said the third. \"Always out looking for a meal. Boy only knows how to think with his stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, off in the distance, they heard a hefty hiccup rip through the woods. They all looked up in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a moment later, another fox appeared with a dazed yet content look on his face. He let out another hiccup. \"I'm back,\" he said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox finished rounding the corner, and to their astonishment, his stomach was so huge and full that it dragged on the ground, almost lifting his hind legs up. He practically had to drag himself into the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff?!\" one of the foxes cried, absolutely amazed. \"What happened to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff just grinned sloppily as his stomach sloshed beneath him. \"What a night!\" he roared orgasmically. \"Never have I seen such a creature! So well ripened, seasoned with the fat of excess and a lifetime of greed... Oh, he was <i>rich</i>, my friends! <i>Ri-i-i-i-i-ich</i>!\" He belched again, and then threw himself in a corner, his huge belly swaying like jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other foxes surrounded him, impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this gut! How is it even holding all that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff patted his belly and slumped drunkenly. \"My stomach can handle anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... what was it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A great big rat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! A rat filled you up that much?! It must've been huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enormous! Horribly obese! I probably put him out of his misery!\" Jeff crowed triumphantly. \"Little bugger gave me some trouble months ago, and I thought he was fat then! But nope! He somehow grew five times bigger!\" He paused to belch again. \"And oh man, let me tell you, revenge is sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other foxes shook their heads fondly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta hand it to you,\" they said. \"You finally found your feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox patted his belly again. \"I'll say I did. This <i>has </i>been a night!\" He got himself nice and comfy as he regaled them with the tail of the fat rat. \"First of all, let me tell you -- at first glance, I thought he was a woodchuck...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing as the knob was far too high for him to even reach, Templeton began making plans. There had to be another way in. He spotted a window not far from the door. Maybe he could make use of it. Looking around, he spotted a disused step-ladder. It wasn't easy to maneuver it in his bloated state, but he was so determined, he didn't care how much work it took. So what if he lost a few calories along the way? He'd make them up once he was inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few clumsy attempts, he finally got it set up correctly. He awkwardly made his way up the steps and towards the window. He saw it was already open a crack - no doubt due to the warm summer weather. Grinning eagerly, he forced it the rest of the way open. Once certain it was now high enough for him to fit through, he heaved himself up onto the windowsill and peered inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen was empty. No signs of life. He could hear heavy snoring coming from upstairs. Careful not to make too much noise, he climbed onto the end table beneath the window and gently lowered himself to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Excellent</i>, he thought to himself. <i>Now let's see... Time for the meal of the century!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving himself over to the fridge, he pulled it open and was immediately bathed in the bright light. After his eyes adjusted, his mouth fell open in amazement. It was jam-packed full of food and drink, and it was all for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, he climbed up and started eating everything he could find. Heads of lettuce, carrots, raw hotdogs, salami, turkey, hunks of cheese, anything he could get his greedy little paws on. He guzzled down a half-gallon of milk, a quart of orange juice and several shots of coffee creamer. He sucked down the ketchup, mustard, barbecue sauce and even the horseradish. He ate seven eggs raw, ate up some leftover green beans with cold pot roast, and then finished with a few pickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, by now, on top of his insane gorge earlier that day, Templeton was now twice as huge. He barely even fit in the fridge at this point, but he didn't care. He simply worked his way down until he couldn't hold on anymore and landed with a hefty thump on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Unnnnnnnnngh</i>, he thought, rubbing as much of his stomach as he could. <i>There's just so much more... I could leave now, probably... but I want more... and I have access to more... More, more more moremoremoremore... Ohhhh, I could burst. I could explode right here. But it'd be so glorious...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around and saw the pantry beckoning to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Curse my gluttony</i>, he thought gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so enormous at this point that it took nearly fifteen minutes to heave himself to the pantry, but he did it. He didn't even care that he hadn't closed the fridge door behind him. His greed narrowed his focus to simply finding more things to eat. He found crackers, peanut butter, cookies, pretzels -- entire bags of them -- and he ate them. His stomach wailed in protest, but he was so blinded by rage and gluttony that his mind forced him not to notice. He'd show that little girl. Nobody abandons him and gets away with it. He would eat every last morsel in this house. And when they went out to buy more, he'd eat that, too. He'd do nothing but fatten himself up until he died. That was a good death. Death by gluttony. He'd never accept going any other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while, as he fantasized of his endless feasts, his stomach grew and grew. Bigger and rounder and larger and fatter. The more he loaded into it, the more it filled the small room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, after another hour of gorging, the pantry was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton finally felt himself go calm. His stomach stretched so far in front of him that he couldn't see. His vision blurred from exhaustion as all his efforts finally began to catch up with him. His breath was slow and heavy -- so much work just taking in oxygen. He swore he could hear his stomach creaking like an overfilled balloon, ready to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Phew!</i> he gasped. <i>I was beginning to think I'd never get full...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he heard footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped out of his drunken stupor and realized someone was coming. No, it was too soon. He hadn't had a chance to escape yet! He tried to heave himself towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he realized he was now too big to fit through the exit. In fact, he was so dangerously full that his stomach could touch not only the doorway, bulging through it slightly, but also two of the other walls. He'd stuffed himself so utterly huge that the couldn't possibly escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a gasp and a shout. He wondered who it was. But then, he sadly reckoned, it really didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shadow fell over him, and the shocked eyes locked with his, he thought one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Curse my gluttony.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite his fury at being abandoned, Templeton knew he was in no fit state to go back to the house. He was far too bloated to get there. The best thing he could do right now was get himself somewhere safe. He was so gloriously fat, there was no way a predator would be able to resist trying to catch him. He needed to find somewhere safe. Heaving himself away from the tree, he began to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he was now so large that there was no way he could fit in the normal places he would hide. Plus, he'd just spent the last few months living in someone's house. His survival skills were a tad rusty. He knew getting himself completely hidden from view was important. Something with a roof and walls. Maybe some rocks somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, he couldn't find anything at the moment. This was made all the more difficult by the fact that it was dark. Maybe he should've headed back towards the town. Could've hidden in a trash can or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, somewhere in the dark, he heard a twig snap. His head snapped in the direction of the sound, and his eyes scoured the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing heavily, he resumed his awkward waddle through the woods. Not much moonlight through the trees - maybe he'd be all right. He kept his ears open for anymore sounds, but none came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't mean it couldn't feel someone's eyes on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back over his mound of a shoulder, he realized he'd covered some considerable ground. He wasn't even sure which was the town was. He thought he'd been walking in a straight line, but that didn't seem too likely now. He'd had to move himself around quite a few trees. Maybe he should turn around anyway. Unless that just gave away to his predator that he was lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he heard movement behind him. Swallowing down his nerves, he waddled slowly forwards, hoping maybe his assailant hadn't noticed his fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he heard a scurrying sound ahead of him. He froze in place, not sure what to make of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scurrying circled him, and then was joined by more scurrying. So there was more than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton whimpered as his eyes darted around. Maybe there was an escape somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, they were closing in on him. He was all set to try digging a tunnel in the ground when he heard a reedy voice somewhere behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHARGE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard several scurrying footsteps rustle through the leaves and grass, and his enemies swarmed him, tackling him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton screamed in terror as he went tumbling to the ground and was rolled over. He waited for the end, hoping he wouldn't go out crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the end never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly opened his eyes, and when they adjusted, he found himself looking into the stunned eyes of a female rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" she said. \"Whaddya know?\" She looked back at the several other rats that surrounded him. \"Ted, you were right! It <i>is </i>a rat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton blinked fearfully. \"... What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled mischievously. \"Sorry. Most of us thought you were a young woodchuck. Who are you?\"</span></div></div>",

She smiled amiably at him, but there was something in her eyes that told him to be wary. After a brief consideration, he finally decided to take a chance. \"Name's Templeton,\" he said, and he left it at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Templeton,\" the female rat said. \"I'm Tierney, and this is my mischief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mischief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! A group of rats is called a 'mischief'. Not to mention we're a bunch of mischievous scallywags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton looked among the rats that surrounded him. There must've been at least thirty of him, all looking at him with various expressions. Some looked curious, some looked cheerful, and others looked suspicious. It all felt a bit off-putting. He hadn't had to deal with other rats in years. All those years living on the farm had kept him away from socializing. Antagonizing the barnyard animals always seemed more than enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So!\" Tierney said cheerfully. \"What brings you out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton swallowed before speaking. \"Just... looking for some shelter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTierney chuckled. \"Well, ya got yer work cut out for ya!\" she said, playfully slapping the obese rat's belly. The resulting ripples tossed her around briefly as if she were a ship at sea. \"Whoooo!\" she exclaimed as she got her sea legs. \"You got yerself quite a cargo in here, boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother rat - a male one - came sniffing up to him suspiciously. \"Just how did a rat get to be as big as you?\" he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton shrank back from the rat. In his current state, there was no chance of him defending himself should a fight break out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTierney swatted the other rat away. \"Barnaby, back off,\" she scolded. \"You want answers from this big guy, ya gotta play nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarnaby hissed before retreating back into the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But as he was saying,\" she continued, sliding down Templeton's stomach to get level with him. \"You got yerself some impressive heft there. Must've been feastin' for quite some time to get this big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton couldn't help but feel flattered that his fat was being admired. \"What, this?\" he asked, smugly patting as much of his stomach as he could reach. \"This is just the end result of a day long gorge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, Tierney looked a little surprised. \"You... you got this big in a day?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly less,\" he replied. \"Had the most satisfying picnic just earlier. Lost track of time, but it couldn't have been more than a couple hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the rats began to chatter, some with interest and some with suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarnaby spoke up again. \"And just how did you come by this great feast?\" he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I enjoyed a great meal ticket for the last few months. A little girl in one of the houses over there kept me as a pet for a while. Sadly, she was... ill-equipped for sustaining my great appetite. I make it a point to eat my fill and then some,\" he smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarnaby scoffed. \"Bah! I don't believe a word of it. What self-respecting rat would allow himself to be kept as a pet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton sneered in his direction. \"A self-respecting rat who enjoys a hearty gorge whenever he can,\" he replied. His expression turned sad. \"Of course, now she's abandoned me. Stuffed me to the gills, and left me for dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTierney tutted and patted his belly. \"Such a shame,\" she sympathized. \"Looks like you're stuck out here, then -- in more ways than one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton looked at her. \"I don't suppose you could help me out?\" he asked innocently. \"Given my current situation, I could do with some assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTierney smiled slyly. \"I suppose we could assist you,\" she replied. \"What do you require?\"</span></div></div>",

Too many predators, and I'm, as you can see, in no fit state to run and hide on my own. Know of anywhere that could give me some cover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTierney grinned, taking a moment to admire his girth. \"I think we know a place that could cover you,\" she replied easily. \"But we'll need to move fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says we're moving?\" demanded Barnaby. \"What's to gain from saving this overstuffed creature?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe murmuring amongst the rats told Templeton he would need to do better than simply start issuing commands. He cleared his throat and waved his paws for silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get me some shelter for the foreseeable future,\" he said, \"and I'll show you a place where you can eat to your heart's content.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got their attention. The murmuring turned from irate to curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTierney looked at him intently. \"No fooling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None whatsoever,\" Templeton grinned. \"Just get me someplace secure and we'll start plans tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned in return. \"Y'know, I'm starting to think we did the right thing not eating you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile faltered. \"Er... thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTierney whistled to the others. \"Okay, troops!\" she called out. \"Let's get a shift on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swarm of rats all got on his left side. He felt their tiny little paws push against his flab. His belly gurgled as they began to push him, rolling him along like a giant bowling ball. Templeton went 'round and 'round, feeling his contents shifting within him, making all kinds of gurgling noises as he gently bounced over twigs and rocks. Definitely not his preferred way of travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing all right there, big fella?\" Tierney asked from somewhere near his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing -- oof! -- just -- ugh! -- fine!\" he grunted over every bump. \"Oof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were too many course corrections to count, and the fat rat felt each and every one of them. He did his best not to complain, knowing he needed to stay in their good graces, but his earlier gorge kept swirling around inside of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it much further?\" Templeton grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost!\" said Tierney. \"Just gotta... oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What 'oh'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remembered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Templeton felt his momentum increasing. He briefly thought that maybe they were speeding up because they were under attack. Then, he felt the pressure of their sharp little paws slacken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's at the bottom of a hill!\" Tierney's increasingly distant voice shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton found himself going faster and faster, bouncing off sticks and pebbles, spinning around until he bowled forwards. He bounced off a bigger rock and went flying through the air. He came face-to-face with the opening to a large hole in the ground. With a yelp, he gently bounced off the ground, and then went sailing neatly into the hole, like a cork into a bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he came to an abrupt stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton closed his eyes for a moment, trying settle himself after rolling around too fast. Once the dizziness faded, he opened his eyes again and blinked to adjust to the darkness inside. It looked like, despite the smallish opening, to be some kind of underground cave. He could see a few smaller caverns with a big open space in the middle. It definitely looked ideal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could just force himself the rest of the way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he heard several scurrying footsteps behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good! You found it!\" said Tierney triumphantly. \"Okay, everyone! One good push! Heave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton suddenly felt a lot of pressure behind him, and after a few painful seconds, he popped through the entrance and rolled into the middle of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the rats scurried around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go!\" Tierney said cheerfully. \"Safe and sound from all sides!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said another rat, pushing her aside. \"Now what was that about food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other rats all tittered eagerly, all asking about food frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton chuckled, despite his awkward angle. He forced himself into a sitting position, his stomach sticking for out in front of him. \"Okay, settle down,\" he said calmly. \"It's at the same place I got this gut from. You probably know about the houses on the edge of the woods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarnaby snorted. \"Filthy humans moving in,\" he grumbled. \"What would we want with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their food, for one thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think we haven't tried?! Do you know how many rats who've never come back from their foolhardy quests?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, well, they probably didn't live inside one of those houses as a pet for months on end, did they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you know how the house works?\" Tierney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure, know it backwards and forwards. I know when they leave for work, when the kid goes to school, when they go to the store... How to get in and out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other rats all tittered at that. Clearly, he had some takers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're willing to show us how to get in?\" Barnaby asked doubtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton smirked. \"Mayyyyyyyybe,\" he said slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTierney began to smile as well. \"Guess you need some time to think it over,\" she decided. She addressed the rest of the mischief. \"Okay, boys and girls. I'll stand guard over His Nibbles, here. Barnaby, take charge of the hunt. With any luck, we'll be hunting quite a bit less after tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarnaby glared. \"You're giving them hope,\" he growled quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right,\" she replied evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other rat still wasn't happy, but he still turned and led the other rats out of their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Templeton and Tierney were alone together.</span></div></div>",

That mischievous glint in her eye meant something. Would she be a friend or a foe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sidled up to him. \"Gosh, you're big,\" she murmured. \"Hate to think how we're ever going to keep you full. Be a shame if you had to go a bit hungry for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton eyed her suspiciously. \"Is that so? I wouldn't advise that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What're you gonna do? Roll on top of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton attempted to roll towards her, but he was still too full, not to mention sleepy. \"Not worth the effort,\" he said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked. \"That's it,\" she chuckled, patting his belly. \"No need to burn too many calories. Now then!\" She clambered up on top of his gut and laid down to look him in the eye. \"Gonna tell me what this plan of yours is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton blinked, startled by her proximity and her directness. \"Er...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>do </i>have a plan, don't you?\" she smiled cheekily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he? Templeton didn't feel sure. His mind raced -- how was he going to get all these rats fed? Somehow, all of them raiding that one house felt extremely stupid. Sure, it would get rid of some of them, but the remaining rats might take issue with that. Then, of course, he remembered all the other houses that stood on that block. Maybe he could swing that somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to smile. \"Of <i>course</i>, I have a plan,\" he told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTierney smiled back, putting her head down on her paws and listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton cleared his throat. \"Now then... how many rats are in your little group?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty, altogether.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm... and how many houses around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a few. Maybe... fifteen? Sixteen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton nodded, the plan taking shape. \"I think... rather than just take down that one house, we should work on taking down the whole block.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, ambitious!\" she said, growing excited. \"How do we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thirty rats divided into teams across fifteen or sixteen houses... I daresay we can figure something out. Groups of two or three, depending on how far we want to spread out. But I think we could definitely manage it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manage what, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free food. Loads of it, in those houses. In our pairs or groups or whatever, we work together and steal 'em blind. If we play this well, we'll eat like kings for the rest of our ratly lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTierney took a moment to wipe some drool from her mouth. \"Go on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each team takes a house, and for the first week or so, they simply study it. They can live on scraps in their trash in the meantime, but they need to observe the usual goings-on within their assigned house. When they go to work, when they go to bed, when they eat, what they eat, etc. Once we know their schedules and habits, those teams then move into the house and set up a sort of residency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Residency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hiding place from natural predators, but inside the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they'll know the habits and schedules, they'll be able to sneak about and get food whenever they want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTierney nodded thoughtfully. \"Very clever,\" she said, patting his belly. \"Not bad, big guy. You might be invaluable to us yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton grinned. He kinda liked her patting his stomach. \"Let's hope so. Your older friend didn't seem too keen on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTierney snorted. \"Barnaby's been trying to take charge since my dad died, but my pop raised me well. He'll do as I say. Especially considering the rest of the mischief will want in on the plan once they hear about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Then when they return from their little hunt, we can give them the details. When are they due back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not for a while, I should imagine,\" she smiled, getting herself comfortable atop Templeton's belly, giving it another rub. \"Hope you're sitting comfortably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton's eyebrows rose, and then he gave her a sleazy smile.</span></div></div>",

But what he loved the most was the amount of food he was given. Even if it was healthy fruits and veggies, it would still plump him up. And as the weeks rolled by, his frame fattened up even more. The girl's mother began to feel suspicious about her weight, so she doubled the healthy foods and tried to limit her fatty snacks. But she didn't catch on that the healthy food would go to Templeton, which wasn't an issue with him. Every apple, every carrot, every grape, every beet, every fruit and vegetable would be devoured by him and his figure would still bloat like a balloon. And the young girl would still get her snacks; cupcakes, licorice, cookies, chocolates, soda, sour tarts, etc. She snacked on and on as the weeks went by. At times, the sugar rushes she had would make her seem more active. But in the end, it would be inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following month, the little girl found that the straps of her overalls would barely reach her shoulders, which didn't seem to matter since her wider frame and growing belly made it impossible to fit. When she looked at herself in the mirror, she noticed what the endless snacking had led to; Her belly was bigger than before, round and noticeably large. Her legs were thickening up, nearly rubbing together. Her arms were just as thick and would wobble as she moved them. Her face was plumping up, as her cheeks were round and big while her neck was forming a double chin. She was huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at a nearby picture of her at the carnival last year. She was definitely skinny then. But she looked at herself and noticed immediately how fat she has become. Part of her wanted to cry, as tears were forming in her eyes. But the other part of her was still enjoying this new lifestyle of snacking, even if it added more to her weight. She rubbed her bloated belly, then looked at the cage where Templeton was napping in. He was obviously larger and was in pure bliss of his gluttony. She wondered why he enjoyed eating so much and why he had no problems with his weight. She looked at her belly, then back at his, still pondering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to Templeton's cage and looked at him with curiosity. \"Are you actually enjoying yourself,\" she asked. All Templeton could do was smile at her, grinning as wide as he could lazily. She looked at herself in the mirror again and patted her belly, watching it jiggle.

The one to the left seemed to have been eating what looked like a small mouse. Templeton kept to the shadows, not wanting to be seen or heard by the two ravenous birds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d he sighed, \u201cjust what I need when I want a bite to eat.\u201d His rather thin stomach growled with anticipation. He then punched it. \u201cI know your hungry, just shut up and let me think.\u201d He kept his dark eyes looking at the birds, waiting to see if they would take off and fly away just as he wanted them to. There didn\u2019t seem to be a point in going back to the farm for food, since there were no pigs to provide any like in the past. But these birds wouldn\u2019t leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the rat crept through pipes and used trash cans to circle around them in his quest for food. Sniffing the air he couldn\u2019t find much of anything because of the carcass of the dead mouse staining the other perfumes of vittles with its own rotten blood dry stench. He found a crumb here and a crust there, and other little morsels, but none being enough to help him reach a state of fullness. Being the gluttonous rat he was Templeton would rather eat to the point of bursting than to the point of contentment, no matter how much his stomach complained. But he found nothing, it was a disappointing time at the junkyard. So his stomach complained some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame me for these scraps! It\u2019s not like there\u2019s some magical place where there\u2019s a never ending supply of food! This is the best we got!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Templeton\u2019s dismay his outburst had alerted the birds, who now flew over head and glided toward him. \u201cAww great, see what you made me do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first crow swooped down but missed as Templeton quickly ducked and made a run for it. Ducking and weaving through garbage and keeping an eye out for the crows. His rat heart raced at the thought of being someone else\u2019s lunch, he wouldn\u2019t have it. After much running he managed to jump right into a broken down cars muffler. The birds flew down and began searching for him under the car, one even flew back up into the sky to catch a glimpse of him. But to no avail. They gave up their search for the rat and took to the skies. Abandoning their hopes at looking for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he heard their wings flutter away, Templeton came out of his hiding place and gave a sigh of relief. \u201cWhoo, gave them the slip. Sure was in a bit of a pickle there.\u201d At the sound of food his stomach acted up again. This time retorting with small bits of hunger pain. Templeton softly clenched his stomach and was about to hit it. Until a garbage truck came from it\u2019s pickup routine. It emptied its contents like a waterfall to form a new pile of trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton patted his thin stomach approvingly. \u201cThis just might be it.\u201d He said as he ran over to the newly formed pile. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Within it were two half eaten cheeseburgers, some fries and plenty of ketchup bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally! Something good!\u201d The loud grumbling of his stomach even surprised him, \u201cyour right, less talk, more eat.\u201d Templeton wanted to save the best for last, since he believed he wouldn\u2019t find another meal like this in a junkyard. He started with the fries first, and then the burgers. He didn\u2019t even bother pouring some ketchup on any of them, he just quickly tore them open and drained the contents rapidly, then went to work on the fries. Each on he swallowed whole to reach a certain level of fullness which he liked. Then came the twin delicacies. Each bite of the twin burgers warmly massaged his insides with each drooling scrumptious bite. The crunching of pickles and onions sent vibrations to his belly which had grown slightly in size. The burgers where bigger than he thought. Obviously whoever ordered them must have had a small appetite since they were far from finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shame, thought Templeton, that humans would make such delicacies go to waste. As he finished the last of the meat patty he licked whatever grease was left from his paws and placed them on his belly. It had grown rather plump from the big meal, and his stomach was satisfied. Because of ingesting his meals in in the largest portions without much chewing it allowed him to become full faster. It was a shame for Templeton, that he had to force himself to become full. As he breathed his plump belly went in and out like a door opening and closing. He patted it softly and ran his paws across his round frame which pleasured his portly shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be grand if I could always eat like this? Not just stop once I\u2019m content but until I\u2019m full, and even go beyond that. Wouldn\u2019t that be swell?\u201d He asked his belly softly. It gurgled with a pinch of pain that made Templeton wince a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slapped his stomach rather hard, \u201cC\u2019mon, even you can\u2019t say no to that after all the fuss from earlier. Think about it, a place where there\u2019s glorious food by the pawfuls. A place where a rat can truly be a rat. Despite the fact that you\u2019ll hurt. I told you this before, you can handle anything. Moldy cheese, spoiled milk, rotten eggs. You where made to handle anything. And once I take you to this place your gunna thank me. I just need to find it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach gave a silent gurgle in agreement. \u201cNow that\u2019s better. So, I\u2019ll just leave this up to you. Should we go home or look for something else?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seemed the time had finally come for him, as the fair had been promised to hold seemingly endless amounts of food to eat.  And it was through this persuasion that led him to the place he was now; in the miserarble crate of that obnoxious pig, Wilbur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton looked out the bars of the crate, to see that his patients had finally paid off.

Templeton, being the mostly selfish rat he was, was getting all to tired of being bossed around.  When asked this one last time for a word, he had early promised to make it happen.  And perhaps it would.  As Templeton set out on his journey, he thought about it for a little while, and realized he could simply set out here and never return.  The only cost of which would be the burden of remembrence that he had broken his oath.  He snickered at this thought, and looked out at the food filled landscape before him.  His mouth watered, and he decided what to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being meters away from the gorging of a lifetime, the temptation was too much for Templeton to handle. Hiding and spying might have been one of his hobbies back on the farm, but eating was his true passion of passions. He warned her didn\u2019t he, he wouldn\u2019t spend all his time running errands. Never had he received a single thank you for his favors, never a congratulatory pat, nothing. The ingrates would be getting what they deserved. His stomach gave a loud rumble, as if urging him to stop standing around and get to the task at paw already. Giving one last devilish grin back at the pen, Templeton locked away his guilt (if temporary), and set off for what was to be the pinnacle of his ratty life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton waited for awhile so that the crowds would disappear. After the fair grounds were empty of danger and distraction, Templeton set off to work. His thrill began at the hotdog stands. Easily climbing the carts he spotted a treasure trove of hotdogs and buns; along with ketchup, mustard, onions and tomatoes. Quickly, he shoved everything within the cart, and jumped in; eating everything by the pawfuls. Over 10 bags of hotdogs and buns were devoured in minutes, and out came a bloated rat with a look of satisfaction on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his whiskers for drips of grim, he waddled off to more stands. Cotton candy, funnel cakes, ice cream, lemonade, soda, mounds of food were shoved into his ever expanding stomach. The more he ate, the more difficult it began to climb onto the stands for the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the strenuous task of climbing tiring him out, Templeton waddled toward the leg of a table and rest his now larger back against it. Allowing his legs to drop down, they were nearly lost under his bloated bellies visage. Groaning and bubbling, the rat patted his glorious swell contently, causing it to slosh and gurgle in his wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, this is the life,\u201d the rat sighed, squeezing the soft flesh and fur, \u201cno more orders, no more worries, why didn\u2019t I come here sooner.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing an unfinished pretzel near him, he pulled it closer with his tail and rested it on his plump belly with a slosh. Casually taking his time in savoring it, looking around to see what his next course of action would be. Although this was the most he had ever eaten in his life, his belly could\u2019ve been satisfied a lot more. It would become a personal goal that he\u2019d consume as much as he could without stop. Suddenly it hit him. THE TABLE! He was under what could be a dinner for a family of ten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to climb up the leg and onto the counter, Templeton drooled in amazement. Burgers, fries, cake, more ice cream and hotdogs, and a stack of chicken sandwiches, all seemingly untouched by human hands. Giving his belly a hard slap, which sloshed furiously in excitement, he ran as quick as his bloated body could take him to the feast before him. Chunks of meat and bread were ripped off each burger, bouncing the rats belly with every mouthful. While on the last burger, Templeton stuffed as much fries down his throat as he could; even resorting to shoving his paws down his throat just to get the food down. He winced as he swallowed, then exhaled as the pain passed. When the burgers and fries were finished he worked on the ice cream and hotdogs. His belly gurgled ominously toward the task before him, but with a few reassuring words and patting, he continued. Quickly, Templeton slid hotdog after hotdog down his throat, not even bothering to chew. The more he did this, the more his continuously growing belly started to groan and glop at the continuous amount of food being fed. His pudgy waist began growing larger than his legs, which made it hard to stand upright. Grabbing the bucket of ice cream, he stuck his head within it; sucking up the melted contents like a vacuum. Sticky strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate made his fur messy as he pigged out. When the contents where done, he attempted to stand upright. His now enormous, cavernous belly of indigested gorge, wobbled around like jello. His round behind, unable to contend with his over gorged mass, caused him to run forward in an attempt to gain balance. Thankfully, while giggling due to his clumsy size, his mouth was wide open to receive a large mound of cake. Closing his mouth and swallowing, he continued glutting down the cool frosting and strawberry filling. Quickly, the cake was done, leaving Templeton to lay on his enormous body. Letting out a hiccup, the rat felt woozy and felt at his stomach. Now the size of a bowling ball, he giggled further at how little he was able to touch. But within the soft mass he was able to feel all the hotdogs and solid objects he had glutted. But it wasn\u2019t over yet. There was still the chicken sandwiches. Bloated beyond comprehension, he spotted the plate not too far from him. Licking his lips, he did the arduous task of crawling forward; his ever groaning belly, sloshing along the way. Letting out a long breath, the long travel was finally over. Giving his belly a few more inspirational pats, the undulating fat gave him the go ahead. And so, as fast as his paws would allow him, he ate and ate and ate. Growing evermore fatter. With a few more sandwiches to go, he pondered if eating lying on his back would be easier than eating lying on his belly. Not thinking it made any difference, Templeton rolled on his back. His belly burbling and sloshing loudly, until he did a complete 180. Due to his titanic size, his stomach sloshed on top of him like a loved one wanting to cuddle. Smiling at his large bellies yearn for attention, he pushed it away ever slowly, and continued, until he was finished within half an hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton, a monstrous gray orb, laid on the plate, too engorged to move. What had been a gorging of a lifetime now caused him a slight amount of grief, if not pleasure. Letting out a anguished moan, he placed his small paws on the blubbery ball of adipose tissue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHic\u2026HILP!! Never have I dreamed of\u2026hic\u2026HILP!! Getting so full. The goose was right\u2026hic\u2026HILP!! But my stomach feels like its gunna explode.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt something shake at the pit of his belly. His fat jiggled about as all the nights contents began bubbling and churning. Templeton gave a few soothing pats and rubs; hopping it would stop the churning. But it didn\u2019t, it just grew louder. Finally, whatever had been churning went up to his chest, then to his throat. From fear of regurgitating, he held his mouth. But the force was too much. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n*BURP* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expel of gas immediately calmed him down. But not only that, it freed up space in his stomach, and with space left, there must be food to fill it. Or, now that he had enjoyed himself, perhaps he could return to Wilbur and Charlotte with a word. Of course, much time had already passed, and Charlotte wouldn\u2019t be too happy with him taking so long; let alone his feeding taking priority over the pigs life. Decisions decisions. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having splurged himself as he pleased, Templeton decided to complete his original task. Not that he cared about the spider and pig now that he had a seemingly endless utopia of food to feast on, he would miss his rattie home back on the farm; and who could forget those humble slops, which nourished him for a long time. It would also give him a chance to show off his glorious transformation. That he, Templeton, had returned twice, nay, thrice the rat he left as. Everyone will be in awe over his blubbery visage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his massive swell happily, he attempted to stand up. But with each attempt, his burbling, over gorged corpulence would quickly push him back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon now,\u201d he huffed, \u201cwork with me. There\u2019s still much more out there to glut.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAs if understanding him, all his nights gluttony sloshed and rolled Templeton forward. Then, on the brink of tipping over, his body became balanced, his tiny footpaws still miraculously touching the floor, and allowing him to move. Jiggling his blubbery frame with delight, he resumed with his quest for food, and a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the fair grounds, delicious treats were in plentiful supply. While looking for the word, Templeton had consumed two donuts, a bag of chips, a slice of cheese, a box of curly fries, and half a cup of soda; growing all the more fatter, and loving every new inch. It was becoming apparent that he was doing more eating than word searching, and pondered on how to improve his searching efforts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting against a trash can, he rested a paw on the soft, furry tub of lard that was his belly, and scratched his chin. Having continuously gorge himself without stop, his belly growled and sloshed louder than his thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, what would be a good place to look for a word?\u201d While he said this, his brain asked something different.<i> What was a good place to look for more food?</i> Hah, thinking, a pointless waste of time. His all consuming stomach would do all the thinking for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where do you think I should go,\u201d he asked his globe like belly, giggling as he sloshed around his feast with every playful slap. It was more food then he could think of, all rolling around in a massive cavern of blubber and digestive liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe groaning gray balloon spoke in a language Templeton could actually understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the vegetable judging stand it is.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nHis belly, growling in excitement, sloshed loudly as he pulled himself forward, and as he dragged his bulk across the fairgrounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the fruit and vegetable judging section wasn\u2019t too far off, so the task of moving didn\u2019t deplete much of the rats precious calories. What did however, was climbing the stand. Determined and with enough motivation to fill his stomach 10 times over, he managed to hoist himself up, thanks to his claws and the long table cloth hanging down to him. It was miraculously enough to sustain his weight-without him pulling it off. There truly must\u2019ve been something up there heavier than him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there certainly was. There in front of his eyes was the largest squash, pumpkin, and potatoes Templeton had ever seen; truly deserving of first prize. Plus, there were boxes with writing conveniently placed within paw reach. Using both paws to shake his abundant amount of belly, he thanked his body for helping him find the way, and got straight to repaying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began with the potatoes, each one about the size of his bloated belly when he first began the night\u2019s feast after abandoning Charlotte and Wilbur. Grabbing the first one in the basket, he took a massive chomp. As the juicy succulent chunks of the spud slithered down his throat one by one, he squinted his eyes; oblivious to the fact that each massive swallow was a little more than his throat could handle. But he muscled his way through the pain, the satisfying sound of every chunk glopping and bouncing in the pit of his titanic belly. When he couldn\u2019t reach for another potato, he climbed into the basket, then truly let himself go. His waist and abdomen growing with every slurp, every content swallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finished, he climbed out, a gray obese ball of fur and fat, with a sloppy grin slapped on his face. As his grotesquely large belly lightly grazed the table top, his large body erupted in a symphony of sloshing and squelches. Hiccupping loudly from his victory, he continued his gorging. His plump arm muscles straining to drag his massive girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he moved up to the squash, he took a large bite. It was soft, squishy, and filling, just like his belly. Suddenly, he stuffed his head within the hole he made, and attempted to eat it from the inside out. All ready at the brink of fullness, he was shocked at how much his monumentally enormous gut could hold. While mouthful after glorious mouthful was shoved down his throat, he thought about all he\u2019d eaten. It must\u2019ve been enough to feed a family for a week, maybe longer. He was truly proud of his gluttonous achievement; this was what he lived for. Being an enormously fat greedy rat couldn\u2019t of been better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter unbelievably feasting the inside of the giant squash, he finished off the outside in a similar fashion. Licking the flavor from his lips, and holding in a massive hiccup, he swallowed the last of the remaining fruit, and looked to his belly. Slowly, the largest most pleasurable grin he ever had formed across his face. It was so much, and felt like too much for him to handle. So tight, round, and incredibly big. His stomach now seemed to make up 91% of his body; his arms, legs, tail and head making up 1.5% each. His arms, large and flabby, unable to feel any bone when he squeezed them. His legs, lost under his incredible burbling gut. His head, physically merging with the other 91% of his body. His tail, forgotten and probably would never be seen again. And then, his vociferously groaning belly, the epitome of over eating. The tank of lard swayed to and fro hypnotically, sloshing with the slightest movement; all of it pure glorious fat. Lifting up his arms, Templeton allowed them to slap the squishy part of his body that used to be his chest, which was now part of his gigantic stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSending a jiggling wave throughout his body, the rat\u2019s entire stomach began to collapse like an avalanche. With too much fat for his small paws to push back, the weight of his belly crushed him for a moment, then toppled him backwards; continuing to happen again, and again, and again. Until his fat back pressed against something, sending all the fat in front of him to smother against his muzzle. Making him smile from feeling all the warm fluffy adipose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraining his head to look behind him, he found it was the pumpkin that stopped him. Then, looking back to his blob like groaning swell, he shook it with his paws, which slowly sent undulating waves pleasurably coursing throughout his plump body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou planned this out didn\u2019t you,\u201d he asked his gut, which loudly  gurgled in response. \u201cThis is the hic\u2026HILP!!! Final thing for tonight. I hic\u2026HILP!!! Want to show off to the pig and the hic\u2026HILP!!! Spider.\u201d Understanding, his stomach caused him to erupt in a gaseous belch. Then, he took the first bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pumpkin being as big as it was, took a lot of eating. So much eating not even Templeton was up to finishing it off. But it was fine, he got the word he was looking for from one of the boxes which read, \u201ccome to humble hanks! We\u2019ve got the largest crops around.\u201d Humble, a good word, one the spider would probably like. But, that\u2019s if he could get back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been much more eating than he thought, the gargantuan rat was only able to finish off half of it. Still, he relaxed with his back against it, allowing his glorious achievement to flow like jello. He spent about 10 minutes, stroking and squeezing his large mound of fat. It was no question now that he would literally burst if he would take one more bite. The pain excited him, but also saddened him. Only because he was now reduced to rubbing his claws across such a plentiful amount of belly, and was afraid that the slightest slap would cause it to rupture. He was even afraid to snuggle it with his muzzle lest he explode it. Everything, so tight and tense. He didn\u2019t know what to do. He had already grown to ungodly proportions, and now he currently could eat. It was as if he purpose for coming had now left him. But at least he has the word. Now comes the decision for what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he take the word back and be scolded for his feasting and coursing. Should he take a nap and sleep if off. Or, should he take the bold risk and finish the pumpkin, regardless of the consequences. With his stomach now resting and out of commission, making his own choice seemed hard. Rubbing as much of his body as he could, he made his decision\u2026..  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at the pumpkin, then to his quivering, bubbling tub of lard, Templeton decided to return the word after all. Caressing the thick ball of fur and fat, he moaned with pleasure. Over filled--over stuffed more than his simple mind could think about, the best thing he thought of (or his stomach rather) was to rest back at the pen and allow his stomach to digest the ungodly amount of food resting safely inside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempting to roll over, Templeton huffed and puffed to move himself into a crawling position. Unfortunately, his waist was so large and stomach so big that he was only able to stay in a lying down position. Placing both paws on his mountainous belly, he began shaking and sloshing it around, the food bubbling and churning all over his cramped organs. Much of the fat around his plump chest remained in a state of stasis. Gathering momentum, his belly slowly shifted to his side; causing the obese rat to giggle as his indigested gorge massaged his insides, until he was slightly lifted off the ground. Using both arms and one footpaw on the ground, leaving the other to dangle weightlessly off the ground, he pulled himself. Grunting and kicking his body across the table. Then landing with a deafening squelch that popped his ears. Waiting a few seconds to gather himself, he pressed onwards with word in mouth while grinning of his accomplishment and sighing in ecstasy at having glutted so much. With every slosh, his grin would grow wider and wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * * <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time past, daylight still a long time from coming, Templeton slowly grew accustomed to his tremendous weight. Dragging his way across the fair was more exercise than he was used to, which burn plenty of calories and digested food quicker. Needless to say, with a little more room in his belly, he waddled off here and there for more food. Corndogs, cotton candy, funnel cakes, popcorn, pie, and chicken legs were continuously devoured by the insatiable rat; growing a bit fatter as time progressed. Most of the added weight went straight to his rump, which helped to tip him over into a standing position. And miraculously, Templeton was able to walk on his virtually non existent legs. Helping him to get to the pen faster and easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his body jiggling, bouncing, and sloshing loudly along the way, he ran his paws across as much of his wide, blubbery frame as he could before he took his nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the plank of the pen, his chubby face peeked over with dazed drunken eyes and a crooked grin. \u201cHic\u2026HILP!!! I\u2019m back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig and spider weren\u2019t the least bit happy he was. Charlotte\u2019s many eyes glared at each glared at him with a fiery hatred that would make any other rat cringe. But not Templeton, who was too fat to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere have you been! Has it not occurred to you that Wilbur\u2019s life is at stake, and yours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPfft, not anymore, thought the rat, typical nagging Charlotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to lift himself over the board, the woodwork gave a loud snap under the rat\u2019s weight. Sending him face first to the ground and revealing his over filled, obese figure which jiggled furiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the pig and spider gasped, but Charlotte was the only one who spoke. \u201cAre you kidding me! Is this what you\u2019ve been up to all night!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton dragged his bloated body to the nearby crate. \u201cI could\u2019ve Hic\u2026HILP!!! stayed out longer you know, and neer Hic\u2026HILP!!! Come back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked to have realized such a thing, the spider pursued Templeton. \u201cYou fat, selfish, arrogant, sphere of adipose! Your too bloated to understand your own words. You\u2019re a disgusting sight. So, tell me. If you could\u2019ve abandon us, what gave you the audacity to come back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in a comfortable position with his back to the wooden corner, Templeton slapped both paws on his globe like belly; most of it sliding to his muzzle, which he then nuzzled his fat body with. Grinning through barely opened eyes, the fat rat slid the cut out cardboard across his belly; a pleasuring sensation flowing through him as soft fat ran past his digits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the cardboard, Charlotte swung over to the gray mountain, causing an earthquake of giggles to ripple through the rats body as she landed. As she crawled down further, she read out the words, and with her numerous eyes looked at the euphoric rat in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou actually came back with a word?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton didn\u2019t open his eyes. \u201cHic\u2026HILP!!! Your welcome, Hic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte said nothing more, just the way the rat wanted it. With his large back resting peacefully in the corner, he patted his belly one more time. The sickening sloshing and burbling like music to his ears. And then, he drifted into a deep slumber. Dreaming of reliving this glorious night all over again.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Night had fallen once again, bringing with it an empty food loaded fair once more. Stirring from his slumber at last, Templeton sniffed out all the delectable goodies from the pen. Wobbling his fat around to free his legs, he then stretched his limbs for the night ahead. The over abundance of calories the previous night had converted into soft fat throughout Templeton\u2019s body. Giving himself a few smacks to his belly, he rolled over and out the pen, eager to resume his glutting once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose two wont be seeing me for awhile,\u201d whispered Templeton to a sleeping Charlotte and Wilbur. \u201cWont they be surprised by how much I\u2019d change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting another moment waiting, Templeton pulled himself over the wooden plank of the gate, landing with a squelch, and waddled into the food loaded fairway. Finding small pile after small pile, he stuffed himself continuingly, patting his hefty belly once finishing one. Then pulling himself onto a table, he found many ingredients used to make a sandwich. Opening the bag of bread, he slapped the first slice on the floor and proceeded to pile it high with meat, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, and cheese. Not bothering to use the peanut butter or jelly jars, he just glutted both down, adding to the plush sloshing goodness of his belly. Using as much ingredients as he could and eating the leftovers, Templeton took his first munch of the massive meal towering him. More than delicious, he continued his relentless glutting, until he sat by himself, patting a massive belly spilled across the table in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling over to a nearby trash can, he landed inside with a squelch, and in under thirty minutes knocked it over, with all of it\u2019s previous occupants sloshing and glorping within his cavernous swell. Doing the same with two more trash cans and disposing of the piles of food sitting atop of the tables, the voracious rat bloated further to his delight. So much that he had to transition from walking to pulling himself as his belly lifted him higher off the ground, neutralizing his legs. Being of no consequence to him, he gradually swallowed whole a hotdog soaked to the brim in grim and topped with mustard, then afterwards finished the mustard jar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fair, where a rat can be a rat without any worry or danger. The only consequence being, that by the end of the day (or month for that matter) mobility might not be feasible. It was a goal Templeton planned on reaching, becoming fatter than any rodent living. Slowing down due to his weight however, the rat found a pile of cups, wrappers, and discarded trays and pans to rest against, all the while stuffing himself with further sustenance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfing down a slice of pizza, he gave a hefty smack to his titanic sloshing, burbling stomach. \u201c*Hic* If I knew a fair were this bountiful *Hic*, I would\u2019ve came here a long time ago.\u201d Wolfing down another slice, he grabbed a small box of juice and quaffed down the rich grape flavored drink. \u201cI think the goose *Hic* always knew about this place, and only *Hic* told me about it so I\u2019d come with *Hic* Charlotte and Wilbur.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling himself slightly forward, he lifted a pan of funnel cake, rested it on his belly, and funneled as much as his mouth could hold, finishing it in no time flat, ready to grab the next thing to glut. \u201c*Hic* No one cares about \u2018ol Templeton *Hic* do they. Except you,\u201d he held a hefty portion of pie eye level, \u201cYou care about me don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Hic* Yes Templeton,\u201d said the rat making his voice a higher pitch, \u201cI appreciate *Hic* you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rat smiled his sloppy smile, and kissed the pie, \u201cI appreciate you too.\u201d Without warning, he violently shoved the slab of pie into his mouth, stuffing his paws down his throat to get it all down. Jiggling his rippling stomach, Templeton laughed. \u201cNow you could appreciate me with all the others, ahahaha.\u201d Templeton, the gruesome glutton, the merciless muncher. To him, nothing edible on the planet was safe from his maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing what was left around him, he rolled onto his fantastically over gorged mass and proceeded toward further gluttony. Making melon rinds out of melons and cans out of cantaloupes, he mused as to where some significant eating can be had. Already overfull and overfed many times over, the fair experience was a limited one, and he wanted to milk it for all the food it had. Speaking of which, he disposed of a few warm milkshakes scattered besides cheese burgers and French fries. The salty snacks forced him to guzzle down a few cups of soda, as well as take a bottle of ketchup to go with the fries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two hours passed and Templeton was still glutting himself with absolute abandon. Pulling his continuously bloating body around proceeded to grow more difficult, but with resilience Templeton fought on. The gorging had greatly slowed down compared to earlier in the night, but only because Templeton\u2019s body limited him, not due to the rat\u2019s tiring. Having surpassed the capacity of fullness, Templeton psychologically remained hungry. So long as there was another morsel to feed him, it\u2019d be crammed within his gigantic sloshing blob like swell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the remains of a watermelon for the third time that night, he rolled his back onto three bananas stuck together. His tremendous weight catapulted each rich fruit into the air, and shifting his blubbery mass skillfully about, he caught each one in his mouth with a sickening squelch, adding more weight to his stomach. He became a mere appendage to it, head, limbs and tail all at his belly\u2019s mercy. And truthfully, Templeton couldn\u2019t be happier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning in pleasure, Templeton stroked as much as his lard filled expanse of fur allowed him to. \u201cSo\u2026much\u2026food *Hic*. Don\u2019t\u2026know\u2026*Hic* if-I-can\u2026glut\u2026any\u2026more.\u201d  Testing this theory, he grabbed at a nearby sausage and shoved it down his blubbery cheeks; his neck no longer present, but fusing with his vociferously sloshing, gurgling mid section. \u201cWell\u2026maybe I *Hic* can\u2026still\u2026glut some, hehehe *Hic*.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe might\u2019ve, but it would be a matter of whether he could still drag himself with so much food already fattening him to an obscene extent. Still, the thought of further gorging delighted him, as it was his dream to be the fattest rat in the world. \u201cI can\u2026do *Hic* this. My *Hic* stomach\u2026can handle\u2026anything.\u201d After each glorious hiccup, he reveled in the amount his stomach sloshed and undulated about. Soon letting out an extra loud hiccup, a tsunami of fat and indigested gorge attempted to swallow the rat whole, just as he\u2019d done to so much that night. Unable to fight against the squishy sloshing onslaught, he went with the wave of fat as it rolled him further and further backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the rolling stopped, he was upright once more, back resting against something moist, soft, and aromatic. Turning with more loud sloshing, a sloppy grin formed across his face as he came in contact with an extra large cheese burger. \u201c*Hic*Ooooooh,\u201d he moaned, as his stomach protested and fiercely churned to his pleasure, \u201cFate *Hic*\u2026wishes me\u2026to continue *Hic* glutting.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith gluttonous zeal, he attempted to polish off the large burger. With each grimy mouthful he had to forcefully shove down his throat, he continued growing in girth, making him that much more eager to continue gorging himself. The greasy satisfaction aroused his sense of smell, which after finishing half of the burger, helped him to spot five more. Moaning further in pleasure, he ate the remainder. Rubbing and patting all he could wrap his paws around, he looked at the remaining five lustfully. Pondering whether he should continue with his glut, or return home and wait for the next night.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Releasing a loud hiccup. The enormously bloated rat woozily pulled his way to the five remaining burgers. Moaning and grunting, his massively overfull stomach was almost unbearable to lug around with his flabby frail arms. Reaching the burgers, he then covetously pulled each toward him. Disregarding his belly\u2019s protesting, he ate the burgers in chunks. The gooey cheese and meat, coupled with the juices of tomato, pickles and lettuce traversed into his gut with a glop. The gorging grew quite difficult, to the point where he shoved his own paws into his mouth. Gasping upon swallowing each chunky, he finished the first burger. \u201cOooooh\u2026.one *Hic* down\u2026four\u2026to go.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlutting the remaining burgers proved difficult by the mouthful, especially while his blob of a stomach lay flat on the table. Thinking it would help, he rolled onto his back so his stomach would distend upward. Not adding pressure to it helped out slightly, but only for awhile. As it continued to grow, the burgers began distributing themselves more to Templeton\u2019s upper body and waist. With each passing second, his arms lifted a little more with each mouthful, as his expanding belly continued pushing his body outward. Thinking only about finishing these burgers, he was oblivious to the change, until cramming down the last mouthful of the fifth burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching to make room, Templeton groaned. Much of the fat from his bosom pushing against his chin, he rubbed his sloshing corpulent landscape. \u201cOoooh\u2026so\u2026much\u2026food. *Hic* Can\u2026hardly\u2026move\u2026\u201d As much as it bummed him, Templeton felt little feeling in his legs, as his excess obesity pinned him down. \u201c*Hic* This can\u2019t\u2026be\u2026it, oooh.\u201d Though getting as fat as he currently was delighted him more than anything, he was expecting to become fatter before reaching immobility. Rather flustered and unsatisfied, the rat frowned, clutching as much of his body as he could and wobbling it about; hoping the copious sloshing would cheer him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly however, they had a different effect, one that formed an idea in the rat\u2019s mind which only thought of where to go to eat next. Jiggling it more furiously, his frown turned to that of determination. \u201c*Hic* No. I\u2019m\u2026not finished. So long *Hic*\u2026as I\u2026can move\u2026I\u2019m\u2026not\u2026immobile.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill clutching his stomach (with his claws even) he pushed it forward, and pulled it back in a waving motion. Little by little, he felt his back slightly lift off the table. \u201cIt\u2019s *Hic* working.\u201d Pushing and pulling with more effort, he kept the rhythm; his stomach sloshing over him, then pulling him forward. As he was lifted high enough off the table, he strained to move forward, even grabbing his belly so he wouldn\u2019t fall backward. Pulling himself enough, he was finally able to sit up again, only, surrounded by his own fat every angle he turned. Thankfully he had enough back blubber and rump to keep him from falling backward, unless he leaned. Patting his corpulent mass, he giggled as the vibrations sloshed his gorge around. Legs now free from the blubbery embrace of his lower body, he attempted to walk. Slowly but surely, his tiny legs were able to move him forward while his belly dragged on the table. Nearing the edge, he purposely fell into a large trash can where further eating awaited him. Landing with a loud squelch, he feasted upon all he saw. Knocking over the can a few minutes later, he clutched his belly as he rolled uncontrollably for a few inches, stopping with his face in the dirt. Giving a loud belch to the sky, he wobbled his gut around. Still moaning as it bloated further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust\u2026find\u2026more\u2026food\u2026oooohhh.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging himself throughout the fair grounds, he limited his eating only to what was ground level, which was still quite a lot, especially when he could pull table cloths with his massive weight, and showering whatever food might\u2019ve been on the table directly to him. Doing so with three, he managed to eat some apple pie, scraps of cheese, lettuce, tomato, and bologna, a box of crackers, and a banana which only added more strain on his belly. Admittedly, the rat contemplated stopping and to rest up for another day, but by some nature, the slightest second he wasn\u2019t eating made him want to eat more. Whether it was his stomach that was at his mercy or vise versa, he wouldn\u2019t stop until one of them were satiated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a half eaten watermelon, he hugged it with his body, then biting a hole within it, he proceeded to swallow the entire thing whole, vacuuming up the inside, then disposing of the rind. Glutting the whole thing and rubbing his belly, he moved onto a basket of candy apples. Biting in huge chunks, the apple\u2019s juices tenderly trickled down his tongue, swathing his taste buds in a sweet decadent pleasure. Mad with gluttony, the entire basket was depleted in minutes, leaving an enormous rat to sit in awe of his titanic visage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling thirsty, he searched for the nearest drink he could find. Remnants of sour milkshakes and nearly finished sodas only did so much for him. Searching for that hefty gallon of sour milk or tank of juice to quaff was his main priority, until finally he found something of the like. Neither juice nor milk, a pitcher of yellow liquid bubbled within the confines of an ice cream stand. A peculiar place for one such drink to be, but Templeton didn\u2019t complain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling over, he threw open the door, groggily climbed up the first step of the stand and went over to the pitcher. Thankfully, his gargantuan gut added some significant height to his frame, which allowed the rat to lean in and guzzle down the yellow liquid with ease. The sour tangy flavor warmed his throat and insides, causing his monstrous belly to churn. Unwittingly to the rat\u2019s delight the yellow concoction was none other than beer, which made his already struggling coordination that much more disastrous. Thrown into a drunken stupor, he tried gathering his balance as he woozily attempted to go up to the second level, where the ice cream was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Hic* Come here little ice cream. *Hic* It\u2019s time to\u2026belly\u2026in my get*Hic*, hehehe.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFailing to be able to pull himself up to the ice cream, he managed to come up with a plan despite his drunkenness. Moving the pitcher out of the way, he went all the way to one edge of the cart, and with a hiccup, ran toward the other end, teetering on the very brink of collapsed. Hitting the other side of the cart with a massive squelch and gurgle, the wheels on his end tilted and eventually tipped the cart over, landing with a resounding smash coupled with sloshing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Hic* That\u2019ll do stomach. That\u2019ll *Hic* do. Pulling himself out, he made his way to the ice cream. There were three massive buckets, almost as big as him, filled with chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla. Starting with the strawberry, he popped open the lid, sampled the creamy desert, and found it was smooth and savory to the mouth, not frozen in the slightest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so *Hic* sweet. My stomach can be sweet too *Hic* once you get to know it. Which you *Hic* will now that I\u2019ve got you, hehehe *Hic*.\u201d Wasting not another moment, he gradually gorged himself on the creamy desert with a woozy drunken grin slapped across his chubby cheeks. Having gotten drunk, the limitations his stomach formally felt now seemed non existent, as mouthful after exuberant mouthful continued to bloat the rats already unbelievably fat body to further proportions. Reveling in the burbles and groans his stomach produced, through larger mouthfuls he\u2019d give it a heavy smack with a paw, sinking it within a few layers of soft squishy goodness. Licking every last trace of ice cream from the bucket he moved onto the second, and the third, finishing them in a likewise fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he finished, he leaned the blubbery wall of corpulence that was his back, against the tipped over cart. Finding a few small boxes of ice cream sandwiches, he place them on his wide table of a belly. Ripping each open and shoveling them into his mouth while purposely shaking his continuously sloshing countenance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Hic* I can\u2019t believe how much I\u2019ve *Hic* eaten. So much *Hic* food consumed in one *Hic* night. Everything\u2026so veritable *Hic* so rich. There\u2019s *Hic*, nothing\u2026my stomach can\u2019t handle. This *Hic*, smorgasbord of a fair\u2026really is *Hic* a paradise, where a rat can\u2026glut\u2026glut\u2026*Hic*\u2026glut\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter each glut, he would fervently stuffed an ice cream sandwich whole down his gullet. The vast wealth of his corpulent tissue jiggled and sloshed in bliss. Swollen to the size of two pumpkins, the rat finished off his remaining gorge. Nestling into his swollen body, he marveled at the accomplishment he had made within two days. So big, so rich, so abundant. Never has a rat felt greater joy than what he was experiencing. His hedonistic lifestyle had reached it\u2019s pinnacle, and still, there was room for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Hic* Stomach\u2026you have been good to me. After all the *Hic* time we\u2019ve known each other, I\u2019ve held you *Hic* with the highest expectations. Which\u2026is why *Hic* I\u2019m gunna\u2026let\u2026you chose what to do next. Are we gunna eat *Hic* Charlotte and Wilbur, or are we gunna *Hic* go back to\u2026more\u2026hehe\u2026*Hic*? You\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re so fat\u2026I hope you know *Hic* that\u2026hehe\u2026stomach, you\u2026fat\u2026stomach *Hic* you.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As simple as it would have been to just keep gorging himself on the fairway, he knew that would never be enough. He needed something a bit heartier, and more satisfying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he had a bone to pick with a couple of his \"friends\" from Zuckerman's farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an excited shiver, he began dragging himself back towards Wilbur's pen. Thanks to his relentless gorge, he was quite a bit larger than he had been when they arrived, and his stomach ached for a challenge. He'd swallow the dumb spider first, of course, and then he'd swallow Wilbur himself, without even bothering to chew. They'd beg for him to release them, and he'd ignore their shouts while his satisfied belly slowly digested them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned with ecstasy just from thinking about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him the better part of the day to drag himself across the fair, and he was forced to nap during most of the daylight hours. While he slept, his belly digested the most of the previous night's binge, increasing his size further and making him all the more ravenously hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived at the pen just after the sun went down. Wilbur and Charlotte were talking quietly, with Charlotte resting on Wilbur's snout. They were in the perfect position for Templeton to gobble them both up in one go. But no, he thought- he'd still eat the spider first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poked his head through the slats of the fence and announced himself with a sour belch. It only reminded him how empty his stomach was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, we weren't expecting you to come back,\" Charlotte sniffed. Templeton ignored her as he hauled his massive bulk over the fence and collapsed into the pen. His fat hid his smirk at Charlotte and Wilbur's gasps of surprise and revulsion. He was easily as big as Wilbur now, and soon, he'd be even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss me?\" he slurred, as he dragged himself towards them. As he moved, what little food was left in his belly sloshed from side to side. The pig and the spider had no idea what danger they were in as they both made disparaging remarks about his ample waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The word worked,\" said Wilbur. \"So what made you come back <i>this</i> time?\" Templeton was now nose-to-nose with him. Charlotte's delectable, furry little body was millimeters away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Charlotte,\" he said huskily. And before she could ask what that meant, he'd stretched his neck forward, opened his mouth wide, and grabbed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing!?\" Wilbur shouted, as Templeton swallowed with a noisy gulp. Charlotte's eight legs tickled his throat all the way down, but she was so small that he couldn't even feel it when she dropped into his cavernous gut. His stomach rumbled irritably, desperate for something bigger. Templeton smiled lazily as Wilbur moved to attack him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, my humble Wilbur!\" he crowed. He opened his mouth even wider and caught Wilbur's snout between his teeth. Once he had a good hold, he began to swallow ravenously, sucking Wilbur's head in first and then his shoulders and front legs. Templeton's front legs clutched his belly as it exploded in size, while his back legs kicked impotently at the air. His eyes rolled back into his head as he continued to swallow, devouring Wilbur whole in a matter of minutes. Once most of the pig's body was pressed into his gut, his struggles shifted Templeton's center of gravity, swinging him into a more or less upright position. Wilbur's hind legs kicked feebly straight up into nothing but air. Aided by gravity, Templeton barely had to swallow at all as Wilbur's legs slid down into his belly with the rest of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach closed over the huge load with a noisy <i>squelch</i>.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned by the size of the gorge, Templeton sat completely still, as if by moving or taking any more than the shallowest of breaths, his stomach might explode. He hadn't eaten anything that was alive, or nearly as large, so the shudder of Wilbur's breathing and heartbeat made his stomach still in confusion. It was several minutes before Templeton dared to give his stomach a tentative pat. His stomach, swollen and taut as it was, was incredibly sensitive, and it shuddered at the touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it,\" he finally whispered. His belly quivered. \"I did it!\" he said, more loudly. He was so full that he couldn't even move, so stuffed that he couldn't even feel the pain of fullness anymore, and he didn't care. He sat right in the middle of Wilbur's pen, swollen to bursting, bragging to the world that he was the first ever rat to swallow a whole pig and live to tell the tale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome panicked, barely audible noises bled out from his middle. Either Wilbur or Charlotte was trying to talk to him. He laughed with delight that they were completely muffled by his stomach and his bulging fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to let you out?\" he slurred, rubbing his belly. \"Too bad.\" Finally sated after days of gorging himself, he belched deeply, allowing himself to enjoy Wilbur's taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" he told his stomach as he belched again and relished the sweet flavor. \"That buttermilk bath really <i>does</i> work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to be the last indignity for Wilbur, because suddenly there was a large bump inside Templeton's stomach, and he was knocked off balance, rolling to one side. He giggled as he rolled helplessly for a few feet, his chubby and useless arms and legs flailing in the air, before he ended up on his back, his gut swaying proudly. Wilbur did it again, and he rolled to the other side of the pen before crashing with an enormous hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop- <i>hic</i>- it,\" he laughed. \"You're- <i>hic</i>- making me- <i>hiiiicc</i>- hiccup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third time, Templeton ended up propped in a corner, the perfect place to sleep off his enormous meal. Luckily for him, Wilbur was tiring out, and his movements were getting sluggish. He was running out of air. Clutching his belly tightly with both paws, Templeton let out one more satisfied belch, and groaned with delight as Wilbur slowed to a halt. Templeton's stomach gurgled richly, and digestion began to take hold. As the rest of the food in his stomach sloshed around Wilbur's unbelievably heavy body, Templeton felt over-stuffed, over-sated, and most of all, unbearably sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rested his head and paws on his belly and fell into the deepest sleep of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly the next morning, he was awakened by some human voices. His belly had softened somewhat, but he was still incredibly bloated. He pricked up one ear lazily and listened to what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, over here! I want to see Zuckerman's famous pig!\"     </span></div></div>",

He looked at his massive swell and asked: \u201cHic\u2026HILP! You ready to go already?\u201d His stomach grumbled and gurgled and Templeton, despite his massively swollen state, started to salivate at the thought of further feasting and glutting.  Hiccuping happily, Templeton patted his belly eagerly and slowly started to work himself over onto his stomach. Amid a symphony of sloshing and bubbling, Templeton slowly teetered on his tiny feet and finally held his balance. Taking one laborious step at a time, the incredibly massive amount of food Templeton had already ingested sloshed and glorped inside his bulging stomach. Making it to where he entered only a few minutes previously, Templeton hiccupped and stared with awestruck eagerness at the fields of trash and rotting goodies. Charlotte called to him: \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Templeton turned, hefted as much of his massively overgorged gut, hiccupped loudly and replied: \u201cHic\u2026HILP!! Where do you Think? Hic\u2026HILP!! I did my duty\u2026I\u2019m going to enjoy myself\u2026HILP..What feasting and glutting awaits me\u2026Hic\u2026HILP!!\u201d Templeton leaned back so far that he crashed onto his rump with a deafening squelch and glop and woozily fell silent. Charlotte reprimanded: \u201cLook at yourself, you\u2019re gigantic, how can you possibly think of going out again?\u201d Templeton lazily hiccupped and replied: \u201cHic\u2026HILP!!! My stomach can handle anything\u2026HILP!!\u201d, slapping his stomach at every syllable and rejoicing in the sickening squelches it made at every slap. He grinned sloppily at Charlotte and amidst deafening bubbling, Templeton heaved himself over onto his fat belly and slowly dragged himself off to continue his glut. The last Charlotte heard was a chomp, the bubbling of Templeton\u2019s overfilled belly, and an incredibly rich and exuberant hiccup followed by \u201cThis will\u2026HILP!! Be a night to remember!!\u201d<br>\r\nAnd indeed, right outside of Wilbur\u2019s pen, Templeton had found a large chicken leg that someone had apparently dropped while looking at Wilbur. He eagerly tore into it and stripped the bone bare quickly. He looked at the bone, hesitated for a second, then took the bone and began to shove it down his throat. Wincing from the pain, he swallowed massively and the bone entered his gigantic belly with a gurgle and Templeton hiccupped loudly and happily and dragged himself to other pieces of food that were strewn across the fair. Determined to overgorge himself many times over, Templeton devoured hot dogs, hamburgers, made apple cores out of apples, funneled funnel cakes into his stomach, and drank a large cup of warm milkshake. Finally Templeton arrived at the snack fairway and paused to rest. His already gigantic belly had bloated out larger and larger and Templeton couldn\u2019t be happier. \u201cHIC\u2026HIC\u2026HILP!!! What feasting and glutting, a real gorge\u2026HIC\u2026HIC\u2026HILP!!! I\u2019m not done yet!! HIC\u2026HILP!!\u201d Templeton joyfully slapped his massive gut which bubbled and sloshed. Templeton, driven insane by gluttony, started to gather all the food he could find into a massive pile. This undertaking proved harder than expected, not only because of Templeton\u2019s massive size, but also because the temptation often proved too much and Templeton often glutted himself on the food before he could add it to his pile.<br>\r\nHaving gathered a truly impressive mound of fattening, rotting goodies of all kinds, Templeton hiccupped richly and, teetering dangerously on his feet, obeyed the will of his hugely overglutted stomach and dove into the pile and started to gorge and glut with complete abandon. The pile steadily and speedily shrank until it had completely disappeared into Templeton, who, stunned at his accomplishment, rolled out of the ruins of his gluttony, grinning stupidly at his own size. His fantastically overgorged, overfed and overglutted stomach was a sight to behold. All the indigested mass of eating sloshed, bubbled and glopped sickeningly as Templeton rolled uncontrollably toward a large table. He hit it square at the center of his massive globe-like stomach with a cacophony of bubbling. Templeton drunkenly looked up at the table and greedily shook his overflowing stomach. \u201cHIC\u2026HIC\u2026HIC\u2026HILP!!! What gorging and glutting\u2026HIC\u2026HIC\u2026HIC\u2026HILP!!! This fair is a rat\u2019s paradise\u2026HIC\u2026HIC\u2026HILP!!\u201d Templeton grabbed the tablecloth with his forepaws and tried to pull himself up onto the table, but his hugely grown belly stayed put and the tablecloth began to move downward. Giggling at his own weight, Templeton hiccupped and allowed himself to drop back down onto his stomach with a deafening squelch. Woozily recovering, Templeton looked up and saw a whole variety of goodies teetering on the edge of the tablecloth. Not waiting another second, Templeton hiccupped eagerly, patted his belly happily, which burbled an oversated reply and then tugged on the tablecloth. Food came raining down straight toward his mouth and Templeton only had to shift around to reach it. Donut holes, bananas, hot dogs, and more and more glutting material dove into his mouth and splashed into his obscenely fat stomach which bloated larger and bubbled even more. <br>\r\nFinally, after gorging on an entire table\u2019s worth of food, Templeton woozily looked around for more gorging. Incredibly, he hazily saw another large pile of rotting food, not far from where he lay, pinned under the massive product of his uncontrolled gluttony. He hiccupped massively and richly and eagerly wheeled back onto his overinflated gut. Straining with all his might, Templeton managed to drag his huge, sloshing belly, his hind legs kicking helplessly in the air. As he was making it, Templeton lost no opportunity to gorge himself on smaller amounts of food that lay between him and his next target. All these \u2018little\u2019 amounts were happily and blithely crammed into his cavernous stomach. At long last, Templeton arrived at the pile and discovered with great delight that not only was this latest pile very large, but that there were more of a similar size nearby. Salivating, Templeton eagerly began his glut, finishing off one pile after the other with fantastic rapidity, gorging his fantastically, massively overfilled stomach to even more incredible proportions. Hiccupping and belching richly at his most recent glut, Templeton drunkenly staggered to more piles until his stomach became so incredibly large and overfilled that after a final gorge, Templeton could not support his massively overstuffed frame on his tiny feet and crashed with a giant squelch. Templeton grinned sloppily and carelessly smacked his titanic stomach. The massive amount of food slowly pushed him down and nearly crushed him with its bubbling, gurgling contents. He happily fought against the oncoming tsunami of swollen stomach and gratefully managed to roll toward new feats of glutting. <br>\r\nTempleton then bumped against something moist, and turning his head, he was stupefied to find a huge, half watermelon right before his eyes. He gulped amazedly and then: \u201cHIC\u2026HIC\u2026HIC\u2026HILP!! What a Night!! HILP!!! This will DEFINITELY be a glut\u2026HILP!!! To remember!! HILP!!!\u201d Without further ado, he began eating into the watermelon with massive bites until he all but disappeared into the massive fruit. Viewed from the outside, an observer could only see the rind shuddering and hear incredible bubbling and massive, rich hiccups and the occasional belch. At long last, Templeton lay within the rind, having completely consumed the entire inside of the watermelon. Woozy and drunkenly swollen already, this recent gorge only made things much worse. He hiccupped uncontrollably and often, happily grinning at the sickening cacophony of sloshing indigestion. Templeton slapped his stomach: \u201cHIC HILP!! My stomach can handle anything! HIILPPP!!!!!\u201d and bit into the rind of the watermelon, pausing to wonder if he should dispose of the rind as well as the inside.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Templeton hiccupped, shrugged and began to attack the rind of the watermelon with gluttonous zeal. Though it was very bitter and foul tasting, Templeton was too woozy and food-drunk to know the difference. He only wanted more to shove into his over gorged gut. Soon, the entire rind had disappeared into Templeton\u2019s massive stomach. He hiccupped massively and richly and slapped his huge, bulging, stomach which bubbled an overfilled reply. Having stuffed and glutted himself to an obscene extent, Templeton still somehow felt a need for further eating and was as determined as ever to overfill his stomach to absolute incapacity. However, the sun was just beginning to rise, and Templeton felt that he should at least try to begin to work his way to Wilbur\u2019s pen. <br>\r\nBelching richly, he heaved himself onto his stomach and very slowly began to drag himself in the pen\u2019s direction. However, there was a vast amount of eating to be had between there and the pen, and Templeton took full advantage of it. A substantial trickle of food passed his lips and continued to bloat him out even farther as he moved until he spied a fallen trash can. Wanting to investigate, he approached and was yet again awestruck by the huge amount of rotten, thrown away food and other garbage that was packed inside and spilled across the fairway. As he dragged himself toward the motherlode of goodies, he stuffed all and sundry into his massive belly. Half eaten bananas, cookies, forgotten cupcakes, hamburgers, stale hamburger buns, rotten fruit, squishy vegetables, all of these and more found new incredibly cramped accommodations on Templeton\u2019s gargantuan stomach. He hiccupped, delirious with joy, when he arrived at the entrance to the trash can: \u201cHIC\u2026HIC\u2026HIC\u2026HILP!!! So much Food\u2026HILP!!! So\u2026HIC\u2026RICH\u2026HILP!!!

Seen such fantastic\u2026HIC\u2026eating\u2026HILP!!!\u201d His belly groaned and gurgled with strain and overfeeding, but Templeton rolled himself with his mouth facing the can, and rolled into his newest feast. All the feasts of this most fantastic night were dwarfed by the size and ecstasy that Templeton felt within this trash can. Literally everything was sopping with grease and oozing with overripe seasoning. Templeton couldn\u2019t get enough into his gullet fast enough, even eating the paper wrappings of the food as if they weren\u2019t there at all.<br>\r\nA good half hour passed, the trash can reechoing with Templeton\u2019s moans of enjoyment, his incredibly rich hiccups and overstuffed belches, and most of all, the incredible noise of his vastly overfilled stomach. Finally, having polished off a good \u00be of the massive amount of food in there, a gigantically overfed slowly rolled his way out of the trash can and plopped sickeningly onto the ground. Templeton couldn\u2019t believe how much he had eaten, his stomach was so titanically stuffed it boggled even his wildest dreams. He contentedly hiccupped and plopped his hands onto his mass of a stomach. His gorge bubbled, burbled, sloshed and glorped around with the least movement. \u201cHILP!!! HILP!!!!

He drunkenly grinned, slapped his truly titanic belly, and looked forward to showing off his night\u2019s work.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sloppily grinning Templeton hiccupped: \u201cHIC HILP!! I\u2019m BACCKK\u201d. Charlotte and Wilbur seemed much less annoyed with him now. Templeton struggled greatly to heave himself over the bar, feeling his fantastically overfilled belly slosh beneath him. Another resounding crack followed by a sickening squelch and glop announced Templeton\u2019s vastly increased weight even from earler in the night. His stomach slammed into the ground and sloshed over his head for a second, glorping, bubbling and burbling all the while. Templeton woozily let himself further down: \u201cHIC HILP!!!

Charlotte broke the silence: \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible for you to get any bigger than before, but this is obscene. You should be ashamed of yourself, It\u2019d serve you right if you got an acute attack of severe indigestion!\u201d Templeton hiccupped happily and slapped his stomach multiple times: \u201cOh pleash\u2026HIC\u2026my stomach can handle anything\u2026HIC HIC HILP!!!\u201d His stomach heaved  and sloshed in reply and Templeton\u2019s hands fell limply off his massive bulging gut in a catatonic, self satisfied stupor. Wilbur piped up: \u201cTempleton, if you weren\u2019t so dopey, you\u2019d notice that Charlotte\u2019s made an egg sac!\u201d Templeton blearily opened his eyes and tried to lift his head above the massive swell of his belly to see the egg sac. His stomach bubbled and sloshed at the increased effort, but try as he might, Templeton\u2019s belly was simply too massive to look over. After a struggle Templeton collapsed back down upon Wilbur\u2019s leg with a slosh and said: HIC\u2026.HILP!!! Hooray for Scharlotte\u2026HILP!!!\u201d and patted his vociferous stomach proudly.  Wilbur contined: \u201cFor your information , there are 514 eggs in that peachy little sac!\u201d Templeton hiccupped, slapped his giant belly and woozily snickered: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more than that in this \u2018peachy little sac\u2019 I can tell you that! HIC HIC HIC HILP!!! This HAS been a night\u2026HIC HILP!!!\u201d He then attempted to roll over onto his stomach again. Three times he tried and finally after a third time he sloshed upright and his stomach ballooned out as he landed with a sickening glop. \u201cHIC\u2026now excuse me\u2026HILP!\u201d and dragged himself toward the crate. Even though he was so obscenely bloated, a small voice in Templeton\u2019s mind urged him to go out and continue eating. He even spied a simply massive mound of food that he could hide and glut on while the day progressed. Giggling drunkenly, he hiccupped and reached the crate\u2019s wall, where he threw himself against it, stomach prone yet again, and began to slap it and slosh it around with delight: \u201cHIC\u2026HILP!!!

He then eagerly struggled over onto his bloated, churning belly and started to drag himself to the massive pile. Glorping and gurgling with every heave, Templeton\u2019s belly was slowly dragged out of the pen and into the early morning sunlight. For Templeton, it was incredibly hard work to pull his gigantically bloated body toward this next feast, but somehow he made it, and with the first contented bite, Templeton considered it ALL worth the effort. Burying his head into the pile of rotting food, Templeton used his forepaws to shovel more and more into his already overburdened stomach, even stuffing both paws into his mouth to ram his glutting down. The food landed inside Templeton\u2019s gut no longer with sickening splashes but with obviously overstuffed, burbles, glorps and bubbling. Ignoring his gut\u2019s protestations, Templeton slowly dragged himself into the pile so that he completely disappeared. The last Charlotte and Wilbur heard of Templeton was an incredible squelch and glop, followed by a massive hiccup. Indeed, Templeton had found a simply massive banana at the center of the huge pile and proceeded to shove it whole down his gullet. It slammed into his gigantically bloated belly and pushed it much further than before. Templeton lay in the center of his pile absolutely stunned. He woozily grinned and gingerly placed his tiny forepaws on his overfilled stomach which groaned and gurgled with strain at accommodating such a gigantic addition. For a few minutes, surrounded by food, Templeton was stunned into dazed inaction by the sheer size of what he had ingested. He hiccupped richly and uncontrollably and often and grinned crookedly in between. However, surrounded as he was with food, Templeton quickly recovered and snickering at his seemingly infinite capacity and the massive amount of further gorging, began glutting himself again with even more reckless abandon. An hour passed and he had not even made a dent in the huge pile, but he definitely had eaten gargantuan amounts, as his titanically overfilled, overburdened and overstuffed stomach, which continued to expand out farther and farther to accommodate its master\u2019s feckless gluttony readily attested. Templeton now lay there, crushed by the weight of his gluttony, in a self satisfied catatonic stupor, belching and hiccupping massively and richly, but his tiny forepaws a flurry of action, grabbing all and sundry and cramming it into his open maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Templeton\u2019s food surrounded world turned upside down and he tumbled with it into empty space, his big fat bloated belly leading the way, crazily sloshing and gurgling. Incredibly, even in this moment of seeming danger, Templeton, though keeping his forepaws protectively around as much of his titanic gut as he could grasp, was still engrossed in glutting, grabbing numerous chunks of tumbling food in his mouth and blithely continued his feasting. Templeton landed heavily on his incredible stomach within a large heap of food with a \u201cGLORCH-gurgle\u201d. Woozily recovering, Templeton ate his way up to the top of the pile and peeked his head out. His pile of food must have been loaded into a trash can, as Templeton stared directly at the wall of a barrel. Not believing his fantastic good fortune, Templeton hiccupped happily and jiggled his massively bloated lower body in jubilation. Without wasting another moment, Templeton, salivating and giggling with anticipation richly hiccupped and cried: \u2018HIC HIC HIC HIC HILP!!! Oh thishhh will\u2026HILP!! Be\u2026HIC HIC\u2026RI-ACHHH\u2026HILP!!!!\u2019and eagerly dove into the trash again, his mouth wide open to begin glutting the instant he landed. His titanic stomach groaned, churned and bloated larger as Templeton dove into the richest, oldest, most rotten bottom of the trash can and started his eager feasting....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Evening spread its cool darkness over the fairground, a small head peeked over the lip of the trash can to savor the refreshing air, only to spew a gigantically rich and woozy hiccup and shatter the otherwise serene silence. Templeton had spent the last 12 hours alternating between napping and eating, but mostly eating. The humans had busily refilled his trash can with vast amounts of discarded trash and half-eaten foot, which Templeton had eagerly and happily glutted on. Now, with the humans leaving the fair, Templeton woozily struggled to focus his eyes on the fairway before him, strewn with even greater piles of trash and delectable pleasure. His eyes glinted greedily and he hiccupped readily: \u2018ooof\u2026HILP!!!...tha gooshhh was right\u2026HIC HILP!! Thishh fair ishh a\u2026HILP!!! Rat\u2019s Paradischhh HIC HIC HILP!!! What feasting and glutting awaits\u2026HIC HILP!!! Thishhh will be a night to REMEMBER\u2026HIC HIC HILP!!!\u2019 With that, Templeton allowed himself to drop back down the considerable distance into the treasure of trash that he had temporarily abandoned. He landed with an explosion of sloshes so rich and indulgent that even the food-crazy Templeton paused momentarily to survey how much larger his belly had bloated out through his day of eating. Food seemed to be stuffed in every part of Templeton, swelling all of him to a large size, but nowhere was this obscene bloating  more noticeable by far was in his titanic, bulging stomach. Templeton doubted that he could drag himself around once he was through, but, snickering at the thought, He was sure he\u2019d find a way to continue eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot losing another moment, Templeton, hiccupping eagerly, dove greedily into the vast sea of food, trash, and wrappers. He crammed food into his mouth with fantastic rapidity, gasping for air between the nearly continuous stream of food through his mouth, only broken by fantastically rich hiccups and contented belches. His vast stomach squelched and burbled deafeningly, which the woozy Templeton mistook for calls for even more frantic eating, which he was happy to oblige. Despite the can\u2019s vast size, Templeton soon enough was moaning with pleasure at the bottom of a mountain of soggy wrappers, every last morsel crammed into his gratuitously swollen body. Nearly crushed beneath his gigantic stomach, Templeton happily slapped its wide girth and hiccupped greedily and started to rock back and forth, reveling in the overstuffed sloshes that exploded from his bulging stomach, which soon began to bounce and heave to and fro and soon enough the trash can tipped over and a bubbling, woozy, drunken Templeton rolled out and onto the food-loaded fairway.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he plopped out of the lid of the can, the wide expanse of Templeton\u2019s abdomen pressed onto the warm fair soil and formed around his back. Ever so slowly the bubbling mass of his insatiable gluttony rolled onto the back of his head with grotesque burbling and sloshing, which was music to the rats ears. It was indeed the feasting of a lifetime, with consequences only a rat would indulge in. Templeton had gorged himself to an incredibly obscene state that not even Charlotte and Wilber would believe how much he had grown over the course of one day. It thrilled the rat\u2019s mind, producing tremendous anxiety in sharing his latest and greatest accomplishment to both his friends. Truly, his goal to of eaten until made immobile in this heavenly place, will be soon realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly, warped in a continuously rocking state, constantly gurgled as all of it\u2019s pleasing contents shifted into comfortable positions within Templeton\u2019s incredible bulbous mass. He rested momentarily, allowing the shifting tide of lard from his back to soothingly massage his insides like someone giving him a backrub. Purposely, he even slightly shook himself to continue the pleasuring process; which only took a slight tremble. Content in his current position, he patted the sides of his belly with both paws, producing liquid like glorps and bubbling gas which exited the rat\u2019s body through an appetizing belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, this is the life.\u201d The moaned, half opening his eyes and grinning at seeing the marvelous food loaded fairway. What he had gorged on the previous night looked to be fully restocked, with interest even. A monstrous gurgle erupted from the deep pit of the rats stomach, which made him softly stroke the plush squishy surface with great relish. \u201cDo you still have some fight left in you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach groaned in response. Giving in a couple of hefty pats, Templeton\u2019s body began sloshing vigorously from head to tail, resuming his constant jiggling state. Adding to this, he rocked his body back and forth, and once getting enough momentum dragged himself forward using the force of his body. It worked well enough for the time being, until even his towering fat is too much to handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely Templeton continue shoveling food down his gullet to his hearts content. The already limited space caused some slight discomfort as new arrivals struggled for room, but the rat forced more down needlessly. Each morsel that passed through his lips was a wondrous delicacy; everything rotten, soaping with grease or mold, or just a hefty portion he had to push down his throat just to get it through. The constant consumption even at his enormous state continued to be just as delectable as the first night, if not more so with enough food in his belly to feed a group of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter consuming what seemed like an untold amount of hot dogs, corn dogs, candy apples, fries, sour milkshakes, and a jar of pickles, Templeton further fleshed out. But more importantly, his stomach, once gelatinous in movement, now began growing rather firm to the touch. Giving himself a few experimental slaps, his bubbling belly danced for a bit but only for a brief moment. Finding a nearby uneaten hotdog, he quickly grabbed it, rolled over onto his back resting against the leg of a table, and quickly shoved it down his gapping maw. There was a sharp pain on the way down even the rat couldn\u2019t shake off and by the time it went down, Templeton could literally feel it in his pudgy chest. But more importantly, he felt his body grow tighter as it grew outward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s strange,\u201d said the rat, daintily rubbing his smooth blubbery visage, \u201cAm I finally getting full?\u201d The thought of it slightly disappointed him, but when looking over just how enlarged he had become throughout this entire ordeal, it was quickly rubbed off. Squeezing at his bulk, he patted it some more. \u201cNever have I dreamed at becoming so incredibly fat. All that food, all that gorging, it was all worth it in the end.\u201d Softly, his stomach gurgled in compliance. \u201cYou really are a stomach that can handle anything.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving constant praise to his stomach and the accomplishment of his obese state, irony began to twist in Templeton\u2019s mind. He was won over by the fact he was growing full, but the glory of his stomach\u2019s resilience had suddenly peaked his arousal. \u201cEven if I\u2019m getting full, I\u2019m sure you could handle more am I right?\u201d With a loud glorp, Templeton received his answer. \u201cThen lets continue my belly of a thousand stomachs.\u201d................... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jiggling it about, Templeton set off once again to finish his treatment. In his area there wasn\u2019t much to be found: a bag of popcorn, cotton candy, liquorish, churros, nothing to completely satisfy him. He kept on the lookout for that one meal that\u2019ll truly quench his gluttonous appetite, and then, he found it. On top of a table was a large assortment of goodies he knew would be more than enough: 2 buckets of chicken, 3 boxes of pizza, a large bowl of sausage links, 2 two liter cokes, and an enormous chocolate cake sitting in the middle. Wasting no time, he climbed up a convenient step ladder. It was good to once again use his legs for once which helped tremendously despite his enormous belly getting in the way a bit. But once he reached the top, he proceeded with his  binge starting with the chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly and skillfully he tore the meat from the bone, swallowing in large portions. The sharp pain continued striking with each gulp, but he did his best to ignore it. It became more bearable with the continuing flow of food; perhaps something in his chest was dislodged? But his expanding stomach remained getting tighter and tighter, as well as wider. As he finished the two buckets, his unyielding girth was distributed somewhat to his back, allowing him to crane his head back and roll to a standing position. His titanic burbling belly bloated out beyond comprehension. Patting his triumphant treasure, he noticed that what once throbbed about upon the impact of his paw, now only slightly trembled. What also once was a symphony of sloshing turned into a thick squelch. It must\u2019ve been the firmness upon reaching his full capacity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow upright, Templeton moved from side to side in order to free his legs from underneath his plump robust waistline. Walking was still difficult, but proved simpler than before with his newer more plumper backside. Continuing his binge he moved onto the bowl of sausage links. He moved beside it, grabbed a single sausage connected to the ones around the bowl, placed it in his mouth, and swallowed. Like a vacuum, the entire link quickly slithered down the rats throat in a meaty train of goodness. Quickly, his belly began bloating out further, even causing Templeton some discomfort at the rate it grew, and the tighter it became. But he just kept eating, for better or worse. The savoring the juicy grease grazing his throat, until the whole thing was finished. Grunting as the last sausage entered his stomach, he let out a loud hiccup, which dangerously teetered him on his feet. Regaining his balance, he then set his eyes on the three boxes of pizza. Suddenly, his over gorged abdomen groaned at the thought of it\u2019s master\u2019s intentions. The movement was forceful the rat nearly fell forward as ripples ran through his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, had enough already?\u201d Placing his paws on his stomach he felt the various shapes of his gorge fatuously trying to shift around in his cramped body, causing it to violently churn. He looked to his massive stomach, then to the food, then to his stomach. The incessant groans pleaded for a break, causing Templeton to bow his head in sympathy at his stomach\u2019s hard work. Giving it a short rub, its contents tenderly sloshed around. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he spoke softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without warning, the rat pushed on, against his own weight, to get to the pizza boxes. Quickly, he threw the lid open, and dived into his latest gorge. Devoid of thought of his stomach\u2019s limit, he shoved as much of the cheesy treats as he could into his mouth; taking large chunks down the hatch. His blithe smile masked the sharp pain that would come with each mouthful, as his belly grew rounder and tighter. Not wasting a moment, he continued onto the second box, then the third. Grinning and practically laughing at his disobedience to his own body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot resting, he moved onto the soft drinks. Taller than him, but not very far, he gnawed off the caps, leaned back, and allowed the liquid to flow inside him. Powerless to his own insatiable binging, he gave a loud sigh as he finished the bottle off. A tsunami of fat then rolled onto him, too much for him to push away. The momentum caused him to flip over back onto his feet. Having consumed so much liquid, Templeton felt he was about to explode any minute, but relentless and determined, he would finish his meal even if that were the case. \u201cYou take orders from me,\u201d he spoke to his stomach, out of breath and grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisposing the soda the same as the first, his rich hiccups had returned, causing him to clutch his middle as the sharp pain came. At this point, with each hiccup, the rat swore he could feel some of his nourishment wanting to come back out; possibly his body fighting back against it\u2019s owner\u2019s greed. Struggling, he moved to the final ingredient in his appetizing pot of a belly, the cake. Perfectly untouched by some miracle, he crawled toward it, using the same method before he started. The sheer size of it intimidated him, but without avail, he took his first chunk within his paws. Savoring the sight of the delectable pastry, he opened wide, stuffed it in his mouth, and swallowed the most relishing swallow he ever had. The sugary goodness was so great he moaned in pleasure. But before he could take his next bite, something happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sharp pain that plagued him shot in his abdomen, causing him great discomfort. It was like a stomach cramp, only Templeton had never had one before so this was more frightening. The intense pain caused him to squint and even wobble in place. Helpless, the rat rolled around, his entire body loudly sloshing in the process. Oblivious to his own movements, his monster of a belly had accidentally rolled onto the pastry. And as soon as it came, it was finished. The pain slowly began to recede, leaving Templeton lying down with his otherworldly belly towering in front of him. His huffing and puffing, the rat\u2019s large grin was all but gone, leaving with it a look of defeat. The cramp proved too much to handle, and now, with his paws gently stroking the frosting off his messy fur, he sighed in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026lets\u2026go back\u2026then\u2026\u201d There was no reply from his belly, only silence, and the nodding from each breath he took.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as he wanted to retreat to the safety of Wilbur's pen, Templeton was forced to deal with the indisputable fact that he was completely unable to move. His stomach was stretched taut, hard as a rock, and unbearably heavy, as if he'd just swallowed a whole bowling ball, or some other weighty, inorganic object. The food was packed in so tightly that he couldn't even feel the different foods in his belly anymore. He was just one big, heavy, immobile lump of rat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd gorged himself to his absolute limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton tilted his head back, opened his mouth, and belched richly, breaking the silence of the dark fairgrounds. His belly shook with relief at the decrease in pressure. Templeton reclined against the empty pizza boxes, picked clean by none other than himself mere minutes before, and looked out over the fairgrounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next table over was also stacked high with pizza and soda, and what looked to be a half-eaten bucket of chicken wings. Beyond there, he could see a closed ice cream stand, a stack of watermelons, and the setup for a hot dog eating contest. There was a stand for barbecue pulled pork, and one for lemonade. None of that was even to mention the trash cans that he knew were piled high with rotting delicacies, or the leftovers that littered the ground. His own body was still coated with cake and frosting that he couldn't even bear the thought of licking off himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could smell it. There was still food everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must've- <i>hiiiiic</i>,\" he slurred, unable to speak without his belly throwing in its two cents. \"<i>Hic</i>. I ate enough to gorge-\" on the word <i>gorge</i>, his own gorge shifted and he belched- \"a thousand rats. <i>Hic</i>. And it's like I was never- <i>hic</i>- here- <i>hic</i>- at- <i>hic</i>- all. <i>Uuuuuuuurp</i>.\" With each hiccup and belch, he patted his stomach, as if to reward it for a job well done. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"<i>Hic.</i> Can't eat another bite.\" He belched loudly. \"That'll do, stomach. <i>Hiiic.</i>\" As if spurred on by his praise, his gut, formerly silenced by an overdose of heavy, satisfying food, let out a loud groan. It was finally ready to digest.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nTempleton dropped off into bloated sleep almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke only briefly, when the sun was rising, to woozily roll himself off the top of the table and into hiding underneath it. As soon as he was back in the dark, Templeton was back into full sleep, snoring the day away while his belly attacked his meal. Locked in a deep, dreamless sleep, he was completely oblivious to the comings and goings of humans all around him. By the time he awoke again, darkness had fallen, and he was alone. He yawned widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's time to go back to the pig and spider,\" he said wistfully. \"At least I'll have something to show off.\" He moved to pat what was until recently a massively swollen stomach, his trophy of greed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton was a skinny rat again. In fact, his insides were gnawing with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What</i>!?\" he gasped, and he patted himself all over, as if maybe his glorious bulk was just hiding from him. Did he dream it all? Was he still on Zuckerman's farm? No, he was definitely at the fair. He even still had some frosting on his fur. He licked some of it up experimentally, and his stomach growled its appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" he moaned, and he tried to stand up. He lost his balance and fell. That was when he realized something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot substantially taller, just an inch or so, though that made all the difference to a rat. His body had bulked up to match, though he was painfully thin, just like he'd been before Wilbur had moved into his pen. Surviving on miserable scraps at Zuckerman's, Templeton had never grown to be a particularly large rat, not like the enormous bucks he'd seen patrolling the junkyard. Finally gifted with enough calories to launch an ambitious self-improvement project, his body had apparently funneled every ounce of fat he'd packed on into an overdue growth spurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't enough energy, though, apparently. Templeton's shrunken belly was desperate for a new influx of food. The fair was rich and abundant, covered with the leftovers of a second day of festivities, as if the humans were deliberately trying to indulge him. Wilbur and Charlotte completely forgotten, he licked his lips and rubbed his empty stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for seconds?\"     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Templeton scurried up the side of the table with an agility he'd forgotten he had- and hopefully, would soon forget again. As luck would have it, another pizza party had happened here while he was asleep. Pizza boxes were stacked high, dripping with grease, begging for Templeton to tear them open and devour whatever was inside. He climbed on top of the stack and opened the top box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmpty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fair had never denied him before. His hunger intensified. He shoved the first box aside and looked in the second one. It was empty, too. But he could smell that he was getting closer to his prize. The third box had one half-eaten slice left. Templeton gulped it down in less than a second. And starting with the fourth box-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhole pizzas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a triumphant whoop, Templeton dove into the first course of his second gorge. This time, his body was ready for him, and he swallowed huge chunks of pizza, barely bothering to chew. When the first one was gone, rather than break his rhythm, Templeton chewed straight through the box to the next one, swallowing greasy cardboard along with bread and cheese. His tail disappeared into the pile of pizza boxes as he burrowed downwards, recklessly stuffing his face. And when he'd finally finished the last one, grease dripping out of his mouth and onto his filthy fur, he paused to take stock of how his new body was holding up. <br>\r\n   <br>\r\nHis stomach bulged outwards only slightly, serving only to make him look less painfully skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, he was still ravenously hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I can hold more now, huh?\" he laughed, patting his stomach approvingly. In no time, he was onto his next stop, an overturned bucket of fried chicken, left behind by some charitable human. Then he scampered away, leaving a pile of bones. On one table, he found a tray of biscuits and packets of butter that melted all over his face and chest when he tried to swallow them whole. Some moldy hot dog buns combined with some stale mustard for a particularly pungent taste. He scaled the lemonade stand for a quick drink, then ran over to where he'd seen the melons displayed. Only pieces were left, but he gulped them down easily. And when no more food was immediately apparent, he dove gracefully into a large trash can, and gobbled up every disgusting partially-consumed piece of food that had been tossed in and mashed together over the course of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of it was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton burped when he'd finished, but it was quiet and tame- nothing compared to his gorge of the night before. No matter how much food he ate, his stomach stayed more or less the same size. He swelled up with each new intake, but just as quickly shrank back down. His stomach's base size was growing, but far too slowly for his taste. On the one hand, he liked the idea that his belly had adapted to compensate for his massive appetite. As long as he kept a steady pace, he could eat forever- well, forever to a rat- and never have to stop. On the other hand, however, he'd enjoyed having prominent evidence of his gluttony. Eating for the sake of eating was wonderful, but he missed his fatty belly.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be a way to get you to fatten up,\" he said, rubbing his belly. Well, really, the solution was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he had to do was eat more, and more quickly, than his stomach could digest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton was a true glutton, and the mere thought of out-eating his own stomach was enough to drive him into action. A dumpster was sitting behind the food stands, waiting to take in the surplus garbage from the surrounding area. The fair's maintenance crew clearly hadn't been too active that day, and the dumpster was overflowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, luckily, Templeton was ready to take in surplus garbage from the dumpster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dove into the trash, mouth agape, and swallowed a whole strawberry without bothering to chew. The stack of pizzas was merely a practice run. Nearly everything in the dumpster was edible, or edible enough for Templeton's greed. Like before, he ate straight downwards, digging wildly even as a steady stream of rotten goodies passed through his lips and into his stomach. His only slightly bloated middle disappeared into the mountain of trash, followed by his back legs, and finally, by his slender tail. After a few minutes, the tunnel he'd made collapsed behind him, burying him under a mountain of rotten food waste.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he'd been willing to stop eating for even a second, Templeton would have grinned with delight. Now all he had to do was eat his way back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAided by gravity, Templeton opened his mouth wide and allowed the food to flow into him, like a drain at the bottom of a swimming pool. He still had to guide each greasy, rotten, delectable morsel into his mouth, but he barely had to chew or swallow- he'd consumed so much that his mouth and throat had given up, content to serve as nothing more than a dumpster-to-stomach gateway. As planned, his stomach swelled impressively, and Templeton wasn't sure if the pressure on the inside or the outside of his belly was more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>More</i>, his primitive brain begged as he inhaled pound after pound of trash, barely distinguishing what was edible and what was not. <i>More! MORE!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn observer would have been treated to a curious sight. Here was a dumpster, slowly emptying itself, in the middle of the night. Before the bottom of the dumpster became visible, however, a fat rat's head and shoulders poked out of the mess. And before Templeton could finish swallowing what was in his mouth-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belch was so massive it was painful, and louder than what any human could produce. The flavor was toxic- a product of whatever disgusting concoction had resulted from packing a mountain of garbage into one rat's belly. He tried to keep eating, he really did, but his stomach had already signaled that it was ready for a break, and he was barely able to eat enough more to get himself dug out of the mess. He collapsed onto what was left of the trash pile, the contents of his enormous belly sloshing about inside of him, accompanied by his own stomach's rich groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That- <i>hiiiic</i>- that really hit the spot,\" Templeton slurred. He belched again, so forcefully that his distended stomach lifted off the ground ever-so-slighty before noisily dropping back to the dumpster floor. \"<i>Hic.</i> Can't believe I can eat- <i>hic</i>- so- <i>hiiiic</i>- so much in one go now. My stomach can handle- <i>hiiiic</i>- anything. <i>UUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRP</i>.\" Even as he relished his bloated, bulging state, however, Templeton knew that digestion had already taken hold. He'd have to eat more soon if he didn't want to risk shrinking back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. <i>Urp.</i> What to do,\" he wondered allowed, drumming his fingers on his enormous stomach. \"Should we go on dumpster diving? <i>Hic.</i> Or should we take a breather, and pull together a <i>real</i> gorge?\"    </span></div></div>",

And while his belly was getting large and round, he wanted to test his new size ans see how far he could go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for a real smorgasbord,\" he said as he licked his lips with anticipation, \"I need to make a whole mountain of food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, he heaved his belly up as best as he could and began to work on his mountain of food plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scavenged as much as he could find in the fair and the gluttonous rodent was in great luck. From the ground, he found caramel apples that were half eaten, pieces of popcorn still inside the bags, banana peels with piece of bananas stuck inside, apple cores starting to rot, grapes turning into raisins, and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the tables and the benches, he found pizzas that were half-eaten or just down to the crusts, cakes that were either half-eaten or nothing but crumbs and icing, pie tins with the pie and filling still inside, chicken that were almost to the bones, burgers and hotdogs that were either down to a small fraction or had only a big bite on them, and that was only a fraction of the bounty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his gluttony fueling his anticipation, he went to work. Grabbing everything he can with his claws and moving them as close together as his belly will allow him. The food he found would start as a small pile, but gradually got bigger and taller with every food item he could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just before he could continue his masterpiece, a particular scent had caught his attention. The scent was sugary sweet... and smelled like it was deep fried...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around and saw a food stand with two words that caught his attention: FUNNEL CAKE. Just the mere mention of the snack got his belly to growl in hunger despite it already looking enormous...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way into the stand and found numerous bits of funnel cake all around, as well as a big bag of powdered sugar. He grabbed numerous bits of funnel cake, as well as fresh funnel cake that was left around the stand, and shoved it in the bag of sugar, then dragged it towards his pile outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton had been carrying a large weight on his abdomen and around his shoulder, struggling to make his way back to his mountain of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, this is going to be a great glut for me,\" he said as he heaved himself, \"Just a little further...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his low center of gravity slowing him down, he managed to bring his sugary treasure towards his mountain and began to dump it all onto it, making the mess more appealing for a rat with a large appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon, with all that was said and done, the mountain of food was complete. Scraps and pieces of junk food had formed into a five foot mountain of a rat's feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton slowly and carefully climbed up the pile, making sure his belly wasn't going to cause the pile to break apart. After a few close calls, he made it on top of the pile and licked his lips eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a meal fit for a king,\" he said with pride,\" And I will eat like one tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the chunky rat began munching his way down the mountain, eating every bit of food that he painstakingly gathered, as his belly began to take it all in and pack it away that was noticeably visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery crumb was munched away by Templeton, as his appetite was in control, while his belly did what was told and took in more food, grumbling in agony. But that hardly stopped him. He wanted more... And he was going to get more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway there, his belly was looking larger, almost as if he swallowed a grapefruit. But that size would only increase as he continued to glut like he never glut before. He paused slightly to savor the taste and make a few HICCUPS in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he neared the bottom, his belly was growing wider to accommodate the rest of the food, looking like he swallowed an over-inflated basketball and feeling just as tight. But his gluttony was far from over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he began licking crumbs and powdered sugar off of his fur and his belly, which looked mountainous to him but looked more like a swollen beach ball. He pat it with pride as he demolished the mountain of food, leaving himself in a drunken haze of gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was a &gt;hlp!&lt; night to remember...,\" he slurred, \"A rat can really enjoy &gt;hlp!&lt; the finer moments in life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton rose from his stupor and made his way under the nearest gazebo, resting on a newspaper that was under it. He laid back and let his belly stick up high into the air, as it gurgled and groaned from his glut. He placed his hands as much as he could on his enormous gut, rubbing it gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did well &gt;hlp!&lt;, stomach,\" he cooed, smiling from ear to ear.</span></div></div>",

Sighing in relief, Templeton gently rubbed his enormous gut and slowly fell asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun rose, the fair was open to the public once again, as crowds poured in for the usual activities. And with their fun came food. Lots of food prepared and lost of it being thrown away either in cans, dumpsters, or just tossed all over the fairgrounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from underneath a nearby gazebo, lies the insatiable rat Templeton, resting from his late night glut. Though unbeknownst to him, his belly's mass had been shrinking away after his meal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough most of his belly had digested the meal, it hardly shrank away into nothing, as resulted in him having a prominent paunch, which jiggled slightly. The rest of his body fattened up just as much, as his arms and legs began to look chunky, his figure looked wider, and his face looked chubbier with a double chin forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut during his fattening process also came the increase of his height. His body creaked slightly as he slowly grew taller, inch by inch, as he grew slightly bigger than the newspaper he was resting on. In comparison, he looked slightly bigger than a ferret or a weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the crowds began to disperse as night came. And when the crowds go away, the rat will come out to play...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton slowly woke up from his morning slumber, then began to rise up... and up and up until his head hit the top underlay of the gazebo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his head from the pain, then began to notice his new figure, looking taller and fatter than before. He looked down to see his new furry pot belly, sticking out about an inch from him. He held it and jiggled it slightly, enjoying the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is certainly a big surprise,\" he said with pride as he hoisted his belly and dropped it, watching it jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then made his way out of the gazebo, the hole looking smaller now thanks to his taller and fatter figure. After a slight squeeze, he managed to walk out to see how his new taller perspective had changed. It was strange at first, but he felt good... In fact, he felt really good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis new height made him feel like a whole new rat. Between his new fat figure and his new taller stature, he figured it was worth every moment, no matter how big he became...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is only the beginning,\" he said with confidence while rubbing his belly, \"This rat is going to glut and glut again... and then he's gonna grow and grow again...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although Templeton reckoned he could fit more food into his stomach, which continued to gurgle and bubble beneath him, he was also exhausted. He was bleary-eyed and dizzy from a long night of feasting, and now he felt a little disoriented. Plus, the sun was coming up, and that meant people would be coming back. It was probably in his best interest to let the fair fill up with people again and let them spill their calorie-laden treats for him to munch on that night. He'd have more energy after getting some sleep. He heaved himself with a great struggle yet with great delight as well, dragging himself all the way into the crate where he could sleep it off. It took him about a minute to drag himself all the way to the back and out of sight, and he rolled over onto his back with a great exertion of energy. He stretched and a yawned, and he put his arms lovingly around as much of his gut as he could. He felt his eyelids droop heavily, and soon, he was off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he dreamed of the fair. He dreamed of eating and stuffing and binging and drinking... He dreamed of cramming and slurping and belching and eating again... Oh, if only he could remain with this wonderful fair. Such a beautiful place. He could travel with them. He could \"clean up\" after them. Whatever the humans spilled, he'd make it his life's mission to eat it all up. Give the cleaning people some time off. He'd make a killing. Just to stuff himself silly and then have a nice place to sleep afterwards appealed to him greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he was rudely awakened out of his dreams as he was suddenly flying through the air and landing with a loud gurgle on his back. His stomach rolled over his face, and he was forced to push it back to keep from suffocating. He felt rather dizzy from his recent flight, and he checked himself over to see if he was hurt. He certainly wasn't. His new flab had kept him safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now Wilbur was staring down at him. He looked serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton yawned. What a bore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Templeton, pay attentinon!\" Wilbur ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of monkeyshine is this?\" the rat grumbled, patting his stomach protectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Templeton, Charlotte doesn't have a long time to live! She can't come home with us, and my only wish is that you get her eggsac for me. You're the only one who can reach it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Templeton was a little surprised by the request. Charlotte dying? He knew spiders didn't live long, but goodness... It was all a bit sudden. And the pig wanted to rescue her egg sac? How tediously noble of him. And now he wanted the rat to reach it for him? Well, Templeton wasn't really in the mood for a climb. But to save Charlotte's children... A part of doing this good deed appealed to him. And then he grinned widely as he realized his could use this good deed to his advantage. He yawned and patted his bloated stomach sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...it's old Templeton to the rescue again, is it?\" he asked patronizingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Templeton, hurry up!\" Wilbur wailed, rather thoughtlessly, the rat noted. But then again, the pig was an emotional one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's 'hurry up, Templeton', is it?\" he sneered. \"And just what thanks do I get for all this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilbur looked at a loss. He didn't know what to offer, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton grinned. Time to leverage.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, could you answer that,\u201d said Templeton with a sly grin. It was a rather rewarding blow, especially after Wilbur\u2019s dopey comment about him. Seeing the pig dumbfounded at his retort was almost as rich and filling as all he had glutted on\u2026almost. His belly wobbling as he let out a mirthful giggle, the rat crossed his arms and laid his head down. \u201cWell, I suppose I could get the egg sac for you, if you make me an offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStricken at the rat\u2019s greed, the pig let out a loud s snort which caught Templeton\u2019s attention. Suddenly, and large hoof stomped right beside his body, causing him to slightly recoil in fright, sending his massive gut throbbing and sloshing about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you listen you fat, greedy, despicable rat,\u201d shouted Wilbur with animosity in his eyes, and a tear sliding down his snout. The helpless rat watched him wide eyed over his gut, paws resting on top of it for comfort. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving this place without those eggs, and so help me if you don\u2019t get your blubbery butt up there you\u2019ll never stuff another scrap of food down your throat again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrembling at the pigs rage, the engorged rat tried keeping his blubbery visage still to keep it from sloshing and jiggling about. \u201cW-what are you gunna do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the pig shoved his snout up to the defenseless rodent\u2019s face, with his scowling dagger like eyes piercing any sense of pride the rat once had. \u201cGet\u2026up there\u2026now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Templeton squeaked, \u201cwhatever you say.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Wilbur retracted his fearsome glare, but still stared at Templeton with malicious intent. Not wasting a moment, Templeton tried moving his enormous, over stuffed, over gorged body as quick as he could. The fear he suffered was a little more than his clogged rattie heart could handle; and all thoughts of using this demented swine for his own gain were thrown out the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn\u2019t go at all like I thought it would, thought Templeton. Never in his time of knowing Wilbur did he think he would ever snap like this. He was always the kind compassionate hog who would save part of his breakfast for him, or even let him help himself when Lurvy came by with slops. The terrific, radiant, humbled pig everyone thought him to be. Well, everyone has their dark side at times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the top of the beam and onto the rafters, Templeton was out of breath and collapsed. The sides of his stomach merely melted off the rafter edges as he tried regaining composure. The egg sac and the tiring body of the once nagging spider lay across from him, all the way on the other side of the pen. Having endured the arduous climb, his limbs felt on fire. But his task wasn\u2019t done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHURRY UP,\u201d shouted the malicious swine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPathetically dragging his frame across the rafter, he made his way across. Grunting and gurgling, huffing and puffing, the exercise was proving unbearable on the rat\u2019s body. His stomach began lagging behind, and puffed in and out due to the rat\u2019s laborious breathing. Nothing would please him more than to put all this energy he spent into cramming pastries down his gullet. Finally, reaching the egg sac, he grabbed it with his teeth, tossed it in Wilbur\u2019s direction, and plopped his head onto the hard wooden plank. Panting with exhaustion, Templeton didn\u2019t bother to see if Wilbur picked up the egg sac or not. But judging by the pig not saying a word, the egg sac must\u2019ve been fine. Still though, a thank you would\u2019ve been appreciated for his tremendous toil. But no, not a single word was said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the rumbling motor of a truck and some voices were heard approaching the pen. Templeton\u2019s guess was Zuckerman came to take Wilbur home. The annoying voices of the Arable children soon confirmed it. Next was the shutting of a crate, closing of a truck bed door, and the rumbling motor growing more faint by the second.  As quick as they came, they were gone, not noticing the over gorged rat plopped lazily on the pen rafters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime had quickly passed while Templeton was passed out. The toll of fetching the egg sac proved more than his fat frame could handle. Letting out a prolonged yawn and stretching his limbs, he took notice of his surroundings, sloshing as he shifted his massive body. The pig and his pen were no longer present. His hunch was Zuckerman finally took him back to the farm, leaving good ol Templeton behind. Better so, the rat wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere near him after this incident. So that just left Templeton, a dead Charlotte currently being feasted on by ants, and the food loaded fairway\u2026which he will remain stuck with\u2026forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck here\u2026forever!\u201d The thought struck his mind not as a shock, but as a blessing. Night after night, for who knows how long it\u2019ll last, Templeton would be able to pleasure himself on endless gorging just as he\u2019d done these couple of days. Who needs slops when there were a large variety of goodies at his disposal. The selection caused his mouth to water, and finally free of any choice to come back, he would be able to glut himself more than he had already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach growled for nourishment, and eager to appease it, he crawled down the beam, landing with a loud glorp as his belly bounced, and climbed over the bar of the pen gate, moving toward the fairgrounds, lifting his stomach and jiggling it with pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis will be a night to remember!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waddling and huffing, Templeton spent the entire night stuffing his stomach back to the brim. He felt as though he hadn't eaten in days. He found the remnants of old cheeseburgers, french fries, and onion rings. He downed sour milkshakes and flat watery sodas. He found huge chunks of moldy cheese and rancid lettuce. He chowed down on apple pies and old bags of salty buttery popcorn, followed by a few discarded sandwiches. He ate everything and anything he could get his grubby little paws on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only that selfish pig could see me now...,\" he muttered to himself between handfuls of grub. \"Greedy and gluttonous, eh? If he thinks I was bad before, wait 'til he sees me after a week of this! Or a month of this! Maybe even two months, if I last that long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no secret to the rat that there was simply no way he could keep this up for years. At the rate he was going, he'd die the size of a beaver. But he would die happy. Fat and happy. Fat and happy and unable to move. He'd see to it. His grand finale. He'd go out on a big fat high note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then found a picnic table with a blanket draped over it. Smelling edible goodness upon it, he climbed and struggled and made it all the way to the top. He took a moment to get his breath back, and then he proceeded to gobble up forgotten cookies and neglected slices of cake. Then he spied a large pitcher of lemonade that made his mouth water, and he realized how thirsty he was. He quickly grabbed a couple of straws, jammed them together and stuck them into the pitcher, and he slurped with all his might, draining the pitcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he realized was that he was not drinking lemonade. He wasn't sure what this was, but it gave his frantic mind a nice soothing feeling. He chugged it all, and soon the pitcher was empty, save for the ice. He hiccupped, watching the fair spin around him. He stumbled on his hind legs, not aware of where he was going. He waddled and tripped over his own tail, sending him rolling on his stomach until he sailed clear off the table, and he found himself flying through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed with a squelch in front of something that almost moved him to tears. He staggered upright to stare up at what lay before him \u2013 a seven layer cake, coated in vanilla frosting, and possibly several times his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh\u2026,\u201d he moaned with anticipation. \u201cI\u2019m going to need someone to carry me around at this rate\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an impish grin, Templeton charged at the cake, and he started to stuff it down his throat. He chomped and munched and stuffed and gorged. He swallowed chunks that were as big as his head. He could feel his stomach stretching outwards, all around him. It was becoming larger than his legs. He was reaching madly, eating way too fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust\u2026have\u2026more\u2026 Must\u2026getter\u2026bigger\u2026fatter\u2026MORE!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a very long time, but at last, the cake was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in its place was a very, very, very full rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton moaned with pain and pleasure. \u201cOhhh\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have\u2026 So good\u2026 So much pain\u2026 Must\u2026move\u2026 Must find\u2026more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach was about the size of a basketball, and it felt as heavy as a bowling ball. Templeton struggled and pushed with his front legs to get himself upright again. He managed to lean against a wall, and now he could at least see over his stomach again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should probably be making tracks,\u201d he sighed. \u201cIf I get going now, I might be able to find a new hiding place before sun up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he saw something next to him that he\u2019d overlooked in his single-minded pursuit of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA freezer, and it was full of ice cream sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton held back a belch and stared at it uncertainly. He shifted his weight and found that he could move, albeit incredibly slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he? Shouldn\u2019t he? Was it going too far?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, he realized he\u2019d somehow already eaten two of these things, so he shrugged and kept up, enjoying the pain in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, he\u2019d eaten approximately thirty of those ice cream sandwiches, and his stomach was now not only huge, but chilly as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, and after hefting his bulk he spotted a hot dog vendor. Liking the looks of it, he struggled onto to the freezer, pushing the top shut. Once he was sitting on it, it suddenly sprung open and catapulted him towards the open vault on top of the stand. He went down head-first, and he promptly stuck fast, unable to continue inside. It didn\u2019t matter \u2013 there were plenty of warm hotdogs, just waiting to be feasted upon. He reached down into the pile and began to cram them into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fifteen minutes of this, he heard a sound. It was like metal bending. It WAS metal bending. He let out a yelp as his growing weight finally proved too much for the edges around his hole, and it finally gave, allowing him to fall into what was left of the hotdogs, and he swallowed six whole in one go in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh\u2026,\u201d he groaned. \u201cToo much\u2026 Far too much\u2026 MORE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent an entire hour at that hotdog stand, just binging himself silly on hotdogs. And when those were gone, he grabbed the buns and ate them too. He took the packages of mustard and ketchup and ate those as well. He swilled it all down with a gallon of soda. He let out a huge belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he couldn\u2019t climb out, so he spotted a side door. He rolled against it a few times, and after a minute, his bulk proved just enough to break the lock, and he spilled out on the ground, rounder than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe patted his aching stomach. \u201cOkay\u2026 That\u2019s enough\u2026 Time to find a place to hide\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalancing himself on his spindly hind legs, Templeton waddled forwards, holding up as much of his stomach as he could, trying not to trip over it. He was still loopy from that not-lemonade, so he staggered this way and that, feeling strangely light on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he found a dumpster that looked ideal. Looking at it sleepily, he headed over towards it, scooping up a half-eaten chocolate donut on the way, and he swallowed it whole. He struggled and pushed a few things aside, but at last, he was inside the dumpster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was even more rotten food in here as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton sighed. \u201cForget that stupid pig. I\u2019m in paradise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he stuffed himself with whatever was in reach, and it wasn\u2019t long before he fell asleep, listening to his poor belly struggle to digest its latest onslaught.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was another ice cream container, only, it was of sandwich-type, as well as bowl-type, as well as that-on-a-stick. He climbed on top of it, opened the door on it, and jumped into it. He gobbled it all up, and his belly grew larger. Templeton was fat, lazy, but yet, he was willing to do whatever was necessary to do what he enjoyed. He went to the fair, with a little difficulty-as he was waddling, and saw some burgers, dogs, potato chip bags, fries, and onion rings. Six \"large-orders\" types of each. The rat ate them all, and, got fatter after that. His belly now looked like a large balloon, yet felt as heavy as a small, spheral boulder than usual types. After hiccuping, he noticed an ice cream machine. He drooled, and came to it. He ate the toppings from each container, from m&amp;m to fudge brownie.0 The rat, then pulled the lever of the machine, after putting his mouth close enough to it, leaving it open, then, after grinning from it, he broke the lever, and the ice cream machine filled him up. After it was done, his belly grew larger than ever. Now he was a quivering, fat glob, that looked like a rat equivalent to a character fatter and bigger even than X-Men's Fred Dukes/The Blob, in fact, he was a rat equivalent to a \"fat glob\". Also, as luckily as there was no one around, he, having eaten a lot, had fainted with his belly covering him while he was down on his back.</span></div></div>",

The half already in his belly would get lonely, he reasoned. Besides, he'd come to this fair specifically to gorge with reckless abandon, and he wasn't one to give up on a challenge, <i>especially</i> when it involved eating as much as his stomach could hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some difficulty he turned around and sank his teeth into the pumpkin's exposed flesh, tearing off a large chunk and forcing it down his throat without chewing at all. It landed in his belly with a satisfying <i>plop</i>. Templeton waited for a moment to see if his stomach would burst, and when it didn't, he resumed eating the pumpkin with greater enthusiasm. He moaned with delight as the juicy pumpkin squeezed its fluids down his throat. He swallowed the chewy seeds by the handful. Within the hour, he was flopped down on the inside of an empty pumpkin rind, groaning as he gave his stomach a chance to adjust to the sudden influx of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that was left was the rind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton went to work on devouring the pumpkin rind from the inside out. If anyone had been watching, it would've been an amazing sight. The pumpkin slowly but surely collapsed inward as Templeton ate, tearing off chunk after chunk and shoving them into his greedy mouth. He ate relentlessly, ignoring his enormous stomach's moans of protest, oblivious to the fact that he was ballooning up to nearly the size that the pumpkin had been before it had had the misfortune of encountering him. Sticky pumpkin juices coated his fur. As he ate the last chunk of pumpkin skin, he used his fat to roll himself into a more-or-less upright position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeated as he was where the blue-ribbon pumpkin had been, the vegetable stand almost looked like it had been set up for him. Empty and half-empty baskets of vegetables were scattered all around him. His proud belly swayed to and fro as it churned its ridiculously large contents. One of Templeton's paws was resting on top of his enormous stomach. The other one was clutching the pumpkin's stem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems wrong to- <i>hiiiiiccc</i>- just leave the stem,\" he slurred out loud, followed by another loud and near-painful hiccup. He opened his mouth wide and shoved the large piece of vine inside. His stomach hurt at first at the introduction of something so inflexible, but with help from Templeton's throat and also his paws, the whole thing got shoved inside with a noisy <i>squelch</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pumpkin was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton let out a triumphant belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sto- <i>hiiic</i>- stomach can- <i>hic</i>- can- handle- <i>hiiiicc</i>- 'nything,\" he moaned, barely able to speak since his throat was so exhausted from the gorge. \"Take- urrrrp.\" He was cut off from his gloating by a belch and another hiccup. \"Take that, Wilbur. Stupid- <i>hic</i>- Charlotte.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach gurgled appreciatively, as if offering its own congratulations. Bleary-eyed, Templeton stared down at the word he picked- \"humble.\" Would he even be able to make it back to Wilbur's pen in this state?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, regardless, he couldn't stay here.      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unable to move properly, Templeton did the only thing he knew how to: he rolled. With the help of the momentum built up from his stomach's rhythmic swaying, he used his weight to drag himself off of the table. He landed on the ground with a loud belch and rolled a few feet, ending up on his back with his massive stomach up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pinned under his own gorge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis decision to eat the entire blue-ribbon pumpkin suddenly seemed not so great, as he realized that his stomach was now so heavy he wasn't quite able to move it on his own. When he pushed at it with his paws, it grumbled and pushed back. His belly was exhausted, and it had apparently decided that the middle of the vegetable judging stand was as good a place as any to take nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" he groaned, and he shoved at it some more, to no avail. Well, there was nothing for it- he'd just have to sleep some of the meal off, and hope he wasn't discovered. With his limbs spread out and his belly stretched upwards, Templeton fell into an uneasy sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slept, he felt his stomach attack the enormous meal. His belly groaned and sloshed as it slowly liquified the many large chunks of food Templeton had greedily swallowed whole, without concern for how it would affect his body. Even so, his stomach fought valiantly, and in time, even the pumpkin stem had been melted into a thick mush. His stomach changed shape as it digested, from the impossibly taut bulge of being completely stuffed to layers of soft fat. It shrank in size, too, allowing the food to be absorbed into his body.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rat belched himself awake a few hours later, still in the same spot, and unmolested by humans or other vermin. The sun hadn't risen yet, but he could sense it was close. The word <i>humble</i> was still clutched in his chubby paw. With his smaller, albeit fatter, body, he was sure he'd be able to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, stomach,\" he grunted, and with minimal effort, he rolled over onto his belly, allowing all four legs to touch the ground. He scurried away from the vegetable stand at a slow but comfortable pace, headed straight for Wilbur's pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't mean he couldn't stop for a snack here and there, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third time he stopped, he inhaled a two sodas followed by some leftover fries and two cheeseburgers in large, greedy bites, letting out a loud hiccup when he finished. By that point, he was well aware that his stomach was bulging outwards again and it was slowing him down. He dragged himself a little further towards the pen before his weight forced him to stop for a break. Next to some more food, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just too much,\" he said with a grin and a burp, petting his rounded belly. \"Too much- <i>hic</i>- delicious, grimy food. I just can't let any go to- <i>hiiiiicc</i>- waste.\" He inhaled a hotdog and smacked his lips before letting out a loud belch. He looked around for his next destination, and a slow smile spread across his fat face. Turning himself slightly off-course, he dragged himself over to a large pile where a trashcan had been overturned, and began shoving food into his mouth relentlessly. Pizza, chicken, pickles, candy, hot dogs, hamburgers, condiments, club sandwiches, apples, popcorn, pretzels- all of these remnants disappeared into the rancid melting pot of Templeton's stomach, forcing him to bloat outwards with over-full belches and moans of delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Templeton finished licking the melted ice cream off an ice cream sandwich wrapper, his gluttony was halted by an upsetting sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was finally coming up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word <i>humble</i> was still clutched in Templeton's tail, and he rushed towards the safety of Wilbur's pen, running on his hind legs with his enormous belly dragging him forward. He made it just in time, but he wasn't able to stop his forward momentum. He crashed into the side of the fence, and instinctively, his tiny claws burrowed into the wood to keep himself upright. His stomach churned wildly from all the excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back,\" he slurred. \"<i>Hiiiiicc</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Charlotte and Wilbur both turned to face the drunken voice. There they saw Templeton's head resting on the lowest plank of the fence- his fur disheveled and covered in grime, a dopey smile plastered across his face. He stared right back at them, his senses so dulled from the massive amount of food that all he could make out was a pink blur- Wilbur of course. With some struggling, Templeton hoisted himself up onto the bottom plank of the fence. At this point, his grossly distended belly seeped over the plank like a water balloon and pulled him down face first into the pen. A loud glorping sound echoed throughout the pen as his titanically stuffed belly hit the ground behind him. Charlotte and Wilbur were shocked. Whatever they had been talking about before the rats appearance was completely forgotten about. They glanced at each other in disgust and looked back toward the rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh..... HIC! Ooooo... What a night! He looked up toward the big pink blur that was Wilbur.  \"I think I outdid my-HIC, myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton dug his claws into the dirt in front of him and, with all his might, he managed to slowly drag his bloated body forward.  His rear legs were completely useless, kicking helplessly in a vain attempt to aid him in moving.  His rear end gently bobbed about and jiggled as he inched himself closer to Wilbur.  Both the pig and spider could only watch, curious to see the situation the rat had put himself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching Wilbur's foot, Templeton stopped and attempted to roll over.  He pushed himself up from the ground trying to rotate his body onto its back, but his swollen belly and widened hips were not making this maneuver easy for him.  His arms gave and his head lazily crashed on the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HIC-URP!\"  A particular disgusting burp had snuck its way out with his hiccup.  His eyes widened and he quickly covered his mouth, fearful that his belly was going to eject some food.  His cheeks puffed out holding the burp in place, and the rat, realizing it was just gas, slowly blew the burp from his mouth.  He grinned at himself, amused.  At this point, Templeton's eyes returned to their half closed state for a second or two, before closing entirely.  His tongue lazily hung from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you awake?  What happened to you?\" asked Wilbur, who gave the rat a gentle nudge, causing his belly to make bubbling sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton remained still, about to fall victim to a well deserved food coma.  His tail released the crumpled \"humble\" piece of paper.  Wilbur glanced at it, then at Templeton.  The rats motionless stupor panicked the pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said wake up!\" Wilbur shouted, this time nudging the rat a bit harder, rolling him onto his back with some sickly bubbling sounds coming from his towering, swaying belly.  While on his back, the rats belly came into full view.  It was so swollen that the fur on area around his lower belly was spread thin- Wilbur could see some of the rats pink skin under the fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rats sleepy eyes opened into little slits, \"HIP!  Ooooooo.....  Hey, there Wilbur, whaddya think?\" he moaned while patting his jostling belly.  Wilbur looked down at Templeton's gravy stained fur and crumb encrusted lips and realized the rat had stuffed himself silly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte chimed in, \"I'll tell you what I think!  I think you're a disgusting bloated rat who doesn't know when he's had enough!  Look at you!  You can barely move, barely stay awake....  You keep pushing yourself further and further every time you go out!  One day you're going to take one bite too many and it'll be to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HIC-HILP!  Charlotte....  You talk to mush (hip)\" Templeton slurred.  \"Beshides, I can eat as mush as I want, this right now was (hip) just the....  Ooooooo.... appetizer\", he moaned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Charlotte asked with a raised eyebrow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rr- HILP!  Real- HIP!  Really,\" the rat confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte prodded the swollen, hiccuping mass further, \"So, you're saying you have room for more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton's chest heaved, his hands clutched the sides of his belly, and he blew a silent gassy burp from his lips, \"Absholutely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton grinned at her.  His food drunk mind felt as though it could eat another whole pumpkin if there was one in reach.  But his belly seemed to disagree with him as it constantly churned and bubbled.  It moaned from the massive input of food and quivered in its attempts to hold in one piece.  He had never abused it as much as he did on this last feast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it just so happens Wilbur has a bucket of slop in the corner.  Fern left it there for his breakfast.  I'm sure Wilbur wouldn't mind if you had some first,\" Charlotte said.  She eyed the rats bloated form.  She had always hated Templeton's selfishness, and seeing him like this, at his most selfish, made her want to teach him a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HILP!  Sorry old girl, but this rat is having shum difficulty moving right HIP now,\" Templeton responded, starting to realize he may be in over his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte began grinning, \"nonsense!  We'll have Wilbur pick you up the the tail and drop you in the bucket\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rat squinted at Charlotte, trying to bring her into focus and gauge her seriousness.  She stared down at him.  There little staring contest was interrupted by a massive hiccup.  Templeton rubbed his bloated water balloon of a stomach and laid back thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd show her.  He'd take her up on the challenge and lick the bucket of slop clean...  Or should he?  He felt his trembling belly, swollen to its maximum size.  This might not be a good idea....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They waited a while, listening disgustedly to the burbles, glorps, hiccups and slurps of the glutting rat, anticipating the outcome...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, slowly, ever so slowly, the pail tipped over and out rolled a supremely satisfied but unbelievably overglutted Templeton. Sloshing and glopping, he rolled around and around until coming to rest on his haunches, leaning against Wilbur\u2019s foot. Templeton was utterly punch-drunk and woozy, having crammed yet anther huge meal, fit for a pig, inside his already monstrous stomach, but he absolutely loved it. snickering at his companions\u2019 dumbfounded silence, he jiggled his huge glopping gut: \u201chic HIIILLLP...HICCCCC...\u2019M BAAACKKKK...HICCCC...ohhh everythin\u2019...HILLLPP...wassshh well riipennedd...an\u2019 ROTTEN..HIC HILLLP...ooooooohh...HIC itssss just sshooo RIIIIAACHHH...HIC HIC HIIIILLLP.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte just blinked with utter shock: \u201cTempleton...how...how have you not exploded?

How can you even be CONSCIOUS! You\u2019re truly the biggest glutton there ever was.\u201d Wilbur snorted and stamped his back foot to make his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching, the dumbfounded rat nevertheless giggled at the pig\u2019s incredulity: \u201cHILLLLPP...hehe...UURRRRPPP...muh schtommachhh c\u2019n handlee ANYTHIN...HILLPP\u201d he repeated stupidly: \u201cOoooo...HLLPP, shoo muchh lefttt ta\u2019 GLUT.

He had to find some cover before the humans saw him as they came to eat their measly amount of fair at the fair. None of them could eat as much as Templeton. *hic* His belly rolled forward, sloshing and shuddering as it moved. The force of his hiccups, kept his belly pulling him toward one of the tents. *hic-cup* He groaned at the force of that one, causing his belly to ache a little. He couldn't be full? Nope. It was just the pressure of the pumpkin stem against the side of his belly. Guess it wasn't quite all the way soft or digested. Templeton shook his head and slunk into the tent, listening to the gurgle of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an empty tent, other than several large boxes, which were empty. It appeared to be a storage tent for some of the equipment to set up/take down the fair. Perfect. Templeton slowly rolled himself across the floor. Twice, his feet tried to get ahead of his belly and he rolled onto himself, letting out another loud hiccup. Oops. He squished himself down between two boxes, leaving plenty of room for his blubbery stomach to spread out when he dropped to his butt. He leaned back against the crate, noting he could see the door if anyone came in, but they couldn't see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton patted the top of his extremely round belly. A low rumbling came from the bottom of his stomach. He frowned. A hiccup startled him slightly, but that wasn't it. There was something else. A loud burp pushed out of his mouth. He covered his mouth, fearing that the force would push up some of his meal, but nothing came up. Several softer burps came up after that. He kept his hand there, fearing one small burp would bring up his feast at this point. *hic hic* Two quick hiccups brought up more burps. His belly sloshed back and forth as his hiccups caused the movement to jolt hard. Oo. This didn't feel the best, but it also felt really good. The burps were making his stomach have more room for the next glut. After a few minutes, the hiccups slowed down and he relaxed against the crate, rubbing his stomach in small circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis meal seemed to have settled, finding home in all of his soft curves and finally his stomach went to work. The crazy amount of sounds almost calmed him. Templeton tried to think of everything he'd eaten that night, but he couldn't. His favorite thing had to be the pumpkin. Maybe he'd look for more pumpkins tomorrow. It was a fair; there had to be more pumpkins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Hic*<br>\r\n*HIC-CUP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly agreed with him. More pumpkin and more to drink. He could have really used a drink to settle his stomach a little, but he dared not risk going outside his hiding place until nightfall again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton rested his hands on his belly, feeling the rumbling beneath his hands and drifted to sleep, still hiccuping and burping in his sleep.</span></div></div>",

He was in a bit of a drunken-like stupor as he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the pen was in sight. He was almost there. He needed to get there before people showed up and tried to get him.

I'm the one making the decisions here...\" and he tapped his chin and stared at the pile with greedy eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another moment's hesitation Templeton worked his heavy body forward, heaving his girth before him and sloshing closer to the pile of food.  His mouth began drooling again, leftover peels, a half of a very large sadwich, some varying candy bits and a few more treats, oh what a glorious day for this rat, he thought.  Templeton tried to hasten himself, his feet working to rise above his plump body, but he managed only to trip up his pace and he quickly found himself rolled forward twice, landing rump-side up.  The ball of fur and bulk wobbled and he finally turned himself upright, facing the pile of delectable food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped, at first his belly groaned as he had not realized just how large the pile now was up close...but he grinned slyly and shoved his greedy, greedy face into the mess and began forcing large mouthfuls of the food into his throat and further-engorging his body.  His fat little tail waved wildly as he ate and ate, his rear end and middle growing steadily larger with every swallow, every quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral moments had gone by, and Templeton sat amongst shredded paper and crumbs, a large gray orb.  His head surrounded in his bulk on the very top, almost sunken in, he hiccupped and smiled toothily, patting proudly at whatever sides he could feel, his arms had such trouble reaching much of anything now.  He'd not felt like he could explode before, but Templeton decided that this was as close to what it must feel like as he'd experienced.  An answer of quick relief to that sensation came in a sudden passing of gas.  A shiver down the blubbery rat's body and a mental laugh at his state of being...he had nothing to worry about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hiccupped again and went wide-eyed, the pen!  He still had to get back!  He looked over his bulk, barely seeing much else than himself, and so he oozed forward to get a better view...oh that pen...it looked so much farther away now...how much time had gone by?  He didn't want it to stop, he was so bloated right now, but there was surely more food.  He was THE rat, he could take it down...a hefty belch left his lips and he moaned, rocking in his spot and rolling forward towards the pen.  There'll be more...</span></div></div>",

He landed on his belly, which sloshed inside him. \"Never have I seen such leavings.\" He began to roll and waddle his way over to them. \"Everything well ripened, seasoned with the passage of time and the heat of the day... Oh, it was just rich, my friends, *rich*!\" he said cheerfully. He reached the pig and rolled over onto his back, leaning against the pig's leg and finally resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" the spider scolded. \"It would serve you right if you had an acute attack of indigestion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton held down a belch and started patting whatever he could get to. \"My stomach can handle anything,\" he said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Templeton,\" the pig stated. \"If you weren't so dopey, you'd have noticed that Charlotte has made an egg sac.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton looked lazily up into the corner of the pen. He squinted until he saw the egg sac. He simply belched. \"Hurray for Charlotte,\" he murmured, trying to get to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig wouldn't have it. \"She's going to become a mother! For you information, there are five hundred and fourteen eggs in that peachy little sac.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This *has* been a night,\" Templeton sighed. Deciding all they wanted to do was talk, he rolled back onto his stomach and dragged and rolled himself across the ground towards the crate. Once he got there, he buried himself in the straw and went to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up, it was nighttime again. Templeton moaned. Everyone had gone to sleep. And not surprisingly, he was starved. His stomach had stopped swelling up, and so it was a little easier to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting his girth, Templeton waddled out of the crate and back into the nighttime of the fair. Sure enough, the place was loaded with more food. Even more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly as he could, Templeton dove into the meals that awaited him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit: This whole scene can be depicted here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxO9_CQTElQ&amp;feature=related\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxO9_CQTE...</a></span></div></div>",

The midway was where all the food stands were, right?  He began to drool.  To the midway it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got there, he stopped for a moment and stood looking at the stands.  It was all so good, he couldn't stand it.  He chuckled to himself and sneered, \"If only that stupid spider and dumb pig could see me now!  This rat's day has finally come!  What a feast I see before me!  This fair is a treasure trove of hidden wonders for a rat!  Tonight I make history for all of ratdom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his feet was a rotting banana, which the greedy rat shoved into his mouth even though it was still in the peel.  He saw, not far away, an untouched candy apple drenched in sticky caramel that some careless kid must have dropped. He leaped over to it and within seconds, devoured the whole thing.  Pausing for a second, Templeton decided that he would climb up the stand next to him to get a better view of the area around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was climbing the stand, he smelled something.  He began to drool as he neared the top.  When he had reached the top, he saw what the source of the smell was, and his eyes bulged in disbelief.  Laying in front of him was the biggest watermelon he'd ever seen in his life.  He ran up to it and with his sharp claws, he cut a hole in the melon's rind just large enough for him to fit through.  Diving into the soft, juicy inside of the watermelon, he quickly ate the entire melon, including the rind from the inside out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the entire watermelon was in his belly, Templeton patted it and smiled, slowly bringing himself to his feet.  He was a bit top-heavy as his stomach had gained a bit of size, and he stumbled, falling into the cotton candy maker that was behind the stall.  Templeton rolled around in the machine until he'd eaten every last bit of cotton candy and then slowly climbed out and back onto the stall.  By now, Templeton was feeling quite thirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw at the end of the stand, a pitcher of lemonade.  Templeton crawled up the sign for the stand, and when he was high enough, jumped into the pitcher.  Swimming around in the juice, which was sour from having been left out all day, he toook big gulps, drinking every last drop that he could, and then using his now considerable bulk, tipped the pitcher over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitcher tipped over the side, spilling him in a bag of stale popcorn.  Templeton grinned happily while filling his belly with the salty treats.  Once the bag was empty, he crawled out.  He attempted to stand, but again, his hugely swollen belly sent him lurching forward as he fell head first into a wedge of moldy cheese which was gone in a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton sat up and rubbed his belly grinning happily.  He hiccuped twice, causing him to roll over onto his back, and his engorged belly to slosh back and forth.  He hiccuped again.  He really thought that he ought to be getting back to the pen now, but then...  He couldn't see the sun rising just yet, so maybe he still had time to do some more exploring.  He reached beside him and picked up a monstrous chicken breast lying on the ground next to him.  Stripping all of the meat from the bone, he smiled happily again after eating it, and he patted his belly.  Slowly he stood up, careful not to fall over this time.  He had to do something at any rate...</span></div></div>",

Bits of cookies, hot dogs, pies, and much more artery-clogging goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw a stand that had a triple-layer cake on top of it. He immediately started climbing up. He started eating through it, and within minutes, the entire cake was gone, and he was licking the plate it was on for icing. Then he turned and found a bunch of cupcakes under a glass dome. He removed the dome and started eating the cupcakes as fast as he could, tossing the paper aside as he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw the ice cream stand. It had an ice cream machine in the back. Eagerly, Templeton hauled his body over towards it. Soon he had positioned his mouth under the nozzle of the machine, and he pulled down the handle that opened it. Soon, cold vanilla ice cream was pouring down into his mouth. Grinning happily, he snapped the lever, allowing all the contents of the machine to pour inside him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, Templeton had emptied the ice cream machine. Now he was a quivering blob. His stomach had now stretched out beyond expectations. With his entire night's gluttony packed inside of him, he was now an almost gelatonous mass, rippling everytime his tried to move. Lying on his back, his legs and arms had been absorbed into his body, so he found himself struggling to move for a long time. Finally, however, he was able to roll over onto stomach, the contents inside of it gurgling as he went. He reached out ahead of himself and dragged himself across the table and down on to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in his life, he felt full.</span></div></div>",

So as such it would still grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton rolled towards a funnel cake even though his arms and legs were tucked under his stomachs mass as if his stomach itself were moving him towards it. He opened his mouth as he came close, soon his face was embedded in the sweet fried cake and it made its way into his stomach which stretched larger with it. Then he began to roll towards a whole bushel of bananas perfectly ripe for his mouth to consume. He rolled on top of them forcing them from their skins and one after another into his mouth expanding himself more and more with each one. He hiccuped and smiled, drunk from the feast, but it was not yet done. Secretly a small piece of him wished the feast were done, the sensations running through his stomach were overwhelming, still he would have more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morsel after another as if his stomach sensed more to consume, he made his way over to, and then devoured with his insatiable appetite. He grew and grew with every swallow, an orb pushing in all directions. Hours of this passed, and as the sun began to crack over the horizon it illuminated an unimaginable sight, Templeton loomed over the fair a massive orb of gluttony with a tiny head in the center unable to even see over its own stomach except straight up. He hiccuped again, and suddenly he noticed a crowd had gathered around. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he waddled back to the pen, rubbing and patting his soft burbling belly along the way, the bubbly rat greedily looked about for anymore traces of food. Even after glutting an untold amount of goodies, Templeton didn't want it to end right away. Eating was the passion of his life, and this fair was a dream come true. Sadly, much of what he passed by were hunting grounds which he already cleared. Looking down at his enormous belly, he wore a mirthful smile as he patted it tenderly; sloshing it's rich contents about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've certainly done a lot of work haven't we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach bubbled in reply. Much of his waddle back to the pen consisted of cheerful patting and belly rubs to sooth his, minuscule boredom. Finally, his shifting eyes spotted something he had missed earlier. Like most of the fair, it was yet another trash can sitting there unattended. Though the thought of climbing didn't suit him, it was a chance for a final glut before returning to the pen. So, sticking his belly out, he heartily played it like a drum before going over to a nearby table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if things couldn't get any better, the table was filled with all types of goodies. So without hesitation, Templeton dived into his latest meal. Gathering up all the french fries scattered around the table, he poured around the enormous stack some ketchup. It was about two heads taller than him, and wider than two of his own body. He didn't even bother to grab the fries, but tackled the mountain and did  what he does best. Ketchup messily splattered all over his already sticky and grease/condiment colored fur, which he licked clean off. Mouthfull after mouthfull he felt his feast cram deeper into his awaiting stomach; the pressure building up at his sides, back and middle. Furiously, the rat's bubbling swell groaned in displeasure, but under the will of a voracious rodent, what choice did it have. Dwindling down the stack, he picked up the final batch of fries, and stuffed them in his mouth; both paws literally shoving it down his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips, the rat moved on to a bucket of fried chicken legs, possibly shared by a family; a rich family who didn't seem to care about leaving it seemingly untouched. <i>Oh well, more for me</i>, thought the rat. Dumping the bucket over, he began to rip meat from bone, then tossing what was left over aside. This went on for a good 15 minutes until he came to the last chicken breast. Hiccuping loudly, he rested the breast on his obscenely bloated belly while he ate. Groaning fiercely, the rat didn't care for it's complaints, only that it had to hold more. With how incredibly packed it felt from the inside, he had more than reached his capacity. But still he ate on, going around physical boundaries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finishing  his feast, the over gorged rat, plopped his back on the table. Running his paws through his furry bulk, he squeezed at it; enjoying every inch. \"That'll do stomach, Hic, that'll do.\" Overwhelmed by how much he had eaten, his stomach sloshed on top of him, allowing him to softly nuzzle it, along with licking some of the flavors that splashed on it. Never in his life had he seen his furry coat so filthy, and yet, so abundant; a true symbol of  his gluttony, and certainly a trophy to bring back to the farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it struck him. \"The trash can.\" He had forgotten his whole reason for climbing up the table. Rumbling so ferociously his own body trembled, Templeton's belly knew what the rat was thinking. \"Be quiet. This was the whole reason we climbed up here. You're my stomach and you stop when I say you stop!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging himself over the edge, his eyes sparkled as he gazed over what was inside. If the table was a feast, this was that multiplied by 3. It must have all belonged to rich people, almost all of what was inside wasn't even touched. Corn dogs, popcorn, soda, fries, ribs, all of it seemingly unfinished. Unable to wait any longer, he dropped down, hitting the surface with a massive squelch, sending ripples throughout his body. Having landed directly on his middle, the rat grunted in pain for a bit. Too much of his undigested materials crashed into the more smaller organs of the body. But he allowed it to pass him by, as he stuffed himself further; getting absolutely more fatter, and more delighted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passed, and moans could be heard (if there was other life at the fair) coming directly from the trash can. An hour straight of nothing but over eating had certainly done a number on Templeton. His stomach was so incredibly over satiated, it touched the edge of the trash. Not for one second did it cease burbling and gurgling, trying at any rate to free up space, only for it's master to put it through more torment; or pleasure. And after all this, Templeton still ate the little that remained, but slowly of course. Having enjoyed such a heavy meal, the rat felt drowsy. Too drowsy to finish the remaining piece of funnel cake, or even to move around. Yawning and creasing a sloppy smile over his chubby face, he rubbed a single paw over the wide expanse of his own body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooohh, I look forward to such gluttonous abandon the next time we come. My stomach can handle anything.\" At this he lazily dropped his paw three times, sending undulating waves about and sloshing it mightily, Without a second thought, he stuffed what remained of the funnel cake down his throat, and smiled widely. The sugary treat pleasurably sliding down his large throat and joining the entire colony of food inside his ungodly visage. Resting both paws to his soft stomach, massaging it tenderly, he looked up. It was still quite dark out, and, as insane as it was, he thought about further eating. Now, he was unbelievably full, and would love nothing more than to finally rest with the amazing achievement that was his bulky burbling swell. But his last words gave him some inspiration to continue. On the other paw, he was quite tired, and the thought of tossing over the trash can didn't quite please him. So, he closed his eyes. Thinking about the decision he should make. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Comfortably dozing off, Templeton enjoyed the most peaceful sleep he ever had in his rattie life. He dreamt of how he started the whole experience, from the moment he left the pen. Eyes shut, his tiny footpaws scampered around, and his mouth licked up the imaginary food. It was such a pleasant dream, one which brought out mirthful giggles, which bounced his large belly around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he was awakened by a loud bang. Looking up, he noticed the sun had came up long ago, and he heard the voice of humans moving around. Templeton began to panic. Though his stomach had digested most of his nights gluttony, it had actually gained in size from digesting most of it\u2019s contents into fat. Though the softness would\u2019ve pleased him under different circumstances, he was too frightened to think of an escape attempt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuggh, look at all this garbage,\u201d spoke a male voice, \u201cthese country folk never clean up after themselves do they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuit complainin\u2019 and do your job,\u201d spoke another man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah, sorry ma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton\u2019s grew so frightened he was able to hear his heart beat, which caused him to clutch his plush chest in an attempt to make it stop. As if it couldn\u2019t of gotten worse, his stomach began groaning in hunger, which caused him to slap it. \u201cSsshh, they\u2019ll hear you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, hey Chuck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do with the empty trash cans?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no,\u201d panicked Templeton, \u201cwhat\u2019re they going to do to me?\u201d Terrible thoughts rampaged through his mind like a hornets nest. Nobody liked rats, especially ones as big as himself (which would be a first). He\u2019d probably be, stepped on, or kicked in the face, or crushed or bruised, or lacerated or scared or biffed. But more important, all he had worked for the past nights would go to waste. So, he patted his stomach for what might be the last time, and began to sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, if there\u2019s nothing in them just dump what garbage you find in them. No point in emptying what\u2019s already empty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as he looked up, Templeton say a large bag opening up like the mouth of a frightening beast, only a blessing had happened. Before he could comprehend what was going on, he was buried (and nearly crushed) by a ton of smelly, rotten, sour food and drinks. It was so cramped, that the minute he noticed what had fallen on top of him, he ate for breathing room. Moldy cheese, banana peels, rotten apples, peanuts, and sour butter dripping off half nibbled corn cobs, were devoured silently but quickly, until he had just enough room to feel comfortable and see the sky from under the papers, wrappers, and bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we take the trash can\u2019s out of here? You know, replace them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, leave em, the crowds are gunna use them right away anyways. See, here they come now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill rather nervous, Templeton remained hidden under the trash. Fortune had favor his bold journey of feasting on this trash rather than go back to the pen last night, and who knows, perhaps this would be a good thing. And boy it was indeed. As time passed, more people gathered, and as more people gathered, they were lured by the aromas of food, and after consuming said food (or consuming half of it), they would throw it away. Which needless to say, made Templeton one big fat happy rat. Family after family would come to his part of the fair. The rich families, who would throw away food in excess and not care about how much they would spend, which gave Templeton lots to gorge on while he stayed hidden. Corn dog after hot dog after burger after corn cob after pop corn bag after sloppy joe after soda pop after funnel cake, whatever was thrown away, under the wrappers, Templeton plucked up and feasted on it merrily. It was a never ending supply of food being hurled away without any regard of being wasteful. But hey, if it went to feeding this rat, it went to a good cause, Templeton thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the rat never gave the trash can time to get full, nobody ever came to empty it. Hour after hour continued to pass, and Templeton went on glutting; resting a certain intervals, but never allowing the trash to become full. It was a risky and yet glorious game, which the rat considered himself a pro at. Needless to say, he grew incredibly fatter as time passed on, with his stomach uncomfortably squeezing against the trash can edges. But it didn\u2019t stop him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead he gave it a few congratulatory pats, \u201cHic-this fair is rat heaven. Hic-I don\u2019t know how long this\u2019ll last but I don\u2019t want to stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling loudly, like a lion, his stomach sent ripples throughout his body. Squeezing a large mound of his bulk, Templeton merely stuffed his face with another chunk of cake to spite it. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it, too bad. I\u2019m-Hic-enjoying myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs sunset came, Templeton busied himself on two barely nibbled on apples, while listening to the festivities outside. He had heard all kinds of things from these humans. Gossip, fights, merriment, laughter, and even challenges such as eating contests. At this he scoffed. \u201cI\u2019d wipe the floor with ten of you humans combined.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d shouted a loud voice. \u201cIt is my pleasure to announce, Zukerman\u2019s famous pig!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud cheering, and at this Templeton nearly dropped the apples and perked up his ears. The loud voice spoke about Wilbur\u2019s ordeal and the miracle that happened at the farm. The a song was sung, and a medal was awarded. The fairground was alive with cheering and shouting, which really annoyed Templeton, but nothing more than all the glorifying Wilbur and Charlotte got. Never once was everyone\u2019s favorite rat included in the glorifying. No, thank you Templeton for fetching words, which without you Charlotte would never have her words, and the junk yard a few miles away was more than enough to keep you alive until another pig came to the farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton scoffed, and then giggled. It was all a big joke, but not as big as his titanic body. This whole fair experience was more rewarding than a thousand medals, and Templeton would wear it (or carry it) with pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight had finally come, and the crowds had ceased. Finishing off what remained in the trash, Templeton rocked it back and forth, until it was finally knocked over, and he struggled to pull himself out. Having been scrunched up for so long, he didn\u2019t realize how big he had gotten until he used some left over butter to rub himself out. The farther he reached the edge, the more impressed he was with his growth. Even at the edge he could still feel his waist touching the rim. It was incredible, ungodly. The massive amount of food he had eaten throughout the day, from hours and hours of eating just until nightfall. Templeton had grown (to his knowledge) as large as any blue ribbon winning pig. Or maybe as big as a dog; an incredibly obese dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning and moaning, Templeton\u2019s limbs were too numb to crawl just yet. His tail was just like a little piece of string attached to his enormous rump. His back as soft and plushy as a pillow. And his belly, too massively swollen for words too describe. Coming out of the trash can certainly allowed it to flow, and caused Templeton to sigh in euphoric pleasure; like unbuttoning after a huge meal. Stroking his massive amount of sloshing blubber and fur, his face scrunched up against the dirt floor, he peeked at the sight before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo content to drool over it, he estimated that there was more food now than the night before. But should he really eat more, after what he thought was a 14 hour binge? Rolling over on his back, his gurgling, lard filled stomach rolled over him in pleasing-undulating waves. Not once did he drop his smile, and not once did he regret having eaten so much. Instead he played with his corpulent mass, tossing it about and rolling around. Having such a plentiful amount of body also slightly increased his height, which now enabled him to knock over trash cans with his sheer weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chubby face, sunken into most of his body, erupted in a large grin as his body merrily jiggled and bounced around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was just lunch,\u201d said the enormous rat, \u201cTime for dinner.\u201d </span></div></div>",

And now it was time. 'Screw the Pig,' He thought, and his stomach angrily growled an agreement, and this thought was quickly followed by another,'It's time for Templeton to glot.'<br>\r\nAnd so without further contemplation, both Wilbur and Charlotte were abandoned to the nights promise of a glorious feast.<br>\r\nTempleton found half of a hotdog, and shoved down his waiting gullet, and then he spotted the first stop on his wild gorging frenzy.<br>\r\nLying on the ground were a few half-eaten pretzels, as well as about thirty-eight strawberries, two bananas, four pears, and three apples, all ripe and just waiting for a certain ratty someone to gobble them down.<br>\r\nLurching forward, Templeton sat down in the middle of the feast.<br>\r\nGreedy claws grabbed and dragged a pear closer to him, while his tail, almost with a mind of it's own, snaked around the stem of a strawberry. Templeton took a chunk out of the pear, revelling in the sweet juices it provided, and then swallowed it greedily, already shoving more pear in his face. That, too quickly vanished, and Templeton's tail snaked forward, to shove the whole strawberry into his mouth, which was gasping for air. This cycle continued for a while, untill Templeton had eaten all of the pears and apples, and half of the strawberries. Then, hind legs sliding a bit wider, to accomidate for his growing girth, Templeton slid as many of the strawberries as he could in his maw with one arm, while the other shoved them down his gullet. Berries gone, Templeton laboriously dragged his hiccuping mass to the pretzels, decimating them three at a time, each claw clutching one, and his tail wielded the third. Six pretzels later, the enormous rat collapsed on his bulge, heaving belly sloshing indignantly.<br>\r\nFood drunk, Templeton mistook this for something else, and slapped his gargantuous gut mightily,<br>\r\n\"HILP! good i-HILP!-dea. let's UUUURRRP!! more.\"<br>\r\nThe woozy rat struggled to stand upright, but his overhanging belly pulled him back down, falling dirctly on the tiny bunch that consisted of two and a half-eaten bananas.<br>\r\nthey flew out of their peels, except for the half-one, which simply smeared on his mighty tummy.<br>\r\nSwiftly, Templeton rolled onto his back, pushing away the rolling mass that threatened to stifle him. He only had one chance to make this, and already his vision was fuzzy.<br>\r\nthe bananas flew to earth, and seemed to hurtle themselves into his awaiting gullet. The first got stuck halfway through, but the other flew down, straight into his heaving gut.<br>\r\nStruggling, Templeton rolled back onto his expansive stomach, nd began to massage it soothingly, feeling the chunks of his feast that he hadn't bothered to chew, letting out rich belches and an increasing number of hiccups. Dazed, Templeton could actually feel the massive gorge digesting, covering him in flab.<br>\r\nhalf an hour later, enough paunch had collected on his back and rear that he could pull himself up and waddle on, exploring his growing self. his legs had plumped up enough that he could carry his still sloshing belly, which carried most of the buttery-soft fat, and his arms had swelled equally. A second chin had formed, and the belching rat's doughy, once-slender tail, now three-times as thick, swayed to and fro, snagging goodies he himself hadn't seen.<br>\r\nFinally, the fat rat came to a halt, his almost-bowling ball belly bouncing wildly.<br>\r\nTempleton stared up at the table for a moment, before trying to climb it.<br>\r\nchubby claws dug fiercly into the wood, as his weight gave him leverage to claw painstakingly upward.<br>\r\nmany minutes later, Templeton wound up on the table, breathing laboriously.<br>\r\nThen a delectable scent floated towards him, and he stared, momentarily in awe at the feast that spread out before him, dwarfing his previous 'snack' greatly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Apparently a birthday party had ended early because there was a huge chocolate cake spread out across the table, along with half-melted ice cream, soda pop, potato chips and egg salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh,\" Templeton grinned, rubbing his swell with anticipation. \"It's somebody's birthday alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he dove in, Kamikaze style, his mouth wide open and his teeth bared. He landed in the cake face first, covering himself in the icing. He munched and slurped messily and loudly, unable to contain his joy at the euphoria of sugar and starch that he was consuming. He stopped for a moment and looked around, considering something, and then he grinned when he had an idea. He got up, waddled over to an ice cream container and dumped the half-melted contents all over the cake. He did the same with the other two ice cream containers, followed by the chips and egg salad, until he had one great big rancid concoction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my best ideas when I'm hungry,\" he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he dove back in, slurping and munching and crunching and literally swimming. \"A fair is a verrrrrrritable smorgasbord - orgasbord - orgasbord! Now I shall stuff my gut!\" he sang between bites. \"All this food that the folks have left shall go inside - make me wide - let them slide - down my throat as my mouth shuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he had nearly demolished the entire thing, and he was covered in ice cream and icing. He cleaned himself off with a bottle of soda, and then down a few others himself, catapulting his stomach outwards even further. Content to have made short work of the table, he heaved himself over the edge of the table, where he landed on not one - not two - but three bananas, causing all three to burst free of their respective peels and send them rocketing into the air. He leaned back, opened his mouth, and allowed all three to slide down his throat and into his stomach. His stomach stretched even wider, pushing further ahead to make room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton leaned back, looking at the massive fuzzy balloon that lay before him, giving him a rather heavy feeling. He let out a huge belch and patted it feverishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Birthday cake and melted ice cream. Bananas, chips and...probably something else soon,\" he sang. He heaved himself to his hind legs and forged onwards, trying to navigate with his new-found gravity. He staggered on towards another picnic table, and with surprising grace, he bounded up to the top and found even more food, which he sang about as he stumbled along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apple pies, and double-Decker sandwiches! Jumbo hotdogs, buttered popcorn, candy, and lots of super-fatt'ning food that can make me rounder still!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate all this and then some, until the table was completely bare. He staggered on ahead, and after looking over each edge of the table for something safe to land on, he was satisfied to find a huge spilled bag of cookies. Despite now having a stomach the size of a watermelon, he did a graceful swan dive into the bag, which he devoured in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhhh...,\" he moaned. \"Sooooooooooooooooooooooo... <i>Goooooooooooooooood</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a huge belch, he staggered upwards onto his hind legs, leaning back against the table, looking at the huge globe in front of him. He grinned at how far ahead it was stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can...handle...anything...,\" he panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a look around, he was pleased to spy a stall that read \"DOUGHNUTS\". Licking his lips, he made a run for it, stumbling and tripping a bit, but he made it in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went around to the back and found the supply: chocolate iced, glazed, sprinkles, custard filled, jelly filled, creme filled...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for dessert,\" he snarled, getting a determined glint in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he dove straight in, grabbing tray after tray of doughnuts, stuffing them all into his mouth. He got covered in icing all over again, but he didn't care. He'd just lick it all off later on. \"More...,\" he whined, grabbing his tenth tray. \"Gotta have more... Getting bigger.... SO full... So heavy.... Stuff.... Stuff... STUFF!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd an hour later, he was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty trays demolished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a rat the size of a beach ball sat in the middle of it, leaning against the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton gasped for breath. \"Can't...move...,\" he moaned. \"Can't...breathe... I think...I'll just...HILP! ...stay here... Have a li'l...nappy-nap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he saw something that scared him - morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people would be coming soon! He couldn't stay here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the protests from his gurgling stomach, Templeton managed to stagger upright. Most of his feast had been digested by now, coating him in a fresh layer of flab. Hiccuping and belching and moaning, the huge rat managed to waddle out of the stall and off to look for a place to hide.</span></div></div>",

The errand that had brought him to the fair in the first place had been pushed fully out of his mind, replaced with dreams of gorging himself until he burst. For now, though, he would retreat and recuperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doughnut stand was close to the back of the midway, and Templeton saw- or smelled, rather- a dumpster nearby. He stumbled over towards it, clutching his stomach to stop it from tripping him up. The rat had climbed into many dumpsters in his day, and he scaled this one with ease- well, after his bulk dragged him back to the ground on his first two tries. On the third climb, he pulled himself over the top, and with a sigh of triumph, he dove into the pile of garbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swarm of flies quickly dispersed as the bulging, furry stranger went tumbling into the mound of rotting food. Once his stomach had stopped wailing in protest at the rough treatment, Templeton poked his head out from under the pile. He suddenly realized-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was neck deep in another glorious meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan had been to sleep and get ready to go out again at night, but since he'd already digested most of his previous gorge, well, it wasn't like he didn't have room for more. And the delectable mix of tastes and smells inside the dumpster was a whole world different than the leftovers he'd eaten outside. As he contemplated resuming the feast, his belly let out a timid gurgle of protest, as if begging him to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Templeton declared simply, coming to his decision. He reached for the nearest piece of food- a half-eaten, soggy hot dog- and shoved it down his throat whole, as if to punish his stomach for daring to complain at all. Stretching his stubby arms in all directions, he began shoveling edibles towards himself, his greedy mouth agape and waiting to welcome them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, the rat had settled into a comfortable rhythm, establishing a steady flow of food down his throat and into his belly. He gorged so quickly and so efficiently that not even the flies could escape his him, and he giggled whenever he felt them buzzing around helplessly in his gut. Each new bite had a new and exciting flavor, but it didn't matter if it was good or bad. Templeton was a true glutton, and <i>what</i> he was eating didn't matter nearly as much as the very act of eating itself. He swallowed as much as he could reach, groaning with excitement as his stomach filled up and bulged outwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he paused for a break, he had put a solid dent in the pile of garbage, and the flies were too afraid to even come near him. He lounged lazily, an air of satisfaction about him, leaning against some as-yet uneaten treats. His enormous, aching belly moaned gratefully at the reprieve, and forced out an enormous belch. The taste was thoroughly rancid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever's in there isn't- <i>uurrrrp</i>- mixing well,\" he said with a grin, and his miserable stomach bobbed its agreement, gurgling with indigestion. Templeton reached down and gave it an affectionate pat. The way his stomach struggled against the onslaught of food was insanely pleasurable. It could have held more, sure, but for now, he was content to relax and enjoy the rewards of his long night of gorging himself. He closed his eyes and fell asleep with a smile on his fat face.         </span></div></div>",

He collapsed from exhaustion the moment he made it. The trek hadn't been long, but the effort made his stomach groan with renewed hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little snack before bedtime can't hurt,\" he mumbled to himself, pushing a paw into his vast flab. He squinted upwards and sniffed the air to determine what food was available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd ended up at a stall that served roasted ears of corn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton dragged himself over to where the food was stashed. He grabbed the nearest ear, rested it on his fat belly, and nibbled the kernels off one by one. They were rich in flavor, roasted and buttery. In an instant, he was finished, and he reached for another. Three more ears of corn later, and he was still painfully unsatisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not enough,\" he groaned. The tiny bites of corn were too small, and they disappeared into his body so rapidly that he could barely feel himself eating at all. He was resigned to seeking out his edibles elsewhere when he got a wonderful idea. He lifted a third ear of corn and pulled it close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Instead of eating them bit by bit,\" he crowed, \"I can just swallow them whole! Bottoms up!\" He tilted the ear upwards and opened his mouth wide. Lowering the tip of the full ear of corn into his mouth, he began to swallow, forcing his throat to expand to accomodate it. Templeton moaned with strain and pleasure as he forced the food into his body, his chubby arms pushing as his throat pulled. His stomach bulged outwards to impossible dimensions as the corn dropped into his stomach with a noisy <i>plop</i>, signaling his triumph over his over-large meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton let out a loud hiccup, grunted in satisfaction, and grabbed another. The corn was smooth and buttery, and it slipped down his throat with increasing ease as he settled into a good rhythm. His stomach stretched generously, quivering around the large, oddly-shaped load. Occasionally, an ear of corn would shift, causing part of his stomach to bulge outward strangely, but his belly always got everything back into a place that was comfortable.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he clutched the very last ear of corn, Templeton paused to give his stomach a pat. It responded by groaning miserably, stretched to the limit and weighed down by an onslaught of far too much big, solid food. Templeton could feel every single heavy ear of corn pressing against his insides, struggling to burst free. This time, it wasn't about gorging himself on mouthful after mouthful of delicious rotten food. This time, he was forcing his body to stretch itself to the limit, all for the pleasure of forcing his throat and stomach to do the impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more,\" he rasped, and he lifted the ear high above his waiting mouth. He swallowed it like he'd swallowed the others, forcing it down with his hands, guiding the massive lump to its place at the peak of a mountain of corn that had settled in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton licked his lips and belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better- <i>uuuurp</i>- find a place to sleep,\" he moaned, massaging his enormous gorge with both paws. Despite his plan to only eat a snack before going to bed, he was nearly as large as he'd been before, and just as heavy. With a pained groan, he dragged himself under one of the tables and crawled into an empty box to hide. As he went, the ears of corn inside of him shifted and bumped against each other, causing his belly to shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fell asleep with his face and paws resting on his swollen gut.     </span></div></div>",

She was very skinny, so much in fact that her ribs jutted from below her skin her head was bowed in fright, and her bony tail was clutched in her claws.in an instant, she was on her knees, head bowed, as she stammered nervously,<br>\r\n\u201cP-please\u2026D-don\u2019t make it hurt. J-just q-quick\u201d <br>\r\nQuickly, her legs folded below her, and she practically kissed the ground before him, arms and claws coming to lie on the ground not far from him.<br>\r\nTempleton stood there for a moment not sure what to do.<br>\r\nHis stomach growled angrily, the very sight of her making him feel like he was starving.<br>\r\nShe was tiny, half the size Templeton had been before the fair, but her fur, her fur was lovely. It was like icing on a cupcake, long and thick, and it had a nice sheen.<br>\r\nShe was still trying to bury her face into the dirt when Templeton started to shake and wobble with mirth.<br>\r\nHe let out a sort series of laughs, interrupted thoroughly with hiccups and rich belches. Finally his outburst came to a halt, although his madly jiggling stomach was still quite active.<br>\r\nFinally, once he had released enough gases to speak, he grunted,<br>\r\n\u201cToo bony. Besides, there\u2019s too much food around here to even share\u201d<br>\r\nNervously, the She-rat laughed, and then unsteadily climbed to her feet. She fell, and Templeton watched, uncertain if he should help her.<br>\r\nHe had never had much luck with females.<br>\r\nSuddenly, something in Templeton\u2019s gut shifted, and he was irrevocably pulled forward. Tiny feet not being sufficient to move him anymore, Templeton rolled twice, and came to a halt beside her. He grabbed her tiny claw, and gently pulled her up to stand, not wanting to hurt her because she was so fragile. Her delicate claws were lost in his flab.<br>\r\n\u201cNames Templeton\u201d he grunted, <br>\r\n\u201cCyra\u201d she replied, and then looked him in the eyes for the first time.<br>\r\nEvery other She-rat Templeton had met had had yellow eyes. Even his mother\u2019s eyes were golden. But yellow was gaudy, and overly much. <br>\r\nCyra\u2019s eyes were beautiful. Like her, they weren\u2019t too much; they were both vivid and stunning, alluring and bewitching, classy and comely, dazzling and delightful, delicate and divine, elegant and enticing, graceful and grand, ravishing and refined, stunning and sublime.<br>\r\nThey were silver.<br>\r\nThen she looked away, and at his massive gut. Then away again, shyly.<br>\r\nTempleton understood.<br>\r\nCarefully, he grabbed her claws again, and pulled them close.<br>\r\nShe followed, and spread her arms wide, massaging his innards.<br>\r\nTempleton moaned with pleasure, as she aided his titanic tummy digest what was left of his gorge. The night was theirs.<br>\r\n~<br>\r\nQuite some time later, they wandered out again, in search of food for Templeton.<br>\r\nCyra had already explained that she had a condition, that if she ate more than enough to keep her alive, she would helplessly regurgitate it.<br>\r\nAt first, Templeton insisted that he could make it by himself, but eventually he broke down, letting her simply roll him along, handing him goodies she found. He was surprised at her strength. Nibbling on a pretzel,  he smiled in bliss.<br>\r\nThe real trouble came when they found a table.<br>\r\nThey had a brief light argument, Templeton wanted to get up the table himself, so he could gorge with the full knowledge of what else there was. Cyra countered that it would be more preservative of his calories if he simply let her help him, handing the food down the table.<br>\r\nSo\u2026\u2026.</span></div></div>",

It groaned wearily in protest of his weight. Then suddenly, Cyra was below him, pushing him higher, onto the wooden board. <br>\r\nThe struggle repeated, this time onto the top of the table. Finally, breathing laboriously, Templeton lay on his back, resting from the exhaustive expense of energy. Quickly, Cyra was kneeling beside him, pushing him up to his feet.<br>\r\n\"Told you\" she muttered, but Templeton wasn't listening.<br>\r\nThere were two small tables pulled together, each loaded with food.<br>\r\nOn the first table, there was a tub of mashed potatoes, a stack of corn on the cobs, a big pan of cornbread, a bucket of fried chicken, a bigger pan of Macaroni and cheese, and a few Pizzas.<br>\r\nThe second table had a bunch of burritos, a bucket of chips with a side of cheese, and what appeared to be a large pitcher of lemonade.<br>\r\nUnable to resist, Templeton rolled over to the tub of potatoes, and reached in with his paws, grabbing chunk after chunk of the still-steaming mess, and shoving them down his gullet. It wasn't until he could no longer reach more of the gooey mess that he considered that Cyra was there too. Turning,it  he looked at her, white potatoes smeared all over his muzzle and much of his stomach.<br>\r\nAbsently nibbling on a kernel of corn, she smiled at him, speaking simply in an awed tone,<br>\r\n\"You're amazing\"<br>\r\nSmiling toothily, Templeton realized for the first time that there was something wrapped around his thick tail.<br>\r\nNot that he could reach it, but it just felt uncomfortable.<br>\r\nSuddenly, she was there, unwrapping the paper from his pudgy tail.<br>\r\n\"Humble\" she read aloud.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Templeton remembered, the word! He was supposed to bring back a word. Well, this was a 'perfect' turn of events. He should turn back, and get it back there himself, but then again, he was here, surrounded by this food, he could just send Cyra to do it.<br>\r\n\"Mind giving that to -HILP!-someone?\" he asked, slurring his speech slightly.<br>\r\nshe nodded<br>\r\n\"Go to the -HIC!-pig pen's. HIs -HILP!-name is Wilbur\" <br>\r\nShe took another step towards him, and smiled, \"Need some help?\" she pushed him up, and into the half empty tub. Hiccuping with glee, Templeton Thanked her in between guzzling as much Potatoes as possible.<br>\r\nThen she was gone.<br>\r\nTempleton glutted in relative silence for a while, amind the gurgling sloshes of his tummy as it digested the meal.Then suddenly, there was no more potatoes. No more food in the tub.<br>\r\nHeaving, Templeton pushed himself up, onto his stomach.<br>\r\nhe was able to see over the lip of it, and grabbed the edge with his paws.The distended stomach groaned, and sloshed indignantly, but Templeton quickly hushed it,<br>\r\n\"Quiet. I'm-HILP!-getting us more food.\"<br>\r\nthen he strained mightily, and plopped some of his gut out of the tub. another heave got him half out of the tub, and with a rich belch, he slid onto the table. hiccuping, his tail managed to wield a corn, and his paws grasping a second. Templeton devoured them, enjoying the sour flavor of the rancid butter, and when he finished the cob of one, he barely hesitated to stuff the empty cob into his far-from-empty tummy. In this manner, he had seconds. and thirds, and fourths, and fifths.<br>\r\nit wasn't until ten ears of corn filled his round belly that Templeton noticed an odd feeling in it. It felt unusually taunt. shrugging off the feeling, Templeton managed to swivel his gut towards the cornbread. Grabbing chunks and shoving them in his maw. Ignoring the increasing pain he felt in his belly as he shoved more and more down, Templeton glutted himself on the cornbread until it was gone.<br>\r\nThen he rubbed his sore distended mass tenderly, not sure he could swallow another bite. He felt sad, that his stomach had found it's limit, but he also felt a strange sense of peace, and he closed his eyes, a weary smile resting on his lips. <br>\r\nHe rested.<br>\r\nSomething touched his swolled middle, and Templeton jerked, exclaiming with the pain it caused him. It seemed his food had expanded in his gut, and now he seemed ready to burst. It was only Cyra there, and she quickly flicked away her tail, which had been resting on his distending stomach. <br>\r\n\"Sorry\" she placidly stated, \"I gave that strip to a Spider named Charlotte, are you okay?\"<br>\r\nTempleton grunted, and then belched richly,<br>\r\n\"Sorry. uuughhhhh, feels like-HIC-HIC-HILP!!-m'gonna egsplode.\"<br>\r\nThe release of gas dislodged some of the food he had eaten, and his belly bounced up and down wildly.  <br>\r\nImpulsively, he patted it, and the touch felt good, like it was soothing his aching gut.<br>\r\nsoon, bony claws massaged his tummy, and he giggled and beclhed richly with delight as he could literally feel his body changing the stuffed contents of his stomach into buttery blubber. Content, Templeton rested once more.<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, hunger gnawed at the bloated rat's titanic tummy. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Templeton looked away, not wanting to watch himself being eaten alive. Oh, what a horrible way to die! Templeton didn't want it to end this way. He wanted to live longer. He had so many goals in life he wanted to accomplish. He wanted to gorge on more food than what he could ever imagine. And here was this obese cat, coming up to him, about to end it all.<br>\r\nTempleton was too busy thinking about life and food that he didn't notice that the cat wasn't eating him. When he snapped out of his thoughts, he noticed an enormous turkey in front of him that he hadn't noticed before in his fear, and behind that, the even larger feline that had nearly ended his life, gorging herself on the delectable turkey, not paying much attention to Templeton. Templeton wasn't sure if the cat was waiting for him to try and escape before he ate him or if he was going to be eaten right after the turkey. Slowly, he asked, \"Are you gonna eat me?\"<br>\r\nThe cat looked at Templeton for a second and observed him. Truth be told, she hadn't given much thought to the rat. She just wanted the turkey. But looking at Templeton now and taking a good look at him made the cat realize that she wanted the rodent in her belly. She began to salivate. The thought of all of that juicy meat just lying there was too much for her. Surely he would be even tastier than the other rat. Finishing off the last bite of the turkey, the cat walked over to Templeton. \"I wasn't going to eat you before,\" she said. \"I just wanted that turkey there.\" She rubbed her stomach, which grumbled despite it already being filled with an entire turkey and much more. \"But now that you mention it, a little more meat couldn't hurt.\" She stepped forward and picked him up.<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Templeton yelled. \"Don't eat me! I, uh, have a special condition! If you eat me, you'll get very sick and die!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just ate a rat minutes before I came upon you,\" the cat said. \"He told me the same thing, but I gulped him up anyway, and he tasted delicious!\" She patted her engorged stomach. \"You look like you'll be even more delicious.\" She opened her mouth wide.<br>\r\n\"No!\" Templeton yelled. \"I'll do anything!\"<br>\r\nThe cat stopped for a second and considered. On one hand, the rat was one big hunk of meat that she could easily gulp down. But then she realized that he said he would do anything. This rat could get her all of the food she wanted! All she needed to do was show off her teeth, make a couple of threats, and he would squeak in fear and get the food! It was perfect!<br>\r\nThe cat closed her mouth, smiled, put Templeton down, and walked over the the hot dog stand next to them. She took out a bag of sausages from it and began to swallow them several at a time. \"There is one thing you can do for me.\" She pointed around the fair. \"There's so much food left over all around the grounds, all left uneaten by wasteful humans, which I'm sure you know. I want to eat it. All of it. I would go get the food myself, but given my current size, I can't do much.\" She patted her big belly for emphasis, which had considerably grown from the rat, turkey, and sausages she had just eaten. \"Plus, why do it when someone else can do the work for you? So I want you to gather the food from the fair and bring it all to me. Every single morsel.\" Showing off her claws, she added, \"And if you try to escape, or save anything for yourself, I will find you, and I will personally make sure that you add to my waistline.\" She threw aside the now-empty bag of sausages and took another bag of them from the cart. \"Now go!\"<br>\r\nTempleton, who had been frightened to death from the monstrous feline in front of him, scampered away. Great. Now he had to get food for the cat. It could've been for him, but noooo. He just happened to be unfortunate enough to run into the cat. As he looked around, he realized that he could make a run for it. After all, how would the cat know if he escaped? On one hand, he felt like she had no way of knowing where he went. However, Templeton got a chilly feeling that if he went there to gorge, the cat would somehow find him, and that would be the end for him. But was it worth the risk?</span></div></div>",

The cat had been right. It was a gigantic plethora of abandoned foodstuffs lying all around, ready for the taking. He sighed sadly. So much of it could all go in his belly right now, but if he ate so much as a crumb, the cat would find out. He was sure of it. That big tub of lard would find him somehow. And given his current size, he wouldn't be able to escape forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, a thought occurred to him. He was too full to run. What if he made the cat too full to chase him? What if he filled her stomach with so much food she simply couldn't do anything? Perhaps he could find some way to fatten her up to the point of immobility. Make that stomach so large she couldn't do anything to stop him. Then he'd have the remainder of the fair for himself. He grinned to himself and prepared to gather the heaviest fattiest food he could find. He was going to have some fun with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about an hour, but he soon had a gigantic pile of discarded food on an old picnic quilt he'd found. It was a mound of rotting apples, squished bananas, half-eaten hotdogs, hamburgers, melted ice cream, and various other cholesterol-laden treats. Grinning to himself, he grabbed a corner and pulled the giant load to the cat.</span></div></div>",

Looking down at his own body, it was obvious that he had burned some calories. While he was still very plump for a rat, his stomach was noticeably thinner, but still big enough to tempt the cat.<br>\r\nHuffing and puffing, Templeton reluctantly walked back while dragging the food behind him. Upon his arrival, he looked around and saw a couple of empty hot dog carts, a few plastic bags scattered around, a tablecloth with freshly emptied bowls sitting atop it, and an open freezer with numerous empty tubs of ice cream scattered around it. As he approached the freezer, Templeton stepped back as another empty tub of ice cream fell out, followed by an enormous, multicolored ball of fur that rolled out of the fridge. \"Mmm,\" the cat said, licking her lips. \"That ice cream was deeeelish.\" She patted her engorged middle, then looked over at Templeton. \"Ah, the main course has arrived,\" she said. The cat walked, or rather, dragged herself over to Templeton, her monster of a stomach barely keeping her hind legs on the floor. \"I trust you have brought me an abundance of food to gorge myself on?\" she asked. \"I'm starving.\" <br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Templeton said, gesturing his hands to the feast while concealing his grin. \"Have all you want!\"<br>\r\nThe cat smiled and dug in. She targeted the apples first and shoved them voraciously into her mouth. Sure, they were rotten, but to her, food was food. In no time at all, all of the apples were gone inside her bottomless stomach. She smacked her stomach. \"It's nice to finally have some fruit in here.\" Craving more fruit, she continued to the bananas. Being too lazy to peel each banana and eating it that way, the cat took each banana and threw it into her mouth whole. Soon the bananas were history. Meat was next on her list. She went over to the hamburger, took the cold meat, swallowed it whole, and proceeded to do the same for the rest. Then she spotted the huge plate of bacon next to her. Taking it, she emptied the entire plate of it into her ever-growing gut, which expanded even more. Noticing an enormous bucket of French fries, she took a bottle of ketchup nearby and squeezed it into her mouth while taking the bucket and putting it over her mouth. The landslide of fries came down to mix with the ketchup. Both landed in her stomach. She continued her rampage on the eggs, fried chicken, ice cream, and everything else that Templeton brought to her. Not a single morsel was spared from her gluttony.<br>\r\nAs she finished off the last of her gorge, Templeton watched, hoping that the food he brought was enough to immobilize the cat. She had glutted on more than he could've ever dreamed of eating, so he figured that she was immobile at this point. Sadly for Templeton, he was answered by a yell of \"More! Bring me more!\" The cat had finished her meal and was now dragging herself over to the pretzel stand, knocking it over with her sheer weight and munching on several cheese-filled pretzels. Her hind legs hovered far above the ground thanks to her stomach.<br>\r\n\"You want more?\" Templeton asked, becoming a little nervous. \"That's not enough for you?\"<br>\r\nThe cat gave him a look of menace, then dragged herself over to Templeton, her pointy teeth bared. \"Remember our deal? I want ALL of the food in the fair. You know what will happen if you fail me, don't you?\"<br>\r\nAs if on cue, an obese mouse chose this time to come into the scene to look for food. He was as large as Templeton was when he encountered the cat. At the sight of her, the mouse screamed and attempted to run, but his stomach weighed him down and he was helpless as the cat lifted him up by the tail and dangled him over her mouth. \"Help! Help me! Somebody!\" the mouse yelled to nobody in particular. At the sight of Templeton, he yelled, \"Please! Save me! Help me!\"<br>\r\n\"Not sure how to help you,\" the cat replied, opening her mouth. \"But you can help me.\" With a laugh, she let go of the mouse's tail. Templeton watched in horror as the mouse fell to his ultimate demise into the cat's mouth, soon to be a part of her blubbery body. The cat's stomach, already enormous, bloated further from the prey she had just eaten. She burped and patted her stomach. \"Are you going to get me some food now?\" the cat asked with an evil smile as she resumed her attack on the pretzel stand.</span></div></div>",

He waddled away, noting how much easier it was getting to move around. If he kept burning calories, hopefully he would slim down enough that he could easily escape the cat. Still, he was determined that she must have some sort of limit to her. Might take some time, but it wasn't impossible. Just stuff her until she can't move an inch on her own. He sighed as he grabbed the blanket and took it back to the fairgrounds. He hadn't put that big of a dent in the food, and considering how much she was putting away, it wouldn't take long before she got to be so big she couldn't move anymore. Her stomach was currently stretching out further and further at a very leisurely pace. He rolled his eyes and walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he started stacking more and more food onto the blanket, he got very determined. He didn't care how many trips it took. He was going to stop this feline if it was the last thing he did. He just needed to keep at it. At some point, she would have to get too full to move. She simply had to. Unless she had some sort of power he wasn't aware of. Still, until she demonstrated such abilities, he would have to keep going. He piled the food high on the tablecloth, making it twice as big this time, and with all his strength, he dragged it back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he returned, he found her to be lying in a heap against the toppled pretzel stand, an expression of absolute ecstasy on her face. She hiccuped in a surprisingly dainty manner and patted her stomach, which was now the size of a globe. The rat dragged the food towards her, making sure it was close enough to consume without her needing to move. \"Good little rat,\" she purred. \"Bring it all over. I want to savor this moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton rolled his eyes and leaned against the pretzel stand, waiting for her to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, she reached over and started her next round. She didn't care what she grabbed as long as she got plenty. She shoveled indiscriminately, swallowing and gulping her food as her stomach inflated even larger, stretching high above them. She crammed everything into her gut with pleasurable moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton watched, quickly getting the impression that she wasn't going to be satisfied with just that lot, and she was already halfway through it. Looking around, he spied a trashcan with lots of half-eaten food poking out. Taking advantage of her brief distraction, he slipped away and started to dig out as much food as he could. She wanted more? He'd give her more. He dug it all out and left it in a pile on the ground, not too far away from where she was already finishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the cat sat up and looked around, she saw him gesturing to the pile of food he'd procured. \"Your next meal, madam,\" he said sarcastically. \"I'll prepare the next one.\" He headed off towards a stall and started to toss another pile of whatever food he could find on the ground, just a few yards away from the first pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat saw the food and twitched her nose, a little suspicious, but her stomach rumbled and she focused again on the last few scraps of her meal before struggling to roll over onto her stomach. With great effort, she dragged herself across the ground the few feet it was to the first pile. It was a beautiful sight, so she just dove straight in and gorged on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton finished with the second pile and poked his head out of the stall. She was already starting. Realizing he was able to get her to move as long as there was food not far away, she began to ponder. Perhaps her singlemindedness for food would work to his advantage...</span></div></div>",

After thirty minutes, he got to the foot of the cage and made a pile there. Then he made a pile in the cage. The cat eventually got to the pile right before the cage. Templeton suddenly realized how big she'd become. Her checks were incredibly plump. They looked like they would burst at any minute. Her legs were thicker than a streetlamp light. Even her tail was as thick as her legs. But they were nothing next to her stomach. Wobbling and jiggling with every tiny movement taken, it was truly a sight to behold. Her stomach could truly handle anything thrown at it. Templeton suddenly realized that she was much too big to fit into the cat carrier. Just as he was thinking that, his world went dark.<br>\r\nThe cat rolled onto Templeton, covering him with her massive body. She was furious. How dare he try and trap her! Honestly, did he really think she was that dumb? Her two weeks in the world, though short, trained her to notice these things. And here he was, trying to make a fool out of her. She snarled. \"Did you really think that would work? After all I did for you, you do that?\"<br>\r\n\"Wh-what did you do for me?\" squeaked Templeton, barely audible from underneath the mass of lard.<br>\r\n\"What did I do for you?\" yelled the cat. Her stomach wobbled. \"I let you live, you ungrateful little rodent! I could've gulped you up any time I wanted to, and this is how you thank me?\"<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry,\" squeaked Templeton. \"It won't happen again.\"<br>\r\nThe cat rolled back. Templeton breathes heavily, having been relieved of the enormous burden. \"I'll let you off this once,\" she said. \"Next time, however...\" She pointed to her mouth and made a swallowing motion. \"Now get me more food!\"<br>\r\nTempleton began to make more piles of food for his master. She was ruthless, no doubt. It was time for another plan. But what could he do?</span></div></div>",

Templeton worked at lightning speed, making each pile in a matter of seconds. He could do it! He just knew it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Templeton's chubby body came to a rest. He was finished getting all of the food into piles. Looking around, he couldn't see a single morsel of food other than what was in the piles. Sighing, he sat down. Just as he did, Templeton heard a high-pitched shriek right behind him. Turning around, he watched a blubbery paw scoop up the pile of food right behind him. He watched the paw go up to its master's mouth. The mouth opened as food was deposited into it. Templeton looked a little farther up and saw the creatures face. His jaw dropped. He couldn't believe that the cat was so big. It was simply impossible for anyone to be that big and still be able to move. Tree trunks were a joke next to the cat's jiggly legs. Her trunk-sized tail hung uselessly behind her, too heavy for the monstrous feline to hold up. But the true spotlight was on her stomach. Comparing her stomach to a 50 foot drop ride was like comparing a newborn baby to a grown man. And the best (worst?) part was that she was still mobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton looked into the other paw and found the source of the yell. A Persian cat, much flabbier than normal, was in the cat's grip, pleading with her. \"Please!\" she said. \"Let me go! I have a husband and kids!\"<br>\r\n\"I know you do,\" said the cat, a sly grin on her face. \"But let's just say that they've been relocated.\" The lardball patted her prodigious gut. \"Care to join them?\" Laughing, she threw the Persian into her greedy gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton froze in place as the cat turned her gaze to him. \"Ah,\" the cat said, picking up Templeton and the pile of food he rested on. \"And last, but not least, the one who's made all of this possible! Without you, I wouldn't have achieved my dream of eating everything at the fair.\" She gestured to the bare fairgrounds. \"Every single morsel and animal are now in my stomach. Even the rides have found a new home!\" She grinned. \"And it's all because of you.\"<br>\r\nTempleton paused. \"So, can I go now?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" the smiling cat replied. \"In my stomach, that is.\" And with that, Templeton was thrown into the dark abyss of no return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat smiled. Her monster of a stomach handled everything the fair has to offer, from the food to the animals to the rides. And to think that just a couple of hours ago, she was smaller than the average cat! Now, there was nobody to challenge her size or girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat's stomach rumbled. Even after all of the food, her stomach still wanted more. She began to think about what to do. She knew about another fair a couple of blocks away even bigger than this one. But she kept her mind open for other ideas. Looking around, she made a decision.</span></div></div>",

But for now, choosing her next gorging spot was more important.<br>\r\nShe looked out into the distance, her beast of a belly making her look taller. She giggled as her belly wobbled and shook. No doubt it's inhabitants were looking for a way to escape. She spotted the fair a couple of blocks away, as she expected. But on her other side, just as close, was a small town. Normally, she would've gone straight for the fair. However, the small town was clearly a town that was big on food. He figured that there would be just as much food in either place.

The cat was putting obscene amounts of food in the blink of the eye, so Templeton wasn't sure if she could be immobilized, and that was his only idea. He decided to just feed her and plan while he did it.<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard the cat yell, \"Hurry up! Get me food faster!\" Templeton quickened his pace. Every pile he made was bigger than the previous one. For each pile he made, he continued to ponder upon what to do. Meanwhile, the cat was in ecstasy. She had a servant forced to give her endless amounts of food! It really didn't get better than that. It especially helps if you can make a meal out of your servant when he's done with his labor, which of course was her eventual plan. After all, he had to pay in some way for trying to trap her. The cat decided that a trip down her gullet was enough punishment. Plus, it would nourish her dangerously obese body even more. It was a win-win situation for her. She smiled and continued to gorge, her stomach grumbling in hunger.<br>\r\nAfter half an hour, Templeton saw a building with lots of food inside of it. He couldn't tell what it was for a second until it hit him. The kitchen! He could leave her in there! There was certainly plenty of food in there. Perhaps he could ditch her in there and just gorge on the rest of the food in the fair. Templeton missed the feeling of having a big belly. He looked down at his petite stomach. \"Don't worry,\" he said. \"I'll get you food soon enough.\" He worked even faster, trying to ignore the loud chewing of the cat behind him. It reminded him of his fate if his plan failed in any way. After 5 minutes, he made it to the kitchen. Walking into the kitchen, the cat followed him. He looked around. There was certainly tons of food there. \"This should keep her busy for a while,\" Templeton thought. However, it looked like she would have some competition. A plump canine was already here, along with a few rats. Templeton secretly felt sorry for them, given their eventual fate. Looking behind him, Templeton's jaw dropped. The cat simply looked too big to exist. Her belly took up the entire doorframe by itself. He heard the cat yell, \"Pull me in!\" Templeton grabbed some of her soft fat and pulled. The animals watched this spectacle as the largest mammal they had ever seen attempted to get it. Their food remained forgotten in the scene of it all. After a minute of struggling, the cat managed to get in and began to gorge. She was glad that the rat found such a great gorging spot for her. Immediately she spotted one of the rats. Without a second thought, she snatched the rat and gulped him down, which was the fate of every animal, big or small, that crossed her path. Of course, the only exception was Templeton, but she was going to eat him anyway after he finished his work. She looked at the other rats and the dog huddled in the corner. \"Which one of you is next?\" she asked. Eyeing the dog, she licked her lips and picked him up. \"I guess I'll have the one with the most meat first,\" she said. Laughing evilly, she threw him into her mouth, soon to be another life lost to the gluttony of the feline. In the midst of it all, Templeton scampered out and closed the door quietly.</span></div></div>",

The rat was making endless piles of it for her, and she was loving it. Ever since she had come out of her dying mother's womb a month ago, she had always wanted to experience the feeling of filling her belly many times over, and now her dreams were finally coming true!<br>\r\nMoving on to the next pile, all of the food there quickly disappeared into her unsatisfied gut, which grumbled in protest. She wanted more! She wanted to eat until the world ran out of food! After that, she would have to start eating everyone she came across (which she kind of already did). But hopefully that wouldn't be for a while.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Templeton was making a continuous line of piles of food for the lardball to consume, hoping that she would eventually eat herself to immobility.<br>\r\nAn hour of laborious work later, Templeton came to a rest. He had made about 30 piles of food within the course of an hour. Templeton rested against the last pile he made and sighed. Hopefully this would be enough to satiate her appetite. He could hear the sound of chewing behind him. All of a sudden, he heard it very close. He looked behind and nearly screamed.<br>\r\nThe cat's stomach, once globe-like and small (compared to now anyway), was now three times the size of one. Templeton noted that a family of canines could comfortably fit inside of it. Every inch of it wobbled and shook with every tiny movement she made. She was unable to walk properly. Her stomach deprived her of such a simple luxury. And the cat was proud of it. She loved every inch of her monstrous stomach. All she wanted was for it to be bigger. The obscene amounts of food could not sate her hunger. By no means had she eaten too much. She could eat the whole fair five times over if she wanted to! There was no stopping her gluttony. She had no limits. All she knew were her bottomless stomach, her never-ending hunger, and food. No matter how much she ate, as long as there was food, she would go to the food, no matter what it took.<br>\r\nFinishing up the second-to-last pile, she looked over at Templeton's appalled face. \"Are you going to get me more food or what?\"<br>\r\nTempleton was taken aback by this statement. \"You're still hungry?\"<br>\r\nThe cat hissed. \"Yes, and I will eat all that this fair has to offer. Whatever I say, goes. Now get me more food!\" She began to attack the last pile.<br>\r\nTempleton sighed. At this point, despite being much slimmer, given the cat's girth, she could easily smother him, and if not, she could just grab him, so there was no use in running away. His original plan would no longer work thanks to her ability to somehow walk no matter how large her waistline was. He had no choice but to accept his fate until he could come up with a plan. But was it even worth serving the cat anymore? It didn't seem like there was an end to this madness.</span></div></div>",

He found a couple more hotdogs, burgers, buckets of stale popcorn, and some corndogs. He would normally stuff himself with all this stuff, but he really wanted to live. He needed to come up with a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to think of something.\" Templeton said to himself. \"I don't want to eat so much that nothing is left for me. That and she's most likely to eat me after I give her what she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of the massive kitty devouring him into that pit she calls a stomach gave Templeton the shivers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to avoid that at all cost.\" Templeton said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton then delivered more piles of food to the cat. She continued to eat and eat and eat. Not even resting or chewing her food. Her belly bloated up more and more. Her belly was now close to the size of a tracker. But she wanted it to grow even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More. I want MORE.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Ye...yes.\" Templeton said shaking and then running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the running has reduce most of Templeton's belly. He was still quite fatter than his normal self, but now more of a pear shape and had a big rump. He was starting to get unhappy and the feeling shows with his growling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhh....I'm starving. But I need to get her all the food I can or else......\" Templeton was in a bind. \"Why did I get myself into this mess? What am I gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton then fell to the ground and weep for a bit, but then he looked at some machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's that?\" Templeton said. He then walked over to the machine. It had some kind hose attached to some tank. Then a idea came to the fat rat's head. \"It will be risky, but it might work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with the rat's plan in mind, he goes back to the behemoth bellied cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. How come you haven't brought me more food?\" The cat said angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton then said....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The kitten frowned. \"And why should I follow you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"This area has no more food,\" answered Templeton. \"There's another place that has much more food.\"<br>\r\n\"But look at this stomach!\" complained the calico, patting her obese wrecking ball of lard. \"It'll take forever for me to get there!\"<br>\r\nNow, to the casual observer, she may have had a fair argument. However, in reality, it wouldn't take her forever to get there, and the cat knew that. In fact, she could get there quickly if she wanted to. She was simply much too lazy to even lift her legs. Templeton didn't know this, and so thought she had a point.<br>\r\nSuddenly, the lazy kitten spotted twenty cats walking in their direction. They were clearly not here for the food, as they all seemed to have normal body weights, except for one. She looked at them and said in her cutest voice, \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\nThey stopped. Then a tabby cat in the front walked over to her. She could tell he was the leader. For one, he walked with as much of a strut as his dragging stomach would allow. He was also the only fat one of them all. The tabby then came over to the cat and asked, \"Yes?\" in a tone that suggested he was annoyed that she had bothered him.<br>\r\n\"Can you do me a favor?\" asked the calico. \"Can you carry me to wherever the rat is going?\"<br>\r\n\"And where would that be?\"<br>\r\n\"Near the Ferris wheel,\" chimed Templeton, pointing to the grand structure about 50 feet away. \"Not too far.\"<br>\r\nThe gray cat scowled. \"Why should we carry you when there is more food to be eaten, more places to gorge?\"<br>\r\n\"Pleeeease,\" begged the kitten. She stared at him with the most innocent look she could manage.<br>\r\nThe tabby looked at her and sighed. \"Fine.\" He called his friends (more like slaves, considering how much more fed he was compared to the rest of them) over. \"Help me out with this.\" The other cats immediately sprang up and rushed over to her. They all gathered around her, with the exception of the tabby, who was munching on a hamburger he found on the floor. \"On the count of three!\" the leader yelled. \"One, two, three!\" The calico felt her body lifting ever so slightly above the ground. Templeton ushered them over to the Ferris wheel. As she was hoisted up, she asked, \"What about my food? I want some food on the way.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll get you food as we walk over there,\" replied Templeton, throwing her a whole watermelon. The cat replied by swallowing the watermelon whole. During the long, tedious, five minute journey, Templeton gave her food he found on the side. By the time they got there, the calico had devoured enough food to fill all of the cats carrying her 3 times over.<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" yelled Templeton in front of a huge pile of food next to the Ferris wheel. They didn't need telling. The cats immediately let her down and fell onto the floor, exhausted. The calico then observed her surroundings. The rat was right. There was much more food here than there was back there. She began to eat the food in front of her.<br>\r\nA minute later, the leader walked up to the kitten, who was finishing off the pile of food. \"Now that I've brought you here, what shall I get in reward?\"<br>\r\nShe cocked her head. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"I meant that I helped you get your fat, lazy, overlarge butt over here!\" he yelled. \"You're telling me I deserve nothing?\"<br>\r\nHow rude! The kitten was appalled that someone could be so inconsiderate. He needed to be taught a lesson. She began to concoct a plan.<br>\r\nHe continued. \"Do you know how much food we could've eaten in the time it took you to get here?\"<br>\r\n\"You mean how much you could've eaten,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" the tabby roared. He stared at her with disgust. \"You are a very rude and fat kitten. Look at you! My God, my entire family could live comfortably inside of your stomach. I demand a reward for having carried such enormous weight.\"<br>\r\nThe kitten had enough. His attitude was too much. There was only one option left for him, and he wholly deserved it. She smiled evilly as she licked her chops. \"How about a new home?\"<br>\r\n\"A home?\" he asked. \"Where?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's very close to where you're currently standing.\"<br>\r\n\"But where? Show me.\"<br>\r\n\"I will.\" And with that, the obese feline picked up the flailing tabby.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" he demanded, flailing in her hand.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm eating you,\" the kitten said casually, is if he had just asked how the weather was.<br>\r\n\"This is unacceptable!\" yelled the tabby. \"Put me down now! I have a lawyer you know! He'll hear about this!<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up,\" she yawned. She then threw him into her bottomless pit (or, as she liked to call it, her stomach), soon to be another victim of the calico's unsatiable gluttony. She looked at the other wide-eyed cats, staring in disbelief at the kitten's even larger belly.<br>\r\n\"She ate master,\" one of them whispered.<br>\r\nThe kitten smiled. She wouldn't mind having to eat all of them if they rebelled. Then there was suddenly a joyous cheering as they praised her for getting rid of their oppressive master. One orange cat came up to her with a picnic blanket filled with food. \"We offer our thanks to you for freeing us from him. You shall be rewarded for this. What would you like? We can get you anything.\"<br>\r\nThe kitten smiled as she began to eat the food. \"Bring me all the food you can find!\"<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" the cat replied. \"As you wish.\" He and the other eighteen cats went off for food. She then turned her attention to Templeton. \"That includes you too, you know. Get me more food!\"<br>\r\nTempleton scurried off. Suddenly, he remembered why he really brought the behemoth-bellied kitten here. But would the plan still work? He glanced at the machine he had seen earlier. She was likely much too big for it. Was it worth a shot? Or should he just keep finding food and think of a new plan? Risks, risks...</span></div></div>",

Looks like the rat missed something.\" The cat said. \"I'll eat it later. I got to find that rat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to go back to her search, but then something seemed to pull her back.

Right there was a literal mountain of discarded food over ten feet tall. Corn dogs, hamburgers, and other oily fast foods stood there for the taking. They seemed to be calling to her, \"Eat us! We'd love to be in your belly!\" Drooling, she dove in.<br>\r\nFive seconds later a slightly more bloated cat lay where the pile once stood. Next to her was a table with a considerable amount of food on it, including an enormous bucket of chicken. The feast could've easily fed a family of four for a month. Yanking the tablecloth, she swallowed the feast whole in two seconds flat, including the tablecloth and bucket. Then she spotted Templeton next to a machine. She grinned and rolled over there.<br>\r\nTempleton smiled as she came over. Finally, he would be free of his bondage, so long as he waited a little longer for the plan to work. He continued to grin even as his world became dark.<br>\r\nThe cat grabbed Templeton. \"Are you ready to be punished?\" she asked, smiling.<br>\r\nTempleton faked a gulp. \"Wait! Before you do, I want to make sure you get the food you want!\" He pointed to the machine. \"This machine sucks up all food in a set radius and shoots it out of this tube.\" He pointed to the hose-like object protruding from the tank.<br>\r\nThe cat looked skeptical. \"Show me.\"<br>\r\nTempleton pointed to the knob. \"Set that to 10 feet and click the 'On' button.\" The cat looked around and saw twenty knocked-over trash cans nearby with some weasels trying to dig through its remains. She then did what Templeton told her to and pressed \"On.\" Immediately a burst of the food in the garbage can came through the hose into the cat's open mouth and straight down to her stomach.<br>\r\nThe cat's eyes widened with her even larger stomach. \"Impressive,\" she said, licking her lips. \"But why did I taste some weasel in the pile?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, the machine identifies food as anything edible, so animals will be thrown into the bunch.<br>\r\n\"So why weren't you thrown into the oblivion of my stomach?\"<br>\r\n\"It has a 2 foot dead zone. It also won't suck in the user of the machine, or anyone on the exception list, which can be configured here.\" However, Templeton had already added himself to the list before he came back to the cat.<br>\r\nShe then set the dial to 50 feet and pressed \"On\". A torrent of food poured out of the hose. Screams could be heard as the load forced itself down the cat's throat and into her ever-expanding belly. In the midst of it all, Templeton slowly walked away. Suddenly, he felt something soft tighten around his body.<br>\r\nThe cat lifted him up. \"And where do you think you're going?\"<br>\r\nTempleton gulped. \"Can't I go now?\"<br>\r\nThe cat laughed mercilessly. \"No. Your demise will only be delayed. After all, you haven't payed me back enough to allow me to spare your life. I'll simply eat you last. Meanwhile, I'll make sure you stay put.\" The cat then tucked Templeton right under her flabby bottom.<br>\r\nTempleton gasped for air as he heard the cat switch the dial. This was not how it was supposed to work. He was supposed to be out in the fair, gathering food before the cat could eat it. Instead, he was underneath the world's largest rump belonging to the world's most obese, crazy, merciless, lazy, and gluttonous cat. If only he could do something...<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the cat looked at the dial. From what it looked like, the maximum was 10 miles. She could grab all of the food in a ten mile radius. Amazing! She pressed the on button, and...</span></div></div>",

Maybe, while she had her back turned, he could escape! Templeton saw an opportunity, and he dashed as quickly as he could. However, he was stopped by the even faster hand that grabbed him.<br>\r\nTempleton gawked at the multicolored lardball in front of him. \"How did you get me so fast?\" he asked.<br>\r\nThe kitten smirked, looking pleased about herself. \"I have my ways.\" She then stared at Templeton. \"You know what will happen next, won't you?\" Suddenly, the calico felt something gurgle in her throat. She burped as a rat's skull came out, no doubt the obese one she had swallowed earlier. Templeton gulped. The kitten sighed. \"You could've been so much more. You could've lived longer, long enough to see me eat everything in the fair. Maybe I would have let you live long enough for me to eat everything on Earth!\" She shook her head. \"But now, here we are. You broke the rules, and now you will be punished.\" She then threw a screaming Templeton into her maw and felt her already overlarge stomach bloat slightly further. She sighed. \"Now I have to find someone else to get food for me.\" Right on cue, a couple of rats came by. The obese kitten smiled. \"Perfect.\" She snatched them as they yelled in horror. \"Please don't eat us!\" they shrieked.<br>\r\nThe kitten smiled. \"Oh, I won't, so long as you constantly bring me food. So go! Now!\" With that, they scurried away.</span></div></div>",

A gross and slimy room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a dilemma you got yourself into this time, Templeton.\" Templeton said to himself. \"I should have never trusted that cat. Her appetite is so.....vorgul. She just wants to eat and eat. A true glutton, I admit. I envy her in that say. But she's going a little crazy.

Their load of food was enough to feed an entire village. \"Faster!\" she yelled. \"As fast as you can! I don't want my mouth to be empty again, or I'll eat you!\" The rats sprinted away and came back a few seconds later with even larger piles of edible goodness, all for her to eat. The kitten began to shove the food into her mouth. Chicken, pies, burgers, even forks were swallowed by the beast, all in a vain attempt to sate her hunger.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Templeton, trying to climb out, was suddenly crushed by a wave of food. He fell down, flailing. Grabbing onto a burger, he managed to surface his head, ready to try again, but the torrent kept coming. The stomach was already almost filled to the brim with food, and it just kept coming. Templeton swam far away from the throat to avoid being crushed again by the oncoming stream of food. Once he hit a stomach wall, he began to relax for a bit. Then realized he didn't know how to get back to the throat. He was lost. Lost inside of a stomach. It was so pathetic that it would've funny if the stomach didn't belong to a gluttonous kitten who never stopped eating. More food came as it filled the stomach, allowing his head to barely be seen. His head was touching the ceiling of the stomach. He swam over to the wall and leaned against it. Templeton could feel the ceiling and the wall moving, which he found quite odd. Then he realized that her stomach was expanding to make room for more food. Templeton shuddered at the thought of more food entering her enormous stomach. If more food meant a bigger stomach, that meant that he could get lost more easily and maybe never find a way out. He couldn't let that happen. He simply stood still and tried to think of a way out.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the kitten was gorging on the never-ending supply of food being brought to her. The supply of food was twice as fast as before, given that there were now two rats giving her food. The pile in front of her was taller than her belly! She closed her eyes and sighed in bliss as she dropped an entire turkey down her maw. Opening her eyes, she suddenly noticed that some of her food was missing. The calico was furious. Who would dare to take her food? She reached blindly behind the pile and got something. It was heavy too. Quite heavy. She pulled her paw out from behind the pile and realized the thing she caught was a Siamese cat, and a very fat one at that. The Siamese was the fattest cat the kitten had ever seen. Despite being quite bottom-heavy, her stomach was still over two times larger than the calico's. The kitten snarled. She couldn't have competition, much less competition larger than her! There was only room for one obese, spoiled cat! Only one thing could be done to fix that.<br>\r\nThe Siamese whimpered. Though she was fatter than the calico and could probably flatten her (which said quite something about her girth), the kitten had an iron grip. She knew there was no way to force herself out, so she decided to talk her way out of it.<br>\r\nThe Siamese made a brave attempt at a smile. \"H-hi.\"<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" replied the calico casually. \"How's life?\"<br>\r\n\"I-it's fine,\" answered the Siamese.<br>\r\n\"That's nice,\" said the kitten. \"You look quite plump.\"<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks,\" the Siamese muttered.<br>\r\n\"Plumper than me!\" the hungry beast continued. \"I've never seen anyone as fat as you before. It's bad when animals are fatter than me. I can't stand seeing someone larger.\" She licked her lips in anticipation. \"Do you know what I do with them?\"<br>\r\n\"Share your food with them?\" asked the Siamese hopefully.<br>\r\n\"Eat them.\" The calico stepped back, preparing for the biggest thing she'd ever eat. She began to swallow the Siamese starting from her enormous rump. It took a bit of effort to swallow her whole, but after her prodigious belly, the rest of her furry body slid down easily. The Siamese fell down and was immediately buried by the incredible amounts of food in the stomach. Lacking the mobility of the calico, the Siamese couldn't get up from the pile of food. Already she felt the digestive acids working on her belly. She snarled. No! She wouldn't give up! She worked all five years of her life to get this fat! No way she was going to let a baby like the calico end her fun. She began to plan a way to get out.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the kitten's stomach, already the size of a large room, tripled in size to the size of a house. Her eyes widened. She hadn't expected her stomach to become that large. Her shock quickly turned to joy as smacked her stomach and called into it, \"Who's the fattest cat now?\" She smirked and continued to attack the new, much larger pile of food in front of her brought by the rats in the midst of the encounter.<br>\r\nInside the stomach, Templeton has no clue what was going on. One second, he was neck-deep in food near a stomach wall. The next second, he was being squished by both the top of the stomach and a huge, white belly of fur. He looked around. The stomach walls were gone. Probably much farther away to accommodate for the girth of the cat she had swallowed. Nothing familiar was in sight. Templeton sighed. He needed to get out. Maybe he could find the throat and see if she'd stopped eating, but she almost never did, so it was risky.  Or maybe he could ask the cat in the stomach for help? Templeton shuddered. That was just as scary. What if the cat ate him the second she saw him? Was it worth the risk for the small chance of getting out?  He could only think of these two plans, and both of them seemed unlikely to work, but it was worth a shot. Weighing his options, he decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could eat the food in the stomach! He grabbed a burger and stuffed it down his throat. Grabbing a bucket of French fries, he poured them down his waiting maw. A bucket of chicken wings followed. He started on a tub of ice cream, but suddenly stopped halfway through. He looked at his body, already a little plumper than before. How would he ever get out if he ate a lot? What if he, like the Siamese in the stomach, became too fat to fit through the throat to get out? He stopped eating and looked at his stomach, which was already the size of a grapefruit. He sighed as he realized that it was weighing him down, which would make it harder to climb out. He had priorities, and priority #1 was getting out. Gorging would have to wait. Looking below him, Templeton also noted the Siamese cat eating everything around her. She was fatter than he had last seen the kitten, though obviously the kitten was much fatter now. Realizing how close he was to her, he noticed that he was fat enough to be considered a decent amount of food by the cat. He looked at her overlarge rump and decided he would not want to be part of it later on. However, he already ruled out climbing out of he throat by himself. Maybe he needed help.

Now that she's eaten you.....\"<br>\r\n\"What do you want okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Help. Don't you want to get out of here?\"<br>\r\n\"Well this isn't really a place I want to be in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton looked up and sawed a couple of food dropping down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's got to be where the throat is.\" Templeton thought. \"Hey, I have an idea.\"<br>\r\n\"What's your idea?\" The Siamese asked.<br>\r\n\"Over there is our way out.\" Templeton said pointing at the dropping food. \"If you could make a ruckus, cause her discomfort for a bit so she can't focus on eating, I could get out from her mouth. Like a furball she has to hack off.\"<br>\r\n\"Cause a ruckus? After eating me, I'll do more than that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Siamese then started bouncing and punching the stomach walls.

Do you really want to fi.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the kitten stomach was starting to feel more pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAHH!!!!!! Grrrrrr......persistent are you? I can't focus on eating.\" The kitten said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her distracted from eating, now was Templeton chance to star climbing. It took a while, but he made it to the throat hole. Before he climbed up it, the Siamese spoke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" The Siamese said.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Templeton said.<br>\r\n\"Listen, you may be able to still get out, but with my size, I'm pretty stuck here.\" The Siamese admitted. \"Can you do me a favor?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't like doing favors, but what is it?\" <br>\r\n\"When you get out, find some way to stop that glutton of a kitten.\" <br>\r\n\"I don't even think that's possible now.

And it was all because of the Siamese cat in her stomach, who was still causing a ruckus in there. Her stomach hurt a lot. She yelled, \"Hey! Stop that right now!\" Ignoring her, the Siamese continued to kick and punch the kitten. Howling in pain, she punched her stomach, hoping to hit her visitor. She smiled as she heard her fist connect to one of the Siamese's legs. It was the Siamese's turn to scream in pain as she stopped kicking the stomach due to her newly broken leg. The kitten was truly proud of her strength. She could really pack a punch if she wanted to.<br>\r\nThe calico called into her stomach, \"Would you like me to break your other legs? Because I will if you don't stop punching.\" She was answered by silence. \"Good cat,\" she purred. \"Just wait as you slowly dissolve into nourishment for my body.\" The Siamese sighed. The digestive acids were really starting to work on her. She felt her whole stomach burning. Soon her fat would dissolve and turn into, well, fat. The kitten, oblivious to the pain of her visitor, grinned. \"You should feel honored that you get to contribute to the body of the world's fattest cat!\" With that said, she turned her attention to the food in front of her, brought by the other two rats in her service. She smiled. The pile was as large as her belly. The calico dug into her meal while considering possible locations of the rat.<br>\r\nShe looked around and sniffed the air. She could smell something ratty nearby. Pausing her feast for a second, she grabbed a nearby garbage can and turned it upside-down. She caught the contents in her blubbery paw. Banana peels, moldy bread, and other junk fell into her hand. She extracted something out of the pile that didn't seem to belong. She grabbed a rat's tail and pulled it out. The kitten smiled as Templeton's shocked face stared right back at her.<br>\r\nHe was stunned. How did she manage to find him? Maybe his fur was too exposed in an environment like that. Nevertheless, he gulped as he knew the next thing that would happen. And this time, it didn't look like there was a cat to save him, as the belly had stopped moving too much, signaling that the cat had been digested.<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes, waiting for the inevitable. He waited. And waited. But nothing happened. He then realized he was on solid ground and staring up at the face of the monstrous kitty. She sighed. \"You just don't learn, huh?\" She resumed her rampage on the pile of food while talking to Templeton. \"You had one job. That job was to give me food.\" She threw three turkeys into her mouth simultaneously. \"But you didn't do it, so I had to eat you. Yet here you are again. I'll give you one last chance.\" She shoved five pies down her throat. \"Get me food like the other two rats. Don't eat any of it. If you eat anything or complain, you know what your punishment will be.\" Suddenly, she felt something in her throat. She burped. A cat's skull popped out of her throat and landed in front of Templeton. The skull was no doubt the one of the cat she had just eaten. Templeton backed up in fear. \"Whoops,\" said the kitten, giggling. Then she continued. \"The longer you follow directions, the longer you delay the inevitable. So go! Get me food!\" She continued to attack the pile.<br>\r\nTempleton didn't even know what to do. Sure, she would eat him no matter what. But maybe he could talk her out of this later. Or should he gorge now and risk being eaten? Templeton was craving food in his belly, but he knew that the second the food touched his lips, it would be goodbye for him. He thought for a while about what to do...</span></div></div>",

He also knew that the cat would just eat her again at some point. So he needed to come up with some plan. But for now, he had to play the role as the cat's servent. While he grabbed some food, he got the chance to talk to those other rats. This was a good time to talk to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen you two.\" Templeton said to the other rats. \"Just so you know, at one point, she WILL eat us all.\"<br>\r\n\"D...don't you think we know that.\" The male rat said. \"But what can we do?\"<br>\r\n\"You were inside her.\" The female rat said. \"Do you really want to risk getting back in there?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not. I was only lucky to get out.\" Templeton said. \"Without that cat that helped me, I may not get a second chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three rats then finish gathering more food and put them together to make a huge pile for the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen. There isn't much food left.\" Templeton said to the rats. \"Not only that, the sun will rise soon. When that happens, humans will be here.\"<br>\r\n\"You don't...think she will to eat humans too, is she?\" The female rat asked.<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't surprise me if she did.\" Templeton said.<br>\r\n\"That...monster.\" The male rat said.<br>\r\n\"Feel like that's an understatement.\" Templeton said. \"When I was inside her, I saw her stomach get filled to the brim. But then it just...expanded. So that means believe it or not, she can never get full.\"<br>\r\n\"So...we would be force to feed her....FOREVER?\" The female rat said.<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure we would die before that. By starvation or digestion.\" Templeton said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, the two rats feared for their lives either more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna die either way.\" The male rat said shaking.<br>\r\n\"Calm down. I'm pretty sure she can smell fear.\" Templeton said. \"We're feed her for now. I'll come up with something later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rats brought the pile to the cat. With three rats, the work was tripled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work, you three.\" The cat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gobbled down the big pile. Shallowing most of the food whole. This didn't made Templeton happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just shallowing the food.\" Templeton thought. \"She's not even savoring it. I bet she doesn't even know half the food she has eaten the whole night.\"<br>\r\n\"I still want more.\" Remember...I want EVERYTHING.\" The cat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three went to get more food. Unfortunately, the pile of food was looking light. It was mainly cause everything else was already in her belly. This made two of the rats panic, while Templeton tried to say calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...is this all the food?\" The male rat said. \"WAH! THIS IS ALL THE FOOD.\"<br>\r\n\"Noooooo!!!!!! WE ARE GONNA DIE!!!!\"<br>\r\n\"Calm down.\" Templeton told them.<br>\r\n\"How are you not scared?\" The male rat said. <br>\r\n\"Guess getting eaten once takes some of the fear out.\" Templeton said. \"Otherwise, I would be like you.\"<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say. I don't think we will be as lucky as you. What are we gonna do?\" The male rat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton thought deep about things and came with a new plan. The plan was convincing her to leave. With the fact that morning was coming, humans would soon arrive. They had to hope she didn't want to be seen by them. That and the fact the fair still had one more day left. So there would be more food to have. If only she waits til nightfall.</span></div></div>",

Here is the plan.\" Templeton said to the two rats. \"When you give her the last pile of food, convince her to leave the fair grounds until night fall. The last day of the fair will only mean more food. Knowing her, she can't miss the opportunity of getting more food.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay. But what about you?\" The female rat asked.<br>\r\n\"I gonna stay here and warn my friends Wilbur and Charlotte.\" Templeton said.<br>\r\n\"You gonna ditch us with that blob of a kitty?\" The male rat said a little ticked.<br>\r\n\"One of us needs to come up with a plan to stop her.\" Templeton said. \"If we all stay with her, we won't be able to do anything.\"<br>\r\n\"Guess.....you have a good point.\" The male rat said.<br>\r\n\"Okay. You two deliver the food to her 'blubberness.' I need to go into hiding.\" Templeton said. \"Just tell her I got eaten by some other cat.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" The female rat said. \"Be sure to hide you scent. That's how she found you last time.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks for telling me that.\" Templeton said before running off. \"Okay. One last thing, don't get eaten.\"<br>\r\n\"Before you go off, mine telling us your name?\" The female rat asked.<br>\r\n\"Templeton. Your's?\" Templeton asked.<br>\r\n\"Rusty.\" The male rat said.<br>\r\n\"Sherry.\" The female said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Templeton left the other two rats. First things first, he had to hide his scent, then hide somewhere. Wilbur's pen was the best place he could think of. He rolled on some dirt, then he goes to Wilbur's pen to hide. He happening to wake up Wilbur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T..Templeton?\" Wilbur said quietly acter waking up.<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh...stay quiet.\" Templeton whispered. Templeton then hides under a haystack behind Wilbur.<br>\r\n\"What are you...\" Wilbur asked.<br>\r\n\"Shhh....I'll explain later.\" Templeton said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Wilbur stayed quiet. Meanwhile, the other two rats, Rusty and Sherry just gave the last pile food to the blobby calico kitten. Telling her about leaving for the next night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is all you could find?\" The calico said.<br>\r\n\"Yes. The rest of the content is in your belly.\" Sherry said.<br>\r\n\"Good work, but where is the other one?\" The calico asked.<br>\r\n\"He tried to make a run for it, but was eaten by another cat.\" Rusty said.<br>\r\n\"That so?\" The cat then chug the rest of the food in her gullet. \"What a shame. He was actually quite useful to me. Now, what to do with you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe calico cat grinned delivish at the two rats. The both stepped back and spoke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on. There is still one more day of the fair.\" Rusty said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You will need us to get more food for you.\" Sherry said. \"If there was this much food left here then, just think about how much will be here tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat realized that they were right. All that extra food could be more than she desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll leave until nightfall.\" The cat said. \"But you are both coming with me, and no funny business.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" Rusty and Sherry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the cat began leaving the fair grounds making heavy pounds on the grounds. Wilbur noticed the ground shaking the same for Charlotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with all the shaking?\" Charlotte said.<br>\r\n\"An earthquake?\" Wilbur thought.<br>\r\n\"I'll explain later. Now stay quiet.\" Templeton said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they saw it. The huge calico kitten who went from being slightly chubby to the size of a mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...on Earth...is that?\" Charlotte said shocked with what she was seeing.<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh....\" Templeton said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat then turn to the pig pens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pig pens, huh?\" The cat said. \"Normally I would love to eat each and everyone of them.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made Wilbur shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I have to leave. Can't have any human know I was here.\" The cat said. So, consider you all lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe calico then moved more. Further and further to the forest and deep so sbe can hide from them. They were all safe. Templeton then hopped out of the hay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I think we are safe for now.\" Templeton said.<br>\r\n\"Templeton! What was that huge thing?\" Charlotte asked.<br>\r\n\"What was that talk about wanting to eat me and the other pigs?\" Wilbur asked frightened.<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you two everything later.\" Templeton said. \"Right now, I need some rest. Been up all night and for something that was gonna be the best night of my life, it was the worst night of my life. I just need two hours and I'll talk. Is that okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Fine. I guess we can understand.\" Wilbur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Templeton went to Wilbur's crate to get some sleep. After all the stuff with the cat, he needed the rest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Templeton woke up as the fair opened. He blinked a couple of times before sitting up. Looking over at Wilbur, he noticed that Wilbur seemed to be looking at something else in the pen. Getting a closer look, Templeton realized that Wilbur was talking to a very cute and fat Siamese kitten, who was sitting down on her enormous watermelon-sized buttocks. Though not nearly as fat as the calico, her belly was still largely distended, touching the floor despite the fact that she was sitting upright. Getting a closer look, Templeton realized that she was crying. Thick tears were coming out of her bright blue eyes, splashing onto her large white stomach. Wilbur had a look of pure terror on his face. He looked at Templeton. \"Good morning,\" he said, his voice shaking. \"Jenna here just explained who wanted to eat us and what she did.\"<br>\r\nThe kitten sniffled as she hung her head. \"That monster ate my mom. I don't even know how she did it. I was taking some food from a pile with her when I saw a paw snatch up my mother. I ran and hid under a table as I saw a calico cat half of my mom's size talk to her for a bit. The calico said that she couldn't stand it when animals were fatter than her. Then she lifted my mom up, put her above her mouth, and...and...\" Jenna broke down as Templeton remembered what had happened. Sharp images of a very large Siamese cat being swallowed by the calico rushed through his brain. He felt some sort of emotion running through him as he struggled to recognize it. Then it hit him. Sympathy. It was strange, because before this night, he had never felt sympathy or kindness toward anyone. But now, Templeton felt very sympathetic for Jenna and the fate of her mother. Perhaps last night had some positive effects as well. He raised his hand and put it on her blubbery shoulder. \"It's okay. I was swallowed by the calico as well, right before your mother was swallowed.\"<br>\r\nJenna sniffled. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" replied Templeton. \"I managed to escape with your mom's help. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be here. She helped me escape. She was a hero.\"<br>\r\nJenna looked at him with her watery eyes. \"Thanks.\" Suddenly, Templeton spotted a person coming over with slops. Templeton's eyes widened. She couldn't be seen in here. \"Quick!\" he said to her. \"In here!\" He pointed to Wilbur's crate behind him as he jumped in. With difficulty, Jenna stood up, her large rear end making it hard to stand. She waddled to the crate as her stomach dragged along. First her head went in, followed by her stomach, which took up most of the room in the crate. She was about to get her hind legs inside when she was stopped by her wide mounds of fat. Jenna groaned as she struggled to get inside the crate. Wilbur gave her large butt a few shoves, but it was simply too big. He gave up as the man came with the food. He casually stood in front of the crate as the man put the slops in the trough and walked away.<br>\r\nWilbur sighed with relief. \"All clear,\" he said. The cat stepped out of the crate, massaging her sore rump, followed by Templeton. Jenna eyed Wilbur's breakfast with interest. She looked at him. \"Do you mind if I have some?\"<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" he said. \"Have the whole thing if you want it. I lost my appetite a long time ago.\" Before he could even finish his sentence, Jenna grabbed the whole trough and tipped it over as the contents spilled into her mouth. She put down the empty trough and belched. \"Thanks,\" she said. \"Food always makes me happier.\" Jenna walked over to the corner of the pigpen. She buried her belly in the haystack and yawned. \"I'll be asleep for now. If I can also have your lunch, wake me up then. If not, wake me up for dinner.\" She closed her eyes and fell asleep.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Templeton stared wide-eyed at her enormous belly that took up an eighth of the pigpen. He suddenly thought up of a plan. Since Jenna was an extremely gluttonous kitten, Templeton thought that if anyone can stop the calico, it was her. But maybe another plan would work better...</span></div></div>",

He began to think about how this would work.<br>\r\nAt noon, Jenna felt someone shaking her shoulders. She rolled over and heard a scream from beneath her. She quickly rolled back and saw a very out-of-breath Templeton laying there. She grinned sheepishly. \"Whoops. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" gasped Templeton. \"The slop just came and Wilbur said you could have it.\"<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" she said, grinning. \"But where's Wilbur?\"<br>\r\n\"Right outside. All the pigs were called down for the pig-judging contest, and Wilbur wants me to come.\" Templeton then crawled out of the pigpen. \"We'll be back soon!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Jenna replied. \"See you!\"<br>\r\nTempleton simply waved back as the crate was taken to the judges. He couldn't help but smile as he watched Jenna gulp down the entire trough in two seconds. Templeton yawned. The hot sun made him tired. He closed his eyes and fell asleep.<br>\r\nAn hour later, he awoke to a loud thud. Templeton looked and saw that Wilbur had fainted on the stage. The crowd all seemed to be shocked. He found it rather amusing that everyone was making such a big fuss. Quietly, he crawled over to Wilbur and bit his tail hard. Everyone cheered as Wilbur jumped awake, and they cheered even louder as he was given the medal. Wilbur was then put into the crate where Templeton was and was carried over to the pigpen. As Wilbur was let out, Templeton jumped out and sprinted inside, but the cat wasn't there. Templeton began to panic. Where did Jenna go? Suddenly, he heard a voice say, \"Psst. Templeton.\" Templeton whirled around and saw Jenna's head poking out from behind the pig pens, her blue eyes piercing his. \"Hey,\" he said. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\nJenna looked a little nervous. \"Ummmm, after I ate Wilbur's lunch, I kinda noticed that none of the other pigs had eaten their lunch, and then I saw that everyone was at the pig-judging contest, and I saw a lot of food lying around on the fair grounds, and \u2013 \"<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure I know what happened next,\" Templeton interrupted. \"How big are you now?\"<br>\r\n\"Ummmmm...\" Jenna fidgeted nervously with her paws. \"There's a reason I didn't come back to the pigpen. Why don't you come look?\" Templeton climbed out of the pigpen, looked behind the pigpens, and gasped. In front of him lay an enormous Siamese cat with a stomach wide enough to take up two pigpens. Her thick hind legs hovered above the ground, completely useless. Her blubbery tail hug limply, just as useless. Her rump was three times the size it had previously been. Jenna sheepishly grinned. \"I did tell you there was a reason. I certainly can't fit in the pigpen. Hopefully the humans won't come here.\" She yawned. \"Wake me up when it's nighttime. The calico and I have a deal to settle.\" With that said, Jenna dozed off.<br>\r\nTempleton made his way back into the pigpen, where Wilbur was napping, his medal hanging proudly in front of the pigpen. He realized that soon, they would have to go back to the farm, where they would never have to worry about the calico again. He couldn't believe it! Finally, it would all be over soon. But then he thought about Jenna, and what the calico had done to her mother. Templeton wasn't sure whether he wanted to stay to help out Jenna, or if he wanted to go back to the farm, where he could gorge on lots and lots food, thanks to the fact that he had gotten Charlotte's egg sac for Wilbur in exchange for first pick on all of the slops. What to do, what to do...</span></div></div>",

She took a look at the bottom of the enormous pile in front of her where the rats stood and suddenly noticed that one of the rats had plumped up quite a bit. She picked up the watermelon-sized rat as he screamed. The kitten grinned. \"What did I say you have to do if you want to live?\"<br>\r\n\"T-too keep bringing you food?\" he stammered.<br>\r\n\"Exactly. And when I say that, it means you give me ALL of the food. It doesn't mean you can have some.\" She licked her lips. \"But you had some food anyway. But fear not. You can still fulfill your promise in a different way.\" She then threw the flailing rat into her titanic stomach. The female rat watched in fear as the kitten turned to her. \"As for you, thanks to him, you have to work two times harder to avoid punishment. Go get me some food!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes miss,\" the rat squeaked as she ran off to get more food. Content, the calico turned to the pile of food, which was larger than her. She tore through the food, shoving the fatty goodness into her waiting maw. She burped twenty minutes later as she finished off the pile. She looked at her stomach and admired its sheer size. As large as a mansion, her stomach constantly wobbled even when she was still. Putting an ear to her stomach, she smiled at the sloshing sound of her stomach digesting as it turned the food into more squishy fat for her gargantuan body. Lifting her head, the behemoth-bellied kitten took a step and smiled when she heard the ground shake as it struggled to hold her weight. She rolled over to the next pile the rat had made, her stomach jiggling furiously as she did. The pile was almost as large as the previous one. She smiled and began to gorge.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Templeton was watching this spectacle from a nearby table. He was still quite hungry, but he refrained from eating the piece of cheese in his hand. Tempting as it was, before her gorge, Templeton saw the kitten look right where he was with an evil eye, as if daring him to eat the cheese. He wasn't sure how she would be able to eat him from that distance, but something told him that she could really do anything she wanted. Then again, he wasn't sure if he would ever be able to eat again, so this may be his only chance. Looking at her monstrous stomach, he shuddered as he realized that this time, there was no Siamese cat to help him out if he got stuck in there again. It reminded him of his fate if he was eaten again. Would eating the simple piece of cheese really cause his doom though?</span></div></div>",

So he took a chance and ate the cheese. He feared that the cat saw him, but he was lucky she didn't. She was actually looking at something else. Templeton was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*phew* I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.\" Templeton said quietly to himself. \"It wasn't much, but it's better than letting the cat get her way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton stare from a far, being sure not to be seen as the pile that the calico was eating from began to quickly deplete. She was really in bliss. The pile just the other was gone into her behemoth belly. The next pipe she was given was....surprisingly small. Like her original size small. This ticked her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Why is this pile so small?\" The cat yelled.<br>\r\n\"Th..th...this is all I could find left.\" The rat said scared. \"Everything else is already in your stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat then realized that she has gained quite a lot for one night's run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...supposed I have eaten quite a lot.

She then grabbed the rat. \"In my belly.\"<br>\r\n\"Wa....wait. Please?\" The rat pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat was about to eat the rat, but then she loudly spoke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT?\" The rat shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe calico admittedly stopped to hear her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean tonight?\" The cat asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure all the food is gone now, but today is the last day of the fair.\" The rat said. \"If you were able to eat so much now, think about the feast you can have at nightfall. You may be able to eat even more than ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of having another feast like this night's gave the cat eternal bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will just have to wait til night fall.\" The rat said. \"You don't want to get seen by humans, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's true. A cat her size would cause alarm. That and a hungerbounded kitten that would eat anything might get the army involved. Even she couldn't take on military forces and nuclear bombs. The calico knew that she had to stay hidden. For now at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I will go for now and come back at night.\" The calico said. \"I've been up all night anyway. Even I need sleep. It will also give me time to digest everything. Heehee. I can just feel the mounds of fat now. You little rat will get to live another day.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank...you.\" The rat said greatful to live another day.<br>\r\n\"For now, stay with me. And no funny business.\" The cat said. \"Don't try to be like that other rat who ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gargantuan cat rolled away and the rat followed. They left the fair and Templeton came out. He was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, she left the fair and will be back tonight.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the sun was rising, Templeton sighed and laid down underneath a table and decided to sleep. He was tired. He gorged for a bit, ran into a calico kitten, watched her eat a mouse whole, got her food nonstop as she fattened up from the size of a turkey to the size of a mansion, got eaten by her, got out of her stomach thanks to a Siamese cat, and ran away, all in just one night. This rat needed to rest. He closed his eyes and immediately fell asleep.<br>\r\nThe sun was now completely up. The setup crew were unaware of the fact that absolutely nothing edible was left on the fairgrounds. They just set up their props like it was another day. And it was the last day too. There would be three times the normal amount of people today, as the pig-judging contest would be today. Plus, they gave discounts on the last day, so they weren't surprised when they finished their setup and already found a huge line waiting to buy tickets for the entry, the people completely oblivious to the huge white mass behind them, slowly rolling to the forest.<br>\r\nGiven that the trees were slightly taller than her, the kitten figured she would be able to hide decently enough in them. She glanced back at the fair and grinned. There were a lot more people than there were yesterday. That would mean more food would be consumed, meaning more food would be brought in, meaning more for her to gorge on tonight! She looked at her belly, which was already larger than a mansion. The mere thought of it doubling, even tripling in size made her sigh in bliss. She couldn't wait for the night to come! Returning her gaze to the forest, she double-checked to make sure the rat was still following her. Trying to look behind her, all she could see was her enormous belly from all sides. Grabbing down, she felt something and picked it up. It was a chubby weasel. Without a second thought, she threw him into her mouth. She reached down again and managed to grab the rat, who let out a little squeak. \"Sorry,\" the kitten said. \"I just can't see too well if you're near me, so I'll have to hold you, if that's okay.\" The rat nodded vigorously. She was willing to do anything as long as she could live. The kitten continued to roll over to the mass of trees, clutching the rat in her paw. Rolling into the forest, she found a little pathway made by the trees barely large enough for her to get through without knocking over any trees. Going along it, she came to a little open area about 30 seconds later. She realized that she was in the yard of a mansion. The property was gorgeous. A beautiful fountain stood in the middle of the lawn, the gray stone's intricate design captivating the kitten's attention. \"Must be some really rich people that live here,\" she thought. \"Maybe they'll have lots of food.\" Licking her lips, she turned her head to look at the white mansion. A yellow \"For Sale\" sign was slapped onto the door. Nobody owned this house yet. \"What a shame,\" the calico thought. \"Of all the houses I could have come across, I come across one that's not even sold yet? Why?\" In frustration, she rolled over the property. The fountain was smashed into little bits of stone floating in some water. Dust, rubble, and wood were all of what remained of the mansion. She smiled. To think that just her stomach had caused all of that destruction! Suddenly, her stomach growled again, as it always did. She turned to the rat. \"Okay, now that we're here, I'm going to nap. As for you, I want you to gather some food for me. I'm going to sleep and I'm waking up at noon. When I wake up, I better have a big pile of food waiting for me, okay?\" The rat nodded and scampered off as the cat dozed off.<br>\r\nAn hour and a half later, the kitten opened her eyes and blinked a couple of times. She yawned and stretched her chubby limbs, which were even thicker than tree trunks. Then she looked at her body. Her face had plumped up quite a bit. A lot of fat seemed to have gone to her rump, which was now very plush and jiggly. But where almost all of the fat went was her stomach. She looked at her monstrosity of a stomach and grinned. A huge blob of pure fat was what her stomach was composed of, and she loved every corpulent inch of herself. She then took a look at the huge pile of food in front of her. It was a little more than three quarters of her size, which shocked the calico. She didn't know there was that much food nearby. Looking down at the rat, she asked her, \"Where did you get all of this?\"<br>\r\n\"The nearby supermarkets,\" answered the rat.<br>\r\nThe cat cocked her head. \"How did you manage to get the food?\"<br>\r\n\"They were closed.\"<br>\r\n\"All four of them?\" asked the kitten.<br>\r\n\"All four.\"<br>\r\n\"And how many supermarkets have you emptied so far?\"<br>\r\n\"Just one, the one farthest away from here.\"<br>\r\nThe calico licked her lips. \"Get me the food from all of them.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" The rat scampered off to get more food for her. Truth be told, she actually didn't mind getting food for the calico at this point. It was fascinating to see a creature that was once so small reach such extreme proportions. At some point, when she took a short break, she stared at the kitten's massive stomach, trying to comprehend how she could hold so much food. She had once tried to count the rolls of fat on the calico's stomach while she was asleep, but got bored after she hit triple digits. Finding the next supermarket, she spotted a garbage bag. She took a few of them and ran into the store.<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, she came bag with 5 garbage bags filled with food. The supermarket had been cleaned out thanks to her. The rat dragged them over to the spot where the kitten was. The calico was finishing off the first pile and grinned as she saw the new food coming in. \"Supermarket two has been emptied,\" announced the rat. \"The contents are right here.\"<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" responded the kitten, digging into the food. The rat scampered off to do this again for the other supermarket, and then for the one after that. Each time, she brought back bags filled with the food from the supermarket and went to the next one, only to come back twenty minutes later to find the previous pile polished off. As the rat brought back the final mound of food, she sat back and relaxed.<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, the rat was resting in the shade when she heard a loud cracking sound. She jumped up and looked around. A couple of trees had fallen over due to the kitten's obesity. The stomach of the calico itself was the size of the entire property. She belched. \"Ahh,\" she sighed, patting her vast stomach. \"Good job,\" she said to the rat. \"Thank you for your service.\"<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" responded the rat.<br>\r\nA yawn came out from the kitten. \"And now, time to rest again.\" The obese calico then closed her eyes and went back into slumber.<br>\r\nAt nine o'clock, the calico slowly opened her eyes. The stars and moon were out. She looked at her body, which had shrunk a little during the duration of her nap. Now the size of three mansions, she still took up the entire property ground with just her stomach, though her stomach didn't touch the edges nearly as much as they did before. Her body had even more rolls of fat at this point. Her numerous chins swayed in the wind. Looking at the fair, she noticed the fairgrounds were closing down, and everyone was heading home.<br>\r\nThe fair! The calico immediately sprang up, causing tremors in the ground. Finally! All of that napping, and she got to have round 2 with the fair. She was just about to roll over to the fair when she realized...</span></div></div>",

He was thirsty after his large meal, and besides that, his fur was covered in sticky fruit juice and other bits of food. A good cleaning was in order. Rows and rows of ice buckets brimming with sodas were waiting for him, almost begging him to drink them. Each individual bottle looked lonely and cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Templeton had a solution for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled over to the nearest bucket and pulled out a bottle of coke. After gnawing the cap off, he rested the bottle on his swollen gut and guzzled up the contents, giggling as the fizzy liquid tickled his insides. The sudden influx of fluid forced his belly to swell, and the food from his gorge dislodged ever-so-slightly, sloshing around inside of him. Enjoying the sensation, he gulped down a second soda, and a third, resting a paw on his stomach so he could feel it swell with every swallow. By the time he'd finished everything in the bucket, he was surrounded by empty bottles, he'd developed some severe hiccups, and his belly had bloated to nearly double its previous size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo,\" he said thickly, followed by a loud and near-painful hiccup. \"Not- <i>hiiicc</i>- thirsty anymore.\" He couldn't feel any solid food inside of him at all. The fullness he felt from the liquid was different from what he'd felt after filling himself with food- the food had made him feel stuffed and heavy, while the fluids just made him feel funny all over. The monstrous concoction of sugary drinks that he'd created in his belly almost seemed to have a life of its own, shifting gently back and forth as the liquid struggled to break free. His stomach ached from trying both to contain it and keep it still.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hiic</i>.\" Templeton grunted miserably, patting his stomach. He was able to sink his paws into his belly, causing it to change shape as the liquid shifted. \"At this- <i>hic</i>- rate, my stomach will- <i>hiiiicc</i>- run away from me. <i>Hiiic.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't far off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving into exhaustion, his stomach stopped trying to stop itself from going where it wanted to go. His enormous gut swayed to one side, and this time, it kept going. Even with his new girth, he wasn't heavy enough to stop his latest glut from dragging him off of the table and rolling him away into another part of the fair. He grunted in discomfort as he rolled his way down the midway, unable to grab any foothold, until finally, he crashed into something and righted himself. His belly quivered with triumph. Templeton groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally. <i>Hiiic.</i>\" This time, though, the hiccup stuck in his throat. The long roll had churned his beverage into a frenzy. The carbonation was bubbling furiously. Templeton licked his lips, opened his mouth, and indulged himself a long, throaty belch. The storm quelled, but only slightly. He was desperate to weigh himself down with some solid food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" he said. \"Where are we?\" Rubbing his watery eyes to clear them, he looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jaw dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth watered. </span></div></div>",

He could smell mountains of raw meat and sugary sweet sauce, but the thing that had gotten his attention was the stand's main attraction: a massive roasted pig, proudly displayed whole on a spit. Some fresh meat was just what he needed to weigh his bubbling stomach down and get his evening back on track. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hic</i>. Come on, stomach. <i>Hiiic</i>.\" With one mighty shove, Templeton's belly was carrying him towards his next meal. He crashed into the spit, and his weight sent the pig crashing to the ground. His belly's momentum kept him moving. Templeton tumbled forward and crashed into the pig, his stomach erupting in burbles and sloshes. He dug his claws into the meat to stop his stomach from dragging him away again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp close, the pig seemed massive, even bigger than Wilbur. It smelled delightful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This</i> will be a feast to remember,\" he sighed happily, and he sank his teeth deep into the pig's belly. His mouth immediately filled with succulent juices, and he groaned with pleasure at the taste. He tore a massive chunk of meat off the carcass and swallowed it whole. It fell into the liquid soup in his stomach with a noisy splash. Templeton grabbed a second mouthful, and a third. Because the chunks of meat were the only solid piece of food in his gut, he could feel them knocking against the walls of his stomach. His belly rumbled happily at the promise of a filling meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton attacked the roasted pig with his teeth and claws. Barbecue sauce dribbled over his face and fur. He was forced roll himself forward, on top of his massive gut, so he could better reach inside to the meatier parts of the pig. As he ate and his belly bulged outwards, all four of his feet left the ground, not that Templeton cared. When he'd eaten so much that the pig's belly was a thing of the past, he paused to indulge himself a loud belch. He dug his claws into the pig's thigh, and with a series of noisy sloshes, pulled himself over to the pig's haunches. Even those few inches were almost more than his feeble arms could handle- the meat in his belly had soaked up a good deal of the soda, and he was unbearably heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton gorged himself on the pig for hours, pausing only to shift his body once he'd picked an area clean, or to belch deeply to make room for more meat. So much eating and very little movement caused him to dramatically balloon up in size. He balanced himself precariously atop his churning, sloshing belly as he ate, patting what he could reach and giggling at what little chance he had of touching the ground again. Even so, he kept eating, even as his belly tightened up with fullness and it became harder and harder to swallow. He tore the last bite of spare rib off the pig's skeleton, and was forced to use both his front paws to shove the morsel down his throat.His gorge shifted to make room for it with a sickly<i> squelch</i>. Templeton woozily looked back and forth for where his gorge would take him next, only to be pleasantly surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no meat left. He'd already eaten it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost the entire pig had vanished into his belly- all that was left was the head, the curly tail, the feet, and a pile of bones, all held together by mere scraps of muscle sinew. The visual evidence of how much he'd eaten was overwhelming. Realizing that it was finally finished, his bloated stomach groaned with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton's mouth opened, and he released a massive, exhausted belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Urrrrrrrrrp</i>. What a night,\" he moaned, squinting his watery eyes to survey his handiwork.His belly had grown so much that it pushed him more than a foot off the ground. It was packed as full as he could get it and drum tight to the touch, which he verified with a few hearty slaps. He'd also massively bloated out on either side. His fat tail swished uselessly back and forth into the air. With a satisfied groan, Templeton dug his claws into the pig's head- the only thing heavy enough to act as a counterweight to his engorged belly- and slowly rotated his massive body to allow him to lie on his back, propped up against the bones. His stomach was finally allowed to expand freely, and it happily did so, bulging outwards another couple of inches. The overstuffed rat moaned happily at the release in pressure. His stomach rewarded his efforts with another heavy belch. Templeton licked his lips and savored the flavor of the roasted pig as it returned to his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...<i>urrrrrp</i>... good,\" he moaned. His belly was so big that it blocked his view of what was in front of him. A loud hiccup forced its way out of his overfull stomach, causing the whole mass to wobble. \"<i>Hiiiic</i>. This fair is the best- <i>hic</i>- thing that's ever-<i> hic</i>- that's ever happened to me.\" His uncontrollable hiccups made him giggle, and he slapped his belly again. At the spot he'd struck, a low gurgle began that slowly grew and spread up through his overstuffed stomach before it erupted from his mouth as another satisfied belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Urrrrrrrp</i>. I had no idea pigs tasted so-<i> hic</i>- good. No wonder- <i>hic</i>- Zuckerman wants to eat- <i>hic</i>- <i>hiiiic</i>! No wonder he wants to- <i>hic</i>- eat Wilbur. <i>Hic</i>! <i>Hiiic</i>! <i>Urrrrrp</i>.\" Templeton licked his lips again. As he spoke aloud of Wilbur's predicament, he remembered why he was here- to find a word for Charlotte. Now that he'd eaten his fill, should he fulfill his promise? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hic</i>. Well, anyway, I won't be- <i>hiiiic</i>- leaving this spot for a while,\" Templeton giggled, patting the swollen gray sphere that he'd turned himself into. \"<i>Hic. Hic. Hiiiilp</i>.\"   <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Templeton was so stuffed and bloated that he didn't even notice that he'd fallen asleep until he was rudely awakened again. His belly had gotten to work digesting his massive gorge, but it wasn't anywhere near finished yet. Even so, a thick layer of fat had settled over his entire body, and doubly so on his stomach. Templeton delighted in the soft, squishy feel as he gave his fatty stomach an affectionate squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his brain caught up, and realized why he'd been woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVERYBODY COME LOOK AT THIS RAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crowd of humans had gathered, and they were all staring. At <i>him</i>. He faintly saw flashes of light going off on the other side of his fat belly, and he realized they were cameras, just like the ones he'd seen humans use to take pictures of Charlotte's web. Templeton did not care for being the center of attention- he found he could get more eating done when he was alone. He was ready to clap his paws over his ears and go back to sleep when he realized what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He ate that whole pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get a picture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton took an interest. He perked up his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They should make this rat the fair mascot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look how big he is!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, seriously, isn't that what <i>you</i> feel like when you eat the food here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne voice, however, stood out from the crowd:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should enter him in the hot dog eating contest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton <i>really</i> took an interest at the word \"eating.\" He figured it had been at least a couple hours since he ate last, and he had room in his stomach now. The man who was talking was nibbling on a corn dog. His friend was skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would a rat know what to do in a contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All he has to do is eat. He's obviously good at it.\" Templeton silently agreed. \"I'm sure if you put some food next to him, he'd eat it. Look, he's awake.\" As if to demonstrate Templeton's eating prowess, the man handed Templeton his half-eaten corn dog. The rat gobbled it up without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know, Hank. People hate rats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the point of going to a state fair if you don't see crazy shit like this? Don't you want to see how many hot dogs this fat rat can eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton's mouth watered, and his belly growled. Yes, he did want to see how many hot dogs this fat rat could eat. Why waste precious calories looking for food if the humans would just give it to him? They obviously had more than enough of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Hank,\" the second man repeated, shaking his head. As more people arrived at the fair, an even bigger crowd gathered. Hank clapped his hands to get their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO WANTS TO SEE THIS RAT ENTER A HOT DOG EATING CONTEST?\" he shouted. The crowd erupted in cheers. Hank scooped up Templeton and his bowling ball sized stomach and began walking him to the midway. The crowd followed.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\nTempleton grinned greedily. He'd been expecting to have to wait until nightfall. Who knew he'd get to gorge himself again so soon?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Templeton was carried a few hundred yards before reaching a picnic table with a few human men seated around it. A massive banner over the proceedings proclaimed that Templeton had arrived at \"HUMBLE HANK'S HOT DOG EATING CONTEST!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hank, what the heck is that?\" one of the other participants asked. Hank plopped Templeton down on his belly at the end of the table. He was happy to be lying on his stomach- this was the best position for keeping food within reach of his mouth and paws. His hind legs, however, were back to hanging uselessly in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This rat ate a whole pig this morning,\" Hank said, poking Templeton's jiggling, sloshing belly. \"I decided to enter him in the eating contest with you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a <i>rat</i>? I thought it was a really fat woodchuck!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's a rat. See its tail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who wants to watch a rat eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All these people,\" Hank said, and he gestured at the crowd that was arriving to fill the seats. He once again clapped his hands to draw their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Humble Hank's humble hot dog eating contest!\" he shouted, to cheers and applause. \"We all know the rules. Last one to stop eating wins. If you throw up, you lose. The winner gets bragging rights and a coupon. Now, bring out the dogs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton turned his head the best he could to watch as some of the hot dog stand's employees began to bring out the hot dogs for the hot dog eating contest. His eyes glazed over in sheer ecstasy as a towering platter of hot dogs was placed in front of him, each one grilled to perfection and dripping with ketchup and mustard. Never could he have dreamed that the humans would up and give him such a bounty. He reached out his flabby arms, grabbed the closest hot dog he could reach, and pulled it into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rat says it's time to go,\" Hank laughed, \"so LET'S GO!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll sounds around Templeton faded away as he settled into the gorging of a lifetime. He swallowed the hot dogs in two or three bites at a time, massive gulps sending each mouthful into his hungry stomach. He demolished the first tray, and was immediately presented with a second one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis fair was a rat's paradise, indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rat seems to be keeping up with all of you,\" Hank chided the other contestants. The hot dogs churned inside Templeton's belly. His face was coated with mustard and grease. There was no end to the eating in sight. The second tray was finished, and a third was deposited in front of him. He was dimly aware that the crowd was cheering for him as another contestant dropped out. He didn't care about that, of course- he only cared about eating. He gave his stomach a reassuring pat as it filled back up and began to bloat outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more men dropped out of the contest as Templeton inhaled his fourth tray of hot dogs. He heard Hank whisper to one of the employees that they were going to need to bring bigger trays of hot dogs to satisfy his appetite. He grinned wolfishly and continued to eat. His belly had long since lost its squishy softness and was now a taut orb once more, growing bigger by the second and lifting him higher and higher off the table. He wasn't yet feeling the uncomfortable tightness he'd had after his gorge of the night before, however. His stomach had gotten accustomed to larger meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever <i>seen</i> a creature eat like this!?\" Hank shouted, and the crowd went wild. An employee staggered over to Templeton with a tray of hot dogs three times taller than the others. Templeton reached for a hot dog, yanked it out of the stack, and kept gorging. Each swallow made his belly quiver and expand. He was now as big as he'd been when he'd finished up last night, and he had every intention of pushing his limits even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last human contestant, a younger man who'd held out as long as he could, finally surrendered, and rushed to a nearby garbage can to throw up. Templeton felt a twinge of regret that the man had ruined what could have been enough food to stuff ten Templetons, but hey, he had all he needed right here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a winner! But the fat rat shows no sign of slowing down!\" Hank showed no sign of slowing down Templeton's supply of hot dogs, either.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn straight,</i> Templeton thought as he continued to stuff food down his throat. <i>As if any of these stupid humans could out-eat <b>me</b>. I'll be bigger than Wilbur at this rate.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank muttered a few words to another employee, and another tray of hot dogs emerged, piled even higher than the last one. At the same time, the employees were cleaning up the other contestants' areas, and bringing those leftovers to Templeton as well. He ate voraciously, his stomach bubbling and glorping and bulging with each new addition. Even though the contest was over, the crowd lingered, as if to see just how much this rat could eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the employees were ready to be done with the whole spectacle, and they hadn't used much care in stacking all of the food. As Templeton ate, the tower of hot dogs began to lean precariously towards him. Stuffed and woozy as he was, he didn't notice the trouble he was in, before the tower finally collapsed on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a happy groan, Templeton welcomed the rain of hot dogs, catching one in his mouth and swallowing it whole in one massive gulp. The avalanche knocked him backwards, rolling him into an upright position. He realized that his belly had bloated outwards so much that he was a little bit taller than before, though that was the least of his concerns. He belched loudly to make room- much to the delight of the crowd- and went back to gorging himself on everything he could reach. When he could no longer reach any food past his massive stomach, he kicked his fatty hind legs against the table until he rolled back forward onto his belly to resume the gorge. Templeton's stomach was bottomless. He would eat until someone made him stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank's earlier enthusiasm for the spectacle the rat had created was diminishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, Tom,\" he said. \"How many hot dogs do we have left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was it, boss,\" Tom said with a shrug. \"You said to keep feeding him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton gobbled up everything on the table until there was nothing left but himself, a massive, groaning gray orb surrounded by crumbs and grease stains. He dragged the last hot dog to his mouth and licked his lips. He was about to take a huge bite out of it when he was rudely interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TEMPLETON!? What did you do to yourself!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squinted his eyes at the interruption, and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Templeton squinted his eyes. He'd overstuffed himself so dramatically that his eyes were watering and his vision was blurry. It was Fern, the little girl who was Wilbur's friend at the farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this your rat, missy?\" Hank asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sir!\" said Fern. \"I mean, well, sort of. He lives on my uncle's farm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind getting him out of here before he eats me out of business?\" Templeton snickered and set to work eating Hank's last hot dog. When he'd swallowed the last bite, he licked his lips and let out a truly colossal belch. When he'd finished expelling the air from his bloated belly, he settled into a series of woozy hiccups.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sir. Sorry, sir!\" She grabbed a boy who Templeton didn't recognize, and begged him for help getting Templeton back to Wilbur's pen. Templeton couldn't ask for a better deal- the humans stuffed him to the brim with food, and now the humans were going to carry him back to Wilbur's pen so he could nap. This was shaping up to be the best day of his life. <i>Hic. Hic. Hiiiilp.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh- and take your prize, too,\" Hank snapped, and he threw a piece of paper at Templeton. It smacked him right in the face, and he peeled it off before looking at it. A coupon for \"Humble Hank's Hot Dog Stand.\" A slow, lazy grin spread across his fat face. He'd found some words for Charlotte, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFern's friend came back to the hot dog stand pushing a wheelbarrow. Templeton giggled. Laying on his stomach as he was, he didn't have much idea yet of how bloated he'd become. Apparently he was so massive now, they were going to have to <i>wheel</i> him back to the pen. Won't the pig and spider be surprised to see how much he'd accomplished in less than twenty four hours! <i>Hic</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, Fern and her friend rolled Templeton into the wheelbarrow. He ended up on his back with his belly bulging upwards, and oh my, was it huge. He was as big as a beach ball, and stretched just as tight. Every ounce of food in his belly was fighting for space. He patted his taut stomach and belched again, so deeply and loudly that the wheelbarrow rattled.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Do you have anything you can cover him up with?\" Fern's friend hissed. \"People are going to ask questions.\" Fern quickly took off her sweater and put it over top of the wheelbarrow, shielding Templeton from prying eyes. He hiccuped and the sweater bounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just get this over with,\" Fern sighed. They crossed the fairgrounds as quickly as they could, punctuated by noisy hiccups. Whenever the wheelbarrow hit an obstacle and jostled Templeton's engorged stomach, he'd let out a throaty belch. Templeton patted his massive stomach affectionately with one paw. The other was still clutching his prize coupon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Templeton heard the familiar creaking of the gate to Wilbur's pen being opened. Fern snatched her sweater back, and her friend tipped the wheelbarrow forward, sending Templeton rolling across the pen. The contents of his belly swirled around inside of him, massaging his overextended insides. He crashed into the corner of the pen, luckily propped upright, with his massive stomach groaning and bulging out in front of him. The two kids quickly took the wheelbarrow, closed the gate, and disappeared. Templeton peered around the pen through squinty, watery eyes. Wilbur was napping in his crate. At least, he was, until Templeton's massive gorge shifted, and he startled everyone awake with a raucous belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hiiiic</i>. I'm back,\" he slurred, licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Templeton!? Is that you!?\" Wilbur gasped. It wasn't a surprise that Templeton was unrecognizable in his current state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hic</i>. D'you mish me? <i>Hic. Hilp</i>.\" He'd eaten so much that his jaw and throat were exhausted, and he could barely speak properly. Charlotte peered over the edge of the rafters, and audibly gasped when she saw the sorry state that Templeton had gorged himself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This</i> is why you couldn't bring me back a word to save Wilbur's life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hic</i>. Relaaax, mishy. <i>Hic</i>. Brought a word. <i>Hic! Hiiiilp!</i>\" Templeton released his grip, and dropped the Humble Hank's coupon into the dirt. With both paws free, he set about contentedly patting his taut belly anywhere he could reach. His whole body quivered and bounced with every hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth did you eat?\" Wilbur asked. Templeton sighed with pleasure as he remembered the roasted pig he'd devoured. Now that he had Wilbur in front of him to compare, it was decided- the one he'd eaten was definitely bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You- pig- dun' wanna know,\" he slurred. Charlotte wrinkled her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humble- that should work. <i>Thank you</i>, Templeton.\" Templeton let out another nasty belch in reply. Wilbur wrinkled his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that it matters to you, but Charlotte made an egg sac last night.\" Templeton paused, considering this new information, then patted his stomach and let out an even nastier belch in reply. Charlotte looked at Wilbur and shrugged, as if to say,<i> what did you expect</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Templeton,\" she said diplomatically. \"What are your plans for this afternoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nap,\" said Templeton, with a wide yawn. \"Then- <i>hic</i>- gonna eat more. <i>Hic. Hiiiiilp</i>.\" Wilbur's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious. You're going to eat yourself to death.\" Templeton giggled at that, and gave his fat stomach some rough pats. Already, he could feel the soft gurgles and groans of digestion taking hold on his hot dog feast. He'd rest and digest, then awaken even fatter and be ready to gorge some more. The fair was three days long, after all. There had to be mountains of food he hadn't explored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton leaned back against the wall of the pen and passed into a deep, satisfied sleep.  </span></div></div>",

He SHOULD be thorough in his search, should he not?  That word could be at the bottom of such a bin, and he would be careless to pass it up!  Excitedly he scurried to the closest ledge to the bin he could find, a large wooden food stand.  He groaned and moaned hefting his increased weight up and up, bouncing his furry belly as he landed atop the counter.  His mid-section bulged from side to side as he scurried across it and looked down at the loaded goldmine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuck his nose in the air and inhaled the rotting filth inside and grinned wide and wider.  \"Here I come, little word!  Templeton, to the rescue!\" he pointed to the sky, then cannonballed right into the trash, landing on a fat, barely nibbled on sandwich.  \"No use letting all this waste away...after all, it might get in the way later on!\"  Templton's eye glinted with cleverness, he'd fooled the guilt out of his own self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little under an hour later, the trash bin wobbled to and fro before toppling over with a loud thud.  Litter of all sorts billowed out onto the ground, followed by a gray bowling ball, rolling forward once, twice and finally coming to a rest.  Templeton lay on his grotesquely swollen body looking as content as ever.  He licked his mouth for any escaping flavors in his fur, and squeezed at his bulk below him with his digits, a audible gurgling followed and Templeton erupted in a gasious belch.  The near blob of a rat had not entirely lied, however, he had found a word, or words.  He held in one hand badly nibbled cuttings with the phrases \"Salty\" and \"Delectable.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton looked down at the words and hiccupped, they were good words!  His ears twitched and he spewed forth another powerful belch into the night.  He'd done his duty, Charlotte never said WHAT words to find...she trusted Templeton enough to pick the right ones, right?  Templeton's mind began turning again, as he nuzzled into his fat flesh below him, he SHOULD think about looking for more words...just in case...right?   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With difficulty, Templeton hauled his bloated body up to the top of the gate of Wilbur\u2019s pen. Surveying the empty fair before him, Templeton\u2019s quick nose caught the innumerable scents of thrown away food and rotting garbage. Despite his huge stomach bubbling ominously beneath him, Templeton started to salivate at the thought of gorging himself yet again. Giving his burbling belly a hearty smack, Templeton looked in wonder, \u2018The goose was right. This fair IS a rat\u2019s paradise\u2026HILP!!...\u2019  He patted his bloated gut expectantly and began to lose himself in sheer anticipation. Pushing out his belly and massively hiccupping again, he continued, \u2018 by-by my humble Wilbur\u2026fare thee well Charlotte, you old schemer\u2026THIS will\u2026HILP!!... be a night to remember! <br>\r\n      Smacking his bubbling swell once again, Templeton jumped (or more appropriately, fell) down into a pile of rotting trash. Landing hard on his big belly with a squelch, Templeton lay dazed for a moment and then hauled himself to the pile of food that lay nearby. Taking handfuls of crumbs, seeds and filth as he went along, he stuffed all and sundry into his giant stomach. Finally reaching the pile of food, he began his work. Stuffing a whole wedge of swiss cheese down into his mouth, he chewed for a moment, put his hands on his belly, and swallowed. With a glop the cheese entered his stuffed stomach. Resting only a moment, Templeton pounced on all sorts of rotten goodies, his stomach growing larger and more bloated with every massive swallow. Finally, the large pile was no more and Templeton lay licking his paws and rested them on his gorged gut. Ignoring his stomach\u2019s vociferous groaning, Templeton spied an even larger pile of food ahead. Shaking his burbling belly, Templeton rolled over onto it and slowly dragged himself to it.<br>\r\n      The pile included a large bunch of half rotten grapes and whole hamburger soaked in grime. Templeton gulped, not realizing how massive the task was before him. Taking two of the oozing grapes in each hand, Templeton experimentally stuffed them into his mouth. His stomach bloated larger, burbled, and held. Delighted, Templeton crazedly dove into the massive pile. After finishing the Grapes he moved on to the cupcakes, mammoth breakfast specimens. Expecting them to be hard and stale, Templeton bit through the wrapper, only to find that the muffins were soaked through with grime and were as soft and tender as ever. Eagerly, Templeton attempted to haul his entire body within the cupcake and eat it from the inside out. However, his gigantically bloated belly prevented him. It was of no matter, for Templeton simply ripped large chunks from within the chocolate cupcake and stuffed them into his mouth. Amazingly, within a minute, the entire cupcake had disappeared within Templeton\u2019s cavernous stomach. Hiccuping contentedly, he took the cupcake wrapper and disposed of that as well. He repeated the practice on the remaining three cupcakes. His burbling, bubbling stomach was now nearly the size of a bowling ball. Templeton hiccupped massively and richly and looked greedily toward the burger. Taking a massive exploratory bite, he reveled in its grimy succulence. Hiccupping massively again he quickly polished off what remained of the burger. To his gluttonous delight, he found two more huge burgers, each one grimier and larger than the last. Templeton eagerly grabbed both burgers and glutted his huge stomach with abandon. Chunks of grime landed in his belly with sickening splashes until both had disappeared. Templeton\u2019s stomach paused and then started to churn fiercely, burbling and bubbling more audibly. He placed both hands on his stomach and grinned sloppily as his belly wobbled and bloated with what sounded like indigestion. With a loud glop, his stomach spilled gelatinously outward in a gargantuan, bubbling, quivering spare tire. He patted his gargantuan gut contentedly and rolled on his back, his stomach sloshing fluid-like on top of him. Rolling onto his stomach, Templeton dragged himself to three smaller piles and completed his \u2018treatment\u2019, the only sound louder than his munching was the progressively more insistent groaning, bubbling and glopping of his huge stomach. Finding himself next to a huge trash can, Templeton took a moment and rested against it\u2019s side. His burbling belly was sloshing his glut around. He had never eaten nearly as much as he had tonight\u2026he wearily gave his belly a contented slap, and thought of all he had eaten: \u2018hic\u2026HILP!!! What a feast, a real glut! I have never felt so\u2026hic\u2026HILP!! Bloated in my life!...hic\u2026HILP!!\u2019 <br>\r\nTempleton looked around him and found he was in the center of a veritable gold mine of trash and food. Not wasting another moment, Templeton groaned with expectant pleasure, despite his massively swollen state, and grabbed anything he could possibly reach and began to gorge his already overfull stomach again. Sausages, pieces of bread, cheese, disgarded hot-dogs, funnel cakes, melted ice cream all were quickly devoured by the insatiable Templeton. Gorging and glutting, more and more rotten food, filth and garbage was crammed into his titanically swollen and bloated belly. Finally, he had glutted himself to a nearly unopened box of munchkins. Quickly gnawing a hole through the paper box, Templeton hauled himself into the box and let himself truly go. Stuffing his stomach and glutting himself with increasing rapidity, he soon tumbled out clutching his massive gurgling belly with a conceited grin. He rolled into the large trash can and hit it hard straight on the center of his stomach with a squelch and glop. A large banana, some hotdogs and a large amount of other goodies wobbled and plummeted toward the overgorged rat. Templeton looked up, hesitated for a moment, and then slapped his impressive girth, held as much of his belly as he could, eagerly opened his mouth and let the banana enter him whole. The violent expansion of Templeton\u2019s already massive belly blasted his protective hands away as the Banana found its home with a titanic squelch. <br>\r\nTempleton was momentarily stunned. This was by far the largest thing he had ever attempted to ingest, he had vastly underestimated the banana\u2019s size, and now, he thought, was \u2018paying\u2019 the price. As the banana continued to settle, his belly expanded more and he hiccupped the most massive hiccup in his life. Nearly catatonic with his gorge, Templeton could only smile weakly and place his hands daintily on the sensitive, quivering, titanic mass of his stomach, which deafeningly gurgled and bubbled with every slight movement. Templeton rolled on his back, and his entire stomach sloshed and slopped on top of him, the full weight of his massive glutting nearly crushing him. His huge overgorged stomach, sloshed his night\u2019s gluttony sickeningly as it attempted to digest this massive over input of richness. Templeton\u2019s gurgling gut then sloshed away from him and pulled him in an upright position. Templeton struggled to hold this position, but was forced down upon his own overinflated mass. Despite all he had stuffed himself with, Templeton still saw more gorging around him. He managed to slosh himself upright and run on his hind legs for a short distance, where he collapsed on another large pile of rotten food and sundry trash. Not thinking another minute, Templeton lost himself again in glutting and gorging. He stuffed in his mouth anything he could get his hands on, even a whole apple, one of the largest Templeton had ever seen. He pulled it onto his massive swell and just ate and ate until nothing but a thin core remained. Templeton\u2019s Stomach was now truly gargantuan, becoming nearly liquidlike in consistency and burbling mightily. Having been glutted and over filled, overgorged and overfed many times over, Templeton\u2019s great bloated belly still called for more gorging and further overfeeding, and doubtless, Templeton eagerly acquiesced to its requests. The more he stuffed into his belly, the more he glutted himself, the more woozy and drunken he became, hiccupping massively and uncontrollably, and the more he thought his overfull stomach needed. After much more gluttony, Templeton finally rested again against the huge trash can: \u2018hic\u2026hic\u2026HILP!!! What a night\u2026never have I come close\u2026hic..hic\u2026HILP to glutting so much\u2026hic\u2026HILP\u2026a rea gorge\u2026hic\u2026hic\u2026HILP\u2026everything is SO RICH...HILP!!!!!\u2019 Templeton stuffed some more food into his blob of a belly and looked up greedily at the Trash Can\u2026should he stuff himself and perhaps not get out for a long time? His stomach was already vastly over gorged and dangerously overglutted, but this seemed not to disturb Templeton, who casually stuffed a large hotdog down his throat. Slamming his hands into his gargantuan, bubbling, burbling corpulent mass of semi-indigested gorge that sloshed in his stomach. He decided to\u2026      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Had he not been able to sink his claws into the cloth of the tent next to it, he would never have been able to scale it. Even so, it was quite a feat as his massive stomach bobbed below him, sloshing loudly as it shook.  Finally, Templeton released the tent, and the rat dropped into his new feast with a loud \"GLORCH-gurgle.\"  His gut released a long, low moan of discomfort, but it was cut short as Templeton sunk his paws into it, shaking it around noisily until it began to grumble.  Deciding it was a hungry growl, the rat tilted a large cup upwards, downing the warm, rich contents of an unappreciated milkshake.  It gurgled around as Templeton reached for a bunch of five old bananas.  He squished the contents into his awaiting mouth, swelling his gigantic belly many times further and causing thick glopping noises to issue from his already-loud burbling belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contents of this trash can were almost entirely food, and what wasn't were mere paper wrappers already soaked in grease.  And as such, Templeton shoveled food into his maw as fast as he could, causing his gut to groan even louder.  The rat burrowed into the pile, submerging himself in food.  When he reached the bottom of the can, he looked up, seeing the hole he'd made as a tunnel with a tiny light at the end.  And now, the only way to see that light again was to eat his way out.  His gorged belly bubbled in warning, indigestion already taking hold.  Still, soggy french fries, remnants of ice cream delicacies and all matter of unknown fried foods slid down his throat.  Occasionally he literally stuffed his hands in his mouth to force his feast into his protesting stomach.  His complaining gut felt ready to burst, but the rat made no efforts to stop, so intoxicated in his gluttony he thought every noise of indigestion was a demand for more food.  Templeton instead enjoyed the food rushing into his gut, bloating him further and further and his belly rumbled ready to rupture!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, strange noises could be heard from the trash can.  Multiple moans layered themselves over burbles, and a slow, rhythmic sloshing made itself known.  A gurgling groan squeezed itself from the blob of furry lard filling the trash can, before the face of Templeton moaned himself in blubbery bliss.  His grumbling, bubbling belly shifted continuously inside.  Templeton could feel his intestines sliding unhappily and his stomach twisted and whined deeply.  All the while his gut glorped away, swirling and sloshing his impending obesity around.  Templeton would have continued his feast, but his sheer weight rendered him immobile.  \"Hic...  Hic...  HIIIILP!!!  Ohhhhhhh...  Hic-HILP!  I feel like I might explode... hic...  hic... HILP!  But-HIC-HIIILP there\u2019s still so much more I have to eat...  HIIIILP!!!\u201d  Still, digestion took a lot of energy, and it wasn\u2019t long before he found himself drifting into an intoxicated slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was at the edge of the fair, Templeton was amazingly able to rest in the can, undisturbed as his belly tried to tackle his meal.  When the rat woke, he was only slightly able to move more, the liquid contents of his belly transformed into jiggling adipose.  His gut had barely shrunken at all with digestion, almost all of it depositing itself around his body, particularly his stomach.  With a great deal of effort, the rat was able to tip the can, leaving him and his belly to spill out across the ground in a symphony of blurps and sloshes.  With his flabby arms he rubbed what belly he could reach, giving it a squeze that resulted in a torrent of gurgles and grumbles..  And then it happened: a real rumble of hunger.  Despite hours before being on the brink of bursting, his stomach was demanding more food, ready to grow even larger.  The colossal gorge had left his stomach conditioned to being titanically overstuffed, and Templeton grinned.  Every night forth would be one to remember.  His gut grumbled and growled at the idea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, however, he was faced with a new problem.  With his belly this huge, yet so hungry, how could he move to feed it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His stomach was growing larger and rounder as time went on. It was aching slightly, but he was oblivious to the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton was still munching on whatever he could get. During the night, he had prepared a humongous pile of the food he could find, and when he'd gathered it all, he sat back and ate it all as quickly as he could, and he wasn't done yet. He now moved on to a giant banana, which he pealed deftly, and he tossed it in the air, tossing the peel aside. Clutching his belly, he let the banana land in his wide open mouth, allowing it to slide down his throat whole, catapulting his belly out a few more inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not satiated, he picked up a doughnut and ate it as fast as he could, swallowing the chocolate-coated pastry, adding two more inches to his stomach.

The rat placed a paw at the tense balloon that swelled out from his gut, and gave a quick belch to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his stomach give somewhat, and as long as he had room, he felt he hungry. At this point even the gluttonous rat was astonished at the powers of his stomach, and only felt a twinge of fear in the pit of his stomach that he might never be full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being in the pit of his stomach, it was drowned out by a great feast of food inside of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResolve, however, is one thing. Physics is quite another. His stomach, an immobile mass, now outnumbered him probably by a factor of three to one. But such was the factor of a true glutton; nothing would stand in his way even if a morsel of food could be crammed down his gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his haunches were still in contact with the ground, he made a first attempt at lifting himself up and standing like he was pregnant with a baby cow, leaning back and straining as much as his rat legs would. All the muscles tensed, and he even managed to lift himself up an inch, before crashing down with a jelly-like noise and much content shifting of his bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton looked woozy with the pressure to his body and burped a few times, before being lifted by the momentum in a rolling motion. He stopped at the top of his stomach, using it like a bed for a moment, cluthing it before getting an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rocked himself back and forth before toppling forward, getting squished by his belly for a second before righting up again, and, in doing so, managed a sort of rolling motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was destiny, as it certainly wasn't skill, because he rolled forward without any means or plans on getting to anywhere. So it must have been destiny, then, that he landed at the watermelon vendor at the far end of the row of food vendors. Having stuck to the places where the humans ate (the picnic areas and such) he hadn't even collected the garbage from the vendors, much of which wasn't packed away and simply left to rot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed into a leg of the watermelon cart, and the whole table came crashing down, and before he knew what was going on he had rolled and sunk his teeth directly into the rind of a fat, juicy, partially rotten watermelon. It was big even by watermelon's standards, making it almost twice even the bloated rat's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could he do? One doesn't turn away such fortune. He bit into the rind, only tasting a bit of the pink flesh on the other side in his mouthful, and swallowed it. His stomach got almost imperceptibly smaller from this bite. It would take a lot of eating to get it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chewed a hole in the green rind knowing there was no way to get inside. He swallowed the seeds, trusting the power of his rat stomach to digest them. Or let them grow in the compost in his stomach; it didn't really matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery swallow bloated him more, and every swallow was bigger than the least. He chewed through the rind to get the watery flesh underneath, and practically flowed through his gullet into his awaiting hungry disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he was done. He had eaten the whole watermelon, and was resting on top of a bloated light gray stomach now the size of three bowling balls, churning beneath him. He smiled conceitedly, burping up great quantites of gas from his stomach, and patted it in a congratulatory way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt at his stomach, same as before.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pulling himself over the fence was a laborious task for one so big. His muscles burned as he pulled his bulk with all his strength, and when he reached the top, he allowed momentum to pull him down in a moaning and burbling symphony of sloshes. His belly smacked the ground, and his blubbery hide quarters wobbled in the air. Some of the fat on his back sinked down to the back of his neck, but as Templeton pulled himself, it soon was evenly distributed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the loud glop from the rat's impact, the pig and the spider turned to the fence to find their incredibly over weight friend. Both at a loss for words, they could only stare at the giant rat in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy to see me,\" Templeton woozily said, hiccuping afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness, what have you done to yourself,\" said Charlotte. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What every rat's dreamed of doing. I just got to be the first. To gorge without stop.\" The fat rat lied his back on the fence, allowing his strength to return and his enormous belly to freely slosh and relax in peace. \"Oh if only you'd been there. Such feasting and coursing should never go unnoticed. I'm a champion among rats, and this awesome stomach is my reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reward,\" snorted Charlotte as she flew over to the bloated rat, using a string of web and a small breeze to take her over. \"It's a reward for your gluttony and lack of self control. You should be ashamed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton hiccuped, and grinned sloppily through half closed eyes at the spider atop of his large swell. Patting it, it sloshed and jiggled about. \"I knew you'd like it. You don't need to hide the fact you're proud of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too bloated to know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon, admit it, you like the new Templeton. I'm three times the rat I'd used to be, and tomorrow night I'll double, no, triple my size. I'd be the envy of rats everywhere.\" Templeton let out a pleasurable sigh as he squeezed his bulk through shut eyes. \"My stomach can handle anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You disgust me. You do nothing with your life but eat. It's a pretty pathetic existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me toots,\" Templeton sneered, \"when you're a rat its the only existence, and the greatest. Can you say for yourself you do what you love for a living...I don't think so. Now if you excuse me,\" the rat grunted as he groaned and pulled himself forward, then pulled himself to the crate, \"I have to get ready for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte shook her head in disappointment, while Wilbur still remained silent. With his back to the crate, Templeton rested his paws on his cavernous stomach, his body nearly taking up the whole crate. He massaged and ran his paws through the soft furry mass; feeling at all he had gorged, and licking his lips at all he would gorge tonight, and the next night, probably for the rest of his life in the wonderful place. This was the life for him, a life filled with endless happiness. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Night came once again as well as the riches that came with it. A loud bubbling gurgle suddenly erupted from Templeton\u2019s immense stomach, causing his whiskers to twitch and eyes to blurrily return to the waking world. Taking notice at the lack of light surrounding him and the snoozing of his two companions, he yawned and stretched his limbs as much as his fat immeasurable body would allow him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother perfect night to glut with abandon, right stomach,\u201d he said patting his now blob like expanse of blubbery fur. Much like earlier this day, his sleeping allowed all the food in his gut to convert into fat, giving him much more belly to lug around and admire. But more importantly, his now semi emptied stomach (which had been widely stretched out) would be able to hold more food than when he started. Lifting his head and sniffing the mouth watering aroma\u2019s that trickled the fresh air, the obese rat licked his lips and rubbed his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets see how much fatter we can make you tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking and pushing himself forward, gut sloshing vociferously, he made his way to the wooden gate, struggling to lift himself over. He giggled at all the noise his stomach made getting to the other side. The pig and spider certainly deserved as much. Even at his current size, being a pest to the two entertained him. He was vermin for a reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rat licked his lips, \u201cThis fair is a rat\u2019s paradise,\u201d he said in ecstasy upon viewing all the food just directly to the stands in front of him. Patting his stomach, he immediately went to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing onto a table, he dispensed of a few pies scattered about. The tin pans easily bent under the sheer weight of his belly, allowing what remained of a pie to slide directly down his gullet. Blueberry, rhubarb, coconut, and banana cream began filling him, adding to his belly's soft jello like manner. Once finishing the last pie, he licked some cream from a paw while placing the second on the vast tub of lard covered in fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside him was an unopened box of popsicles. Probably for some children earlier in the day but left behind. Pulling it toward his gut, he opened the box, revealing the treasure trove of frozen goodness. Each was about his height, and no wider than his chubby arms. Taking one, he shoved it down his mouth whole, along with the stick itself. Continuing to do this with the others, his stomach was unable to adjust to a long solid object entering it, and so kept the popsicles shape, creating small bulges around his body. It entertained Templeton to try and push them in, but he wasn\u2019t concerned. As time continued, they would melt, and he\u2019d become fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the table was a large cart which carried hot dogs and corndogs, with a couple packs of buns and pickles on top of it. Waddling over, he shoved the buns within the cart, and opened the jar of pickles. Sticking his chubby face within the hole of the jar, he chewed on the tips of the pickles. Greedy in his gluttonous pursuit, he then tilted the jar upward, causing it to slip down his head and wedge against his body. Disoriented, he ended up falling within the cart, landing softly on a bunch of franks. Drinking the juice and polishing off the remainder of the pickles, he lifted the jar off him and began work on the dogs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, hot dogs and corndogs were fed to him. It seemed he swallowed quicker than he could breathe. But still, Templeton didn\u2019t let up. Not even the ketchup and mustard bottles had the pleasure of his mercy. After a mirthful twenty minutes, the side door of the cart opened up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Hic* What a glut,\u201d *squelch*. The weight of his stomach was too much to keep himself from falling, but enough to cushion his decent. \u201c*Hic* I\u2019ve gorged so much already, but haven\u2019t even made a dent in the feast this fair offers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving grown larger and wider than ever, Templeton was still determined to gorge further. His stomach had expanded as wide as a watermelon, perhaps more so. This only continued to fuel his apatite. The fatter he got, the fatter he wanted to become. So, continuingly moving forward, he searched for the next big thing. He drank from a spoiled carton of milk, to an old milk shake, and even a picture of what he thought was lemonade, which had a little more tang than he bargained for. In his attempts to stand in order to get a better view of his surroundings, he lost his balance and knocked over garbage cans, unloading a treasure of goodies for him to further gorge upon. Sweet succulent grease passed his lips as soaked chewed hamburgers glazed his tongue. The sweet cinnamon of churros delighted his belly, and corncobs sprinkled with spice caused pleasurable churning that made his belly slosh and burble blithely. Donuts, boiled eggs, cheese cake, cotton candy, cream, rotten vegetables, banana peels, anything and everything Templeton was able to lay his paws on, was shoved down his gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no sense of time while delighting himself on the riches of nightly glutting, Templeton chose to rest for a couple minutes\u2026near something to chew over of course. Resting his plump back against a pile of cups and wrappers, which crinkled and cracked under his immense weight, he gently chewed on a hefty portion of a banana. His eyes were half closed, and expression still as exuberant as before. Lazily he wrapped an arm around the banana while still chewing away at it, and plopped a paw atop of his incalculable, otherworldly stomach, moaning in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Hic* What glorious gorging,\" he spoke with his mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffing the rest of the banana along with the peel within his gaping maw, he tapped the gelatinous sloshing ocean of fat with both pairs of digits. \u201c*Hic* I never believed I\u2019d *Hic* become this fat, and I have you to *Hic* thank for it.\u201d He gave his stomach a series of slaps, causing his whole body to tremble, mainly his mid section\u2026which was comprised of 90% of his physical being. \u201cAs fat as I *Hic*have become, there\u2019s still more to glut myself with.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of further engorging caused his belly to tremble in a cacophony of bubbling sloshes. Templeton shook his head, \u201cYou\u2019ll get fatter *Hic* because I say you will. Now here, have some *Hic* more.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling toward him the rest of the banana rind he took the first from, he relaxed as he comfortably began inserting whole each banana down his gullet effortlessly; continuing to gain in size. Never in texts books or the history of the world was a rat meant to become as incredibly overweight as Templeton, but the rat\u2019s insatiable swell was unlike the world ever knew. Drunk and oblivious to his own health, the rat only cared about how much more he could fill into his overburdened stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoveling the final banana into him, the overfed rat smacked his lips, as the delicious morsel expanded him out further. Wearing a sloppy grin, he pulled up some of the blubber atop of his legs, setting them free, then stroke at his corpulent gut. \u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t *Hic* so bad was it? Well, *Hic* break time is*Hic* over. Now,\u201d Templeton placed a paw on his chubby cheek, the other resting on his immensely plush chest, \u201c*Hic* were to glut next.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Of victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke a few hours later to cold wet drops splashing into his furry belly. Opening his eyes, he saw that the sky had filled with dark clouds. There was a mild commotion just outside the trash can as a group of humans was walking by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on kids,\u201d came a voice, \u201cThe fair\u2019s closing for the rest of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw\u2026\u201d whined a smaller voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll be open again tomorrow. But we gotta get out now,\u201d replied the first voice as the group of humans moved away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Templeton rubbed the sleep from his eyes and moved to get a better view of what was happening. He shifted his great bulk forward and, with great labor and careful not to tip the trash can over, climbed up the side to peer out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom where the trash can was, Templeton could see much of the fairgrounds. Sure enough, a steady stream of humans was making its way for the exits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crack of thunder from the sky behind him made Templeton turn his head around. There, he saw a dark thundercloud rolling across the sky, heading straight for the fairgrounds. It seemed the coming storm had forced the fair to close for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to hold his size up much longer, Templeton let go, dropping into the trash with a plop. He was surprised by the sensation of his new bulk wobbling after landing. After a moment, his belly stopped sloshing, but the raindrops kept beating down on his pelt. It was raining harder now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought popped into his head that curled the corners of his mouth into a smirk. \u201cFair closing means no humans,\u201d he said to no one in particular. \u201cNo humans means no hiding. I can eat whatever I want, wherever I want. And another whole day before Charlotte needs words. Why this whole stinking fairground is mine for the taking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed as he began rocking the can over. It was easier to knock over than the first one, because of his added mass. A few rocks and the whole can dumped its contents, rat and all onto the dirt path. Giggling, he righted himself and brought a clawed finger to his second chin as he contemplated where he would go first. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Surely there was something in there he could eat, and besides, he could use the shelter from the rain. He glanced all around one more time to make sure the coast was clear, then began making his way toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was still too immense for him to easily crawl on all fours. But Templeton quickly discovered that if he walked on his two hind legs and arched his back a bit, he could move along more quickly. It was still difficult, slow going with his distended gut stretched before him, wobbling just above the ground as it pulled him forward. His tail swished behind him in a fruitless effort to counterbalance the rocking movements of his off-center mass. And every few steps his balance would fail him and he\u2019d stumble forward into the muddy, rain-soaked path. But the discomfort and inconvenience of toppling into his belly would always quickly give way to a fit of giggles as Templeton marveled at how impressively he\u2019d grown in so short a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my,\u201d he laughed to himself after falling forward yet again, his hind legs bicycling in the air, knees kneading into his soft sides as he tried to rock himself backward. \u201cThis is going to take some getting used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHind feet finally back on the ground, he straightened his knees, hefted his belly off the ground with a grunt, bent his back, waited a moment to ensure his balance was right, then began making his way forward again. He moved more deliberately now, his gait a slow waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was glad to have checked for all the humans to have left, because reaching the first building took much longer than expected. Once there, his ratty instincts took over and he slid under the floorboards, looking for a way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t know it, but the building he had chosen was a\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The air was cold around Templeton\u2019s snout as he pushed it out through a gap in the floorboards. Much colder than it was outside. He peeked his head out and tried to get a look around, but the room was dark, and much of his view was blocked by boxes. There was no sound except the constant hum of an air conditioner and the patter of the rain on the roof. There were no sounds of humans though, and although he couldn\u2019t place a finger on what exactly, he knew he smelled some kind of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gap in floorboards was large, and would have more than allowed him to pass through just a day before, but now he wasn\u2019t so sure. It certainly wouldn\u2019t be easy. He put his front paws at the openings of the hole on either side of himself and began to push down into his paws to lift himself through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis enormous width almost immediately filled the gap. He pushed and strained, forcing more and more of his belly up over the lip of the floorboard. But before even his widest point could clear the hole, he could push himself no further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet kicked helplessly at the air in the gap between the building and the ground outside, but found nothing to push off of. Deciding to give up and turn back, he tried to force his front paws back through the gap to try to pull himself back down, but could find no space that hadn\u2019t already been filled by his bulk. He could shove his fingers between his body and the wood, but not far enough to get a grip on anything. He was stuck right where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton began to panic. This was bad. Desperately, he reached out for a nearby box that had earlier blocked his vision, hoping to find something inside to help. His claw caught a corner of the box, shearing it off. He tried to toss the scrap away, but it stuck to his paw. He looked at his paw and saw that the inside of the scrap was a glob of a yellowish creamy substance, mostly solid in the frigid air but melting around his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sniffed it. It couldn\u2019t be. Could it? He shoved his paw into his mouth and devoured the substance, scrap and all. <br>\r\nIt was! Butter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton looked at the box and saw that where his claw had torn open the box it had exposed a huge slab of butter. He lurched forward, swiping his claws at it, getting them covered in the stuff, making them incredibly slippery, then began massaging the space where his belly met the floorboard, smearing it with the butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then put his paws at either side of the gap and pushed once again. And slowly, but surely, more of him slid through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, ho! This is incredible!\u201d he laughed. He repeated the process over the next few minutes, grabbing chunks of butter, spreading them over his belly, and sliding out a fraction of an inch at a time. More and more of the rat spilled out over the floor around the hole, like a too-large muffin baking in a tiny tin. His gray coat was dripping with butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got further, he was able to reach more butter from the box, popping large chunks of it into his own mouth between rubbing it over his fur. \u201cOne good turn deserves another,\u201d he laughed as he sucked a hunk of butter half the size of his head off his paw. \u201cI helped myself, so now I just have to help myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long struggle, prolonged by his snacking, he finally popped free after one final push, sliding across the floor on his butter-slick gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he stopped sliding, his face froze into a look of terror. There, looming before him was a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was it? It was shaped exactly like a human, but was standing perfectly motionless. And its skin, it\u2019s hair, it\u2019s clothes, it\u2019s shoes were all the same creamy beige color. Templeton\u2019s fear melted away into curiosity: it couldn\u2019t be, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rocked backwards, planted his feet and hefted his belly off the ground. Its slippery surface popped off the floor with a wet \u201cthock!\u201d He rocked back on his hips and waddled around to the front of the figure. He burst into a wide grin when we realized what he was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat will you humans think of next?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a statue of a farmer, carved entirely out of butter. Standing beside it that was a sculpture of a dairy cow, also made of butter. There were other objects in the room, glass milk bottles, tin pails, a short three-legged stool, all arranged in a nearly-finished tableau facing a floor-to-ceiling glass panel that split the room in half so that spectators could see. On the opposite wall, behind the statue, was a large slab of butter with the words, \u201cThank You, Dairy Farmers\u201d carved into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor among the bottles were sculptors\u2019 tools and dozens and dozens of boxes of butter just like the one Templeton had torn into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle drips slid between his fingers as Templeton rubbed his paws together and looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, which of you should I eat first?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The statue held a real pitchfork in one hand, and had the other resting on the back of the cow sculpture. Templeton looked up at the farmer statue\u2019s face, chiseled into a rather serious, proud, almost heroic stare, as if looking out over some very important work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft. Doesn\u2019t look like any farmer I know,\u201d he said. \u201cNot nearly dopey enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped forward and touched the booted foot with an extended claw. The surface of the sculpture was extremely slippery, but the refrigerated air in the room kept the butter quite solid. Still, with his new weight, he was sure it wouldn\u2019t hold him if he tried to climb it. He would have to eat from the bottom up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a few steps backwards toward the three-legged stool and wrapped his tail around one of its legs. He dragged it right next to the statue\u2019s leg then released his tail<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to stop once I get going, I\u2019ll just climb right up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t quite sure he meant that, as surveyed the statue one last time. It was quite enormous, easily too big to eat all at once. \u201cStill, it\u2019s good to have goals,\u201d he said, he patting his stomach and smiling. And with that, he lunged into the foot of the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a ravenous attack, no plan, no logic, no strategy, just trying to get as much of the butter into himself as he could. Templeton was a whirlwind of eating, biting directly into the statue while simultaneously shearing off chunks with his claws and shoving them into his mouth. A near constant spray of butter chunks flew out of his ever working mouth, coating what little of his fuzzy belly wasn\u2019t already soaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon settled into a rhythm, finding that he could get larger and larger chunks down his throat if he first bit off a piece from the statue and worked it over with his teeth and tongue until it was practically liquid. He would gulp, coating his throat in the slippery butter. Then the big chunks he pushed in with his hands would slide right down with one gulp. <br>\r\nHe found himself challenging himself, straining his jaw open wider and wider than ever before as he tore off larger and larger wads of the statue and hurled them down his throat. It was like a game. And he was always winning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach groaned and he pulled his head back to look at how far he had gotten on statue. Most of one booted foot was gone, from ankle to toe. The space where the statue\u2019s boot had been just moments ago was larger than Templeton himself had been before arriving at the fair. He looked forward at his gut and was shocked by how much larger it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down with a weighty thud. Even with his hind legs splayed out at a slight angle, the belly now nearly came all the way to the claws on his hind paws. It looked indeed like he had swallowed a whole average sized rat just since coming into the room. was an amazing sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I could get that big old sign back there to Charlotte, I would,\u201d said Templeton, scooping flecks of butter off his furry chest with his greasy fingers and shoving them into his mouth. \u201cThe four best words I could ever hope to find are \u2018Thank You Dairy Farmers.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he reached out with his claws and popped off the entire heel and much of the shin of the statue \u2013 a chunk far larger than any he had swallowed before. He took a deep breath, and crammed the entire thing into his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWHAM!\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nTempleton\u2019s head whipped around at the sudden sound, the statue\u2019s pitchfork had come loose and slammed into the ground. He looked up and saw the statue teetering slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d He realized he had gotten greedy \u2013 breaking off the rest of the foot had made the statue unstable. It was rocking slightly and could fall at any moment. With all these bottles and pails around, if it fell, someone would surely hear the sound, even with the fairgrounds nearly empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could Templeton do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sculpture teetered more wildly, about to fall over at any moment. Templeton gasped and staggered backwards behind the wooden stool in a panic. He had to stop it, but he didn\u2019t know how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sculpture finally lost its balance completely and began falling toward the bloated rat. Templeton leapt backwards with surprising speed given his bulk. The statue crashed into the stool just below hip level and flipped upside down, and Templeton\u2019s eyes widened as he saw the statue was now falling directly toward him, head first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the world seemed to go into slow motion and the butter sculpture seemed to hang in midair. Had any other creature found themselves in Templeton\u2019s position, they would have run to get out of the way. But Templeton wasn\u2019t like any other creature. A different instinct took over as Templeton realized that there was one thing that he alone could do to prevent disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton threw himself onto his rump, splayed his front paws to his sides to brace himself, and at precisely the right moment, opened his jaw wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact of the statue into Templeton\u2019s mouth sent the rat sliding across the floor and into the wall, and the second impact into the wall forced his head to buck forward, sending even more of the slippery statue into it.<br>\r\nWith a muffled gasp, Templeton realized he had done exactly what he intended: caught the falling statue in his mouth. It had happened so fast he could barely believe it had happened. But there he was, the whole statue sticking out of his mouth with nowhere to go but in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his tongue, he felt the lump that was the statue\u2019s nose. His cheeks bulged enormously to match his incredible gut. His eyes were bulging too as he strained to control what was happening. He had quite literally bitten off more than he could chew. The statue was stuck in his throat good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted his chin toward the ceiling so that gravity could help pull the rest of the head into his butter-slick throat. He watched as a few inches of the statue slid in slowly, revealing slightly more of the ceiling beyond it. After a moment, the rat\u2019s jaw could relax somewhat as it narrowed around the statue\u2019s neck. His snout, lips and cheeks rested against the shoulders of the farmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton took his first easy \u2013 well, easier \u2013 breaths since the statue began to fall. This wasn\u2019t comfortable, and what would come next would be even harder still. He could work his jaws through where they were now, basically biting off what was already in his mouth and throat. But he wouldn\u2019t be able to control the remainder of the statue with his arms once he bit through, and it would just come crashing down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he realized, the most powerful tools at his disposal were his mouth, throat and gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no turning back now. The only safe thing to do was to swallow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton took another deep breath, then widened his jaw and began sucking the statue down. With one gulping inhalation, he drew the shoulders down into his maw. He shuddered as his own body heat softened what of the statue was already in his stomach, making room for what was to come. He hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept his back and legs perfectly still, afraid that any motion besides the rhythmic gulping and slurping would cause the statue to topple over.  And him with it, because after all, at this point, he was rather at its mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d he thought, \u201cit\u2019s at mine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther and further, the statue slid out of Templeton\u2019s vision and into his mouth. Things slowed for a moment as his jaw widened over the farmer\u2019s paunch. Templeton\u2019s front paws reached up and sunk into the butter, forcing it down into his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick snort of relief forced its way out of Templeton\u2019s nose as he felt his lips curl around the narrower waist of the sculpture. He was now over the hump. For his jaw, at least. His stomach still had to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea how his belly was handling all of this mass. He could feel it straining as it filled with the semisolid butter and splaying out over more and more of the floor, but he couldn\u2019t see it over the statue legs that still filled much of his vision. Though he couldn\u2019t see it, he began working over the expanse of his belly \u2013 well, what he could reach of it \u2013 with his slippery front paws, trying to further soften the butter that was filling him like a balloon. He didn\u2019t know if it was working, but it certainly felt good feeling his fingers sink into his greasy, furry mass then having the skin pop back out tight as he released his hands. The sensation was enough to briefly distract his mind from the exhausting work of gulping, sucking, slurping away at the butter sculpture as his body drew it further and further in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the width of the statue\u2019s midriff disappeared into him and all he was left with was the statue\u2019s legs, it briefly occurred to Templeton that he could now easily break off the legs and toss them aside without risk of making much noise. Somewhere deep within his aching, straining belly came a rumble, almost like agreement. Like his body was warning him not to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as the gag reflex that would have prevented him from starting on this journey had been obliterated, so too had whatever base instinct keeps a creature from eating beyond its belly\u2019s ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides,\u201d he thought, \u201cwhy let this go to waste?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe relaxed his throat, thinking that gravity would do the trick. But there wasn\u2019t enough statue left and there was too much inside of him pushing back. He reached above his head and plunged his paws up to their wrists into the legs of the statue. With his throat as relaxed as possible, pulled his arms downward, into his mouth, shoving ounce after ounce of creamy butter through his slickened throat into his straining belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe plucked his arms out, reached up again, and \u2013 ignoring the incredible strain from his abdomen \u2013 shoved the buttery mass in one more time, this time so far that his jaw was able to close around the stump of the foot he\u2019d eaten off earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just a single butter shoe sticking out of his mouth, he rolled his head forward and was surprised to find resistance from the shoe as it bumped against something. My belly, he realized. It now towered over him. With a smile at the corner of his stretched mouth, he leaned his head further forward. Pushing off his belly, the shoe slid into Templeton\u2019s throat, and he swallowed it whole with one final \u201cgulp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis throat finally clear for the first time since the statue fell into his mouth, Templeton let out a strained gasp. He wasn\u2019t sure how long it had taken \u2013 a few dozen seconds, maybe just over a minute. But to his aching body, it felt like it had taken an hour to consume the statue. Every fiber of every inch of his body was sore and strained from what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had done it. And it felt incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept his eyes shut for a moment, breathing shallowly. Every breath, every tiny twitch of a muscle sent ripples across his enormously swollen body. He felt straining sensations, not just across the furry surface of his body, but throughout the entire enormous volume that was him. The slow, dull churning of his abdomen, the almost creaking tightness of his skin \u2013 for a moment he felt every part of himself. A buttery froth coated his muzzle, face and chin, and little flecks and chunks littered the floor about him, but for the time being he was too exhausted to even lick it off, much less grab those pieces off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes. His vision now clear without the statue in the way, he tried to regard his body. But he couldn\u2019t because of, well, his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his position seated against the wall, his belly bulged out titanically before him. It arced upward above his head, where the boot had briefly rested before, but extended up beyond that as well. He had no idea how far forward it must extend, but when he wiggled his toes, he felt his claws scritching into a point not even a fraction of the way down it\u2019s length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was enormous. Larger than any rat had ever been or hoped to be. Bigger than most humans, even. And certainly bigger than any creature he\u2019d met before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he thought glancing over to the other sculpture. \u201cExcept maybe the cows.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unable to speak in the thrill of eating such a large target, he advanced upon the poor, innocent, buttery bovine.

And so it went on, with Templeton taking off small(but still rather large) chunks and shoving them down his throat. Putting an ear to his stomach each time he swallowed, he could hear the resounding GLORP of the butter as it found a new home within his already occupied belly. Finally, after an indeterminate amount of time, Templeton finished eating the statue. \"Aaaa...\" Templeton sighed as he rubbed his swollen gut. \"Mmmm... that hit the spot.\" Suddenly, Templeton heard clanging from the tent next door. \"Should I check them out?\" He thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

There was something about her, Templeton noticed, that made her seem more... well, even he didn't know. But maybe then, he just made a little sound, since she turned around and looked a him with an amused expression on her face. \"Well, I can see that I'm not the only one who looks to indulge in the finer points of life.\" Templeton grinned and replied,\"I'm just glad you're not wanting to add me to your corpulence.\" The lady rat chuckled, her stomach bouncing and sloshing about. \"Well, my name is Charlene, what about you?\"  \"I'm Templeton.\"  \"Well then, Templeton, would you care to join me in an epic quest to stuff ourselves to the point of immobility?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n   \"Well, this is a hard decision...

With each pat his hand sunk in briefly, but then was bounced back by a rippling beneath the taut skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmf,\u201d he grunted. \u201cI simply have to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith energy he shored up from he knew not where, Templeton began shimmying his legs out from under the mountain of gut that buried them. He yelped and moaned as a few times as he moved faster than his body was ready to accommodate, but eventually brought his legs up near his body to begin pressing into a squatting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then leaned into his gut, then reached out with his front paws, grasped onto the wobbling gray expanse in front of him. For a moment he just held this position, enjoying the incredible sensation of embracing this enormous mass that laid out in front of him \u2013 that was him. But he soon got back to work, sinking his clawed fingers into his gut, then, with a quick, whip-like motion, pulling the belly down and back toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expanse that was Templeton\u2019s belly lurched back toward him just a fraction of an inch in a jerky, wavelike motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it jerked back, the slippery surface of his buttery fur caused his gut to rotate under him ever so slightly, allowing Templeton the room to put his hind legs up against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe braced himself, then repeated the motion. With another jerk, the belly shifted and rotated again, and Templeton\u2019s feet were able to climb higher up the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, incrementally, Templeton was pulling his belly underneath himself and keeping his legs against the wall to keep his balance. In this way, he was basically climbing onto his own belly. And he was getting a sense of just how much belly there was as each mini rotation caused more belly to come up beneath him exposed to the cool air, and more on the other side to press into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had closed his eyes for a moment, enjoying the feeling of his slippery fur dragging across the floor under the weight of his enormous bulk as it rotated with each jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes still closed, he shifted himself one last time, and moved his feet to continue climbing the wall when his feet suddenly found nothing but air. He opened his eyes and could not believe what he saw \u2013 he was laying on top of his gigantic belly, and it was even greater than he had imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head, arms, legs and tail and a few rolls of back flab were the only way you could tell what part you were seeing of what was otherwise a nearly-spherical rat. Here on the top of his belly, his eye-level was about three times what it used to be when he stood on his hind legs. And that entire expanse below him, and expanding out to the sides as well was all him. His fantastic belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton began to smile at this, but a sudden realization wiped the smile from his face. That slippery sensation of his gut rotating along the floor hadn\u2019t stopped. Templeton was rotating forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d he gasped. He reached out to find something to brace himself, but his claws found only the belly that he was about to be rolled under. And even though he was attached to it, he held on for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body rolled forward like a furry, overinflated water balloon, only much larger. Templeton took a long breath and held it just before his head rolled into the ground. It was a good thing to, because for a moment, his face was completely smothered by his own bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, his shoulders, back, and hind legs met the ground too and his body, finding its only non-spherical  surface splayed out beneath it, stopped rolling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly lurched forward, letting Templeton breath, then came to rest wobbling in the air beyond his reach, it\u2019s incredible weight pinning him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe breathed a sigh of satisfaction and, finally, licked the last of the butter off his lips. He swallowed with a gulp, then let out an incredible belch that made his gigantic, butter-slick furry beachball of a gut quiver and ripple. Even when that stopped, Templeton could still feel it churning, slowly digesting the incredible volume of fat that now filled it.<br>\r\nHe tapped the sides of it and it made a satisfying, squishy, almost drum-like sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s good to have goals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he passed out into a deep, richly-deserved sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Templeton awoke, the sounds of the rain had stopped. How many hours had passed, he didn\u2019t know.

His stomach itself was about 15 feet around. That wasn't the only thing that had grown. His chest had also obtained a new found plushness, giving the rat a rather pleasant neck rest. Templeton's lower half had not been left out of the festivities either. His backside was rather huge, providing a convenient counterweight to the rodent's titanic gut. His legs had also plumped up, forcing to waddle even more obviously. The only hint that the rat wasn't full was that his stomach didn't feel tight when he rubbed it. Rather, it felt soft and pillowy. <br>\r\n      Of course, now that Templeton's stomach was empty, the only sensible thing to do was to go and stuff it again.

Looking up toward the ceiling, , he saw that his gut had shrunk somewhat since before he fell asleep, though it was still several feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton maneuvered himself out from under his belly. A task that would normally be difficult was made much easier by the fact that Templeton was still coated in butter. After getting himself into a sitting position, Templeton looked around to get his bearings. He found that nothing noticeable had changed in the room, but when he looked behind him he was shocked to find that his rear had grown considerably from his last meal. each cheek was bigger than his entire body was before entering the fair. He tried to wrap his tail around one of the cheeks and found it could only reach halfway around one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" he thought aloud, \"I've never gained weight in my butt before.\" He smiled. \"Though, I also haven't eaten so much in one sitting before either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Templeton heard his stomach growl.

It seems that, after digesting the farmer statue, it expected another meal just as large. \"Alright, alright, we'll stay,\" he said to his stomach. He turned his sights toward the cow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow was huge, even bigger than the farmer. It was so big that even Templeton's large gut couldn't block his view of the entire sculpture; looking up past his belly, all he could see was the ceiling, some of the opposite wall and the head of the cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton stood up. While he was able to life his large butt of the ground, his belly was still a massive obstacle to movement. There was no way he was going to be able to lift its mass off the floor. Luckily the bottom of his belly was still slippery from the butter and he found it was possible to walk in reverse, sliding his belly across the floor. Slowly but surely, Templeton turned so his back was facing the cow and began shuffling backwards. It felt like hours before he made it to the cow, even though it was no more than a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the cow's back right leg, Templeton looked up at his next meal. His stomach growled loudly as he thought of how to approach it.  Remembering what caused the farmer sculpture to fall, Templeton decided to eat the buttery animal's two right hooves first. This would cause it to fall, allowing Templeton to access the entire meal. It would probably be loud, but Templeton assumed it was night after his sleep. It was unlikely that anyone was around to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton started his plan. Positioning himself so that the cow's back right hoof was beside him, he turned his head sideways and began gnawing on the butter. Like before, he gulped down larger and larger chunks. Despite their similar size, the first hoof took nowhere near as long as the farmer's boot did to eat and it wasn't long before he found himself walking backwards toward the other right hoof. He grunted form the weight added by the first hoof, its addition already impacting the size of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached the other hoof and began again. This hoof disappeared even quicker than the last. Lost in his gluttony, Templeton was shocked when the cow statue suddenly toppled over. Remembering that this was his plan the whole time, he dragged himself toward the udder of the fallen cow. He found that with two hooves worth of butter in him, dragging himself had become almost too difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton looked backwards at the cow. \"Hmmm. How to do this...\" he mumbled in between burps. He needed a new plan of attack. Wanting the most efficient gorging method possible, Templeton turned so the front of his belly was pressing into the cow's chest. He grabbed his belly with his front paws and kicked off the ground as hard as he could his his back paws. Just as he planed, his butter-slick belly rolled forward, sending the rest of him up, then into the sculpture. Templeton dug his claws into the sculpture and began digging in, allowing his gut to flow out behind him. Templeton excitedly tore into the torso of the cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly growled for more as he gorged, as if it was pretending to be empty. His eating was a lot faster now, but the cow was huge. As he ate, he would occasionally need to allow himself to slide further down his belly to reach more of the butter. He ate with so much vigor that his gut constantly wobbled and sloshed. Every once in awhile he would stop to let out a belch before immediately returning to his binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he found himself at the floor, having eaten a large hole in the cow's chest. With his stomach yelling for more, he pulled himself closer to the sculpture and continued. Hours passed; Movement was becoming very difficult, but Templeton always found a way to position himself so he could reach more of the butter. Sometimes he found himself sitting on his large butt, grabbing butter with one paw while the front of his belly pressed against another part of the sculpture several feet away. Sometimes he lied on his side with his belly ballooning away from him, freeing up both of is paws. Sometimes he even lied on his back, reaching for butter above his head while admiring the size of his gut. However he sat, he never stopped gorging, and his belly distended as he stuffed himself to more and more ridiculous levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton saved the sculpture's head for last. He sat in a sitting position in the middle of the room, his gut spilling out in all directions. He sat there with the head beside him, belching and hiccuping for a few moments before hefting the head up with both his paws and shoving it into his mouth whole. With a massive swallow, Templeton's eyes widened as he felt his gut simultaneously press into the ceiling and the glass panel dividing the room. Templeton reeled at the realization of how big the statures had made him. Looking to his left and right, he saw that his gut was about as wide as it was tall. Happy beyond belief, he sank himself into his belly. He rubbed his tiny paws all over as much of it as he could - which was barely any of it. There was no way Templeton was going to be able to move at this size, but he didn't care. He had done it.</span></div></div>",

But he managed without much trouble. It felt pleasurable for his whole belly to pull across the ground, massaging across the dirt and sloshing his contents about. As he entered further into the fair he ate bits and pieces of food he had neglected to eat last night. With each new mouthful he grew happier and fuller, but it was just the beginning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled himself beside a table and pulled on a hanging clothe to help him stand up. His weight however pulled the entire cloth down from the table and rained down a shmorgishborg of banana's, pie, burgers, fries, and corn dogs; along with a few vegetables in the mix. Before he could get into the right position and open his mouth, all of it had dropped on top of the rat; burring him in a pile of goodies. Voraciously, he ate without stop; quickly devouring the fries, and the burgers. His stomach glorped and gurgled with each new slab of meat, or bunch of fries that slid down his gaping maw. He placed a dainty paw on his large belly. Giving it a few congratulatory pats at enjoying the feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of it was devoured in minutes, until the fat rat now moved on to the bunch of bananas. There must've been at least five in the bunch. Rubbing the large expanse of his stomach, he thought about how he should tackle this challenge. \"You think you could handle this,\" he asked his stomach, which gurgled in reply. All right then, time for the stuffing of a lifetime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempting to stand, Templeton's legs strained to lift his entire body up. Now on two paws, he struggled for balance. Craning his head back all of his weight caused momentum to stumble backwards. His robust blubbery back cushioned his crash on the table leg, causing him to giggle at his clumsiness. Having so much belly to lug around was an amusing task. Then, walking toward the banana's with each careful step, he positioned his bottom over them, and brought down his massive rump on the edge of the peels. Five bananas flew directly into the air, just as the rat planed, and quickly began to rain downward. He would only have one chance to do this right, least the bananas be mushed into tiny pieces. Placing his paws around as much of his belly as he could, he moved his neck around, mouth open, to catch each flying morsel. 1, he caught, sliding down his throat and greatly expanding his stomach. It was too fast and too quick for his arms to hold onto and catapulted away. 2, the force of this second one threw him off guard, since his stomach was still comprehending the entrance of the first. 3, he felt his whole anatomy continue to balloon outward with each massive swallow. 4, his eyes were nearly shut at the gluttonous pain of having swallowed whole objects about the same height as him. And 5, finally, with the last banana swallowed, he allowed his entire body to rest, and what a body that would be resting. Templeton looked downward at his stomach, sides, everything. It was so large, so glorious, he was practically a watermelon of fur. A butterball of delight. Patting all he could, a symphony of sloshing and burbles erupted. The entire fair experience brought with it more and more delights, and this was one of them. He had truly grown to a admirable size, with a belly all rats would envy. But it wasn't over yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a large burp, and catatonic hiccups, he rolled his way to the next feast. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Attempting to stand, Templeton teetered slightly until his bubbling body stabilized. Being very heavy around the mid section, his body leaned forward and rump stuck out behind. The obese rat jiggled his massive belly with both paws. Sending pleasuring ripples that massaged his tender insides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve already eaten over thirty lunches, but there\u2019s just so much more glutting to be done. I don\u2019t know if my stomach could take anymore.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of this, his belly rumbled loudly. Squeezing and patting his large bulk, the reassurance lead him to continue on. Each step he took was followed by a slosh, proceeded by his gut wobbling up and down. The feeling of being so overly fed was intoxicating, and never in all his life did he think to have a belly of such grand size. He continued to caress it while picking up scraps of food along the way with his large tail and popping them effortlessly into his gapping maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he found a small building which read \u201cCafeteria\u201d and licked the drool seeping from his lips. Running over, he was greeted with tables upon tables, and open windows at the far end, where they served the food. Smelling all of the left out rotten goodies, he stuck out his plentiful stomach and smacked it heartedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a blessing. Lets see if I could still moved after such glutting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccidentally falling over onto his massive belly, Templeton dragged himself to the nearest table. Thankfully, there was a convenient step ladder to help him scale the tables faster, and with less effort than he would pulling himself up. The rewards were great as he reached the top. Pizza, burgers, corn and hotdogs, pie, and other goodies, were quickly wolfed down into the rats bottomless chasm. Already full from before, Templeton\u2019s stomach continuingly grew tighter and rounder, and sang in a symphony of gurgles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt continued like this for almost an hour with each table, which numbered about fifty. With each new mouthful, Templeton would grunt at the pain of having to make room for yet another morsel. He was growing more belly then anything, enough to hold a few grape fruits. He even took little time to breath in between meals, and was left panting after swallowing whole anything he could get his paws on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the tenth table or so, the rat had been so careless as to attempt to shove down his throat a whole kiwi. His head having sunk and merge into his body, made it easy to swallow faster, but the sheer size of this thing made it troubling without chewing. Still, he shoved on, until the massive swallow let out a large gasp of air, and sent Templeton crashing down on the table, gasping for air. It was the only time he relaxed and didn\u2019t immediately move on to the next pawful of food. But the reward was great. Rolling onto his back, the tower of fur and bubbling fat rolled over onto his muzzle, which he nuzzled his belly before pushing it back. Stroking the tight expanse with his paws, he giggled and smiled happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow this is a stomach worthy of first prize.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, Templeton looked around but saw no one. Then, furiously rotating his body, causing it to erupt in a torrent of sloshes and groans, he saw what was behind his belly. A female ferret of tremendous size, almost as big as him, for a rat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there,\u201d she said happily while stuffing her face with a few baked potatoes she gathered. \u201cNever seen you around here before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking at coming in contact with another predator, Templeton attempted to drag himself away. Unfortunately, his stomach was too heavy for him to leave fast enough, and before he knew it, he felt a paw patting his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever knew you rats could put so much away. This was a belly if I\u2019d ever seen one. So soft and plushy, hehe, and loud. Does it ever stop bubbling.\u201d She patted it a few times more. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton being too frightened to answer, merely shivered. \u201cJust make it quick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake what quick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKilling me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ferret burst out in laughter, and rolled him on his back so that they made eye contact. \u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you silly,\u201d she scratched his belly with a paw, which felt really relaxing to Templeton who was unable to reach as much as she was. \u201cThere\u2019s so much food here why would I need to. Besides, I\u2019m not a fan of eating living prey. Which is why I came here, it\u2019s a paradise, and by the looks of you I\u2019d say you think so too. My name is Pip, what\u2019s yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTempleton,\u201d the rat whispered, relaxing as she scratched his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTempleton, great name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee thanks,\u201d the rat giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bobbing of his stomach, Pip giggled as well. \u201cWell Templeton, this your first time here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, resting his paws on his belly and sinking deeper into his large body. \u201cThere\u2019s so much glutting to be had here, and I\u2019m not even done yet. My stomach can handle anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, I\u2019ll say it can. Having grown this much and still able to handle more. Hmhmhm, a stomach like this shouldn\u2019t have to be lugged around everywhere. Just wait here Templeton,\u201d she patted his belly, \u201cI\u2019ll bring you some more food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her own large belly slosh as she waddled away, Templeton blew a content sigh whilst rubbing his soft fur. \u201cWell she\u2019s nice, and she\u2019s bringing us more food. What do you think of that?\u201d His belly gave a large bubbly reply, which tickled Templeton who patted it merrily. \u201cYes I like her too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, open wide you fat rat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to his side, Templeton eyes grew wide at the large pile of food she had gathered extremely quickly. \u201cHow did you do that so fast, you\u2018re so big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you come to the fair as much as me, you get used to being so big and kinda speed up,\u201d she smiled while holding a banana over his head. \u201cNow come on, bottoms up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his mouth wide, the banana quickly shot down his throat and nestled in his stomach with a glop; finding a home with the rest of the days gluttony. \u201cYou like that big fella,\u201d she asked Templeton\u2019s stomach as she patted it, jiggling and sloshing it about, \u201cWell there\u2019s plenty more where that came from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, Templeton continuingly grew fatter and fatter as all he did was lye down and having food being brought to his awaiting mouth. The more he grew, the happier he became, and more bubbly Pip was about his size. Templeton was happy to be with someone he could relate to. Never did they reach a dull moment as she kept bringing him more and more food from the other tables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passed and all the tables were finished. Templeton continued to rest peacefully, while squeezing, nuzzling, and patting his globe like belly, which was so big he was able to rest his chin on it. Gelatinously it swayed from side to side and gurgled loudly. It was two heads taller than Pip, who stood beside it. Rubbing it while curling her whiskers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness, your stomach really can handle anything. It\u2019s huge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold-HIC-ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you\u2019ve lived every rats dream today. To have a stomach this grand certainly is a tough job but you\u2019ve managed in one day. Hehehe, I we could fill it up more; what do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHic-Hilp. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m getting kinda tired. All this-HIC-gorging has made me sleepy. Plus, my stomach has never felt more full than it-HIC HILP-does now. I should give it time to rest. It\u2019s done a good-HIC HILP-job today.\u201d At these last words, he lifted his heft arms and gave himself a pat, which sunk his whole paw into his fleshy body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPip giggled, \"Well it certainly gave you this cute little hiccups mr fat rat. It\u2019s your call. We\u2019ve yet to go behind the windows, which has all the food used to make everything out here. We could find more in there than we did out here. But if not, I know a place where you could rest. Hehehe, when I\u2019m half as big as you, I would always go there. Humans don\u2019t know about, so we\u2019ll be safe until nightfall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tough decision. Though he was already an ungodly size, further eating excited him, and with the help of his new friend all he\u2019d have to do was lye down and have food brought to him; just how he\u2019d like it. But, he had already eaten so much, over gorged many times over and unable to see anything in front of him. Who knows, he might fall asleep in the middle of eating anyway. With a paw scratching his belly and another scratching his chubby face, he contemplated.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing it differently though, Pip patted it herself. \"To the kitchen's it is then. This is going to be fun,\" she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, it wasn't quite fun getting there. Having glutted to the size of a watermelon, Templeton's limbs did little activity while Pip rolled him over to the door. The rat's fat face seemed content reveling in his sloshing countenance as all his gorge shifted around like a washing machine, giving him quite the inner belly massage. Pip on the other paw, didn't seem as content, but pressed on. Thankfully, the cafeteria door was merely a pushable one with no lock or latch. Using Templeton's superior weight, she was able to move the door with ease, with the rat's stomach releasing a grotesque squelch as it slid off his belly and closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tantalizing aroma's made the obese rat let out a mirthful sigh, rubbing his blubbery expanse at the though of once again stuffing his already over cumbered belly. \"This really is a fair where a rat can glut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a ferret,\" replied Pip. \"Don't think I just brought you in here for yourself Templeton, I'm hungry too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton smiled back at his gluttonous new friend. \"I know, thanks for bringing me in here still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trouble at all,\" she tried putting on a fake smile, \"now, lets see how much your stomach could handle after eating everything in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton wobbled his stomach in anticipation. \"It can take whatever you could dish out,\" he sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp to the challenge, Pip immediately set off gathering everything edible. To Templeton's surprise, Pip also turned on some stoves, placing some of the frozen foods inside boiling pots to defrost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide,\" said the ferret, holding a large burrito over his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as she asked, Templeton placed his paws on his over gorged gut, while allowing the burrito to travel down his throat, so the contents within it wouldn't spill all over his face if he bit it. As the hefty specimen slithered it's way into Templeton's stomach, it slowly began bloating further outward, even causing his chin resting on his fattened chest to rise. Upon completion, the rat licked his mouth and patted his stomach daintily while it growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that,\" Pip put an ear to Templeton's belly, \"you want more? Well, why didn't you say so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a few funnel cakes to Templeton's side, she allowed the rat to eat by himself while she looked after defrosting some more food. She had enough time to get things done before the rat wolfed down each sugary desert in a pinch. For the next meal, Pip opened up a nearby fridge, which was filled with ice creams and popsicles. Bringing over a box of ice cream sandwiches, she placed one by one on Templeton's obese bosom, smiling at his ravenous apatite. Continuing with the popsicles and bucket of ice cream, she returned to the food on the stoves, letting the rat glut for himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passed as the rat's feasting of a lifetime continued. Busily, Pip rotated from checking the frosted food, to feeding Templeton. Having a constant trickle of food being passed to him, the rat continued to bloat, so much tha this stomach became so big it would needlessly slosh over his muzzle without letting up. So to prevent Templeton from suffocating he rested against the side of the kitchen window's counter, allowing his overfull, over gorged, overfed stomach, filled to the brim many times over, to gelatinously spill across the floor and continue to take up space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning in pleasure, Templeton became a mere appendage to his blob like swollen body. Every slight movement left behind it a minute worth of sloshing and burbles, each hiccup would leave a minute worth of jiggling and undulating, and each slab of food he would continue to consume would only delight him further. His arms grew heavy, his head sinking further into his engulfing fat, his legs virtually non existent at this point, and his stomach, bloating up more than a prize winning pumpkin, and he liked it that much more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Hic-Hilp* Pip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,\" yawned the tired ferret, \"You think we should stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Heh...hahahahaha. You tell me Templeton. Your stomach, isn't going to stop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding beside the towering rat, she poked at his belly, \"I've never seen an animal get so fat, that it grew to be twice my height in one day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Hic--Hilp* I know what you mean. *Hic--Hilp* It surprised me too. I think you *Hic--Hilp* should enjoy yourself now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocking her eyebrow, she folded her paws and leaned against Templeton's blubbery visage, sinking into his fat almost to the point in being engulfed herself. \"Well, that's mighty kind of you. I'm sure I'll find something in here, even after you've eaten everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing her disappointment, Templeton gave his stomach a hefty pat. Jiggling it and bobbing Pip about. \"*Hic--Hilp* At least we saw how fat it could get\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Pip smiled reluctantly, \"and I bet it could get fatter still. Well Templeton, I'm going to go enjoy myself now if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Hic--Hilp* Okay, I'll rest here for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, I don't think you're going anywhere anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs true as she was, Templeton wasn't so sure. Where there's a will, there's a way, and when it came to eating Templeton would most assuredly find a way. While Pip waddled out the door in search for her own gluttonous escapade, Templeton nestled deeper into his obscene form. Resting on top of his gigantic stomach was like resting on a pillow, and gently began to lull him to sleep. But, as obscenely full and massive as he's become, the thought of further eating intrigued him. Further patting his bubbling corpulence, the glorping and sloshing further tantalized him.

Stretching,he looks around, finding a slumbering Pip, curled around her own huge belly, nestled beside him. The two are pressed close together, though Templeton quickly rolls a way, feeling hot under the machinery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Once he's able to sit up, mammoth stomach spread between his thighs, Templeton decides to examine himself, smirking at how he's grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Templeton's limbs have grown so plump they now resemble thick sausages with thick claws bursting out of the thick ends, and his head is easily nestled into the thick rolls of his neck, the bottom-most of which always rests squarely on his belly. His rear has plumped up to help balance him out, though is not nearly comparable to his burgeoning belly, which sprawls out before him, resting on the ground and pooling out to his dimples of knees and high enough in the air that he can rest his arms on it comfortably. Even his tail has become sausage-like, though a quick test reveals that it's kept most of it's dexterity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Pip murmurs something, rolling over onto her other side, towards him, in her sleep, drawing his attention back to her. Faintly, he can smell something sweet stuck to the fur of her belly, making him remember how long it's been since he's eaten anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       His own belly gives a growl at the thought of food, and Templeton begins to knead his doughy flab in excitement. Unfortunately it's daytime, and there are humans everywhere, so he can't exactly amble out there and glut himself right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       However, a nearby trash can catches his eye, or more accurately, the frequency of half-eaten food that's tossed in the trash can, as people are eager to get on whatever ride they're beneath, catches his eye, and Templeton finds himself salivating at the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       There's also an abandoned food stand right next to the ride that would be easy to get to, though he's not too sure what food would be left...</span></div></div>",

Such a large feast has left me tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's fine,\" replied Pip, \"I know a great place to rest. People don't know about it, and yet they pass by it everyday. Also, the place where they dump all the left over food isn't very far from it. C'mon, lets go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the rat's eyes shot up in surprise as she began to leave. Looking at his massive, burbling girth, he attempted to shift it around into a crawling position. The symphony of sloshes was like a bunch of rocks sliding off a cliff. Gurgling and glopping as all his days gluttony shifted around for a more comfortable position. It was a feeling Templeton had grown accustomed as well as fond of, over the past few days, But despite his efforts, he was unable to roll over, and remained in his lying down position, with his blubbery chest huffing and puffing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the corner of his eye, Templeton saw the ferret giggling at his failed attempt. \"Well someone's grown a little top heavy. Don't worry, with practice, you'd be able to manage your weight well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing back onto the table, the fat ferret went over to his left side, and slowly pushed his doughy frame off the table; sending the rat tumbling down to the floor. Grunting as he hit both the table seat and the floor, the rat moaned and grasped his stomach, as his delicate bulk churned in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you do that for! You could've seriously hurt me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I couldn't. I knew your big belly would soften your fall. With time and feeding you'll come to forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuggh,\" Templeton moaned, the churning of his stomach giving him slight discomfort. \"My stomach blames you for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPip patted his stomach, \"Again, with time and food. I'll roll you to where we need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having much of a choice, Templeton allowed himself to be slowly rolled to Pip's hiding place. He was sure to forget about this incident with time and food as she said, and finally when all was said and done, he could show off to the pig and spider. The washing machine like massage the rolling caused comforted the churning somewhat, which allowed the rat to relax on the way. As soon as all he had eaten was digested, he couldn't wait to start gorging again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTempleton rested in Pip's hiding place, which was under the ferris wheel and conveniently near a dozen concession stands. His stomach gurgled slightly at the thought of eating once again, but he was still stuffed from the previous gorging. Pip left to enjoy herself a little more before people started to come while Templeton slept. At first he was worried the fair workers would spot her, but her peppy reassurance convinced him otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've done this millions of times. When I'm back you wont find little ol me so little anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe already didn't, but said nothing. Only an hour passed before Templeton was disturbed by the sound of grunting, complaining, and a cacophony of growling mixed with sloshing. Having slept with his stomach grazing the floor, Templeton shifted around until he was looking in the direction of the noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uugh, come on you darn thing, we're almost *hilp* there. Uugh, just a little more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the draping on the side of the ferris wheel floor was lifted, the enormous figure of Pip bulged it's way through a few bars. \"Oh, high Tempy. *hilp* Told you l'd be back bigger than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was, much bigger. So big it even impressed Templeton, along with urged him to out eat her in means of size. \"Good thing you weren't caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPip hefted her massive swell and patted it merrily. \"I know my way around. It's gunna take a *hilp* bigger stomach than this to spot me.\" Resting her back against a flat surface, her belly oozed out like a scoop of melted ice cream. \"This fair is great, and this isn't even the biggest I've gotten. *yawn* I'm tired. If you *hilp* go out later on and don't come back I understand. There's so much out there to explore. Well, G'night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton continued to admire Pip size and fantasized himself being as big, bigger even. But as she said, he might not be able to show her. He hadn't checked back with the two he came with for some time, and didn't want to worry them. Of course, his greed began getting the better of him. If he went back he'd no longer enjoy himself, and the longer he stays with Pip, the more she might be able to help him like in the cafeteria. </span></div></div>",

He'd stopped a few times on the way to give himself time to digest, and his stomach had gotten somewhat more manageable in size, but that didn't make the trek easy. Too exhausted to attempt to climb over the fence, he flopped down right next to Wilbur's pen, one paw resting on his swollen belly, the other paw clutching the words he'd found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was awakened not by the fact that the sun came up, but by a much more familiar sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilbur was being slopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the rat delicacies littered all around him, Templeton couldn't help but perk up at the familiar sound and smell. Well, he <i>was</i> hungry from all that traveling, and he couldn't help it that he liked eating Wilbur's food. He set to work dragging himself over the bottom plank of the pen's fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back,\" he announced huskily, and he tumbled to the ground with a messy flop. His stomach was still a little more swollen than he thought it would be, but digestion had rendered his whole body soft and squishy. Charlotte barely hid her disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are your words, madam,\" he snarled. He tossed the two words aside and dragged himself towards the food. While the pig and the spider were looking at the words he'd found, he managed to clamber up into Wilbur's trough and begin slurping up the satisfying swill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These won't do at all,\" said Charlotte. \"We don't want the crowd to be reminded of barbecue!\" Templeton ignored her, swallowing down a large chunk of what might have once been bread, or maybe lettuce. He'd already made a nice dent in Wilbur's breakfast, and now he was inclined to swallow the whole thing. He started gulping down huge mouthfuls of liquid, and he grinned inside as his stomach began to bloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" he said, licking his lips, once he'd guzzled down the last of the fluid. \"I'll go out again tonight.\" Wilbur and Charlotte were talking about something that Templeton ignored. He manuevered his swollen body down into the trough and began working on the more solid parts of Wilbur's breakfast. He devoured what had clearly been a donut, along with some vegetables and pasta. The last thing he swallowed was a chicken bone, before stretching out comfortably in the trough. His renewed fullness made him sleepy again, and he let his eyes close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was disturbed by a very angry pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Templeton! Did you eat my entire breakfast!?\" Wilbur was staring down his snout at him, the way he did when he was being annoying. Sometimes he really hated his dependency on Wilbur's food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he lied, licking his lips. \"Sure, blame the- <i>hic</i>- rat.\" He gave his swollen stomach an affection pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would serve you right if you came down with an acute attack of indigestion,\" Charlotte sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My stomach can handle- <i>hic</i>- anything,\" he replied, with a satisfied burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope it can handle finding a better word than 'salty.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton waved a paw dismissively and allowed himself to doze off for a second time that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This <i>has</i> been a night,\" he mumbled.

He couldn't nap here, though, he was far too exposed. He dug his claws into the dirt and began pulling himself towards a nearby event stand. His belly was almost too heavy for his stubby rat arms to handle, but he got into a rhythm, and soon he was sliding along quite nicely. He dragged himself into the comforting darkness underneath the stand, prepared to rest and digest some of his earlier gorge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the fair didn't want to give him a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is everywhere,\" Templeton gasped, followed closely by a hungry growl from his already-stuffed stomach. Even underneath a stage, the people at the fair had managed to leave behind more delicious food than Templeton's stomach could possibly hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell- more than he <i>thought</i> he could hold. He was more than willing to put that assumption to the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an excited whoop and renewed determination, Templeton grabbed the closest thing- an upturned ordered of french fries, still half full. He shoved the fries greedily down his throat, barely bothering to chew, ignoring the salt and grease that coated his face and arms. From there he moved onto a half-eaten sandwich. He gnawed every kernel off a rotten ear of corn. He swallowed several chunks of something that was totally unidentifiable, but nonetheless delicious. An upturned bucket of chicken wings got inhaled so fast that he forgot not to eat most of the bones.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery new mouthful of food squeezed into his stomach with a noisy <i>squelch</i>, forcing the rest of what he'd eaten to shift to make room. The shifting food made his belly sway ever-so-slightly, churning its contents into what must have been a frothy mess. Templeton could feel every barely-chewed chunk of what he had wolfed down, and he moaned with delight as he forced even more food inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could never go back to Wilbur's grimy slops after this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton gorged himself until his stomach ached and his throat was sore, and still, he wasn't satisfied. His stomach whined and grumbled in protest, but its pleas were ignored. As long as there was food in front of him, he couldn't stop eating. He reached for a mostly-full bottle of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" he mumbled, his mouth filled with food. \"Thirsty.\" He swallowed what he'd been eating and tipped the bottle towards his hungry mouth. The fluid flowed freely into his waiting belly, forcing it to bloat outwards while its contents sloshed around helplessly. Soda spilled over his face and his swollen belly as he guzzled. His poor, over-full stomach groaned miserably at the horrible treatment.  When he finished, he swatted the bottle away and gave his angry stomach a pat, looking around for his next meal. He caught a glimpse of something that looked tasty a few feet away, and tried to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp pain and a dangerous gurgle passed through his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Templeton groaned, and he tried to move again. This time, his belly groaned loader. The noises coming from his digestive tract didn't settle- instead they grew louder and more insistent. He winced at the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. He ate too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton winced as his stomach shook with fullness. He could feel his gorge shifting upwards. He'd overdone it- he was going to barf. So much delicious food gone to waste- he'd have to start over from scratch- well, that wasn't such an unappetizing idea-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe instinctively clapped a paw over his mouth as he felt himself get ready to erupt. The other paw clutched his belly, as if to will it to calm down. He couldn't hold it all in. He was going to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton opened his mouth and let out an enormous belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach calmed down immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is <i>that</i> what you wanted?\" he mumbled thickly before belching a second time. A third belch ended in a noisy hiccup. Templeton flopped down on his back with a satisfied groan, patting his impossibly round belly with both hands. His stomach gurgled in a way that almost sounded hopeful.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" he grunted, with another loud hiccup. \"Ugh, what a- hic!- night. Just a little break. Then- hic!- back to the gorge. Urrrrrp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was asleep within seconds.</span></div></div>",

The driver didn't notice and drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton heard his gigantic belly grumble. As large as it was, he had emptied it long ago. Licking his limits, Templeton waddled and rolled and crawled as best he could over towards the broken barrel. He reached it in a forty seconds. He rolled into a sitting position in the apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, he managed to hoist one up. They were pretty big apples. Each was roughly the size of him. He opened his mouth and chowed down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...An hour later, Templeton had devoured half the apples, and he was sitting amongst a pile of cores. With his stomach finally a bit more full, he decided to save the rest for later, and turned and went to leave. Of course, he coudn't do it right that second. His now full stomach was stretched out a bit more. After he adjusted, he made his way over towards the pigpen as he saw Lurvey approaching it with the pail. He quickened his pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lurvey finished and walked away, Templeton finally arrived and struggled up onto the trough, his stomach gurgling. He stared at the slop and patted his stomach. Could he really eat that after that large meal of apples? Of course he could! A true glutton doesn't eat to get full. He just eats for the sake of eating! He slid down onto the on his belly and landed with a splash in the slops, his mouth wide open so that he could eat the second he landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton began swimming across the slops, eating as he went. He began to grow a bit larger. However, as he swam, he slowly ground to a halt. He stopped eating and looked up. His stomach had swelled up so much that he was jammed in tight between the sides of the trough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that that was enough for one day, he managed to unstick himself, and he crawled out and slid out and landed on his back. He moaned slightly as he enormous belly almost crushed him. Feeling a bit uncomfortable, he waddled and jiggled back over towards to the barn to sleep in the haybales. He found that he wasn't going very fast. His gut swung from side to side, sweeping the ground, and his entire body jiggled as he went like Jell-O.</span></div></div>",

He seemed to have almost like a growth spurt, but it was the fat on him that truely added to his girth.  He ate through the slop now, like it was nothing, sparing only scraps for Wilbur who was thinning out as the days went by.  To counter this Lurvey came back two or three times a day to refill the slop noticing Wilbur's loss of weight.  Wilbur was able to get a decent meal now, and Templeton got to fill his face a lot more.  He must've weight well over 100 lbs. by now and he couldn't fit in his rat hole anymore.  It wasn't easy for him to hide either, cause this was the day he was discovered.  At first thinking him as some sort of other creature Lurvery moved in with care.  When he saw it was a massive rat he finally figured out why Wilbur was becomming so thin.<br>\r\n  Within days people came from miles to see the newest attraction.  The world's biggest rat.  Templeton no longer needed to hide.  He was given his own pen by Wilburs and his own pail of food.  A garbage trick stopped by once a day to drop off his meal, that seemed to grow larger and larger by that day.  He soon became so obese he could hardly move.

It growled with a force that shook the ground surrounding him, most of which he covered. He drooled further, nothing would be enough for him, or his stomach! Tons upon tons of gluttonous rat moved as though gelatinous through the empty field and down the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quiet little town from which his feedings came may have been slow, but it wasn't dead; a single motorcar came up the road, driven straight into his stomach and sinking a surprising difference into his stomach, still swollen as it was from eating a house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car was a very nice h'ors douevre, Templeton's teeth shearing the metal and engine and swallowing down the huge chunks of it, stretching out his growling, rumbling stomach. There may have been humans inside the car, Templeton reasoned. That would explain the slight increase in the movement he felt inside that gargantuan gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown to the edge of town, the butcher's the first on city block that lead into town, Templeton found it more than fully stocked; He chewed a hole through the cement. It didn't need to be large to fit his head in, and that was all he needed to suck the beef and chicken and various meats through his gullet, only stopping to eat some of the concrete to widen the whole. The equivalent of an entire farmyard of stock came into his stomach, followed soon by the refrigerators, the registers, the cieling, walls, and floors, until all that was left was an empty hole where the building once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut an extra treat lay in store; it seemed the store was just getting in a morning shipment of meat, and a shipping truck as large as trucks get was pulled around back, long as two butcher's shops and so stock full of meat it must have taken several herds of cows to fill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunger inside the rat was raging so that a single growl was now causing a small earthquake. Well, he had moved from eating two cows to eating hundreds. He grabbed the end of the truck in his still-tiny rat claws, and using his weight as a counter-lever, Lifted it up and opened his mouth so that each beef carcass fell into his gaping mouth, and all of them swallowed down into his stomach. He bit at the back of the truck, and shoved it all down his mouth as well, rending the metal and tires as it all swelled out his throat before aiding his stomach in its quest for size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton ate the camper of the truck, and was finished eating the entirety of the meat that could feed thousands. He was now twenty five feet tall at least, and his stomach, swollen and round, jutted out and up greater than any land mammal had ever grown before. Grinning that solipsist rat grin of his, he rubbed the still soft fur of his belly, and hiccuped so large and deep that his head and arms lifted up two dozen feet into the air before returning him back down to his stomach to pat it more.</span></div></div>",

Debris and flesh had flown everywhere, killing the soldiers that stood near it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few miles away back on the farm Wilbur and the other animals looked in aw at the raining mass of blood and debris.

Though the poison had indeed made him hungrier, that didn't mean it was the only effect.  And yet the rat wore a large grin on his face as he rubbed his complaining corpulence.  He was &lt;i&gt;enjoying&lt;/i&gt; it.  His gut shook and quivered, continuously adding more and louder sloshes and gurgles to the symphony of what should be indigestion.  The entirety of his body seemed to tense up and for a brief second, and stopped both its trembling and moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if his own stomach had been holding its breath, Templeton\u2019s gut relaxed and rolled around noisily.

The sound was so intense it rattled window panes and shook the leaves of the trees.  But if one traced it to its source, they'd find not lightning, but the true incarnation of gluttony.  Templeton's stomach growled with unparalleled fervor and greed, never satisfied yet increasingly fuller with every titanic swallow the rat continuously provided.  Had his gut not specialized in localized rapid digestion, the cacophony of moans, gurgles, groans and sloshes would have sounded not unlike the waves of the ocean during a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wobbling rat bore down on anything within sight with a mouth comically stretched to accommodate any gulp he could imagine.  Forests became stumps if they were lucky and pits of soil and rock if not.  Lakes, cities, and landscapes were thrown together into his stewpot of a belly, which crunched them around loudly and powerfully.   Within a mere minute a square-mile of land had been transformed into fat around his gut, deepening his bellybutton to a full mile itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton truly was living to eat, and every portion of him reflected it.  He'd lost feeling in his legs and tail long ago, as they became indifferent from the rest of the sea of flesh.  His thick face was so flabby it threatened to bulge over his eyes.  His ears were long-gone in-between rolls, but he could hear quite well through vibrations in his gut, despite the continuous digestion.  Despite his cheeks his mouth was unthreatened by his impossibly-increasing obesity.  Fat had nearly enveloped his arms, but he still tried to rub his belly when he could.  Nowadays, the best way for him to massage his gut was to slide his way over mountains before eating them.  Occasionally, the forming of rolls, the ripple of violent hiccups, or a particular combination of digestive gurgles was as pleasurable as a true rub.  Of course, depending on where he was, an earthquake provided him with great delight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, to his great surprise, Templeton felt something cold on his lower belly.  Instinctively he tried to look back, but even if he properly could have, the distance was too far.  He was able to see a large body of water immediately in front of him, and the waves crashing up against the portion of his gut in front of him felt similar to the coldness behind him.  With a wide and proud grin, Templeton hiccuped and made an attempt to rub his belly.  His sides rumbled in victory and to urge the gourmand along in his gluttony.  His growling gut wasn't finished and was as voracious as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By this point he'd let his head sink into his corpulence a bit more, and not even vibrations through his body were enough to allow him to hear someone's calls.  Instead, all Templeton could hear was the rhythmic series of gargantuan gurgles that was his digestion and the roars of his ravenous belly.  With a stomach that large, his gut growls layered on top of each other for a truly terrifying din.  Long, high-pitched whines squeezed themselves from the tummy of the starving rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting us food, I promise!\"  He tried ineffectually to rub his belly, but the blob of his arms that amazingly remained could barely move enough to get to his gut, let alone do a thing to comfort anything that large.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of sheer desperation, the rat plunged his head down to the ground.  Second by second, he worked on stretching his mouth wider and wider, putting to shame even the very existence of snakes.  The corners of his mouth slid over rocks and trees, even the few cities that remained.  Hours past, and his stomach protested more every second.  Every growl spurred him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the day, however, Templeton swallowed.  For a brief moment, his stunned stomach was silenced.  He hovered in the depths of space, too stuffed to even wonder why he could survive in that vacuum.  But with his ears underneath so much fat, the rat could hear anything that went on in his body.  And from the deepest regions of his global gut came an overindulged groan of contentment that lasted a few minutes.  After that he could feel his belly settle into work and began to churn pleasurably.  A happy moan escaped Templeton's face as fat layered itself onto his body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, the rat opened his eyes and realized the moon was hovering right in front of him.  His talkative belly was still loudly telling him about how difficult and wonderful digesting a planet was, but Templeton smiled mischievously.  What a pleasant surprise it would be for his gut, and it was so easily reached.  As the true incarnation of gluttony, it didn't matter how stuffed he was.  He idly snaked his head closer and closer to the satellite and opened his mouth wide.  With the moon in his mouth, he let his gut pull his head back and he swallowed.  Templeton could feel the moon slide down and settle in the front of his belly, which again, paused its digestion in shock.  After ten minutes, a series of massive moans, sloshes and a gurgling cheer began his stomach's excited and noisy return to digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton smiled and moaned himself.  The many remnants of earth rubbing against the moon and the churning of his gut created the best massage he ever had.  Never had he imagined an internal stomach massage like this, especially one this grand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps he'd surprise his stomach with something else tomorrow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He spent his time often being lulled to sleep by the rhythmic groans and sloshes of his happy belly.  Otherwise he'd occasionally add to his bulk by grabbing some bit of passing space debris and feel it roll around in his gut a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, however, he felt his stomach twist itself into a knot, rumbling through every roll of his body.  Templeton moaned in hunger and disappointment that his laziness had to come to an end.  Looking around, he found the closest heavenly body besides his own was little Mercury.  As in the past he snaked his head out, unable to propel himself anywhere.  Working his jaws he got the planet in his mouth and began to bring it back.  Ready to settle into blissful contentment again, he gulped.  His belly, however, was only quieted for a couple seconds before digestion began to grumble to a start.  He knew this wouldn't last long, so he waited for another planet to orbit into reach: Mars and its moons.  The rat again stretched to bring back his meal.  When he swallowed this time, the digestive pause was much longer than Mercury's, and his belly then gladly burbled along in its work.  Templeton grinned as wide as his massive cheeks permitted, but the last solid planet caught his eye.  Venus was orbiting within view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe planet was as big as earth was and he remembered that meal well.  His stomach was quite contented with what it had at the moment, however.  Still, the glutton smiled and reached for the planet.  His gut had learned what the strain of a stretch meant, and suddenly began to quiver and ripple in excitement.  To encourage him, despite its impossible fullness it mustered a deep series of growls and rumbles, all muffled by the meal he'd already consumed.  Templeton swallowed and his belly received an even greater gift than it could even imagine.  Though, lacking a brain, any imagination a stomach could conjure up would have been fantastic regardless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly remained silent for a full day, \"speechless\" in containing three planets and having already digested a fourth.  During that day, he snaked his way over to Ceres and the Asteroid Belt and opened wide.  The rock orbited its way straight into his gut, extending the silence.  Eventually, a hesitant few gurgles seemed to test if digestion was even still a viable option.  A few sloshes joined in before the torrent of digestive noises finally resumed.  His stomach made a number of delighted sounds that wove their way in and out of the sounds of work, praising him for the gifts.  Templeton, however, was done with work, and settled into his fat to rest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely he'd learned to identify where his fat was being distributed.  Much of the moon had settled into his chins.  Mars was going to his rear, and mercury padded the joke that was his arms.  Venus began to make a home in his lower gut.  The Earth, however, had deposited itself immediately above his navel.  It rested there heavily, rubbing against his churning innards pleasantly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Days passed, then weeks.  Templeton basked in the warmth of the massive sun, feeling the heat on his belly improve digestion.  Strange phenomenon began to occur in his belly, but it didn't bother the rat in the least.  Bizarre noises would sometimes bubble their way through his body as if the sounds themselves were moving.  Sometimes a few would join up, grow in size and volume, and roar until either meeting with more or they simply faded away.  On occasion, however, his gut would clench in conjunction to such meet-ups.  Some grew so intense his entire body shook and rippled violently and it would feel like his digestive system did somersaults.  There was no pain in these \"stomachquakes,\" however, just increased pressure that would eventually dissipate.  His groaning girth simply rolled around in contagious ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith half a planet still to go, Templeton's eyes shot open at a familiar feeling.  Even with indigestion incomplete, his belly was beginning to demand more.  The closest thing to him was a gas planet, and he worried about how filling simple air would be.  But his guts rumbled longer and louder with every passing moment, and his only option was to give it a try.  The rat made his way over, biting into and swallowing Uranus's gases and its moons in the process.  His belly seemed confused as it became bloated, not sure what to make of such a strange meal, but still growled for more.  Upon finishing the gas giant off, Templeton's belly only made odd little noises.  Despite a meal that so seemingly so unsubstantial, he felt full.  With his bloated stomach trying to figure out what to do with this unusual belly load, Templeton decided to take preemptive measures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Neptune passed, the rat descended upon it.  It effectively silenced his stomach completely as it bloated further.  Picking off the two moons, Templeton knew his stomach would be appeased for a long time.  However, given that it recently surprised him by complaining with nearly half a planet sitting in his gut, he didn't stop there.  He opened wide and let Saturn's rings flow into his belly, along with its moons.  Titan was a delicious bite, and he herded the other moons into his mouth.  Saturn was a massive feast indeed, and he could feel his fat fret over the size.  Despite the incredible desire to bask in his new definition of obesity, he wasn't going to leave off there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton never imagined what eating a storm would be like, especially one so much larger than Earth.  It was the first bite of Jupiter, and it entered his belly with great protest.  He could feel its power trying to batter his stomach and swollen intestines and his guts began to protest.  Despite the fact his stomach was actually telling him to stop, it didn't deter him.  Bite after bite Jupiter swelled Templeton to even grander scales until the entire planet and its massive moons had a new home.  The rat floated there, dumbstruck as his belly at the feeling.  Deep inside he could feel the gas giants in his belly mingle like the ingredients of a mixing bowl.  They created new currents that swirled and churned his belly all by themselves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long series of uncomfortable whines and groans were the complaints of his intestines.  Grumbles issued from his stomach for an hour until both fell quite.  His innards didn't know what to do, especially with the number and severity of the storms that raged inside of him.  Aside from the volatility of his meal, his belly remained silent for a long time.  After a few days, Templeton snapped out of his stupor and began to wonder if his stomach would start digesting at all. Still, there was nothing that could be done other than feel how the swirls of gasses worked the inside of his stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a week, his guts twisted and began to slide around.  Long moans issued from him and loud, gassy bubbling sounds met his submerged ears.  Slowly, he began to digest.  Gurgles and sloshes joined in as his digestion slowly churned the gas into fatty liquids.  His entire body wobbled as massive amounts of fat began to spread lazily around his belly.  And then, after a few days, digestion finally settled into its own pace, burbling and groaning along happily and sloshing in a congratulatory way to Templeton's appetite.  Stomachquakes became a near-constant occurrence and frequently several would happen at once.  Sometimes they grew so great in number his digestion would pause so both he and his belly could relish the intensity of the internal stomach massage.  All the while, storms continued to rumble through his gut and give him great delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes the rat would still mull over the concept of his home planet and feel for it.  The fat from Earth, despite the amount of new lard pouring in, still sat right above his navel.</span></div></div>",

In fact, for a week he'd fallen into an overindulged stupor, the pressure on his intestines and the vibrations of his stomach immensely pleasurable.  That week his belly groaned with countless \"stomachquakes\" that were more intense than usual.  But as digestion continued, the rat began to muse over his future appetite.  Even weeks later he still felt stuffed far beyond his limits, but then again, he found long ago that those limits were more optional than anything else.  The idea of feeling even fuller was always and appealing one.  He gazed off at the sun and wondered if his belly could handle it.  Then again, he'd been digesting poisonous gases and liquids with little problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the size.  It was hundreds of times bigger than his current mass.  Sure, the swollen rat was astronomically pushed beyond any size his body should ever attain, but he'd never tried to swallow anything that large before, and taking bites out of a flaming sun didn't sound like a good idea.  Still, he tried to get his gut used to the idea, talking to it and attempting to shift his belly in pleasurable ways to encourage it.  After a few days, it seemed to work.  Though still in the midst of digestion and far from hungry, he felt his stomach clench a little and release a long, muffled growl of approval.  As he continued talking to it Templeton's gut grew louder until it did something unexpected.  His belly stretched towards the sun until he could feel his flesh press against something warm.  Thanks to gravity, he felt the rest of his body follow.  He blinked as a dark spot began to grow over the surface of the sun, which began to slowly sink into his navel.  After a day, his own stomach had swallowed the sun, which glowed through the fat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth rat and stomach moaned at the enormous bellyload.  His guts burbled, musing over how to digest a sun.  There was no period of silence.  His belly had anticipated the feast.  However, the sun did ignite the remaining gasses, sending a shock through rolls of fat.  This, in turn, caused an onslaught of stomachquakes.  First one, then a few shook his innards.  The few became hundreds, and the hundreds to thousands, then millions all occurring at once.  Templeton groaned contentedly as every portion of his body jiggled and rumbled, and each at different paces.  His stomach felt like it was ballooning and his intestines felt like spaghetti being tossed in a bowl.  The two rubbed up against each other, massaging and contributing to the stomachquakes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the shakings began to subside, replaced with digestive gurgles that were even more complex than normal.  Templeton listened carefully, shifting his belly around to try to feel.  As he felt food shift from one organ to another, he realized he had many more than he did before his belly ate the sun.  Somehow, amidst the stomachquakes, his stomach had split into several, and Templeton imagined himself as a cosmic cow for a moment.  His intestines snaked their way even longer, and something else seemed to have formed past them.  But as that organ began to fill with well-digested fat, the rat grinned at the sensation.  It churned just like his stomachs did.  This one however, was much larger than his stomach ever was.  The fact that even that new huge stomach was swelling proved just how much he'd just eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton grinned, listening to the sloshes of the digesting sun and taking pride in his belly.  His guts had adapted to this lifestyle and could act on their own, giving him the unique opportunity to eat with his mouth and his navel.  He looked forward to how fast he'd be gaining once he reached another solar system.  But for now, it was time to delight in digestion.</span></div></div>",

Templeton couldn't help smiling: he had trained his stomach to crave food as much as he did, attempting to grasp the ever elusive feeling of fullness that came at rare moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, Lurvy came out of the house - and walked right past his pen. He slopped Wilbur, but headed towards the portion of the barn where he kept all the tools. Soon the sound of a saw and hammer could be heard, but Templeton was far too fat to move in order to see what was being built.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours passed, and the noise ceased. It was nearly noon, and Templeton had still received no food. None of the usual gathering of gawkers had come to give him any scraps either, which made him more curious than angry. What could possibly be more important than his feeding?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally some people began to arrive; but they looked as if they hadn't come to give the tubby rat any treats. Mr. Zuckerman jumped into his truck and backed it up toward Templeton's pen, and everyone gathered around him. Lurvy brought out a large crate, and the pieces fell together. \"They're taking me away!\" thought Templeton. \"But why did they not feed me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the men grabbed onto the rat and hoisted him into the crate, and then lifted the crate into the truck. It took a lot of working and sweating, which would have made Templeton proud, if he wasn't so worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally listening to that doctor, eh Zuckerman?\" said one of the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuckerman climbed up into the driver's seat of his truck. \"Well, it has more to do with the mobs of animal rights activists the vet threatened to bring here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnimal rights? What about the right to engorge himself? Templeton wished he could lodge a complaint with these people. Most barn animals didn't understand threats or deceit, but Templeton was a rat, and rats knew all about those sorts of things. Zuckerman was obviously forced into doing whatever the veterinarian had asked of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they were off, bouncing along country roads as they neared the city. After a while, they entered the town and pulled up to a huge veterinarian facility. The building was obviously designed for the care of large animals with their means of transportation in mind, due to the loading dock that allowed the workers to move Templeton from the truck bed onto a wheeled pallet. Zuckerman walked into an office and left the rat there in his crate. His stomach complained loudly, now that it was three o'clock and he still hadn't received any food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting a while, a man with a clipboard approached the worker in charge of moving animals around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been two months since that fateful visit to the fair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton continued to visit Wilbur every day at mealtime for his share of the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Wilbur had been content to let the rat eat first. It had been the deal \u2013 Templeton saves Charlotte\u2019s children, he gets first dibs. Unfortunately, Templeton\u2019s insatiable hunger often left the poor pig with not much to eat. The rat rarely ate more than half of the slops, but that still wasn\u2019t much for poor Wilbur, who was much bigger than Templeton and thus needed more than him. But Templeton was a heavy eater, and eating in vast quantities was a delight for him. Convincing him to eat less was easier said than done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other animals noticed that while Templeton was steadily gaining weight, Wilbur was starting to lose weight. This caused some worry amongst them. Even if the Zuckermans didn\u2019t kill Wilbur, he\u2019d probably still die of starvation in a few months. Plus, he\u2019d hardly survive the harsh winter ahead if he didn\u2019t have more meat on his bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton didn\u2019t seem to care. He just wanted food. Lots of food. Enough food to fill him until he simply couldn\u2019t anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe animals watched him one day as he crawled out from his hidey-hole under the trough. The rat was getting a little too big to squeeze through it. He\u2019d tried making it bigger, but the structural integrity of the ground under it made him worry it\u2019d collapse and ruin his home. So he was squeezing himself through every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watched in judgmental disgust as he dove into the trough and gobbled up whatever he could. He moaned with pleasure as he did so, enjoying every last bite. It was fifteen minutes before he was done, and he heaved himself up and out of the trough, licking the slop off his fur. His belly was swollen, sloshing with his latest meal, and he patted it proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilbur peered into the trough. Still half left, but that wasn\u2019t much to satisfy him. He sighed sadly and tucked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other animals watched Templeton settle in against a fencepost to digest for a while. The fat rat was getting fatter, and he was pleased as punch about it. They\u2019d all been pondering what to do about him. If he ate Wilbur out of house and home, all of Charlotte\u2019s hard work would be in vain. They\u2019d discussed it while he slept, and they\u2019d made a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goose fluttered down next to the engorged rodent and tutted. \u201cGoodness-oodness me,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLooks like you enjoyed your latest conquest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton opened a sleepy eye. He was annoyed at being awoken, but he couldn\u2019t help but smirk. \u201cIndeed,\u201d he said, licking his lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the orgasmic pleasure that comes from stuffing oneself \u2018til utter satiation.\u201d He patted his belly with fondness, and it jiggled like jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goose smirked back. \u201cA pity the fair has come and gone until next year. It\u2019ll be a long wait before you enjoy its bounties again\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d the rat snarled. \u201cI hate having to leave food uneaten for Wilbur. I don\u2019t get to enjoy it to its fullest extent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goose tried to hide the look of surprise. The rat had been holding back all this time? \u201cSo you\u2019re saying-aying-aying you could eat more in one sitting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course. Sadly, I have to wait many months until I can enjoy such a repast again\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goose decided it was time to unleash the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perhaps if you\u2019re quick and sneaky, you can join in the fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton\u2019s mouth was watering, his nap now forgotten. \u201cYes...,\u201d he murmured. \u201cTime I had a proper feast\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA nightly feast,\u201d the goose added hastily. \u201cAfter all, the circus doesn\u2019t just stop \u2013 it travels. Every night, you\u2019ll have a fresh feast awaiting so long as you stay with them. Doesn\u2019t that sound marvelous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it does\u2026 it does\u2026 It sounds\u2026 excellent! I must be off! Tell Wilbur that if I\u2019m not back tonight, he\u2019s free to eat his slops forever! This circus will be like heaven on Earth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton rolled himself over until he was on his feet. His hind legs dangled helplessly as his belly had grown to the point they didn\u2019t reach the ground anymore. Struggling, he rolled back until he was up on his hind legs. He grabbed hold of his stomach with his front legs and carried it awkwardly, waddling to the fence and heaving himself over it. He didn\u2019t bother with the goodbyes. He knew he wasn\u2019t well-liked by his fellow farm animals. Time to leave their judgement behind and have a good old fashioned free-for-all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found the pickup truck and saw some trash to hide under. It was a very long wait. He listened to the farmer and his wife board the truck and drive off down the road. He listened to the irritating chatter of the family and children as they climbed into the flatbed. He listened to the drive there, and then he felt the truck stop as it parked. He waited until he was certain everyone had disembarked and poked his head out over the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing. There was a large colorful tent with searchlights waving back and forth. He could hear loud voices and lots of racket and music coming from within the structure. He also saw lots of people still walking around outside. Scowling, he clambered down and scurried his way over to the nearest smaller tent. There had to be a place he could hide until the lights went low.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Might make a nice place to rest until it was safe to venture out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, he took in the occupants of the tent. Some large animals he\u2019d never seen before towered over him<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d said a female voice. \u201cWhat\u2019ve we here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and saw a massive hippopotamus peering down at him curiously. \u201cI\u2019m Templeton,\u201d he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Templeton,\u201d the hippo said in a big jovial voice. \u201cNeed directions?

Who is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 a rat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA rat?!? No! Keep it away! Keep it away!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Templeton asked warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind him,\u201d sighed the hippo. \u201cThat\u2019s the elephant. Elephants are deathly afraid of mice and rats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s just so small!\u201d the elephant wailed. \u201cThey can get anywhere!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton looked perplexed. \u201cSuch a large creature terrified of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, don\u2019t get too close,\u201d the hippo advised. \u201cShe\u2019s liable to step on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing personal,\u201d the giraffe added. \u201cJust a reflex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d the hippo continued. \u201cWhat brings you through here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton remembered his mission. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to join you all on your travels,\u201d he said boldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d the giraffe remarked. \u201cDo you have an act?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if devouring massive quantities of food counts as an act.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh,\u201d the hippo murmured. \u201cNot so much joining the show as joining the cleanup committee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I intend to make a feast of the food left behind out there. Is it true? There\u2019s lots for a rat to eat out there, yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, indeed,\u201d said the giraffe. \u201cPlenty to eat. There\u2019s enough leftover food to feed an army of rats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Templeton said, his mouth watering. \u201cHow long before it\u2019s safe for me to venture out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossibly hours,\u201d the hippo replied. \u201cAfter that, everyone goes home. My advice \u2013 get some sleep. You\u2019ll have your pick of the place before too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton agreed, and he found some sweet-smelling straw in a corner near the hippo\u2019s quarters. He buried himself underneath it, just in case some people came by and possibly saw him. He worried he\u2019d be too excited to sleep properly, but it wasn\u2019t long before he relaxed and dozed off into dream land.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He cautiously crawled out of the straw. Listening to the snores of the large animals around him, he found the tent flap and crawled out. He saw the big tents had all gone dark, and there was not a soul to be seen, save for some night watchmen wandering up and down, but he figured they\u2019d not cause him much bother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach was empty, and that was good. It meant he had plenty of room for whatever lay before him. And a lot lay before him. Loads of food, rotting and decaying on the ground, awaited him. His mouth watered in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe goose was right again!\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe sure knows how to find a feast! Farewell, Wilbur! Good riddance, judgmental farm animals! Enjoy life behind bars! This rat\u2019s going to have the meal of a lifetime!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his announcement made, Templeton dove headfirst into a discarded bag of buttery popcorn. He ate the entire contents and moved onto some sandwiches long since abandoned. He found everything to be to his liking \u2013 nicely aged and rotten to the core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCotton candy, melted ice cream, hunks of cheese, doughy pretzels \u2013 it all went into his gullet. It was amazing. It seemed to stretch for acres. He ate as much as he could fit in his mouth, not even bothering to chew. He swallowed everything he came across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what feasting!\u201d he cried. \u201cThis place is marvelous! Better than the fair! So much variety! Must have more! Must have more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe devoured an entire slice of watermelon, spitting out the seeds. He ate two more boxes of popcorn and the remnants of a dropped ice cream cone. He found a trashcan and dove inside, finding so much discarded food. So many half-eaten hotdogs. So many half-finished fries. So many much ketchup and mustard. So many half-completed apples. He heaved himself out and waddled eagerly to the nearest stand. He found it to have caramel apples. He ate three in rapid succession, and then found the container with the caramel. He pulled on the nozzle and put his mouth on it, guzzling as much as he could stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he found another stand, this one full of peanuts and pretzels. He swarmed the trashcan and found so many remnants of unfinished orders. He ate and ate until his mouth felt too salty. He needed something to wash it down. He found a few discarded drinks and guzzled them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, it was finally done. Templeton was laid out flat on his back, panting from sheer exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach was enormous. Big and round like a bowling ball, and about the size and weight of one. His tiny little rat body was almost being crushed beneath it. He hiccupped heavily and patted it happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhhh\u2026,\u201d he moaned. \u201cSo much\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around the circus grounds around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd still so much left!\u201d he sighed sadly. \u201cI barely put a dent in it!\u201d<br>\r\nHe hiccupped again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well\u2026,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to try again tomorrow night\u2026 Oh, but it will fill up again! Then I\u2019ll \u2013 HIC! Ohhhhhhhhh\u2026 I mustn\u2019t think much more on it, or I\u2019ll lose all I worked for\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid there for an hour, groaning in pain. His stomach sloshed and gurgled above him like a mighty tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he soon saw the sun coming up, and he needed to make tracks. He rolled over onto his hind legs and determinedly waddled off towards the animal tent.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I hardly put a dent in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo chuckled in amusement. \u201cWell, there\u2019ll be plenty again tomorrow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton hiccupped again. \u201cUgh\u2026 Don\u2019t talk about it just now. Goodness me\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a stomachache before\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill think you can travel with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd do that every night? I would love such an opportunity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let a little indigestion get me down,\u201d Templeton sneered. \u201cI\u2019m a naturally heavy eater, and the feast alone pleasures me to no end. I\u2019ll gorge and gobble and stuff myself every night, and come home in this exact condition every time. I\u2019ll feast until I can\u2019t hold another mouthful. And it will be marvelous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo stared in amazement. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first rat to come through here looking for free food, but bless me if you aren\u2019t the most gluttonous. I think you\u2019ll fit in just fine around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton smiled. He\u2019d never been complimented for his gluttony before. He hiccupped and rubbed his enormous belly, listening to it churn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow listen,\u201d the hippo continued. \u201cYou need to find a place to hide. The people will be here within a few hours to prepare. Might be nice if you found a nice place to rest until nightfall again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed. I\u2019ll just\u2026 oof\u2026 find myself a spot\u2026 Going to need a lot more straw\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton heaved himself up and waddled off towards the nearest pile of straw he could find. He covered as much of himself as he could before settling in for a long day\u2019s sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo shook her head in amazement. This rat was just astounding. She watched his massive belly rise and fall as he dozed off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Templeton thoroughly enjoyed his time with the circus. It was about a week since he'd joined up, acting as a one-rat cleanup crew for his new friends. Every night, when the lights were off and the people had gone home, he'd go running out into the night and eat his fill. Heck, sometimes he'd eat more than his fill. He'd eat until he had to cram stuff into his stomach. And every night, he'd haul his bloated body all the way back to the animal tent next to the hippo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton had grown fond of the hippo. The other animals didn't particularly care for him, but she was always friendly and complimentary of his accomplishments. She was clearly a big eater, too, but she was so large already that she couldn't really enjoy the benefits that came from an enormous stuffing. Sometimes, he had to physically roll back to the tent because he was so perfectly round. He didn't mind - it was great fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the week, though, Templeton peered out one morning and saw there were fewer multi-colored tents than there had been yesterday. \"What's going on out there?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're packing up,\" the giraffe replied. \"Time to move on to a new town. New prospects. New horizons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton looked around curiously. \"So what happens to you all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We get loaded into trucks and ride to the next destination,\" replied the rhino. \"All very exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure... So where will I be going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence as the other animals considered that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the hippo spoke up. \"Well... that all depends on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be staying with us? Or will you be going back to your farm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton stared at her for a long moment as if she were an idiot. \"Why on Earth would I want to go back to the farm?\" he cried. \"A farm full of pious animals who look down on me, barely enough food to keep me bloated, and nothing interesting to look forward to? I'm staying with you guys. Never have I seen such a wide variety of treats and goodies! I've been in hog's heaven all week, and I'm hardly going to let it end now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo smiled slightly. \"Very well then. I would advise you to keep your head down and time your moves perfectly. The people will hardly allow you to climb aboard yourself, so try to stay near me. I'll share my pen with you as long as you keep out of sight when they're around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Templeton said gratefully. \"I look forward to the journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long day as Templeton waited for them to come for the animals. And even then, it took a long time for them to get to the hippo. The lions, tigers, zebras, monkeys, and even some sea lions were going before they finally got around to her. The hippo sent him a subtle wink, signalling for him to make himself scarce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long time before the hippo was even at her wagon, but thankfully, once they had the door open, she put up a slight fuss about moving so that all eyes would be on her. She watched craftily as the rat hefted his hefty body inside her sanctuary, vanishing into its shadows. Content that he was safe for now, she stopped struggling and allowed herself to be guided into the truck. The door was shut behind her, and she got nice and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton poked his head out of the straw. \"Phew!\" he said, waving a paw in front of his long nose. \"It really stinks in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I tend to be in here for quite some time,\" she replied. \"It serves multiple purposes, if you get my meaning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely. It's like I'm living with the horses again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's transport to free food. Take it or leave it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton grunted and hauled himself up to a small window in the truck to take in the world outside. He watched as the old circus site faded into the distance. He took in the fresh air gratefully, dangling from the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, they passed a familiar site. The Zuccerman farm. He gazed at it for a long time, knowing that it would probably be the last time he ever saw it. He supposed he should be feeling some level of fondness or sadness, but in truth, he really didn't. Barely a thing to eat, animals that barely trusted him and constantly being pushed around. What kind of life was that? How was he supposed to live like that? With this circus, he could eat constantly and enjoy himself. He had an actual friend here. He glanced back down at the hippo, who'd gone to sleep already during the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoisted himself up a little higher so he could rest his belly on the ledge instead of having to hold it up. He marveled at how far it bulged out in front of him. It was truly astounding. He loved how big he was getting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to himself, he slid down back into the straw for a nap. It was going to be a long trip.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Templeton awoke to the sound of the truck door being opened. With an undignified yelp, he sleepily dove under the straw just as the men were coming in to help the hippo down to the ground. It was a long time, but eventually, when the coast was clear, the fat rat was able to poke his head out and check around. He scurried to the open hatch and saw everyone was focused on getting the various animals safely to the tents that were still being assembled. Grumbling at having to move about during the day, he discreetly made his way down the tent and towards some shrubbery so he could watch from a safe distance and then join the animals when the sun went down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke hours later. The sun was setting, giving him plenty of shadows to maneuver around in until he found the right tent. He scurried around until he found the hippo's pen and joined her inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" said the hippo. \"Was wondering where you'd disappeared to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had to lie low,\" Templeton replied. \"Is there no show tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not tonight, no. Basic assembly and so forth. It'll take most of the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drat... That means no scraps of food on the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid not. But if you desperately need food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which I always do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... you could try the town outside and find someplace to look for leftovers. There's bound to be some restaurants that have thrown out food for you to pilfer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton considered this. He'd had plenty of sleep all day, so he wasn't interested in just sitting around until sun up. Not to mention that he was absolutely starving at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" he said at last. \"Travel broadens the mind. Among other things...,\" he added, patting his stomach. \"Very well. I'll try to be back before sun up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the rat scurried back out of the tent and looked around. He gave the air a quick sniff, ascertaining which way the town was. As he got closer, he made his way to the road, making sure it was safe. This late at night, there wasn't much traffic. Listening carefully for any possible threats, he sniffed the air once more, and he detected a rather nice smell in the air that seemed inviting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScurrying down the street, he found himself face to face with a building where the lights were all turned off. He looked up at the sign over the door, and he saw it was a bakery. Finding this very promising, he disappeared around the corner. To his joy, he found what he was looking for. A large dumpster. He scurried up the back of it and peered down inside, enjoying the rotting smells inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was so much bread. Bread in all kinds of shapes and sizes. All gone stale and brittle from being out in the sun. Obviously leftovers. Licking his lips, he did a perfect swan dive into the pile and ate. He chomped and munched and swallowed his way through the pile of old bread like it was nothing. He ate all the biscuits, muffins, loaves, baguettes, bagels, croissants, teacakes, crumpets, potato cakes and hot-cross buns he came across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an hour before he'd finally polished all that he could. He was still gnawing on some old pumpernickel when he realized how full he'd gotten. He rolled over onto his back and peered down at his stomach. What was once a flabby blob was now a taught sphere. It gurgled and moaned from all the carbs it had just had crammed inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton was in a daze, but he smiled all the same. A modest meal, he thought. Good enough for now. He ought to be going, though. It was a bit of a walk back to the circus, and he wanted to get back before the sun came up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hefty grunt, he made his way up and over the side of the dumpster, slowly lowering himself to the ground. He sniffed the air for any danger, but there were no predators roaming this particular street, so he awkwardly waddled along the sidewalk he'd come down, looking for the hedge he'd slipped through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a very long time. His belly was dragging along the pavement, scratching him a little. He was tempted to stop and rest, but he was determined to finish the slog. He had to keep going before it was too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, he saw the hedge. He looked around and saw the opening between the branches he'd used earlier. He hauled himself up and through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept he got stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof!\" he cried. \"What...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis enormous belly had gotten wedged in the opening. He pushed against the branches, but they weren't bending anytime soon. He was wedged in tightly. Groaning angrily to himself, he tried to force himself out, but it was no good. He wasn't going anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curse my glorious appetite,\" he muttered, letting his front legs droop disappointingly from where he stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he heard something behind him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Templeton twisted and squirmed with all his might, but he couldn't budge his bloated self free from the tight branches. He couldn't even turn to see what needed to be done to free himself. He tried going backwards, but that didn't work either. He was well and truly stuck. He was just reflecting on how this couldn't get any worse when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well...,\" said a gruff female voice. \"What have we here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton tried twisted around again, but he couldn't really see who it was. He heard a rustling in the bushes, and to his surprise, another rat slunk easily through the branches and looked him over. She had a lighter shade of grey fur than him, but it was messier and dirtier. She was also way skinnier than him. Any rat compared to Templeton was going to be skinny, but this rat was almost skin and bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's, shall we say, bitten off more than he can chew?\" she continued, laughing uproariously at her own wit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton blinked in bewilderment. Was this really happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady rat regained her composure and looked him over. \"Looks like you've gone and gotten yourself stuck, fat boy,\" she said with a smirk. \"Care to explain yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes disparagingly. \"Tell me where you found food,\" she said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton glared at her, about ready to tell her to bug off. But then he remembered his predicament and thought of something. \"Get me out of here and I'll tell you,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him a long look, like she really didn't want to. But she peered down at her lack-of-belly and grimaced. She didn't seem to think she had much choice. \"Oh, very well,\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scurried over to the branches and gave them a look. Once ascertaining the problem, she pulled aside the two upper branches that held him in place, and once they were free, she gave him a quick kick in the rump that sent him tumbling end over end until he landed in a heap in the dirt. Chuckling to herself, she slipped through the branches and found him lying on his back, his massive stomach sticking straight up in the air. She took a moment to marvel at how huge it was before leaning against it casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" she drawled. \"Deal's a deal! How'd you get this gut, guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton sneered. \"Wouldn't <i>you </i>like to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I would, actually,\" she sneered back, drumming her fingers impatiently on his taut stomach. \"Feels pretty packed in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please. A mild repast. <i>Nothing </i>compared to what I'll have tomorrow night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's tomorrow night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, haven't you noticed?\" he asked, making a grand gesture at the tents looming not too far away. \"The circus is in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a glance at the brightly-colored tents. \"What of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you happen to know when to venture out, it's a unadulterated hedonistic paradise for a glutton such as myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I was simply getting something to satisfy my hunger until the feast tomorrow. Stuffed myself enough that I'll be able to sleep through most of the show tomorrow, and then, a huge field of spilled food, just for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady rat looked impressed. \"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton began to wonder if maybe he had said too much. \"Yes, well... thanks for unsticking me. Must be off. Toodles!\" He tried to get up and run, but his stomach was still too heavy, and he fell on his back once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled and patted his swell. \"My, my, quite a belly you got goin' on here... A lady rat such as myself might be intrigued as to how to grow one for herself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton scowled. \"Get your own circus. This one's mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned down to glare at him straight in the eye. \"Now, now, big guy. Let's be rational about this. Allow me to join you in your feast tonight, and this secret stays with me. If you can't be a good boy and share your bounty, I'll alert every single rat in town about this. You think you're the only gluttonous rodent around? I can think of fifteen rats off the top of my head who'd be all over this. Think you can take them all on en mass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence as he regarded her. His eyes were a mixture of shock, horror, anger and impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Be back tomorrow,\" he said at last. \"Once the sun is down and all the cars are gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally released his stomach and walked off, pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton knew he shouldn't ask, but he felt he had to at this point. \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at him with a confident smile. \"Gula,\" she replied swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Gula disappeared back into the shrubbery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton stared. \"... What a stupid name...,\" he muttered before waddling back to the tent.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All the next day, Templeton slept in the straw of the animal tent, enjoying the peace from all the animals being elsewhere for a while. He could hear the distant sounds of music, laughter, honking, squeaking and explosions. Goodness, circuses were strange. If not for the food, he didn't see much appeal in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the day finally gave way to night, and soon, the animals were being returned to the tent. He was awoken by the heavy stomps of an elephant's feet, and he looked on as all the animals took to their stalls and quarters for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, he looked up and saw the hippo was settling into her straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dearie me, looks like you had a long show,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even the monkeys are exhausted,\" said the hippo. \"And they're a hearty bunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating, I'm sure... How long before I can venture out? I'm desperate for some dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Growing that stomach of yours?\" sneered a lion from his cage. \"That's right. That's just what I like to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you leave the poor thing alone?\" sighed the giraffe. \"For heaven's sake, you get fed plenty around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always welcome a little something extra, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just zip it,\" grumbled the hippo, before readdressing Templeton. \"Ignore him. And also stay far from his cage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing full well the dangers, Templeton shrank back. He was glad the hippo was a vegetarian. \"So how much longer shall I wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the people depart, first,\" the hippo advised. \"Then it'll be safe to venture out. Once the headlights all disappear, you're safe to eat to your heart's content.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm, I shall... was it a large crowd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noisy one, too...,\" grumbled a rhino distastefully. \"But don't worry. Plenty of spilled treats out there, waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I like the sound of that,\" said Templeton, rubbing his stomach. His mind still thought back to that annoying rat who would be returning to join him. He hated the idea, but maybe the field was large enough that they could be on opposite sides and have zero interaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perhaps she'll get eaten by the lion</i>, he thought hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite soon, however, the last of the cars departed, and the animals were mostly asleep. Relieved, Templeton scurried out from under the tent and peered outside. He took a good whiff of the night air, and he smelled the salty sweet rotting smell of the spilled junk food of the circus grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on time!\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, he turned around and saw Gula had appeared in the yard not far from him. She walked up to him with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for a nice round of unadulterated gluttony, isn't it?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unadulterated, indeed,\" Templeton replied flatly. \"Perhaps you'd best... stick to that side over there?\" he suggested, pointing in the distance. \"Cover more ground that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" she agreed, turning her nose up at him. \"Enjoy your gorge, as I shall surely enjoy mine. The best I'll have eaten in many years. See you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking off, she flicked her tail at him, making him jump back slightly. He scowled at her retreating form, hoping that maybe something awful would happen, and she'd never be seen again. In fact, it'd be great if all other rats were destroyed in some way to prevent them from potentially taking what was rightfully his away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXenophobic thoughts were never pleasant at the beginning of a feast, so he put them out of his head. Took a deep breath. Looked out over the food before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYards of discarded candy, popcorn, ice cream, hot dogs... His mouth watered at the sight. Forget the stupid other rats. This was his. Everything laid before him. His belly rumbled. It was time to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zillions of calorific foods just waiting for me to devour them!\" he exclaimed. \"Let me at 'em!\" He dove into a half-finished bag of popcorn and began delightedly devouring the contents therein. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The thing about Gula was that she had grown up on the streets. She was a literal street rat. Typically, she lived in the sewers and traveled as far as she need to find food. The problem with this lifestyle, she found, was that it was really difficult to find a decent meal this way. She was constantly running up and down drainpipes, getting chased by cats, getting swatted at by shopkeepers... It was just a mess. Far too many obstacles for far too little food. Such a hectic out-of-control lifestyle simply wasn't cutting it for her anymore. How was a lady rat supposed to enjoy herself with a weary existence such as this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was part of the reason why she was so skinny. She absolutely hated it. With so little food to eat, she didn't know how she'd survived for so long. She tried to make the best of what she could find, but it was hardly enough for someone with her insatiability. She yearned for the day when she had an endless feast laid before her that she could gobble down completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when she came across a rat that was the fattest she'd ever seen in her life, she immediately knew she'd found someone who could help her. Someone who could lead her to the feast of a lifetime. Someone who knew a good supply. Templeton clearly knew his way around a good gorge, seeing as how big around he was. She wasn't about to let a possibly literal gravy train escape her so easily. And she could've made good on her threat. She knew plenty of rats that would swarm the circus if word got out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ditched the fat rat to scurry to a further part of the field. Right away, she saw the myriad of fattening foods all scattered around, waiting for her to come along and stuff them in her mouth. Licking her lips, she found an old discarded hot dog and bit into it. She was so old and moldy, she couldn't help but swoon. Better than she'd expected. She'd truly found the mother load. She finished it off and rubbed her tiny stomach with glee. How much more could she possibly fit inside herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically squealing with glee, she ran deeper into the field, looking at all the junk food waiting to be devoured. She found a half-eaten box of malted milk balls and poured them into her mouth, swallowing them whole. Her stomach protruded outwards in a lumpy shape, as if she'd just consumed a bag of marbles. She tossed the box aside and found a box of popcorn that she dove into and ate up every last bit. She found some old sandwiches and boiled eggs, devouring them very messily, getting them all over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was definitely growing. Her once skinny tummy was now a rounded mound, bulging with its contents. She gave it a good rub, feeling pleased with herself. She could've stopped right there. She was nice and full now. But it had only been a few minutes. Surely there was room for more. She grabbed a discarded bag of M&amp;Ms and chomped through every single one, expanding her stomach even further. She let out a belch and patted it. Oh yeah. There was still room for much more in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found more food wherever she went. Wormy apples, half-eaten pizza, spilled mustard, soft-pretzels, gooey cheese, melted ice cream... She ate it all, too. Every last bit of it. Ate whatever was at hand. She grew with every bite. Her stomach went from a mound to a bulge to a ball. It amazed her just how big she was getting. Soon, her stomach was so enormous that she couldn't even walk on all fours without getting stuck. She had to roll herself back onto her hind legs and walk along in short bursts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would fall face first into whatever food she'd have next. She found an old doughnut that needed a home. She fell into a few cookies that had been thoughtlessly abandoned. She tripped into some moldy cheese that had been in the sun all day. She ate every last bit. She was slowly approaching the size, shape and weight of an average bowling ball. It felt absolutely incredible. She couldn't stop. She had to have more. Somewhere, there had to be more. Anything. Just something else to eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she spotted that \"more\" she'd been looking for. It was an old pitcher of lemonade, just sitting atop a wooden picnic table. Like a creature possessed, she stumbled and waddled all the way, constantly falling over as her now-massive stomach wobbled back and forth. It took a lot of dedication and patience, but she was determined to consume as much as she could. She struggled her way up, digging her claws into the wood with all her might. She had to make it. She made it onto the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted, she reached up to the table edge. There was a plaid tablecloth, which gave her an idea. She hooked her claws in and pulled it down, pulling the pitcher towards her. It toppled awkwardly from the movement, tipping in her direction. Bracing herself, she lifted up and caught the edge in her paws, and then she opened her mouth and let the watery contents pour into her stomach. Almost an entire pitcher of warm salty lemonade went cascading down her throat and into her already-stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula let out a groan of ecstasy. She was so-o-o-o-o-o full now. And it just kept coming. She had to readjust the pitcher so it would all flow into her stomach. She could feel it growing heavier, swelling like a water balloon, hanging lower and lower, threatening to pull her down in the process. She chugged it all down, faster and faster, enjoying just how utterly huge she was. She had never felt this full before. This was above and beyond what she could've ever hoped for. This was a rat's dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the lemonade was spent. She dizzily pushed the pitcher away and leaned against the table edge while her belly sloshed and churned, swaying gently. She gave herself a push in the opposite direction before pivoting on her hind legs to get herself facing ninety degrees to the right. She attempted to walk towards the edge so she could climb down, but her stomach was so utterly enormous that the weight was too much, and she fell instead. She landed on the ground with a loud slosh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula bounced briefly before settling. She let out a moan of pain. From atop her belly, she was at least a good two feet off the ground. She was so stuffed. She rubbed her swell with orgasmic delight, rubbing her fullness. She gave it a gentle slap that caused her to gasp in pain again. She let out a belch or two before trying to move again. But she couldn't. There was simply no way she was going anywhere. She moaned under her breath, feeling such joy at her accomplishment. She felt amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she heard movement, and she realized that Templeton was coming.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A large shadow fell over the female rat as she looked up at the massive grey orb shuffling over towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton was enormous. He was so huge that he looked like a slightly-misshapen planet. His little ratty head peered down at her from above, a sleepy yet smug grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula looked him up and down in silent reverence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, he spoke. \"Well...,\" he said in a husky tired voice. \"I believe... I've had... just about... enough... Mainly because... there's... no food left... over there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula swallowed, marveling at the size of the other rat. \"How...? How did you...? How are you even...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton smirked. \"My... stomach... can handle... anything...\" He slapped it a few times, but had to stop from the pain it caused him. \"Ohhhhh, what a feast... I can... barely move...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula was still watching him. \"Absolutely incredible...,\" she murmured. \"I've never seen anyone with an appetite like yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton shrugged modestly. \"Well... I see no reason... to stop eating... just because... I'm getting full... Just gotta... keep at it... until it's all... gone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula licked her lips, but she was still too full to eat another bite. She looked up and saw the moon in the sky, and a thought struck her. \"So... how do we get away before the sun comes up and the people come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton chuckled. \"Well... I'm off... back to the tent... to hide under some straw... You'll have to go... wherever you came from...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on!\" she complained. \"I need a place to lie low for the day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... you wanted a... good gorge... and you... got one! This was a... one time deal! You're not getting... anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula glared at him. \"Try and stop me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton heaved himself in her direction, but he found in his engorged state that he couldn't move all that fast. His stomach gurgled and sloshed, and he let out a loud hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEEYOOP!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula was startled by the noise, and she couldn't laughing. She leaned forward and gave his jiggling belly a pat. \"Awww, poor fella,\" she teased. \"Did someone have too much to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton growled. \"No... such... thing...,\" he gasped. \"... HEEYOOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted him again. \"Good lord, what a stomach... We ought to stick you on the helium tank and see how long it takes you burst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... wish... you could be... this fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula looked him up and down, feeling the giant swell under her paws, enjoying how it was simultaneously taut and squishy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yes...,\" she admitted, \"I suppose I do a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton stopped struggling - partly because he was out of breath at this point - and regarded her quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... HEEYOOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula snickered at his unique style of hiccup. \"I can only imagine how full I'd have to be before I make that noise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton rubbed whatever he could of his massive stomach. \"You... desire to be fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's a dream... To eat until I'm so fat I can't even move. That's the best way to go, isn't it? Gluttony finally satiated, enormous stomach, so utterly and completely fat... But a girl can dream, can't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat in silence, listening to their bellies rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Templeton gave a weary sigh. \"Oh... very well. Let's get to the tent before the sun comes up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula perked up. \"Oh? Changed your mind, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Don't get used to it, though. Not likely to happen very often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so honored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better. Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving and grunting, the two fat rats struggled to get themselves moving. It took a very long time to drag themselves across the deserted circus ground. They'd be frequently tempted along the way by some food they'd missed, but they knew it was too much work to go and get it. Eventually, they settled for rolling, which allowed them to cover some distance. It was a long bumpy ride, and they felt a tad ill along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at last, they came to a bumpy stop just outside the tent. Grunting and heaving, they got the flap open and rolled inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula froze when she saw all the sleeping animals. \"What on earth...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh,\" hissed Templeton. \"Don't wake them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Will they eat us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they're just really grouchy when they're woken up. Bunch of whiners. Come on. The hippo's a vegetarian. She won't cause us any grief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waddled, rolled and dragged themselves over to the hippo's spot, sleeping in her straw. They made sure to hide out of view of any potential humans coming around. Of course, they'd become so large that they couldn't hide under the straw completely - their enormous bellies stuck straight up in the air. It took a very long time to cover themselves up completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally did, they were so exhausted that they passed out. Time to digest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No! They're multiplying! Keep away!\" wailed the elephant pitifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rats popped up in the straw in surprise. Even more surprising was that they had fallen asleep in very close proximity together. They struggled to get away from each other, but it was a bit difficult, seeing as how they were both still enormous from the previous night's gorge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo tutted at the sight. \"Well, well, well...,\" she drawled. \"Seems someone bit off a bit more than they could chew, eh, Templeton?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton floundered until he landed a respectable distance from Gula. \"She's just passing through,\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish!\" Gula replied hotly. \"This circus is the best meal I've had in my entire life! Never have I enjoyed such a repast before! There's just so much of it, and there was still so much left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giraffe rolled his eyes. \"Good lord, there's two of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo chuckled. \"Well, if you two stick together, you'll save the clean up crew a great deal of time and labor. No doubt they'll appreciate that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempleton glared. 'We are <i>not </i>sticking together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula glared back. \"Hmph! You keep to your side of the meal, and I'll keep to mine,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a match made in heaven,\" yawned the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rats glared at each other again and moved to opposing sides of the straw, with Templeton burying himself back under the straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula continued to glare at him until she felt the hippo's eyes on her. \"What do <i>you </i>want?\" she snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe stop watching him so much. Makes the attraction all the more obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female rat's eyes bugged out in alarm. \"What?! I wasn't...! I have standards, I'll have you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo smiled. \"So what brought you two together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! I mean... There's no 'together'! I helped him when he got his fat self stuck, and he repaid me by hooking me up with an endless buffet outside. That is <i>it</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't think he's cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! No! He is not cute! He's rude and selfish and pushy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're still looking at him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGula realized she was and looked back again. \"Okay, so I can't take my eyes off the fact that he's enormous. You have to respect a rat who can eat that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like big rats, do ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I -- what? No, stop it! I don't... He's just... He's so... utterly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off when she saw Templeton was once again asleep in the straw, his stuffed belly rising and falling with every snore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... <i>big</i>,\" she finished, a little breathless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo chuckled. This should be interesting.</span></div></div>",
