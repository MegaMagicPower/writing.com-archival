            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The light shined with all its strength on the military headquarter of Central City, making all the smooth rock structure to be covered  with a blinding white halo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs always, Colonel Roy Mustang was sitting behind his desk, with a scowled face, while checking some documentation and fixing some bumf.<br>\r\nHe was incredibly concentrated on his job, his head completely bent on the papers, when lieutenant Riza Hawkeye opened the door. The crackling caused Mustang to lift his head suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Colonel Mustang. Sorry to disturb You, but the Elric brothers are here, as You asked.\"<br>\r\n\"Very Well, make them enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward Elric, with a bored expression on his face, entered followed by his brother Alphonse, who overtopped him. He let his body fall on the soft green sofa in the middle of the office and then yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...why did you make us call so urgently? I hope it's something that worths it....\"<br>\r\n\"It does, fullmetal. Didn't you tell that the recent lack of job was getting you bored? Well, I have some job for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the colonel got up and gave to the young alchemist a ream of papers, and Edward began soon to leaf through it. They looked to be all dossiers of civilians, and each of them had their own photos and description. Underneath it there was a full summary of some investigations done and then a menacing bold type writing: \"disappeared in mysterious circumstances\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disappearing people? Police should be involved in this, not army.\"<br>\r\n\"If you had read more carefully those dossiers, fullmetal, probably you would have noticed that all these vanished people came all from villages of the Eastern Lands.\"<br>\r\n\"Eastern lands, you said?\"<br>\r\n\"The recently conquered by the army lands, you mean?\" Al said.<br>\r\n\"Not exactly \"conquered\".\" then Roy sat down again, putting his hands behind the head.<br>\r\n\"We received the jurisdiction on these lands since a recent long-lasting situation of anarchy made them uncontrollable and potentially dangerous.\"<br>\r\n\"I heard weird stories about those lands. I have shivers every time i recall them on my mind.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Al! Won't you really believe in some stupid ghost stories?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, not.....uhm, sorry.....\" Al said, really embarassed and bending down his head ashamed. <br>\r\nIf he had his real body, probably he would be in a slight cold sweat.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we think that these disappearances are not casual. We noticed that, in most of the cases, the victim was leaving his home or work place before vanishing, and that the event happened right after midnight or after one o'clock.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think it's a coindicence, it almost seems there's a coordinated action. I wouldn't be surprised if a group or some criminal organization was behind this.\"<br>\r\n\"We had a similar idea. But our investigation brought us to nowhere and, what's more, people is not happy to collaborate with foreigners, especially with soldiers.And this is where you make your entrance. Edward and Alphonse Elric, I want you to go to Eastern Lands and discover what's going on there. I want a complete report when you'll come back. I give you total carte blanche. You'll be leaving Central City tomorrow morning, if there's no problem. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n\"No, sir.\"<br>\r\n\"Good. Keep the dossiers with you. You'll need them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the Colonel dismissed the two Elric brothers, who were lead out of the office in the middle of the main corridor. The door behind them was closed with a slam. <br>\r\n\"Wow! Great deal! He just called us to solve a minor case in which his unqualified minions failed.\"<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say so, brother. This thing looks to be serious. According to the papers number, many people have left without a trace.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, probably you're right....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the dossier again and gave another look to those people, and those strange photos. The incredible shadows under their eyes, those possesed faces, altogether with the deepest and longest wrinkles Edward had ever seen on the older victims, make those people appear more as plastic masks. A thing which unsettled him a little deep inside his soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ed? What should we do?\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"I mean, what do you think we should do first? Mustang just gave us some informations, but we don't have still a good trail.\"<br>\r\n\"Uhm....I had an half idea about that. Once arrived, we should...\"</span></div></div>",

You're far grown up for fairytales.\" Ed said, a little annoyed by his brother behaviour.<br>\r\n\"Try to understand! Mustang just told us that these guys don't collaborate at all, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, right....\"<br>\r\n\"And furthermore all the disappearances take place at about midnight - 1AM. Isn't it?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, that's true....\"<br>\r\n\"Good! Then visiting those places at that time will be enough to find out what's going on there!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, but where do we begin? Eastern Lands are huge. And there are many villages and towns in that zone.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I noticed that most of the people in the dossier have vanished right in this town...\"<br>\r\nAlphonse eye fell right on a line telling \"Rauhsang\", right were his brother right finger was pointing.<br>\r\n\"...so our search will begin there.\"<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019ll be far more dangerous this way. Didn\u2019t you think about it? I heard the most terrible things about those villages. The strangest events take place there, the most terrible and incredible ones. I saw some people who were telling around about their travels in those lands forgotten by God. You had to see their eyes, brother. I will never get those scared eyes out of my mind\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cStop it! I heard enough! Now look at my lips: those-things-does-not-exist. Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk, then I don\u2019t need to explain that anymore. I don\u2019t want to hear that refrain again, is that ok?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, ok\u2026\u201d said Al, lowering his head. Ed whispered and then approached to his brother.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Al\u2026I want to be clear with you: I\u2019m not treating you like an idiot, just trying to make you reason. They\u2019re just legends. And, by the way,  how many criminals we caught before? I\u2019m sure this mission will be a piece of cake. So, are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026yes, I am.\u201d Al said, reassured by his brother attitude.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go to prepare what we could need for the travel.\u201d<br>\r\nAnd they both walked fast through the corridor, reaching for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed without nothing special happening. When Alphonse and Edward woke up the morning after the sun was still rising up in the sky and there were still stars hiding behind some thick cloud. After having clothed up, they got outside their home, where Havoc was waiting for them with a car. They left without hesitating. They didn\u2019t talk much during the travel and Edward spent most of the time looking outside the window where he could see the country landscape changing into wide green forests with strong and tall trees, a brilliant curtain of leaves partially blocking the sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car braked almost suddenly and this caused Ed and Al, who have fallen asleep in the meanwhile, to wake up almost jumping inside the car. With an upset and still half asleep face, Edward took a look at his clock, noticing that the car had stopped right after only two hours from when it left aunt Pinako\u2019s home in Reezembool. Quite soon, Edward thought. He poked his head out of the window, just to see that they were in the middle of a huge desert dusty clearing. There was no trace of vegetation and the sky was covered with a menacing dark grey veil, making the air heavy. The only sign of life in all that desolation was an wooden house with some old coaches with horses parked near. Fullmetal was quite impressed by those ancient vehicles, and he recalled he had saw some of them just in one of those antique museums or in a nineteenth century paint. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat does this mean, Havoc? Why did you stopped?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, guys, but I shall leave you here. From now on you have to keep on travelling in one of those coaches.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh? This is nonsense! You\u2019re joking, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not very good in jokes, Fullmetal. Furthermore these roads are incredibly bumpy and totally improper for cars. We could risk to break the oil pan.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI got it, but you could have let us take a train, instead of having this useless trip!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if this can comfort you, there are no railways going through the Eastern Lands.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWHAAAAAT?\u201d Ed and Al faces distorted in that full sense of surprise.<br>\r\n\u201cOk, then. It looks like you don\u2019t need me anymore. Have a good trip. Oh, and send some postcard to the Colonel! He\u2019d be glad\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure! I can imagine\u2026.\u201d Edward said, ironically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward and Alphonse took their luggage out of the car, which, some minutes after, disappeared through the horizon mist. The two Elric brothers stood in silence for few seconds.<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems we have no choice, bro\u2026we have to take that coach.\u201d Al said.<br>\r\n\u201cAl, when you talked about \u201cland forgotten by Gods\u201d, did you mean the fact these guys cannot even afford a railway?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not exactly.\u201d Al said, a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n\u201cOk, ok, I get it. Let\u2019s take this stupid coach and make this thing quick.\u201d<br>\r\nThey reached the coach park with slow steps. They strangely noticed that nobody was there.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, is there anyone here?\u201d Al screamed, but nobody answered. All he could hear was just his echoing voice through the vast moor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehehe\u2026HEHEHEHE!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE\u2026.!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT WAS THAT?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEhehe\u2026.hello to you, strangers! Ehehe\u2026and welcome\u2026ehehe\u2026.how can I help you? Ehehe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nThe screeching laughter coming from Elric\u2019s brother back was an old little man\u2019s. His head appeared to be incredibly big, if compared to the tiny skeleton-like body. But the petrifying thing was his hugely developed forehead and his left eye, bigger and more rounded than the right one, in which a clear grey iris loomed, constantly watching the two alchemists.<br>\r\n \u201cUh\u2026sorry, sir, but we\u2019d like to rent one of your carriages. You see, we\u2019re going to Rauhsang\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEheheh\u2026Rauhsang, you said\u2026ehehe\u2026.I see\u2026.eheheh\u2026follow me\u2026.ehehe\u2026.\u201d That strange creature said, with his almost metallic and hoarse voice.<br>\r\nThen, limping conspicuously, he led the two brothers inside the old structure, into a huge almost empty room. Most of the wood panels were half broken or full of holes, and screeched under the footsteps of the two alchemists, while many dark corners were full of spider web and had few cavities, probably lairs for mice. The old man sat behind a big dark desk and opened a dusty registry. Many of the papers had nibbled edges and their surface was thickened by the halo of dirt and some big stains on them.<br>\r\n\u201cFirst\u2026eheheh\u2026I have to know your name\u2026eheheh\u2026and where you come from\u2026eheheh\u2026.strangers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right.\u201d Edward mumbled.<br>\r\n\u201cWe are\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The horses seemed to be big and strong, but the coach wasn't in a good condition at all: the internal was completely dusty and uncleaned, while the cushion seat had some big rips and even some spring coming out of it.<br>\r\n\"Woah! If this is the best coach, I can't dare to imagine how the other ones are...\" <br>\r\n\"Probably they would go in pieces right after some meters...\" Al and Ed grimly said.<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait a moment!

The door closed right after. Al then reached the coachdriver seat and, with a strong whip, made the horse rear up and run as if they were chased by the devil himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Al continued to whip the horses, he kept on driving the coach making the horse go straight on on the road.

But something else also came in through the window. A shadowy figure silently crept through and walked over to Sonic's bed. It stared hungrily at Sonic as he slept, unaware of the horror that was about to begin. The creature licked its chops as it bent over and prepared to feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight poured into Sonic's room. As Sonic opened his eyes he immediately closed them. It felt like his eyes were on fire. He reached into a drawer a pulled out a pair of sunglasses. He put them on and went into the bathroom.

As he examined the marks his doorbell rang. \"Coming!\" He yelled as he went to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he answered, Tails was there. \"Hi Sonic. Nice shades.\" Said Tails. \"Thanks.

She feels as though she has gone insane, she saw a boy who had suddenly disappeared in thin air and now she is hearing voices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way!\" The voice whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlara walked up the the brick wall that was in front of her, she touched it. Her hand had went through the wall, it had completely disappeared from her site. Her eyes widened with fright and she pulled it back out.

She was certain that she would find something amazing through the walls, but she was mistaken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlara went down the stairs to find a bookstore, she saw the blue eyed boy sitting in the corner reading.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Hello there, and welcome to my first Interactive story ever published on writing.com!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this multiple choices story, a character coming from a popoular series of Anime/manga/videogames/cartoons/TV series, or even a book or a movie, if you prefer, will turn into a vampire for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that moment on, he/she will get into an adventure, trying to heal from vampirism, or another character will do that for him/her. The main character and the other ones appearing in the story can be OOC (especially after the transformation). More than a character can be turned into a vampire. The story setting can be the series/original usual setting or a setting of your own creation. The story can have a horror/thriller atmosphere, but it's not obligatory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now some rules and suggestion to make this story enjoyable:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)THIS IS NOT A FETISH/SEX RELATED STORY! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is supposed to be an adventure story, so nothing related to vampire fetish or stuff like that. There can be love and sex scenes, but remember to keep them to a minimum (which means that, to describe such a scene, you'll have to be allusive and not explicit) and that the story in not centred on sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2)THIS IS AN ADVENTURE STORY, AND SO IT HAS TO BE AS MUCH ENTHRALLING AS POSSIBLE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis means you have to unleash your creativity! Don't keep the story flat! Sensational developments, good dialogues (it'd be better if they are important for the story), well-done plots are welcome. Let's make the story more interesting as possible as the adventure goes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) BAD WRITTEN STUFF OR POINTLESS FOUR-LINES CHAPTERS NOT ALLOWED!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you write here, you're supposed to know a little grammar and have a proper vocabulary. So, no pointless incredibly short chapters, no stuff which looks written by a two years old child, and make all the chapters you add have a little sense. Furthermore, every added chapter must have a perpetuity with the previous ones. This means that a chapter added without a reason related to the plot, even if good written, will be immediately deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) SINCE IT INVOLVES VAMPIRES, THERE CAN BE ALSO HORROR/TERRIFYING PARTS. BUT LET'S NOT EXAGGERATE WITH THE GORE LEVEL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, ok, some violence and bloody scenes are allowed, but don't make the story disgusting or too extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, last but not least, let's take this story seriously. It'd be a pity seeing many choices left blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreative writers, I call on you!!! Let's make this story memorable!<br>\r\nGood luck everyone!</td>",
