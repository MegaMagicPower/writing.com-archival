            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A boy named Adam stared out the window of a taxi as it drove down the road. Adam was 16, and he was rather bored from the long ride he had been through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new dorm was openning for an all-ages private school. The dorm is free, has everything neccessary already provided for its occupants, and co-ed which is why many are trying to get in, including Adam, who will be starting at the private school during the next year. However, as great as it seems, their are two catches:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first is that in order to stay at the dorm, you have to move into it during June, and stay there all summer as well. For Adam, since he is from out of town, and lacks the means to travel to it freely, this means he has to leave his friends earlier and spend all summer away from them, as well as the school year. He would have to get there during the start of the month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second catch is that dorm used to be the house of a very large family that just one day disappeared. There is a rumor that the family still haunts the place, but Adam has never believed in superstition or ghost stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite that, he decided to move in without a second thought. The private school was said to be one of the best, so he knew he could get a good education, which was important to him. His taxi pulled up outside of the gate of the dorm, and he unloaded his things. He didn't have much though, since he was an orphan. Just clothes and a few other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his suitcase up to the door, he hit the button for the doorbell, and almost instantly the door opened. The one who answered the door looked to be a middle aged woman. \"Hello there. You must be one of the student here to use the dorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" Adam repplied. \"My name is Adam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then come on in.\" she said with a smile as she stood aside so that Adam could enter. \"You know, you're actually the first one to arrive, though I expect we'll be getting many more arivals over the week. I'm Ms. Sterious, and I'm in charge of the dorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, the entrance area looked really big, and their were two staircases a few feet away from the door. \"So can you tell me where the room I'll be staying is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we're really lenient, so you can have whatever room you want, just so long as it isn't taken. Not that you'll have that problem since you got here first. The place is four stories tall, and all of the rooms on the second, third, and fouth floors. The first floor has facilties such as a living room, a kitchen, and other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That sounds pretty cool.\" Adam commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pulled out a sign that had his name on it and handed it to Adam. \"Just put this on the door to the room you pick so that others will know its yours.\" she said, then started to walk away, but then turned around to say one last thing. \"Oh, by the way: I'm sorry but none of the rooms have been cleared out of the stuff that used to be in them. Its a big house, so I haven't been able to do it. So whatever is in the room you pick might as well belong to you from now on, so do with them what you wish.\" Ms. Sterious said as she walked out of the room, and Adam headed upstairs. Looking around, he picked a door close to the stairs, and when he opened it, he found himself standing in the doorway of...</span></div></div>",

He guessed it used to belong to a girl who was 16, though he didn't know why he thought that it was that age specifically. Adam briefly considered finding a different room, but then decided he might as well use it. \"Why not? I'll just clear the stuff out later. Its pretty close to the stairs, so I don't have to walk too far back and forth when going downstairs.\" he reasoned. He put his bags in the room.</span></div></div>",

He dried himself off and headed back into his room to change. He decided he might as well start putting his clothes in the dresser drawers in the room. He opened a drawer and then realized he needed to empty them first. Adam decided to get dressed first now that he realized he needed to do some extra work. He pulled out a t-shirt a pair of jeans and a pair of boxers from his suitcase. He was about to put the boxers on when he noticed the panties in the drawer and he became curious. He pulled out a black pair with a slight lace trim and put them on instead of his boxers. He then put his jeans and and shirt on. Not wanting to rummage through his messy suitcase to find a pair of socks he just grabbed a pair of socks from one of the drawers and put them on, not caring that they were pink.

Then all of a sudden the last hour came back to him, as he explored the room, for some reason he realized that the girl who lived here seemed to be about the same size, and that reasoning was good enough to try on some clothes, and then one thing lead to another and he was painting his nails and doing his makeup. What was wrong with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the mirror in front of him, ruby red lipstick, some blush, eyeshadow and mascara, he stood up, he was wearing black high heels and a denim skirt, he had even shaved his legs! checking under the skirt, panties of course, he had on a padded bra and Tight pink T-shirt, his nails were painted a ruby red matching his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hurriedly washed his face as he started taking off the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got the last of it off, he went to put on his clothes, looking through the drawers, none of his clothes were, there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sure he'd put his stuff in the drawers, he looked for his luggage, it was gone as well, the only things left in the room was the stuff he'd found here when he moved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had stripped off the clothes, so he stood in the girl's room naked, when he heard a knock on the door, and the knob start to turn</span></div></div>",

He paused on the top stair to admire the pretty effect. Pretty?! Adam was suddenly very aware of the lace itching against his skin, as if somehow the fabric had planted the word in his head. Pretty...he'd barely used that word to describe girls he liked. He hitched his jeans up a little higher and decided to turn back. It seemed that Ms. Sterious was right - no one else was here yet, and exploring could wait until he was well rested and feeling less...\"pretty\".<br>\r\nA doughy smell wafted through the floorboards.

He turned the water on, undressed, and stepped inside. He washed his hair with the girl's shampoo again because he decided that he liked the smell of it better than his own shampoo. He washed off his whole body and was about to get out of the shower when a razor caught his eye. He picked it up and shaved off his body hair, not thinking anything of it. He then got out of the shower and dried himself off. Once he was pretty dry, Adam absentmindedly wrapped the towel around his chest like it was the normal thing to do. He went back into his room, and opened the underwear drawer. He pulled out a red pair of panties and put them on. His eyes fell on his boxers and he made a face of disgust.<br>\r\n\"Why did I ever wear those things?\" he asked himself. He then pulled out the bra that matched his panties and put it on because he felt like he needed to wear them together. He then put a pair of his jeans and one of his t-shirts on along with a pair of girl's socks. He opened the closet to get his shoes out but noticed a pair of girl's tennis shoes and put them on instead.

His mind wandered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe liked the feeling the sports bra had on his chest, especially after stuffing it like he did, it was tight, but comfortable and soothing, the slight pressure on his chest, he'd have to continue doing it, along with the yoga, he wondered why he hadn't enjoyed i when he first tried it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter washing up he got out of the shower, and wrapped the towel around his chest. and looked in the mirror. his hair had gotten longer, he hadn't even noticed, it used to be pretty short, but now it went down to his chin, he must not have been paying attention the last few weeks. he found a blow dryer and brush and dried his hair. Looking in the mirror again, he liked his hair like this, he'd probably keep it, but then he wondered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back into his room, he found what he was looking for, the last occupants makeup supply, he grabbed a few things and decided to experiment, he was only doing it to see if he could bring out his own natural features, using a little bit of makeup, just to make himself look manlier, and at first he was, but after sitting there in front of the mirror a bit, he started to have fun with it, using more makeup, but promising not to get seen wearing it like that. he tried several styles and things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter playing around for a while, he looked at himself in the mirror, he looked really cute, pink lips purple eyeshadow that faded to pink some blush, and the foundation hid all of his skins flaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe realized how long he'd been doing it and decided he get changed and get some lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put on a pair of panties as usual, and then a bra, but this time, to get that feeling like before he stuffed it with socks. and then his own T-shirt and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou notice that the bra stuffed with socks leaves noticeable lumps on his chest, but he didn't care, he enjoyed the tight comforting feeling, who cares what other thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe was about to leave when he remembered he was still wearing makeup. he looked in the mirror one last time, and begrudgingly took it off, \"he couldn't go out in public wearing makeup, what would people think\", he thought, absent minded fiddling with his bra strap and getting his panties unwedged from his butt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleaned the makeup off, but decided to keep the foundation and did a bit to make his own features look more pronounced, but didn't use enough makeup to get noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went down to the kitchen and was about to make a sandwich, but instead saw that someone had just bought a head of lettuce.  He found some more ingredients and made himself a salad. and turned on the TV and ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flipped through the channels when he saw Pete, the guy from earlier plopped down on the couch beside him, he noticed that Pete was definitely wearing lip gloss, and his nails were painted pink now too, and another thing he was wearing girl's jeans. he knew some guys did, but Pete hadn't been earlier, but whatever, he just figured Pete was kind of an odd guy, but he liked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam ate his Salad forgetting to look for something to watch, the channel was on some chick flick. He and Pete sat through the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end Adam said \"that was funnier than I expected, it wasn't half bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah i hate to agree but it was a pretty good movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam asks \"hey pete, I... uh noticed that you painted your nails.... Whats up with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh, yeah I know its weird but I just got really OCD about how my nails looked, they looked dirty so I cleaned them, and then cleaned them again but it didn't help they just looked ugly to me, so I found this stuff and decided to wear it.\" Pete replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh ok i guess that makes sense.\" Adam said checking out his own nails, he kind of felt the same, they were dirty but it wasn't dirt under his nails or anything, just that the nail itself was ugly, but he dismissed the thought, he didn't want to paint his nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe Bid Pete farewell,saying they should hang out tomorrow, he agrees. Adam heads back to his room. He closed and locked the door and goed back to the mirror, he undoes his makeup, and this time redoes it like he had before. he couldn't resist, he loved the face that looked back at him while wearing makeup like that. Bright red lips eyeshadow, mascara, and some eyeliner and blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to play some of his video games, but after only 30 minutes of Halo he found himself getting bored, and shut it off, and for the rest of the afternoon, just surfed the internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhours went by and before he knew it, it was dark out, he wanted to get some food, since he didnt have dinner, but wasn't sure he wanted people seeing him with makeup on. so he decided to wait until later when most people would be asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about 11:30 he snuck out of his room and into the common area kitchen and got some food and went back to his room and ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand At 12 he decided to go to sleep, he washed off the makeup and changed into a pair of pink silk PJ's he found, leaving his stuffed bra on, it would help him sleep.</span></div></div>",

Today he's wearing a skirt he notice, and he's got a few bracelets on his arms and rings on his fingers, next you notice that he's got the same lumps on his chest as you, he must get the same feeling from the bra as Adam did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile eating Adam asks pete \"whats with the skirt? You some sort of crossdresser now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefensively Pete replies \"It's not a skirt! look its a skort.\" pete lifts up the skirt and Adam see that its only a flap around a pair of shorts. \"and what about you? I see you're wearing nail polish now too, not to mention makeup and that's definitely not you're own shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Adams turn to get defensive, \"I'm not crossdressing, I only painted them for the same reason you did! and the makeup is only to bring out my own features it makes me look hot- I mean handsome, and this shirt is completely unisex\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ok whatever, I didn't mean anything by it, oh! anyways I was planning on going swimming after breakfast, you want to join me?\" Pete asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"definitely that sounds like fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them finished eating and headed back to their respective rooms, Adam was about to grab his swim trunks when he stopped, it didn't feel quite right to be topless as of recently, he'd been wearing a bra as an undershirt constantly for the 4 days he'd been here, and there was just something off-putting about being without it. He wondered if he could wear the trunks and the bra still, maybe have a shirt over it for modesty but that wouldn't work, he decided to see what the closet had, he came out victoriously with two swimsuits a one piece red one, and a two piece purple and pink one, he decided on the two piece cuz he thought the one piece would make him look too girly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way he saw it, the two piece was like wearing a speedo, which would make him look sexy, and wearing a bra, or as he'd been wearing them as undershirts, so he stripped down and donned the two piece bathing suit, making sure his penis was nice and hidden away, he didn't want any wardrobe malfunctions, next he donned the bathing suit top. his only concern was that he couldn't think of anything to stuff his bathing suit with to give him that calming pressure on his chest.  He decided to search through the room, looking for anything that would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found in the back of the closet a small box, he opened it and found a treasure chest, in it were two perfectly sized realistic breasts that not only would fit in any of the bras he wore, but he could also use an adhesive and attach them to his chest to they'd stay in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly since he didn't want to keep Pete waiting, he used the adhesive and followed the directions, and after letting the breasts hold there for a few minutes tested to see if they'd hold, he jumped up and down, getting a realistic feeling and view of them bouncing, it was great, now he'd always get that feeling he'd been enjoying and he wouldn't even need to stuff his bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe donned his top again and, not wanting to be indecent he found a thin piece of fabric that was stored next to the bathing suit, and realized it was a sarong, he tied it around his waist, not thinking of it as a skirt, but more of a thin towel wrapped around his waist. he grabbed an actual towel, cleaned his face of makeup and headed towards the building's pool</span></div></div>",

Next he chose a top from the closet that he found to be \"too cute\" but thinking that it was quite feminine he'd just zip up his hoodie and nobody would be able to see it.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://image.packshot.com/erez4/cache/NLW_189425366_tif_3fa00a6fccb61990.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://image.packshot.com/erez4/cache/NL...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe put on a pair of white frilly panties and then the black leggings then a pair of his own pants, then a demi-bra, then the girly red top, and then he throws on the hoodie. and puts on the girls flats he wore earlier, then gets to work on his makeup<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam heads over to Pete's room, he lets you in, you notice that Pete's mid-back length hair has been curled and styled he's wearing a pair or red 3 inch heels, which makes sense he was kind of short, he's wearing a skirt again, this time you're sure its a skirt, and pantyhose too, and he's one of his own long sleeve T-shirts on, Adam sees the breasts Pete's wearing as bumps under his shirt, again Adam feels oddly proud that he have bigger ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete lets him in and says, \"in return for the help with my makeup I figure I could style your hair for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that'd be great you say, lets start with you.\" Adam says realizing his hair is still braided and in a bun from swimming<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find the makeup his last room owner used and after figuring out what colors you'd use you help Pete get all made-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finish Pete has Adam sit, and undoes his hair, brushing it out, the blond highlights he noticed earlier seem even stronger than before, seems almost half of his brown hair is now a blond color, Pete gets to work with a curling iron and some spray. after thirty minutes of work Pets lets Adam see his work.

They took a taxi from outside of their building and arrived shortly after. The waiter showed them to their seats and they received a number of looks from other people in the restaurant who thought they were dressed strangely. Ignoring the other people, they both ordered salads (despite usually ordering steaks) and began to chat. Thinking that they had spent too much time in their new home, Adam suggested that the pair went out on the town for the night and said they should go out to a local club. Pete agrees to the idea and they order a bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to their bufing shortly after, Adam and Pete return to their rooms to get ready for the night out. Stripping out of his outfit, Adam begins to plan what he should wear for the night. Usually he would wear a shirt and jeans while going out but felt that he needed to dress up to impress Pete. He opened up his wardrobe and could easily see the outfit that the former owner of his room wore when she went out at night. On a hanger, he found a blue sparkiling dress that had a deep plunging neckline and on the same hanger found a pair of tights. Thinking that his current underwear would show through the dress, Adam searched through his drawers and found a thing that would be much better suited along with a bra that would blend in with his dress. He pulled the thong up legs, finding the sensation to be unified but enjoyable and positioned the bra to hold his false breasts. He then rolled the tights up his legs, finding them to be similar to the leggings he was wearing earlier but a lot more see through. Deciding to bite the bullet, Adam climbed into the dress, finding it was a lot more form fitting than he was anticipating but liked it none the less. He then applied some make-up to his face on top of what he already had on, finding it more suitable for a club. He then found a pair of high heels in the closet that matched his dressed and pulled them on, balancing in them as if he had worn them for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way to Pete's room, Adam was secretly hoping that his dress would be hotter than Pete's, thinking he was more likely to meet someone as his boobs were bigger and his figure was better. Opening Pete's door he found...</span></div></div>",

As James had said, a dark-haired girl was there getting her bags together.  There weren't as many as James had made there out to be, but the girl (Aimee was her name) appreciated the help.  Even James came down to assist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aimee, I thought I recognized  you.\"  James said.<br>\r\n\"James, good to see you too.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued into the building, James told Aimee that his room was big enough for two, and had once been inhabited by two sisters.  James offered to share the room with Aimee, and she quickly accepted.  After James and Aimee were settled in, Adam and Pete continued off to their dinner appointment. </span></div></div>",

He was glad she agreed to room with him, the room just didn't feel right with one person.  The room was fairly large, near the staircase on the second floor.  It was also fairly near the second floor bathroom.  The room had two beds, each with a separate closet, desk, boudoir, and bookshelf.  Between the two beds were a couch and table, with a large window above the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closets and desks were still full of the previous occupants clothes and items.

Aimee, in the meantime, had been messing with her hair.  She almost always wears her long, black hair in a ponytail, but now she was keeping it down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, I'm going to go have a look around the house.\" she said.  <br>\r\n\"Fair enough.  I might join you shortly.  I'd like to get the feel of the room a bit more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee headed out, leaving James to himself.  He decided to keep looking through Lily's desk and boudoir, trying to find more information on her.  After about five minutes of looking at scraps of paper and pencils in the desk drawers, he finally found something promising in one of the bottom drawers.  It was a small wooden lever built into the side of the drawer.  James pulled it and a hidden compartment under the top of the desk.  Reaching under, James pulled a thick book from the compartment.  The book was in surprisingly good shape; James had thought that anything left by Lily would be rather old since he figured she must have left the house a long time ago.  But this book suggested that she might have been living here much more recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the book's front cover, James found a large monogram letter L.  This must have been Lily's diary.  A quick glance at the first few pages confirmed this.  Apparently Lily had been keeping this diary from the first day she could write, which must have been when she was quite young.  Tucked into one of the first few pages was a photograph of Lily.  It must have been taken at about the same time as the picture on the desk.  The photo in the book was of Lily sitting on her bed reading a book.  Her legs were crossed at the knee and her chin was resting on her hands, with the book sitting in her lap.  It was hard to see, but James was pretty sure she was reading a collection of poems.  James set the photo aside, and started reading through the first few pages.  He was sitting on the bed reading.  His legs were crossed at the knee and his chin was resting on his hands, with the book sitting in his lap.   </span></div></div>",

There was one story from when Lily was about eight.  Apparently she, her sister Raven, and their cousin Karly, who used to live three doors down the hall, were out playing at a nearby lake.  The three girls had been swimming for a few hours when Lily tricked Karly into jumping from the High Rock (yes, that's what they called it.)  The drop was so far that when Karly hit the water, the top of her swimsuit went flying.  Lily and Raven laughed for an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames put the book aside, deciding to keep looking around the room.  The few other pictures of Lily he could find showed that she almost always had long red hair with that beautiful braid.  A few more minutes of searching turned up a rather strange wig.  It looked identical like it was made to match Lily's hair exactly.  Almost absentmindedly, James put the wig on.  It actually made him look rather like Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b9/11/16/b91116c437efcd0c2141eac7abebac57.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aimee will laugh her head off when she sees this.

Browsing through the closet you find what seems to be a halloween costume, a sexy school girl, putting that aside, there's a prom dress, which would work, but you want to look like a normal teenage girl, so you put that aside, you find a denim mini-skirt, \"perfect\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou continue browsing, girly T-shirts, aren't good enough, a few plain tank tops, finally finding a dress-like top thats really feminine, but somehow you realize that it doesn't go well with the denim skirt, you settle on a white long sleeve top, with the words glamorous with hearts and stars around it, you set it beside the skirt, next is underwear, then shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't wear your boxers under the mini skirt so you pick the first pair of panties available, same with the bra, making sure its white so it doesnt show through the white top. finally you take a pair of what look like 3 inch heels, after comparing them to the skirt, the lower heels didn't look good, so you settled on the 3 inch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore changing you decide to paint your nails, pink is the obvious choice, you do your toes first for practice, then move onto your fingers, they're not perfect, but not bad either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your legs and sigh, you have more to do, you need to shave your legs, luckily you started so early to give you time, you look online for some techniques on how to shave legs and find a few good tips and proceed to take a shower, slowly shaving your legs in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou use the feminine body wash and shampoo and conditioner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting out of the shower you run your hand down your legs, your impressed how good a job you did, it wasn't even that hard. You proceed to put on the panties, situating your crotch to give a smooth front, then slide the skirt up your legs, you didnt realize just how short it was, it doesnt even make it to your knees, it'll be so easy to accidentally flash your panties, how do girls where skirts this short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou struggle to get the bra on before giving up and clipping it first then slipping it on like a shirt, you put two socks in each cup to fill it, then slipping the White top on over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror you can honestly say that your body passes pretty well for a girl, your head on the other hand doesn't, you still need to get makeup done well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know a girl moved into the room next to yours, so you quickly slip out and knock on her door, not really ready to be seen like this just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe answers, wearing a thin wife beater, but with a bra underneath and baggy jeans, you can tell shes wearing makeup too, guess shes not going as all out as you are. You both have the same reaction<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so you're going to this party thing too?\" she says first<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uhh he he yeah... thats why I'm here... I wanted to really go all out... just for fun you know, but... I can't do my makeup, do you think you could help me out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\noh, uh yeah sure why not, I'm finished getting ready anyways, as you can see I was kind of lax with my clothes, I couldn't not wear a bra with this grungy shirt. but you look pretty good so far, good job.\" she says as you lead her back to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits you in front of the makeup table and goes to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later shes finished it looks great, but shes not done she starts on your hair, its not too long so she curls it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost half an hour later shes done with your hair instead of the shaggy look you usually have now its tight and bouncy on your head, not to mention feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"there, ya go, looks great, see you out there, I'm heading out.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up, examining your made up face, you barely recognize yourself, and you hate to admit it to yourself but you love your hair like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut you dismiss the thought, not wanting to be late you slip on your shoes, a pair of 3 inch heels, and miraculously don't have any trouble walking in them at all, you'd always imagined them to be hard to walk in but you gracefully take each step without a problem, you must be channeling your inner teenage girl, you joke to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head out and into the common room, spotting a purse as you leave your room grabbing it, even though its empty</span></div></div>",

Walking in, he looks around at all of the toys again, this time, paying a bit more attention. He then saw a large dollhouse in the corner, and walked over to it. He looked at it closely for a bit before taking a seat on the ground to get a better look at it. \"Huh. Its kinda cute.\" he said. He then reached over and picked up a doll. At first, he was just messing around, and just held the doll near the doll house. But that quickly changed, and picked up another one. Within minutes, he was enjoying himself as he played with the dolls, using them in the dollhouse, and pretending they were a family that lived in it. He never knew that playing with dolls could be so much fun. He decided that he would have to come here to play with them more often.

The bed off to the left side, while still having bars on the side of it, was large enough for him to rest in comfortably and to the side of the door, opposite the stuffed toys, was a TV. So there was no doubt about this being the room of a teenager, a teenager with strange interests but a teenager nonetheless. Adam noticed a door in the far right corner, probably leading to the next room but didn't pay it any mind, it was most likely locked anyway so there was no need. He also spotted a toy chest next to the stuff toys and a desk against the far wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam moved over to the bed and with a little effort managed to drop the bars so that he could sit on the side. The only cupboard space seemed to be the drawers underneath the changing table so he'd have to use that until he replaced it with a real cupboard, he wasn't planning on keeping the changing table obviously but he didn't feel like moving it just yet, he was pretty tired after the travel so changing furniture could come later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam yawns and stretches his arms out before looking over the room once again, it wasn't perfect but it would do.

Opening the door he imediatley noticed that it was obviously a room that belonged to a young women.  Walking in he thought that the girl must have been about 21 years in age, and judging by some of the picture that were hung on the wall, she must have been a model.  He was somewhat aprehensive about staying in someone elses room, and didn't like the thought of living in this womens personal space.   The room was quite large and was full of items from around the world. \"Places that she must have worked in\" he thought.  Opposite of a large bay window was a large walk in closet.  Adam opened the door and couldn't believe the amount of clothes and shoes that this person had.  He dropped his duffle bag in the closet and continued to look around the room.  On the wall as a large bouqet of roses that had dried, a not tied to a string had a little message from what appear to be her boyfriend.  The note was addressed to a girl named Megan, \"So that must be the name of the girl.\"  Adam said outloud, even though he was the only person in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was gourgeous, she had long black hair and judging by some of the pictures and clothes in the closet she must be 5'10\", an inch shorter that Adam.  He was back in the closet and looking for space to unpack.  This was somewhat difficult because of the amount of clothes Megan had.  He opened a drawer that was full of panties and bras, he puched what he could to the side and found enough room for his underwear.  He grabbed one of Megan's bra's and looked for a size. The tag said that she was C cup.  He then found a few empty hangers for his dressier clothes and the rest of his wardrobe would be left on the floor infront of the giant display of Megans shoes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looked at the shoes and noticed that most of them had really high heels, and really fashionable. On the bottom shelf were over 20 pairs of boots.  He gabbed one of the boots and held it up to look at.  He really liked the height of the heel and how clean the black leather looked.  He was thinking that he needed to try it on, when he shook his head in disbelief as he had never ever had a thought or notion to try on womens clothes.  He put the boot back on the shelf and walked out before he gave in to temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed the door and desided he better have a nap before the other arrived</span></div></div>",

He was having trouble getting comfortable and the thoughts of Megan's shoes kept poping up in his head.  In his mind he had already begun to picture himself wearing her shoes.  During the few short moments that he was actually asleep, Adam had a dream were he was wearing a pair of Megan 4\" Louibotoun heels.  In his dream he had walked into the kitchen of his new home and was talking to the other house mates.  Most of them complimenting him on his shoes.  In his dream he was about to talk to Heather about his shoes when he woke up and opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up on the edge of the bed, looking at the ground and recalling his dream and wondering why he would be dreaming of such a thing.  He quickly brushed the thought aside and walked over to the bathroom to splash some water on his face.  Adam smiled back at himself throught the mirror and started to chuckle about his dream and how odd it was for him to be dreaming of such thoughts.  \"It must be because I think Megan is hot, would love to be with her\".  Adam said to himself still looking into the mirror.  After drying his face, we walked over to a chair that was in the bay window and took off his socks.  A pair of grey wool socks that we really bulky and too warm for the temperature of the room.  He rolled them up in a ball and walked over to the closet to put them in drawer besides Megan socks and Nylons. He found a pair of knee high black stockings of megans and thought that they were probably cooler than his socks so he put them on while staring at the wall of shoes in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam was having a hard time controlling his thoughts, he was  seeing images of himself in his mind, situations or former occurances were the shoes he was wearing were womens shoes.  He remembered that yesterday was he was riding the bus to town he wasn't wearing his sneakers, we was wearing a pair black ballet flats,  As he regain focus he saw the same ballet flats on the 3rd shelve.  Thinking that this was to wierd, he grabbed them thinking that there is no way that they would fit his feet.  \"Wow\", he thought, not only do they fit my feet perfectly I can actually recall the store in New York that I purchased them.\"  Adam was dumbfounded, and really confused.  He slipped the flats off his feet and looked for another pair of shoes that would not fit his feet and in no way would he ever be caught in.  Being a young hetrosexual man with no crossdressing tendancies, Adam was trying to find a logical reason for his thoughts.  He found the pair of Louibotons that was in his dream.  They had a 1\" platform and a 5\" inch heel.  Inside the heel he say the Louiboton logo and the word Alti stamped in golf leaf.        <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www4.images.coolspotters.com/photos/83773/christian-louboutin-alti-leather-pumps-profile.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www4.images.coolspotters.com/phot...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoes fit like a glove.  Adam was still wearing Megan's black knee high tights and couldn't believe how good these shoes felt on his feet.  He walked over to the closest mirror, to his surprise he was having no problem walking in 5\" heels.  He found himself stepping one foot directly in front of the other, similar to what he saw in fashions shoes that his sister would wathc on tv.  Looking back at him in the full length mirror was a regular male, but as his eyes began to look down he saw the shoes, and a very femine pose.  He was standing with his weight on one shoe as the other was tilted up and his ankle was bent towards his other leg.  This almost sent Adam to the floor.  What even made it worse was a picture he saw of Megan, standing with the exact same pose from the waist down.  Still confused by how good the shoes felt and how easy it was to walk in them, Adam sat down to consider his next move.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was still early in the day, and Adam wanted to look around his room a bit more.  He kept the 5\" platform heels on his feet, and was beginning to feel more comfortable.  Not with how they fit, because they fit like they were made for him, but comfotable with the thought of him actually wearing women's shoes.  Through out the room was pictures and nick nacks of items Megan collected as she toured the world on modelling asignments.  By the look of the room and the items that Adam saw, Megan was a very mature 21 year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam went back to the closet to take off and return the shoes to the shelving unit. He stepped out of one shoe and sank 5\" as he kicked off the other shoe.  As he returned the shoe he began to look through the other items in the huge closet.  Megan had alot of skirts and dresses and her favorite pairs of jeans.  Not to mention lots of accessories.  Scarves, hat, jewllery and purses.  \"Must be the benefits of working as a model\", Adam thought to himself.  He grabbed some silver bangles and without thinking he slid them on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the urge to wear another pair of shoes he found the boots on the bottom shelf very appealing and saw a pair of flat knee high black leather boot that he wondered what they would feel like.  Sitting down he had no trouble putting them on as they again seemed made for him.  He did find it hard to tuck in his pant leg as the boots were made to wear outside the pant leg.  Thinking that this might be a problem and that he might have to try on another pair, his eyes looked over at the many pairs of Megans jeans and wondered if he should try on a pair so that the boots could be worn properly.  He thumbed through the 20 - 30 pairs of jeans that Megan had collected.  Different colours, different styles, and different lenths is what Adam found.  He settled on a pair of faded blue skinny leg jean that would make it easier for him to zip up the shaft of the boot.  When he zipped up the front of the jean he discovered that the jean were also low risers and caused another problem, because of the boxer shorts that he wore.  Without a moment of hesitation Adam walked over to the dresser drawer and found a pair of black boy cut panties and slid them up his leg so that he could continue to get dressed.  In his mind he was getting dressed in order to go down stairs and meet some of the other housemates.    He slid on the boots and zipped them up and went over to the mirror to have a final look.  He was wearing a green t-shirt up top and he was all Megan below.  The jeans were tight, but shaped his legs somewhat to make them look long and lean.  The boots looked great but he thought that maybe they are too girly and he should instead go with  the black ballet flats instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam walked out of the room wearing Megans' jeans and shoes.  His ankles exposed as the jean only went down to his ankle and making his choice of footwear very visible.</span></div></div>",

There was clothing as well, much of it screamed old lady, like the various pairs of polyester slacks, the long skirts, and the colorful blouses. A jewelry box sat on a shelf, and Adam picked up a string of pearls and casually placed them on his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        A moment later, he checked out the kitchen and decided to make a cup of tea.

Looking around the most eye-catching thing he saw was a stripper pole right in the centre of the room, all decorations clear from it, so nothing would be hit when she was practising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing his suitcase down he decided before unpacking, he would check out the room a little, get to know where everything was and get an idea of what the rooms previous occupant was like. So he decided to start with the wardrobe where it was packed with skimpy clothes in various shades of pink as well as black and white; towering platform heels and surprisingly a bunch of different style wigs that were mainly platinum blonde with a few other colours as well. Adams best guess was it was probably just for different personas for different performances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he moved onto the make-up stand and drawers, which were packed again with skimpy panties, swimsuits, bras and stockings of various designs. Looking even closer he noticed one draw was even filled with certain adult toys designed for pleasure and self-stimulation, so he knew what draw to never open again. Finally when he looked at the make-up stand, the amount of stuff it had on it from standard make-up to nail extensions, false eyelashes and even coloured contacts was absurd, he had never seen that amount of make-up anywhere outside a stand in a mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with a bit of an explore done he pondered, what should he do next</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Main character's name is Adam, but you may add as many characters you want, can focus on any character at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Sterious is the nice woman in charge of the dorm. As her name implies, shes very mysterious, though no one ever seems to notice what word her name sounds like. Another peculiar thing about her is that despite running the dorm, she is rarely ever seen, and that unless she is around, everyone seems to forget that she exists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGUIDELINES:<br>\r\nThe first room that a person opens the door to, you will feel compelled to just use it, regardless of what it looks like.<br>\r\nEach day, they will slowly start to act more and more like the person the room  belonged to, regarless of whether the current occupant and the previous one are of different genders. This happens very gradually and slowly, so don't make the changes happen to rapidly.<br>\r\nAs days go by, the stuff in the room will slowly start to change as if they were meant for the new occupant, but they will not notice. Ex: Clothes will start to alter in size to fit the occupant of the room.<br>\r\nIf the room belonged to multiple people(like parents, or twins, etc), then they will feel compelled to share the room with someone else, and will invite someone to share with them, who will accept the offer.<br>\r\nIf the the room belonged to people who were together, such as married, they will ask a member of the opposite sex who they have invited to share your large room with. Ex: If a guy picks a room for married parents, the girl he invites can be a girlfriend, a girl he has a crush, or just a friend. Same rules apply, with the character starting to act like the person whose stuff they touch first, with their roommate acting like their partner. <br>\r\nIf the occupants were twins, they will invite someone depending on the gender of the previous occupants. If both were the same gender, they will invite a member of the same gender, and if they were different genders, they will invite someone of an opposite sex. If not twins, they will invite anyone. Same rules apply, with the character starting to act like the person whose stuff they touch first, with their roommate acting like their partner.<br>\r\nRelationships between the occupants will start to mirror those whose rooms they use. Ex: Two people who use the rooms of a brother and sister who never got along will start to not get along themselves.<br>\r\nNo one will be aware of the changes that happen to them. Same goes for the other occupants of the dorm, and even those who don't stay there. Everything will seem perfectly normal about what happens.<br>\r\nFor Adam at least, always leave at least a \"Something else\" option before he picks a room. Leave many different possibilities open. It was a large extended family, so their were many brothers, sisters, parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc staying there, so there are plenty of options. Even the ones that have already been done can be used again if you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe creative with the guidlines I have provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditional rules:<br>\r\nNo physical transformations. Only mental.<br>\r\nNo sex<br>\r\nNo killing off characters<br>\r\nNo skipping ahead days<br>\r\nNo ending the story<br>\r\nAnd most importantly, have fun!</td>",
