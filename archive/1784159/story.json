You've heard the talk of their delicious apples and you might as well just go to the farm to buy some of their apples and maybe make some new friends. You soon reach the farm looking at the wonderful landscape. You could see a big rusty barn, a small house and many of their apple trees in the distance. You go up to their small house and knock on their door waiting for somepony to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho answers the door?</span></div></div>",

As the secounds dragged by you grew more and more nervous. Maybe no ones home, you say to yourself before turning tail and beggin the trek back to the room you were renting. Thinking about it you needed to get a job soon otherwise you might not make the next payment. With that lingering thought you heard a voice behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Something I could help you with Sugarcube?\" Came the voice, definitly female and definitly a southern accent. Feeling rather foolish you spun around to face her, the mare had an orange coat with three shiny red apples on her flank as her cutie mark, you winced and shook your head to clear that thought out of your mind. Her mane and tail were blond and bound with rope at the ends. She had green eyes and wore a cowboy hat, she looked kina cute actually. But you cant let your imagination get ahead of you, food and a job were your main priorities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Uhhh, yeah. I was wondering if I could purchase a bushle of your cheapest apples?\" You say uncertainly, while mentally berating yourself for your uncertanty. The orange pony nodded excitedly racing off an returning with two large baskets filled with apples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That'll be twenty bits sir.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You nod and toss her the coins, \"Thanks!\" Wih that done you beggin to take your leave loaded with juicy apples. But a thought struck you, she was the only pony here that you knew of, and judging by the hundreds of apple trees she would need some help come harvest time. \"Actually, would it be possible to get a job here?\" You asked suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Welp, I dont know, we usually dont need any help around here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      We? Guess she does have help, you thought to yourself. \"Okay then, thanks anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Wow there doggie I didnt say no.\" You turn to face her once more. \"Big Machintosh went to visit Appalooza this harvest season so I could use an extra pair of hooves, your hired. Whats your name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Trying hard to contian the feeling of triumph within you respond, \"Names Blaze. How about your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Applejack, be here tomarrow morning at sunrise!\" She turned and trotted inside her barn. And with a grn on your face you canter back down the road to your room excited for the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As soon as Applejack had made it indoors she lookwed out the window, Nopony has ever asked to work here before, and I have never seen him around. He mut be new. She mused to herself watching Blaze canter away. He was a bit of an odd character. </span></div></div>",

You had been anticipatng this moment for awhile, but now that it was here you just wanted to close your eyes and sleep. However you had a job to do, and there was that cute Applejack mare. You looked forward to getting to meet her. Slowly you allow yourself to rool out of bed and fall to the floor with a soft thud. After untangling yourself from the blankets you rinse your coat clean and stand in front of the mirrior. its the first time you have had a reason to look at yourself for along time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Your coat was in good condition, a nice deep dark black with fiant, near invisible, grey lines running along your fur. Glancing at your name sake, your mane and tail both a firey orange color with streaks of yellow and red you make sure it looks nice before glancing at your flank with a sigh... 'Some ponies have it worse,' You say to yourself trying to push the thought out of your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Quickly you throw the sheets and blankets back on the bed ad quietly leave the inn, as difficult as it was to find the right road in the dark you managed to arrive at Sweet Apple Acres just as the sun became visible on the horizon. suddenly Applejack threw open the barn doors shouting \"YeeHah!\" And galloping towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"This way Blaze! We got alot of work ahead of us!\" She lead you behind the barn and equiped you with a wagon full of empty baskets. \"You need to fill all of these up by tomarrow morning. Ill be back to check on yall in a jiffy!\" Then she wheeled around and galoped to a different part of the ochard. Glancing at the amount of baskets you groan and begin picking the apples of the trees.</span></div></div>",

Once there you carefully picked every apple off the tree and genty drop it into one of the baskets. It took nearly and hour and you had only managed to flll four of the baskets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      At that time Applejack came trotting over with two carts towed behind her overflowing with apples. She glance up at you as you struggled to get out of the tree safly. \"What in taration are yall doing p there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Pcking apples, I have only dropped a couple.\" You replied suddenly feeling very small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Sugarcube, that is not how you buck apples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Buck the apples? Wouldnt that damage them.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Applejack trotted towards a apple tree pivited on her forelegs and rapidly lashed out with her hind legs connecting with the trees trunck. The whole tree shuddered and every ripe apple on the tree fell from the tree into her saddlebags, without a single one touching the ground. \"Howd ya like dem apples?\" She asked with a cocky grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You were embarressedd to say the least, and jumped out of the tree. Following her example ou walked up to the tree with two baskets on your back turned a 180 and bucked the tree. It quivered and rustled. Then came the apples all of which fell to the left or right of you brusing there sides. However a single apple rolled off the branch into one of the baskets. you held it up in mock triumph congering a small giggle from Applejack.\"Howd I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Horrible, but you will get better with practice. For now just fill the baskets and store them in the apple cellar.\" You nodded and quickly began scooping the falln apples into the baskets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       You spent the rest of your day bucking apples and loading up the baskets. As the sun set you were hualing the cart of baskets filled with apples to the cellar when Applejack appearred. \"Hay, I was wondering if yall would being interested in some supper?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

There were apple pies still smoking, fresh apples picked erlier today, apple crumplets, apple friters a whole plate full. And many other apple dishes. Slowly carring a large bowl of apple suace was a green pony that seemed to be quite old. Glancing at her flank shows a delicious looking apple pie. You quickly moved to help her with the bowl, \"What a gentlecolt.\" She croaked loadly, \"Applejack is this the feller you hired yesterday?\" Applejack nodded quickly and ran to get the rest of dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Hi, my names Blaze, I hope im not intruding on any family time by me staying for supper.\"You introduce yourself cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Well its nice to meet you Glaze and nah you aint bulling any family time. My names Granny Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        You decide to let the name mess up go unoticed. After she had finishes telling you a story about the apple family a green philly galloped in with a red bouncy mane and a high energy. \"Hi you must be that colt My sister likes!\" She shouted in rapid format. \"My names AppleBloom and I cant wait to introduce you to my friends, how long you staying in ponyville anyway!?\" She continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Awhile. Who are your friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders!\" She yelled. Before she continued Applejack rang the dinner bell and we enjoyed supper with some small talk and instructions on what you would be doing tomarrow. When it was time to leave you bid your goodbyes and thankyous and walked out the door to hear the thundering chrash of a lightning storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Looks like the Pegasi have set up quite the downpour, perhaps you should stay here for the night.\" Applejack said surveying the storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"No, I dont want to impose on anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Its no problem at all,you can sleep in the hay loft and get right to work in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Thank you for your hospitality.\" You smiled kindly recieving a likewise grin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, she had been so kind to you the second she saw you. As you climb the stairs, you can hear the rain pouring even harder than before and even felt a drop leak down. You don't worry about it much though, if this barn was made by that family, there was no doubt that it was of the best quality that they could have made. Finally reaching the loft, you stare at the mountains of hay that almost touched the ceiling. Finding a particularly soft bunch of it, you lay down and prepare for a well deserved rest. After all, you needed to be up bright and early to get back to work. Slowly, you close your eyes.... ready to dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up and take a look around. Something didn't seem right. Your aptly colored mane is standing on edge as if something was watching you. You take a look around the loft but seem to find nothing. Realizing you must have just been hearing nothing, you try to lay back down. Before you can however, you hear the sound of hay crunching again. This time you get off of the hay and walk around. Before long the sound comes back......getting faster and louder. Before you can realize what's happening, you're brought down to the ground.......or wood and something is keeping you there. Whatever is holding you has the courtesy to let you see what it is and it turns you over. Due to the dim light, you can only see the being's eyes and the large bat-wings. Scared out of your mind, you begin to whimper until the creature nuzzles you. You look a little closer, confused by this odd behavior, and can't believe your eyes. \"Applejack?\" you whisper, now noticing the hat that the bat-pony sports. Seeming to be unable to speak, Applebat softly hisses as she nods. Her normally green eyes began to glow red, locking your attention on them. You yawn, beginning to feel drowsy. You realize she's trying to hypnotize you, but it's too late for you to mind. You drift off into sleep, letting the bat-pony do whatever she wants to do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up.... not remembering the strange ordeal you've been through. Looking out the window in the loft you realize that now would be the perfect time to get ready for work. Leaving the barn, you look to the orchard. The storm of last night had passed, leaving behind a wet look on all the trees. You walk to get your supplies and see Applejack. \"Howdy sugarcube.\" she says as she waves over to you, \"How are you feeling?\" You simply say \"Great.\" though you feel something different. You know what you feel... the feeling that....</span></div></div>",

You take off your robin's egg-blue dress hat to check it out, since you didn't get a chance to earlier. Sewn clearly on the sides was the your name. \"Teardrop. Mom knows her sewing beats all.\" you say silently to yourself, so not to disturb any of the ponys reading. With your hat down, you swing your mane back into place. Your coal black mane whipped forward into a straight fancy look. Just the right style for a young stallion. With wings, you don't know why you wear black boot-like slippers, to which you trot some dust off. Your black tail is so groomed, it looked like a curvy wet paintbrush. The last thing you checked was your face. You always seemed to have that \"I'm determined, but shy\" look on your face. Your blue eyes sparkled with longing, yet with a small essence of timidness and adventure. You started to check out the book supply after you got your hat back on. As you scan over the fantasy books you notice a purple unicorn with a blue and pink mane search through multiple books like a machine. \"She knows magic.\" you noted amzed at her speed. She also had a little purple dragon with green spikes going down his back. \"Wow. I've never seen a dragon before. He's so cute.\" To not seem rude you pick up a book, and start fake reading. As you \"read\" you shoot small interested glances at the dragon. After a few moment of peering, the dragon shoots a curious glance at you. \"Oh shoot\" you whine in shock, as you throw the book up in your face. When you put the book down, you see the dragon's green eyes peering into yours. In shock you start to flutter up, but you were stopped by a gentle snag of the tail. You looked down to see the dragon holding your tail. He motion you to come down, so you obeyed since you didn't want to get him mad. When you reach the floor he motion you down closer to ear level. \"Excuse me mister. May I have that book you have there? My friend was looking for that book.\" he said as he motioned to your book. \"S..sure.\" you whimper as you felt his hand grasp around your hooves to recieve the book. \"Thanks a lot, mister, uh?\" he says as he looks at your hat. \"Teardrop isn't it?\" \"Yes\" you reply with some confidence. \"That's a nice name. My name is Spike. That purple pony you saw is Twilight Sparkle. I'm her assistant. You should stop by the treehouse at the end of town. It's another library for Twilight and me. I'll see you later.\" Spike said as he walked back to Twilight. When he gave her the book, he pointed you out. \"Thank you.\" she whispered loud enough for you to hear. You just wave as the two leave. \"Hmm. Maybe I will visit those two. They're pretty friendly.\" you thought to yourself as you started to walk around. \"ZZZZZzzzzzZZZZ!\" you hear as you walk near the tables. When you got to them though you see a blue pony with rainbow hair salivating on the table. You think she's cute, so you sit on the other side of the table, and look at her. You notice a dusty book in front of her. It read \"World's Fastest Flyers\". You reached for it, but you could get it, the bookshelf behind her started falling. \"Look out!\" you yell as you dash around the table and slam into her, to get her out the way. \"What's the big idea!\" she yelled at you. After a few seconds a loud CRASH echoed through the library. \"That\" you say. \"Wow you saved me. Thanks.\" she said as she gave you a nuzzle and started to fly away. \"My name's Rainbow Dash by the way. We should race together. Meet me the edge of the Everfree Forest if you want.\" \"Ok\" you say as she exited. Now you start pondering about who to go see. After a moment you decide...</span></div></div>",
