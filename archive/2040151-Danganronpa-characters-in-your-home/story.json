Right now your playing one of the dangan ronpa games on your vita &amp; your really enjoying yourself. Your almost at the end of the game when suddenly the screen goes black &amp; the power goes out which is bad for you cause you had the system plugged into the wall to charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at the window in annoyance as you put the vita on your computer desk and see thunder &amp; lightning outside, \"Darn you Mother nature!\" you shout to nobody in particular as you put on your coat and head out to the cellar to activate the emergency generator. Afterwords when you leave the cellar you see a bright flash come from inside the house, you decide to investigate this as something like that has never happened before. As you reach the front porch of your home you begin to think to yourself, \"Did somebody sneak into my house?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then shake your head at this saying \"Nah, There's no way.\" you say as you head into the house, as you get into the living room however you see a figure laying on the couch who seems to be sleeping.

I've gotta patch him up &amp; fast!\" you say in your head as you pick the boy up in your arms and carry him to a spare bedroom &amp; lie him on the bed.

Anyway, who do ya need me to check out?\" \"His name's Makoto Naegi, he's asleep right now so I'm gonna bring him in tomorrow. That alright with you?\" \"Yes Jack, that's fine. I'll see ya tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word the call is finished, You let out a heavy sigh as you say to yourself \"I really hope Makoto doesn't find out about my ___ fetish..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A/N Alright Reader's THIS is where you'll have your chance to put in your fetish for Jack &amp; Makoto go nuts! just leave an other option for more fetish choices please.)     <br>\r\n            </span></div></div>",

The lamp on the nightstand barely illuminated his handsome face. For a second - despite the odds of a thief or bloodthirsty killer deciding to sleep in your couch was the first step to take after breaking in your house - you were prepared for the worst. Your hand reached for the lamp, unplugging it in the procress. Prepared to use it as a weapon, you take quiet steps towards the stranger, your hands a little shaky from the fear of waking him up....until, that is, you noticed something perculiar about him. With red-hued locks of hair and pale skin, a goatte and piercings on his ear....it couldn't be...but it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon Kuwata, the ultimate Baseball Player. You had already spent your two Free Time Event with him, in an attempt to understand and bond with him. You could almost summarize his personality: A rebellious prankster that, despite his talent on baseball, aims to become a punkrock musician. In addition, he was also quite interest in girls (Much to your demise), specially towards Sayaka Maizono, who could easilly serve as a step stone to achieve his dreams. As you shortened the distance between you two, placing the lamp on the coffee table, you were finally able to analyze his attire. Similar to the game, his clothing was on spot. From the pattern on his shirt to his chain-like necklace...there was no doubt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon Kuwata was sleeping on your couch!</span></div></div>",

Was he real? Were you having an illusion? Or was it a realistic dream? Despite pinching yourself being one of the most common ways to discover whether your current situation is  fantasy or reality, your hand seems to be reaching somewhere else. Towards him. You wanted to touch his soft-looking skin and dry hair. You wanted to talk to him and discover more information that wasn't available at the game. You wanted to be his friend. So you really couldn't help...your hand was simply aching caress his hair (Before he woke, obviously. Otherwise, you'd guess your first impression wouldn't be as wonderful as you wanted it to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, despite your effort, it seemed the distance between you two seemed to increase. Not only that, but your horizon was lowering by the minute. \"H-Huh?!\" Not able to come with a solution, you simply stared at your idol as he became more and more distant. And soon, you were staring at his sleeping form...at an eye level. That was when you were finally able to grasp the situation. Jack....you were shrinking. \"W-What?! That's n-not possible!\" Your voice wasn't enough to wake the student in front of you. Instead, a grunt of discomfort was uttered instead. He didn't wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon...you were nothing but a puny being on the tiny floor, no bigger than a candy wrapper. Or at least, you assumed. Your size wasn't exactly measured by an object or a ruler, but you were sure your own palm would have been bigger had you stayed your previous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you didn't want to believe your petite height, even after witnessing something already impossible (The \"intruder), it was real.

One of his hands raising towards his eyes, as he rubbed away whatever was bothering him, and his other hand falling from the side of the couch. \"H-Hes waking up!\" You shout, but it goes unheard from the giant above. Not only was his ears far away from your position, the fact he was still debating whether to return to his dreams or actually wake up didn't help neither. However, as he yawned again, it seemed he was settled on continuing his day. After raising his head and torso, you managed to got a bewildering view before his voice finally broke the silence, but the loud words were also shocking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit man...I didn't mean to sleep so much...\" He complained, his back standing out with a faint pain. Ignoring it, he raised one of his legs inches away from the sofa and landing on the floor with a noticeable thump. At least, to you. Luckily, you were in center, instead of one of the sizes, since his other leg also came down on the other extreme. A shockwave of dust being moved from such powerful step. And then, Leon finally stood up, his legs raising like a black skyscraper and his shoes bigger than a large bus. You were between his legs, viewing up would lead to a sight of his crotch, with his shirt and face barely visible (Nothing above his nose was, whatsoever).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, didn't I sleep during class? Did someone move me? Fuck - Don't tell me I'm in the prefect's house! I don't want some extreme punishment!\" His face, although not exactly detailed to you, showed concern for his reputation and situation. Not only would he be dragged by Ishimaru (Everyone witnessing the scene) but he'd be punished with a lecture or something alike. A drop of sweat falling from his face and splashing on the ground bellow, creating a small pool to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He hasn't even seen me!\" You remark, not sure what to do. No, more importantly, what would HE do would cause much more devasting consequences to you...</span></div></div>",

Not only was he now a threat to your existence, but a hoard of bug would likely be reason to run away in total fear. As you continued thinking about the situations where your life could be easily taken away from you...the shrinking continued to take place. It was only after you had become a pathetic and puny being that you finally noticed your lost of height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No way...d-did I just become even smaller?!\" Now, the man above was nowhere to be found. At least, in your previous form, there was some parts of him visible. Now, the sofa was a wall of cotton instead of a gigantic piece of furniture...you were really small! Heck, you're probably the size of an ant! If not smaller! He'd require an extremely good vision to even notice you're around, let alone acknowledge  you're a human!

What if you're stuck like this forever? How will you continue your life? You can barely open a door anymore, let alone lead a normal life! If you didn't live alone, then you'd be in another problem: You'd have to explain this whole situation to your family, who'd take weeks to find your small body. IF they ever found you. What if you're confused with a bug and placed outside by your arthropod-friendly father (Despite your mother's insistent whining about crushing them). How would you survive in the outside world, with animals several times your body? Besides that, you'd have to search for a source of food and water, which would prove impossible, considering a glass of water is already bigger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had paid a little more attention (Nobody can blame you, though, you're still adapting to your situation), you'd notice that Leon had already waken up.

Instead of inspecting you, eventually leading to a contact between beings from different realms, the teenager couldn't comprehend the possibility of the bug being an actual human, but neither can you.  Still lost in confusion, you wonder around in circles, trying to find a solution to your curse, almost forgetting a giant and handsome man slept behind you. Without much thought about taking a specific step, he raises his sneaker from the wooden floor, casting a shadow bellow his shoe. He aims at your puny body, unaware that he's not only taking out a human's life, but that he seems a merciless titan to him. It's the shadow that finally alerts you of your doomed fate. You completely stop walking and look up, only to see a dirty sneaker's sole hang above. \"H-Huh...w-wait...!\" However, before you can finish your sentence, the deadly shoe comes down with impossible rapid speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long before the sole touches your body, and in the following seconds, it begins to crush your body under it. Your leg's bones give in instantly, a pain that last only one or two seconds before more bones continue breaking. You open your mouth to yell, but you have no time to shout worlds of pain before you're finally crushed under the titan. His foot makes contact with the floor, leaving your body completely broken and smashed between them. He makes sure to wipe your existence by pivoting his shoe against the wooden floor, more and more bones cracking under the pressure. After a while, you're only a bloody pulp on the ground, but he can't feel it. Despite the fact you're still dead, he seems to still be filled with disgust, as his blue-hued eyes stare at his shoe. \"Eww...gross.\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Okay here's my 2nd interactive. You could say that this is kinda like my 1st interactive. But,this time there's a twist. (DANGAN RONPA!) That's right the interactive center's around the Trigger happy havoc franchise! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyhow, on to the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules: 1. No insulting other races or people!<br>\r\n           2. Use CORRECT grammar, NO text slang!<br>\r\n           3. Death is allowed but the character must be revived afterword!<br>\r\n            4.Chapters must be at least a paragraph long, unless your picking a character or making a choice chapter,don't make the chapters short!<br>\r\n            5. Make an actual plot. I want an actual story for this with detail!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Okay time to add a new rule to this interactive!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. I want to see the main character and the danganronpa characters actually build a friendship that'll build into a relationship that leads into sex (be it with a male or otherwise)<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOther then that anything is fair game, microscopic voyage story? Shrinking? Giant/Giantess? Everything you can think of is up for grabs just fallow the rules and you'll be fine Don't forget I'll help you if you have writer's block &amp; lastly Have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9/11/2018: Okay I hate to do this but I have to give a warning to an author that has been adding here, recently some of your adds have depicted the main character trying to have his way with a character for personal gain, and I don't approve of that in any way at all! But sense I'm trying to be nice I'll let it slide this time. However! if I see it again I will delete it no if's and's or buts!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8/15/2019 update: I'm looking for additions to my interactives! I'll give gp as rewards for the adds, however I do have rules for this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. If you do a character choice chapter you'll get 100 gp<br>\r\n2. If you do a story chapter you'l get 500 or 1000+ gp depending on the chapter's length<br>\r\n3. Stick to the guidelines of the interactive you add to <br>\r\n4. Lastly DON't add choice chapters over and over if you think you'll get more gp for it! If someone does so they will only get 100 gp for the FIRST chapter because if they do that it's not fair to others that may want to add to one of the interactives!          </td>",
