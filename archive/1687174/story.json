            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today had been a dull day, well the start of it anyway. It had been a pretty typical Tuesday. The lecture was dull as usual sending Greg to sleep in a record 3 minutes and he had no assignments to hand in for just over a week so he was spending the rest of the day reading through gaming magazines whilst listening to music. He would have preferred to be playing video games, of course, but a chaotic house party had ended in the TV going out of the window. He was still trying to work out who the culprit was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current page he was browsing detailed the new features of \"Call of Honor 12\", (he mentally added a 'u' to honour, of course, being British) a game which he had little interest in but he read on regardless, there was nothing better to do after all. Apparently this game added even greater realism with players being even more immersed in the game than ever before and with an extra 20 guns to shoot down terrorists with. 'Amazing,' he thought, 'I can't wait till John gets it and tells me its way better than the last one.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg glanced at the clock beside his bed that he had been lying on amazed that it only read 4:02. He mentally sighed before getting off his bed placing the magazine on the bedside table and tucking his iPod into his jeans pocket. It was too early to even think about having dinner yet but he was hungry and was going to make it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped out into the hall and then into the kitchen flicking on the light switch. He grimaced at the smell of old pizza and vodka that had been so appetizing a few nights before, funny how everything seems better when you\u2019re drunk. He opened the fridge that stood in the centre of the room glancing across the neatly organized shelves that were his housemates before looking at his mess at the bottom. Nothing edible occupied his part of the fridge. \"Looks like its instant noodles again!\" he remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg turned to face his cupboard to retrieve a Pot Noodle but stopped mid turn. An open box occupied the kitchen with a letter and what appeared to be thin black wristbands that couldn't be more than half an inch wide. Being the nosey type Greg sidled over to the table checking over his shoulder briefly to make sure no one saw him before reading the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was written in a very neat and orderly way and appeared to be addressed to Louisa. He couldn\u2019t read what it said due to it being written in Spanish but he guessed it was from her father. She had told him once after a typically boring lecture that her father was an inventor of sorts and that he sometimes sent her his work so she could test it for him. Greg turned his attention to one of the wristbands picking one of the two that rested next to the box and examined it in his hand. It seemed to have some sort of metal part inside its fabric but other than that it was fairly plain. Being the compulsive type he quickly slipped it onto his arm underneath the wristband he was already wearing so no-one would know before dashing back to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg sat down on his bed again before thinking over what he had done. He had just read (well tried to read) a note that was probably private and taken something from a package that wasn\u2019t his. He immediately realised he had been a little bit too compulsive and should perhaps put the wristband back or maybe even explain to Louisa that he had taken it. Then again she had left it there for anyone to see so in a way it was kind of her own fault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do?</span></div></div>",

He didn't know whether to move away from the opened package that was addressed to Louisa, or to stare at her breasts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Instead he compromised looking at the almost stretched T-shirt under the burgundy-jogging top that was slightly unzipped and stretched out by her magnificent breasts.  Damn, he'd failed; but being as Jill didn't seem to notice, there was no harm done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh Gregie, as much as it pleases me to see you being so honest; I hadn't really planned on that happening, so I will have to make it up as I go along.  You see THAT bracelet has the most amazing effect, especially when tied in with THIS device....\"  She said as she held up a new mobile telephone like device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"A phone?\"  Greg laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Suddenly Louisa yelled out from the hall way....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hey everyone, the new T/V is here, who wants to help me put it in my room for tonight. We are having a girls night in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well Greg, aren't you going to help her?\"  Jill asked in her American accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, there is no benefit for me until tomorrow, when it goes in the communal living room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  There was a bright flash of light, which made Greg blink, and then another that made him feel queasy.  And he said... \"Did you just take my picture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No!\" Louisa answered...  \"I think it was just distant lightning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, you know how much I hate thunder and lightening, distant or not?\" Greg replied.  He wasn't wearing a bracelet so he was unaware of all swaps made with the 'phone' like device.  He thought he'd always had Jill's body, just as Jill had always had his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, it is just as well... you know I like showing my breasts in all of the pictures that are taken of me?\"  Greg said as he unzipped his jogging top until his mounds popped out a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It doesn't matter... Jonathan is here now.  Oh Greg... Mimi says you are still invited; as long as you don't try to show off your boobies, too much.\" Jill said from the hall in her mannish voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Jealousy gets her nowhere....\"  Greg said to Louisa, as he pushed his largish breasts in towards each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"... And I know she gets a secret pleasure out of looking at them.  What were you trying to explain to me again?\"  Greg also said to her in his Chicago tainted American accented feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh I was just saying, that maybe you should have taken this bracelet, while you could!\"  Louisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Why would I take that... it is in a package that is addressed to you.  And anyway it doesn't go with any of my other jewellery.\"  Greg answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, you're SO VAIN now!\"  Louisa replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Why wouldn't I be.  You'd be pretty vain if you looked like me!\" Greg replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Louisa considered her behaviour when she had Jill's body... maybe Greg was right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, let us see whether Jonathan has finished fitting the T/V, as I promised to cheer him on, on the field!\"  Greg said as he adjusted his 'low rise, hip hugger' jeans.  He didn't bother tucking his T-shirt in as he actually wanted to show off his new flat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Are you sure you won't accept this... even as a gift?\"  Louisa said.</span></div></div>",

Hmm...okay!\" Louisa shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa then just stood back and watched both Greg and Jill walking around, doing stuff and conversing, having no idea that they had been bodyswapped. The whole thing actually amused her, but she wondered whether she should 'play' with them some more. Of course she should, was the conclusion she eventually arrived at, and she prepared her wonderous device for further use, running her fingers up and down the touchscreen and selecting what she wanted to alter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Greggy would like to be a man again...at least where it counts\" Louisa grinned, as she made a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back over at Greg, Louisa noticed the way Jill's hip-hugger jeans now seemed to be filled out in front. The bulge was caused by Greg's penis, which she had swapped over to Jill's body, in effect making Greg a good-looking hermaphrodite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good Greg!\" Louisa called out her male housemate, causing him to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, like...tell me something I don't know\" he responded in Jill's sexy voice as he adjusted his 'junk' in his tight-fitting jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance over at Jill in Greg's body didn't provide any evidence that she had changed much, but Louisa now knew that Jill's sweet, musky vagina was now nestled between the male legs of Greg's body. The whole thing actually excited her no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else I wonder?\" Louisa mused, as she toyed with her device some more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was quite short, and he was so tall; she wondered if she could change that; maybe swap some of their skeletal features. Sure enough, it was an option. Louisa had to hold back her own laughter as she saw everyone altered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi now stood at 6'4\". The clothes she wore were still for her smaller frame, and they appeared to be more than a little strained with her new height. The skirt had been short before, but now both of Mimi's ass cheeks were clearly hanging below it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jonathan was practically swimming in his clothes. He was only 5'3\" now.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Louisa was intensely giddy at this point. She wondered what she would do next. Then a thought dawned on her. One of Mimi's hobbies had been fashion design. It was one of the distractions from her studies. She probably could've majored in it, but her parents had insisted on something more professional. Regardless, she had a fitting mannequin in her room with which Louisa was eager to experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitated. The device's instruction had clearly said human only; would a mannequin be close enough? She had to give it a try. She decided to Greg the plastic torso and Jonathan the plastic legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, it worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg walked around quite stiffly. His arms were now locked in place. His breasts were now certainly perky, but they lacked nipples. From his neck to his waist, he was plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Jonathan's legs were completely frozen in place. He turned around from side to side to talk to people. When he wanted to move, he would just ask someone to lift him to a new spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the strangest sight was now the fitting mannequin. Instead of being plastic, it was now made of flesh. Mimi hadn't been working on anything, so it was fully exposed. The torso was clearly Jill's, with her large breasts, complete with her dark nipples. The legs were Jonathan's. Louisa gasped as she noticed his penis just hanging out there. Louisa burst out laughing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After thinking about it for a while Greg ultimately decided that he should continue wearing it without telling Louisa. She had left the package there for anyone to see after all and besides there was still a wristband there even after he had taken one. He went back to reading his magazine to try and take his mind off of his stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so passed before Greg began to feel his stomach growl. He remembered that he had forgotten to get something to eat being distracted by what was on the kitchen table and leaving quickly, guilty about taking a wristband. He jumped up from his bed, removing his earphones and turning off his iPod before wandering down to the kitchen to abate his grumbling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the room moving over to the fridge but stopping half way vaguely recollecting that nothing edible was inside. He shifted his focus over to the cupboard that contained his collection of Pot Noodles, selecting the 'Bombay Bad Boy' from its bottom shelf. Greg lumbered over towards the kettle pleased to see that it still had some water in it, switching it on before grabbing a fork from the cutlery draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited for the water to boil he glanced around the room, tutting at the mess that it had been left in, sure he had been somewhat involved in its destruction but at least he felt bad about it, unlike his all-female housemates. 'It's amazing how I managed to get thrown into the flat with the only three girls in the world that aren't concerned with cleaning everything,' he thought as he looked at the dining table that was stained in every colour under the rainbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At least the table hasn't got anything left...' his thoughts stopped dead in their tracks. Someone, namely Louisa, had taken the package away, meaning that she must know that he had taken the wristband. Louisa was the sort of girl that noticed absolutely every detail which made her the perfect student of law, but if she took her parcel in why hadn't she questioned her sole male housemate about its disappearance. Greg was the only person in the flat with her since Mimi was out shopping (as usual) and Jill was out probably exercising (as usual) so Louisa would have known it was him. She must have wanted him to take it, but why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg continued to ponder on this as he poured the boiling water into his instant noodle cup stirring the spicy soup with his fork and then leaving it to cool for a while, he had learnt earlier in the term that trying to eat it straight away ended in a burnt mouth. After the alloted cooling time he took the Pot Noodle to the table, sitting on the cleanest looking chair (which was still pretty grubby) and began eating away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral forkfuls into his meal a very tired and surprisingly sweating looking Jill entered the kitchen. She had her MP3 player blasting away so she initially ignored his mumbled 'Hello' only acknowledging his existence after she took out her bottle of water with a slight nod before exiting the room. It took Greg a few moments to realise that something wasn't quite right with how Jill looked. Normally he took every available second to ogle her heavenly form but this time he found himself paying her figure little attention, in fact he was certain that she lacked a figure at all. Her clothes were also somewhat odd being unfit for her extensive exercise regime and more for sitting inside studying. Greg shook his head as he continued to eat, his eyes must have been playing tricks on him, there was no way Jill would ever lose her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later Greg had finished what passed for his dinner throwing the empty noodle cup on top of the overflowing bin and taking his fork to the sink. He 'washed' the fork with some cold water over the dirty plates and cutlery that already filled the sink just barely removing the sauce that remained on it before casually dropping back in the draw. He walked over to the kitchen door to return to his room, opening it but finding himself walking into someone rather than the hallway. He looked up to see that the person was in fact...</span></div></div>",

Greg immediately noticed the clothes Jill was wearing, her usual sky-blue tank top and black spandex shorts, as well as white socks and sneakers. He took careful note of the sweat stains on her top while he was gawping at her breasts. He couldn't help but wonder how she had got changed and worked up another sweat in just 10 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay Greg!\" came the reply from Jill, her Chicago accent showing through. \"And er...I'm up here!\" she added, pointing to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...yeah...\" Greg mumbled, embarrassed at having been caught staring at Jill's breasts...again. And with that, Jill slipped her earphones back in and headed past Greg, knowing full well that he would be admiring her firm, shapely ass as she walked away. Greg was amazed at how 'fine' Jill seemed to be with guys staring at her chest, but then again she must have been used to it by now, he thought. He was also 'pleased' that he had seen Jill's figure again, which seemed to have been hidden remarkably well underneath the 'studying' clothes she had been wearing just 10 minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling, Greg then disappeared into his room and closed the door behind him. For a moment he just stood there, inspecting and adjusting the armband he had \"borrowed\", then he wandered over to his bed and slumped down on it, retrieving one of his class books from nearby.  He tried to study a little, but for some reason he couldn't concentrate, all he could think about was Jill and her 'assets'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" Greg suddenly said when he heard a knock on his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was surprised when Louisa entered the room. \"Hey you!\" he greeted her casually...before glancing down at his book again. \"What's up?\" he asked. But then his head jerked up when he recognized the clothes Louisa was attired in. \"Aren't those Jill's clothes?\" he inquired of his Spanish housemate, referring to the 'well-worn' sneakers, low-rise jeans, white t-shirt and burgundy jacket she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...they're mine!\" Louisa answered, looking down at herself. \"I don't think they'd fit Jill would they? Unless she had my body too\" she smirked. \"And speaking of things that are mine, that wristband is too\" she added, causing an instant look of 'guilt' to appear on Greg's face as he held out his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once in his life he was lost for words. Luckily Louisa didn't seem too upset by the whole incident. \"Don't worry about it, I was hoping you wouldn't be able to resist the urge to take one of them for a while\" she smiled at him. She then pulled out some sort of device with a touch screen, that partly resembled an i-phone. \"I've got something to show you\" Louisa then told Greg, trying to control her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a phone already\" Greg chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't got anything like this believe me\" Louisa grinned, as she messed with her 'phone'.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was even more interesting, for males of a certain age anyway, was that her tracksuit top was stretched tightly over two fleshy mounds of joy. He just managed to peel away his eyes for a few seconds to look at her and say \"Sorry about that I suppose I should to...,\" before taken another glance down at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I was hoping to find you and ask you about our upcoming seminar. I know its not our groups turn to hold a presentation tomorrow but I thought we should do some ground work early. I was thinking...\" as Louisa nattered Greg couldn't help but look at her breasts. They were probably the finest pair he had ever seen... apart from Jill's perhaps, but nonetheless they were awesome. He wondered how he had never noticed this before. Perhaps it was because of the clothes she usually wore. They tended to cover body completely allowing the male eye nothing to see leaving her largely unnoticed. It was amazing to think that she had such a great body underneath all those layers and that she had only just decided to start revealing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry are my breasts more interesting than my conversion?\" Greg's eyes quickly snapped up to Louisa's face, his mouth looking for an apology but his brain couldn't seem to find one.

Don't worry I'm not that bothered, it's nice for someone to take notice of my body for a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg relaxed a bit glad that she had only been toying with him. \"What did you want to talk about then?

After what must have been a minute of awkward silence he suddenly realised what she had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry did you say that you now have Jill's body or something along those lines?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, I mean you read the note which my dad sent with the... oh of course you don't understand Spanish do you?\" Louisa held Jill's (now her) hand in front of her mouth to stifle her amusement. \"Well anyway. I think you probably have a fair idea what else came with the package.\" She produced a small black device that had a large touch screen on one side. It resembled a smart phone and could easily be confused as one unless you examined the interface which listed several \"swap\" options.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the 'dispositivo de cambio' or 'remote of change' in English. It can change pretty much whatever you want! My dad sent it to me to test and gave me three wristbands so I could use it with friends as only people wearing a wristband can tell that something has happened. Reality shifts for everyone else so they think that anything changed has always been that way. The wristbands are water-proof so don't worry about taking it off when you shower. You're the first person I picked to use it with...,\" she blushed a little before continuing \"but I haven't decided on the other person and to be honest I think it'd be better if it was just me and you.\" She handed Greg the device, indicating that he should have a go at using the device. \"Don't worry the interface is in English, my father thought I'd share it with my English speaking friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg examined the options that the remote presented, some in white text others in orange, but quickly decided that he should choose one of the simpler sounding options.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding that it would probably be best to start off with something simple, Greg settled on doing a head swap involving himself and Louisa, both were in the same room and aware of what was happening after all. He selected the head swap option before selecting his and Louisa's names to be involved in the swap. After the two names slid into place the word 'Accept?' appeared on the screen which Greg tapped. Within a split second a piercing white light filled the room followed by an unnerving floating feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his vision returned and the weird feeling subsided Greg became immediately aware of how much shorter he felt and how much taller Louisa appeared. The sight of his Spanish housemates head on his body was bizarre to say the least. He quickly lost interest in what was underneath Louisa's head, however, as he looked down to see what now lay beneath his own. His vision was filled with two very familiar breasts, what was unfamiliar was the way in which he witnessed them. As he placed his new feminine hands on the fleshy mounds a surge of pleasure shot across his body causing him to let out a slight sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're enjoying Jill's body. It is pretty amazing isn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say! Her arse isn't bad either,\" came Greg's reply as he squeezed the tight behind that was now in the possession of its third owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant the sensation of having someone else's body you idiot..., but yeah she does have a great body. Anyway this is just one of the functions of the device. It can do almost anything in terms of swapping something from one person to another.\" Greg managed to pull himself away from examining his new body for a moment to see Louisa feeling standing with 'her' hands on 'her' hips. The fact that she struck this feminine pose with his body really undermined the impatience she was trying to portray.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... it's hard to take you seriously with my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you look ridiculous as well. Anyway why don't w-,\" Louisa was cut mid sentence as someone entered the room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sorry am I interrupting something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them looked over to see the petite figure of Mimi dwarfed by the huge amount of shopping that she was seemingly able to carry. It was amazing how a girl so small could lift what looked like twice her size in bags of clothes, bags, shoes and other various fashion accessories, they were all of course necessary for her wardrobe. The tiny Japanese girl glanced at the device that was in Greg's hand guessing that this had been the subject of her housemates conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cool new phone Greggy, did you get that today? That reminds me, I got this really great new skirt and I know that it would look super good on you! You have such great legs it makes me blue with envy. No wait I mean green!\" She just smiled at the two of them as they both stared blankly at her. Mimi had a knack for speaking so fast that people found it difficult to keep up. Louisa was the first to make sense of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah <i>Greggy</i> you probably have the best legs on campus,\" she indicated to the fact that he had Jill's body and that for everyone else this was the norm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... thanks that would be... great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm going to go to my room and try and fit all this shopping into my wardrobe. Remember, if you want to borrow anything from me you just have to ask... so long as I can have something of yours in return!\" Mimi swiftly left the room swinging her cargo as she went down the hall to her room. The same shocked silence filled the room as Greg and Louisa tried to get to grips with what had happened. It was the first experience they had had with people that were unaware of the changes that the device had made and the fact that reality had changed to suit these changes was jarring to say the least. Louisa looked over to Greg to see a perplexed look spread across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what my father meant when he said that reality would shape itself around the changes that we make with the device. Hey, I know, let's go to your room, I think you might want to see this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impish grin that occupied Louisa's face unnerved Greg a little but he nonetheless followed her back to his room expecting the worst when he got there. As he opened the door he found that the contents of his room had changed somewhat. The posters that hung on the wall were unchanged, as was the PS3 that sat on his desk, but the clothes that inhabited his room were not his own. A pink hoodie replaced the black one that normally hung off the back of his desk chair and his wardrobe was filled with various feminine outfits. The weirdest thing of all was what he saw when he opened the draw at the bottom of his wardrobe. Instead of the boxers and plain socks that he would normally see he found row upon row of delicate knickers and bras, some with lacy borders, others were more sensible clearly to be used when exercising. Greg sheepishly lifted out the skimpiest pair of knickers he could find, blushing as he realised that they were now his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty hilarious huh? I found the same thing happened to my wardrobe when I changed. Anyway I think you've had enough excitement for one day.\" A white flash filled the room as Louisa swapped the two of them back, she had taken the device back from him as they left the kitchen. As Greg's body had returned to normal so had the underwear that he held in his hands, reverting back to a pair of plain grey briefs. As he placed them back in his draw he noticed that his regular clothes once more occupied his shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway I'd better get back to my room and do some work on my essay in for next week. You should do the same if you don't want to miss the deadline again!\" Greg turned to see that Louisa still possessed Jill's hot body, he raised an eyebrow at this revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It's my device after all! I deserve to have a little male attention for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she left the room leaving Greg alone to work on his essay. After booting up his laptop he opened up the word document that contained his half finished essay. He had actually written quite a decent one by his standards, not wanting to feel the wrath of Dr Alice Springer again. For a cute looking 30 something woman she had a hell of a temper. As Greg stared at the screen occasionally flicking through one of his textbooks he realised that he was well and truly stuck. He had written a passable introduction with two strong opening paragraphs but he couldn't get any further than that. After half an hour of nothing he considered going over to Louisa's room. She had said previously that she would help him with his work if he ever needed it but then again he could just try and go it alone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Greg decided that Louisa was probably just being polite when she had made this offer and that it was a little unfair to rely on her for help when she was working on her own essay, besides he had done well on his own so far. He continued to flick through his multitude of texts books, scanning each page lazily, hoping that something might jump out at him that was necessary until the impossible happened. The perfect parallel to the case-file that he was writing about appeared on the centre of the page like an oasis in a desert, hopefully this wasn't a mirage like so many others he'd found today. As he read through text he realised that it was indeed perfect and he began to type down what he had found, showing the similarities between the two as he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg did this for about an hour until he had exhausted all the information he could. Looking over the several paragraphs he had just written he was pretty confident that he had almost finished. All he needed was a decent conclusion and he'd get a decent grade for sure! He was well on his way now to becoming the next Phoenix Wright, the games, funnily enough, being what inspired him to go for a Law degree in the first place, although he wouldn't admit it. He had even bought a blue suit before he moving out to the campus which he had yet to wear outside of the walls of his room. He briefly wondered what the suit had changed to when he had Jill's body, perhaps something resembling Mia Fey's outfit ... he shook off the though as stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm clock on his bedside table flashed the time showing that it was 9:00, it was way to early to even think about sleep so Greg opened up YouTube and began to watch several of the videos that had been suggested to him. Hours flew by and by the time he decided it was probably a good idea to get some rest his clock displayed a miserable 2:13. Greg cursed under his breath, how could he have wasted <i>five hours</i> watching clips of dogs on skateboards and cats playing musical instruments! He flopped onto his bed, not even bothering to undress, and passed out into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slept he had an unusually vivid dream. He was standing in the middle of the kitchen but it was several times larger than in reality. The fridge looked like a skyscraper piercing the sky and he was sure he could see clouds partially blocking the single working light fitting in the ceiling. No sooner had he taken in his surroundings the gargantuan kitchen door began to creak open letting in a shroud of mist. Out of the fog burst a menacing looking woman who toward over the trembling Briton, her enormous curvaceous body barely covered by a skimpy looking metallic bikini, she was undoubtedly some sort of succubus. As she loomed nearer to Greg her face came into view, it was Louisa, but her usually innocent looking face was contorted into an evil sneer. He tried to flee from her but his legs wouldn't move. She grabbed him with her giant fist and tore him towards her, but rather than taking his body, his soul was torn from his mortal shell. He struggled to escape from her grasp but it was hopeless, the demonic Louisa opened her fanged mouth and consumed him whole... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's eyes suddenly burst open, he was sweating and shaking but he was still alive, it was just a stupid dream. As he went to move out of bed he was sure he didn't feel normal...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Greg moved his nightie covered legs to the edge of the bed and put his red toed feet flat on the floor.  Then he raised his body, feeling his breast's bobbing as they settled into place on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"God... what a night mare!\"  Greg exclaimed as he raised his hands to rub his smooth feminine face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg looked down at his impressive cleavage and said...  \"Well let's see if there was any damage to you girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He then opened his door, checked the passageway was clear, and ran into the female toilets to do his favourite inspection of the day, checking his breast's were clear of sleep damage before choosing what to wear on top.  Some days his breasts were so damaged that all he could do was to cover them up with the pink polo top.  Other days his breasts were still perfect and he could wear his favourite pink string strap vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He looked at his breasts in the mirror and saw that, he hadn't been sleeping on his front, so his breasts were still perfect.  There were no red creases, marring the skin's surface, and he could wear the string strapped vest... perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He wasn't a lawyer yet so he could still dress pretty casually, but soon he would have to wear a skirt suit to interviews and then every day to work, and Greg didn't want that exactly.  Greg loved the freedom of being a girl student and being able to wear what ever he wanted to... whenever he wanted to wear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg then squirted some toothpaste onto his girlie pink toothbrush, and moved his torso back and his head forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What the fuck!\"  He said when he saw his own blonde hair tied up in a high ponytail behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No... no... this ain't right!  Somebody's having a laugh... at MY expense!\"  Greg said, as his hair was short and brown and not the long blonde hair that was currently flowing down past his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'But who?  ... Oh wait... it must be Louisa!'  Greg thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes, Louisa was the only one with this power, that I know of.\"  Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Suddenly Greg wasn't so sure about exposing these breasts to unknown eyes and he ran back into his room and selected the pink polo shirt and a secure sports bra.  Then when he'd easily put them both on, he looked at himself, wearing only his sleep panties below the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Gee... will this never end!\" Greg said as he went to his panty drawer and selected some pink silk panties and swapped them for the sleep panties he was still wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After all, pink was just a colour... it was a nice colour and it matched the polo shirt that he was already wearing.  Then he went to his wardrobe and selected some pink jeans and pulled them on too.  Then feeling like he was dressing to a theme he selected the pink jeans jacket, pink socks and pink striped trainers and put them all on too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Now he was ready to face Louisa, so he went and banged on her door.  Mimi's door opened and she, wearing only panties and a loose T-shirt, said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hi Gregie, I thought you were going with Louisa, to that early lecture, this morning.  Louisa has already left, she didn't take you with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, apparently not!\"  Greg acerbically answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Nice... that is a really cool 'sexy babe' jacket.  Can I ask where you brought it?\"  Mimi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg thought that he had no idea where it came from, so he was about to answer 'yes... you can ask!'  But then he was hit by a memory of the changing room in Top Shop, where he was in Jill's body looking at his back in the mirror, looking at the 'sexy babe' that was written on his jeans jacket back and saying \"yes... I'll take the jeans, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Top Shop in town!\"  Greg humbly answered... hoping that the memory of all of those half-naked young females, in the changing rooms, would survive the transfer back into his own head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Shit!\"  Greg said as he looked at his girlie watch hanging off of his thin right wrist and remembered where he should have been 10 minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, Jill has a car, so maybe we can ask her?  Go and get your hand bag and room key, while I ask her!\"  Mimi offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg was treated to being a passenger, in his own car, driven by Jill in his own body.  They pulled into the building's car park, where Greg noticed Louisa's car... so Louisa was already here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Don't call me baby, that's not my name!\" Greg replied to the drunken beggar who had violently accosted him on the way to the building's entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You rich bitches are all the same!\"  The bum slurred, and blew his nose on his right sleeve. Greg could see a recently stitched up knife wound on his left nostril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well why don't we ask that nice policeman for his opinion on that!\"  Greg said pointing over his right shoulder with his right thumb, in the direction he'd just come from, where the man couldn't see!  Greg thought that the man didn't need to know that there was nobody there and he was bluffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The bum soon wondered off, mumbling drunkenly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Good afternoon Mr Perry, so good of you to join us.  Who's bed did you crawl out of?\"  Dr Alice Springer accosted him as soon as he entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"My own!  I mean, nobodies, that is....\"  Greg nearly stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Alice glared up at Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Sorry, Dr Springer, it won't happen again!\"  Greg said, then he looked for Louisa.  There she was, but there wasn't a single untaken seat, near her.  He looked further afield, there were phoney Tony, and mangler Harris, both patting the seats next to them... as if to say 'I've saved you a seat... darling, come and sit next to me, baby!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Ewe!' that sent a shiver of revulsion up his spine... at least he hoped it was revulsion, and not pleasure.  Oh well there was also weird Albert who always chose to sit by himself too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Is this seat taken?\"  Greg asked Albert, only feeling like he was intruding on Albert's personal space when he sat on his hand.  Strangely it didn't feel as lumpy as it looked afterwards... because of the feminine layer of extra fat on his new behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Erm no!  By all means... take it!\"  Albert said, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Thank you... there IS a god!\"  He whispered when he thought nobody was listening.  Then he gave the thumbs up signal to mangler and received the same signal in reply.  Greg didn't need to know, but mangler had... had a fine view of his wide female ass, when he sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You do know that anything said 'between us' is 'confidential' and should be treated as such?\"  Were his first words to a seated Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What?\"  Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Just so you know!\"  Albert stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Whatever!\"  Greg replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  What happens next?</span></div></div>",

That had certainly been the msot vivid dream he had ever had and he hadn't liked it in the least. He peered down at himself and used his hands to pat himself down, he was somewhat relieved to see he was still himself. Obviously Louisa had been too busy reveling in having Jill's body from the neck down to mess with him. <i>\"Either that or she's just asleep\"</i> Greg mused. He glanced over at his alarm clock, the digital orange numbers displayed 5:23am. \"Great!\" he grumbled to himself, laying back down on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind then started to wander, and several questions entered his head. \"Was Louisa really asleep, or was she messing with someone else? Was he having trouble sleeping because of the device and wristband, or just because his almost-complete essay was preying on his mind. He then thought back to when he had Jill's body, or rather...most of it, it had felt really nice being a girl, and he was half tempted to go and creep into Louisa's room to see if he could grab the remote. <i>\"Nah! If she catches me...I'll be in for it\"</i> Greg said to himself with a groan as he shook his head and turned over onto his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued thinking about the events of the last few hours, and eventually he fell asleep again, and this time...there was no giant 'Louisa' succubus invading his naptime. He woke up when the alarm clock started beeping at 8:00am. Letting out a groan, Greg turned over and rubbed his eyes...before reaching over and shutting the alarm off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting up and stretching (and also doing a yawn that nearly swallowed up half the room), Greg started his normal morning routine, which started with cleaning his teeth and freshening up a little. He decided not to change out of the now creased clothes that he had worn yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling out of his room, Greg looked around for any one of his housemates. Seeing nobody, he made his way into the kitchen, and he saw Jill sat at the table. She was wearing a plain white t-shirt, a teal cardigan, a pair of stonewash jeans and some sneakers, Greg could tell immediately from the lack of breast flesh...that she still possessed Louisa's typically European (and unflattering) body from the neck down...and was still completely unaware of the fact. \"Uh...morning!\" Greg greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout muttering a word, or even pausing from eating her Bran Flakes, Jill briefly acknolwedged his arrival. <i>\"Good talk!\"</i> Greg muttered acerbically, under his breath, as his eyes scoured the kitchen for Louisa, to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Greg eventually decided it was probably best to just suck it up and ask for help, she had offered to help him after all and he was getting nowhere fast. He got out of his chair and made his way over towards Louisa's room bringing his laptop with him. As Greg made his way down the hall towards his room he was sure he could hear giggling coming from his fellow Law student's room. She had obviously made a particularly amusing swap and was reveling in its humour. He paused for a moment wondering whether he should just barge right in there without knocking first but decided that it would be funny if he caught her in the middle of doing something embarrassing, besides she knew that he knew about the device and the door was left open for anyone to just walk in. Greg placed his hand on the handle and jerked it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside he was greeted to a perculiar sight and he quickly wished he had knocked before entering. In front of him stood Louisa with her trousers around her ankles, but it wasn't her ankles, or her trousers for that matter. She had swapped bodies with a muscular and rather well endowed black man and was currently shaking her newly acquired genitals from side to side, watching herself in the mirror. Greg quickly averted his eyes, although clearly not quickly enough to avoid seeing as much as he already had, as Louisa promptly snatched her trousers back up in an attempt to cover her new junk, but the buldge was impossible to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I see you're having fun with your new toy ... or should that be toys.\" For Greg this was surprisingly quick witted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the crap are you doing bursting in like that don't you think of other people's privacy. How would you like it if I just walked into your room uninvited?!\" Louisa's face was \u00a0a very bright shade of red which contrasted greatly from the body that sat beneath it. She flopped onto \u00a0her bed and covered her face with her pillow in an attempt to hide her shame but there was no undoing what Greg had witnessed, although God knows he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-look if I had the device to myself I know I'd do exactly what you're doing ... although it'd probably be with a body like Jill's ... and I'd lock my door. I mean that was pretty amatuerish.\" This did little to heal Louisa's shame, but it did cheer her up a bit. Sometimes the most ill-adjudged words can help more than the best thought out ones just by simply being funny. \"Anyway, how 'bout I leave you to whatever you were doing and come back later. I'll promise to knock next time. Is that Johnathan's body by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" her voice was muffled by the pillow, she turned over to face him. \"Yes it is ... and no don't worry about it now, I'm not exactly in the mood to ... you know anymore.\" Greg wasn't sure if he really wanted to know but he had a fair idea. It was kind of weird thinking about it in reverse but he guessed it made sense. The first thing he would do with that sort of power would be to swap with the hottest girl on campus and stay in his room to 'explore' for a day or two. Maybe a week. Or more. It was certainly surprising that Louisa was eager to experience the other side in such intimate detail considering how innocent she seemed, but then again it's always the quiet ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ashamedly reached for the remote and reversed the swap, the white flash blinding them for a split second before reality readjusted to the swap. Louisa now had her old body back but her face was still distinctly crimson. She looked up at Greg noticing that he held his laptop under his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came over here just to ask for essay help? God I'm such a moron, I shouldn't have offered to help you last week. You know I was just being polite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you shouldn't make promises you don't want to keep and besides there was a more glaring error that you made. Like I said the first rule of masturbation is to lock the door. Or is it to get the tissues I forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're doing. Trying to act like an idiot just to make me feel better, you do that a lot you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, is it that obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! And I didn't promise you anything I just said if you need any help you could always ask me. I was just being kind or something. You seemed pretty shaken after she shouted at you, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it takes more than that North American mad woman screaming to rattle this Brit ... And it sounded like a promise to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting us nowhere! But thanks, you can be nice when you want to be, but that doesn't mean I've forgiven you,\" an unsettling glint filled her eyes. \"I know! How about you let me make one swap to you and you have to stay like it for a day.\" This proposition took Greg a little by surprise but he felt he owed her a little for seeing her in the middle of some 'private time'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but only for a day and nothing too weird!\" He had a bad feeling about this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The grin on Louisa's face was really beginning to unsettle Greg making him regret agreeing to her proposal to a 'swap for a day'. He had really seen another side to her today, it was amazing how a little power could change someone so completely. As she flicked through the various options in front of her, Greg placed his laptop down on Louisa's desk, next to her own which was on and displayed her own essay, it looked as though it was practically finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are still going to help me with my essay right? I mean even after you've done whatever swap on me you want.\" Louisa glanced up at her now very nervous test subject before settling on what to do to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course I'll help you,\" She smirked a little before continuing, \"although I'm not sure what part you'll play in doing the work, if any since I'm going to use one of the unfinished swaps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that supposed to mean? Wait if it's 'unfinished won't that mean it's dangerous or some-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry my dad wouldn't have put an option on this device if he thought it could cause anyone any actual harm. It's just he hasn't finalised it completely which is the whole point of me testing it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still I thought you said you'd do a regular sw-\" before Greg could finish his sentence a bright white flash filled his vision and it felt as though he was ripped backwards through the wall. As he came to his senses he could hear water running and felt as though his hand was freezing cold. He looked down to see that he was holding a glass under the kitchen tap, water was pouring over the sides and onto 'his' hand. Greg slowly backed away from the sink, entranced by the delicate fingers that were holding up the full glass. As he moved to placing it on the table he realised how unstable it felt to move, it was a though his body was made of rubber. Before he toppled over, he grabbed the side of the table to steady himself. The bangles that rattled around 'Greg's' arms were unmistakably Mimi's, well at least he knew who he was and where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of leaning up against the kitchen table Greg tentatively let go putting his weight back onto his feet. Fortunately Mimi had chosen to wear some of her more sensible shoes as there was no way Greg would have coped with something with heels. Getting over the initial shock of the change the new Mimi started to move towards the door out into the hallway but stopped. He was suddenly thirsty, moving back and picking up the glass on the table. Mimi had clearly been in the middle of getting some water to releave her thirst before Greg had taken over, it seemed there was some delay in completely inheriting this thirst, perhaps this was what Louisa meant by the swap being 'unfinished'. After quenching his thirst Greg left the kitchen and made his way towards 'his' room. It was bizarre how easily he seemed to be able to walk with his Japanese housemates' body now when initially he could barely stand. The way his hips seemed to sway as he went was a little unsettling, but that was just the way girls moved after all, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering his new room for the next 24 hours he soon bore witness to the body that was to be his for the same period of time. Seeing Mimi staring back at him in the body length mirror was very ... interesting. She, or rather he, was wearing white training shoes, knee length socks, very short shorts, a brightly coloured tight fitting t-shirt and a purple cardigan. Greg felt fairly ridiculous wearing these clothes, but in the context of having a sexy female Asian teenager's body he had to admit he looked good. He couldn't resist the urge to bop from side to side, mimicking the way he had seen Mimi dance at the various parties they had both gone to.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of posing in the mirror Greg considered what to do next. He began to think exactly what had happened to him and how he was going to cope with being in Mimi's body for the next day. He would have to try and be as inconspicuous as possible mimicking his Japanese housemates mannerism as closely as possible to avoid any unwanted attention. Greg flopped onto Mimi's bright pink bed suddenly realising the great effort it would take to become Mimi for a day. How could he go to her seminars and solve complex Maths equations? He was hopeless when it came to numbers whilst she was a certified genius. Greg reached over to the bedside table picking up a textbook and began flicking through it, expecting to find a sea of incomprehensible gibberish but instead finding a delicate tapestry of letters and numbers. It made sense! His new dark brown eyes darted across page after page, each one seemingly more recognisable than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped briefly and began to think about Mimi's timetable for tomorrow; an early start with Dr Jackson followed by a two hour study session with Katie in the library. He knew everything she knew! It wasn't like accessing his own memory, which he could still do with ease, but like ready someone's diary filled with every thought and detail of their inner mind. Being Mimi for the day would apparently be easier than he had first anticipated, but Greg still worried about one thing. What would happen to his own body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe imagined that Louisa would have somehow set the device so Mimi would be unaware of the swap that had taken place, after all hadn't Louisa said she wanted him to be the only other person to know about it for the time being? He didn't know this for certain, however, so perhaps finding out about the extent of her side of the swap would be wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Greg lifted himself up off of Mimi's bed, which seemed far easier with her light frame, before walking out of her room. Approaching Louisa's door, he tentatively knocked it twice, unsure of what sort of 'Greg' he would find inside.</span></div></div>",

He had assumed that Louisa wanted to keep the device a secret for the moment, but she clearly had other ideas. Perhaps this was meant to add to his embarrassment making him understand how Louisa had felt when he had walked in on her. Certainly seeing his own body grin down on him was unsettling to say the least.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or should I call you Mimi from now on!\" Without any warning the new Greg jumped on the old Greg, lifting him up into the air in a sort of bear-hug. \"I never thought I'd be able to cuddle myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...crushing...me...\" Greg managed to squeak feeling his now small frame being crushed in the grip of the new him. Mimi relented her unintentional torture, dropping Greg to his feet before letting out another maniacal giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry <i>Mimi</i> I guess I don't know <i>my</i> own strength!\" Greg could tell by the way she was accentuating certain words that Mimi was enjoying the role reversal. Louisa also appeared to be admiring her handy work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you were keeping it between us for now!\" Greg said with more than a hint of annoyance. However his pouting only served to amuse Louisa and Mimi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Greg, I can't take you seriously when you pout like that!\" Louisa chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww I think he looks cute when he's angry,\" Mimi said in a cutesy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in your body you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! That's why you're so cute!\" Mimi exclaimed whilst ruffling Greg's hair. Only just resisting the urge to punch his own face, Greg sighed and decided to get to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does she know everything then?\" he said motioning towards Mimi. \"I mean about the device and its abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told her the basics and gave her a wristband so she knows about every swap made so far as well as any future ones I decide to make.\" Mimi revealed the wristband she was wearing, but Greg was more interested in what Louisa had just explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second, did you say the wristband let's you know about changes made before you wear it?\" he said slightly puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm, that's why you know I have Jill's body even though I've had it for a couple of days now. The wristbands are basically a link back to reality, or so my father said...\" The room went silent for a moment, Greg considering the fact that he only noticed that Louisa's figure was different a few hours ago, slightly ashamed of his poor observational skills. There was still one thing that bothered him though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you let Mimi in on it then.\" Louisa raised an eyebrow at Greg's somewhat petulant statement.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Greg, you know. The more the merrier and all that. Besides with more people in the know we have more options.\" she replied with a wicked grin on her face. \"Besides, it doesn't change what you promised before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm going to gave to be Mimi for a day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she's going to have to be me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're ok with this Mimi? I mean she did tell you our 'agreement' right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I was a bit weirded out by it at first but when Louisa told me it was only for a day and that I had your memories so I knew what I was doing I was fine with it. I mean, it's not everyday you get to live someone else's life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed...\" Greg murmured, none to enthused about what he had to look forward to. \"So... what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was going to help <i>Greg</i> with his essay. You could stay and watch if you want Mimi, but I'm sure Law wouldn't interest you.\" A frown spread its way across Greg's face. Louisa and Mimi looked on at him in expectation, apparently waiting for him to play along. It seemed as though he was going to have to stay in character for the next 24 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then. I guess I'll just go be me... mi,\" he said with a sigh, his terrible attempt at a pun and lack of enthusiasm disappointing Louisa and Mimi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg turned and left the room and going out into the hallway. He momentarily walked towards his own room, but stopped halfway remembering who he was. After entering Mimi's room he flopped onto her distinctly pink and frilly bed at a loss as to what to do next.</span></div></div>",

He tried to think about what Mimi had done, but he was having trouble. Why wasn't he able to access those memories? He should be able to, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to go back a little earlier -- to the start of her shopping trip. Yes, this he could remember. He could remember coming home to freshen up. On her way out, she grabbed a slice of pizza and started chowing down. He grumbled. Mimi had totally stole some of his leftovers without asking. On her way out the door, she checked herself in the mirror and spied the package with the wristbands inside. She thought they were pretty tacky, but was also instantly curious about a new fashion accessory. She had placed one on her wrist just as Louisa walked into the kitchen. Louisa explained to Mimi what the wristbands did and asked if she wanted a demonstration. A-ha! So, Louisa had REALLY been lying. Greg wasn't even the first one to know about these -- he felt a little hurt by that. Then Louisa had activated the remote, and Mimi had found herself in a new body, sitting in a really boring lecture about to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Greg realized who Louisa had swapped Mimi with earlier -- HIM! She had done some sort of swap that made her forget who she really was, so from that point on, Mimi had been convinced she was really Greg. Wait a second, that means he really WAS Mimi. Everything earlier was just Louisa toying around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg (or Mimi who thought she was Greg this entire time) was having a hard time wrapping her head around all of this. She could remember her entire life as Greg, coming up with Mimi's memories were so much more difficult. She still identified herself as Greg, but she knew she had to really be Mimi. If she really was Mimi, she didn't think she could keep up with Mimi's flirtatious shopaholic lifestyle forever! Louisa had always been a little jealous of Mimi, but she couldn't imagine why she'd do this to her! And Greg (the real Greg) had played along so well! What should she do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After lying on her bed for several minutes, Greg became acutely aware of how different Mimi's body felt from his own. Aside from the obvious difference than she was much smaller than he was, her body felt more delicate and subtle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively he raised his hands to his chest, cupping the fleshy orbs that were now his own. Despite being covered by several layers of clothing Greg felt a tickle of pleasure from his sensitive nipples which began to harden as he continued to squeeze them in his dainty hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding he wanted to further 'explore' his new form and realising he should probably lock the door, Greg simultaneous slipped off the cardigan and T-shirt he was wearing whilst getting to his feet. After kicking off his pink trainers and noiselessly locking the door, Greg examined himself in the mirror. Currently his breasts were only concealed by a lacy pink bra which matched the frilly knickers that were just visible beneath his denim shorts. Stripy multicoloured knee length socks finished off his sexy outfit.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntranced by his reflection, Greg unclipped his bra, dropping it to the floor, Mimi's modest but perky breasts greeting his appraising eye. His nipples were still noticeably erect and only became more so as he began to squeeze each one between his fingers. The sensation forced a cute squeal from his lips and with Mimi's voice this only served to arouse him more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming more interested in the lower reaches of his new body, Greg slipped off the denim shorts and slightly damp panties leaving only the knee length socks (he had always been rather fond of them especially on Mimi). Slowly he left his now rock hard nipples to explore his new sex. Sliding a hand past his neatly trimmed patch of pubic hair, Greg sent one fingertip to gently slip between his pink lower lips. Greg was momentarily surprised at how wet he already was but a quick surge of pleasure distracted him in an instant. Moving a fingertip upward, he circled his hardening clit slowly. A broad smile spread across his face as he began playing with the sensitive nub. Moving more urgently now, he began to flick his fingertip back and forth across his new love button, causing his whole body to sway with euphoria, sending him falling back onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping his fingertip against his clit caused shockwaves of pleasure to rocket through Greg's body as he introduced his other hand into his playtime. Slipping a finger into his velvet folds he curled that slender digit upwards and stroked his G-spot softly. Greg began to moan quiet words of bliss as he humped his hips toward the ceiling in an effort to get his finger deeper into his pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrusting his finger firmly into his wet cavern, he finally gasped as an orgasm rocked his small body. The rapture that his new body was sent into was like nothing he had ever felt before, every nerve seemingly glowing from the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes he slumped into a deep sleep, basking in the afterglow.</span></div></div>",

Stumbling to his feet, dazed and more than a little confused he switched the alarm off. Looking down at his almost naked form, still wearing Mimi's knee length socks, memories of yesterday came flooding back to him. Louisa had made him switch lives and bodies with their Japanese housemate as a sort of punishment for catching her 'in the act' with Jonathan's body from the neck down. He cursed himself for recollecting the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShame began to flood Greg's mind as he remembered that he too had taken advantage of having Mimi's form. His body still smelt of last night's act, but fortunately there appeared to be no evidence of anything on the bed sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick wash in the shower whilst trying to avoid distraction, Greg dressed in the most sensible underwear he could find, a plain bra and panties, both of course pink. Deciding to be a bit more adventurous with his outer clothing, Greg choose to wear another pair of Mimi's shortest denim shorts and a blue spaghetti strap top. Finally he put on a pair of white training socks, putting on the same trainers that Mimi had worn yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Greg had cleared away the clothes that he had strewn across the floor in the heat of last night, he left Mimi's room going to the kitchen in search of breakfast. On entering the kitchen Greg noticed that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon entering the kitchen Greg saw Louisa, still sporting Jill's body from the neck down, as well as Mimi, though to the rest of the world she was now Greg. Psyching himself up, Greg deciding to go all out in taking on his new role as Mimi, perhaps hoping that a good performance would earn him a quick return to his old life and body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two! Getting ready for another day of lectures and seminars in the art of Law?\" Louisa and Mimi both turned to face Greg stood in stunned silence. Greg began to feel as though he had overdone it. \"Uhh... guys, you don't have to stare me down like that I was only-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Mimi, me and Greg were just getting ready to go. And yes I suppose I am looking forward to it.\" Louisa gave him a knowing smile before nudging Mimi in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes... me too,\" Mimi continued none to enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then Greg we should get going. We don't want to be late and give Dr Springer a reason to shout about 'commitment to our studies' again,\" Louisa said moving past Greg to leave the kitchen. Mimi followed behind stopping midway and facing Greg briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget you have a seminar in just over ten minutes. Please don't be late,\" her tone was firm and a little somber. After a weak smile Mimi followed Louisa out of the room and down the hallway, leaving Greg alone and slightly confused in the kitchen. It seemed clear to him that Mimi was perhaps not taking the swap as well as it had first seemed.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growling of his stomach broke Greg from his train of thought, reminding him that he had come here for a reason. After initially moving to his own cupboard, Greg opened Mimi's taking out the box of sugar coated cereal that she ate every morning. Normally Greg would have a slice of toast in the morning if he had breakfast at all, generally hating any type of cereal, but after a couple of spoonfuls he found that he actually enjoyed \u00a0its taste. It seemed as though he had gained Mimi's taste in food by having her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the bowl of cereal and washing up, Greg left the flat, using Mimi's memories to guide himself towards where she had her seminars.</span></div></div>",

Nonetheless he continued to listen, focusing on her eyes, he couldn't let his own wander back down to her ... No he wasn't going to cave in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I decided to completely scrap it and start anew since I wasn't happy with my conclusion.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I asked Dr Springer which essay she thought would best suit me via email and you'll never guess what she replied!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said I should go...\" Greg had completely phased out by now. Louisa's mouth was moving but he couldn't hear any words. His mind was dealing with the more important matter of why the hell he hadn't noticed her impeccable figure before. It wasn't as if she was reasonably well formed and he hadn't noticed it before due to her plain and baggy choice of clothing, the girl was stunning for goodness sake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... I mean I felt like telling my dad or something but he would only say that I should think for myself a bit more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I'm going to go back to my room and get back to my new essay. \u00a0Oh, and remember what I said before, anytime you need help with work or study just ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa turned to leave the room, stopping to smile at Greg before closing the door. Even her arse was perfect! This was beginning to really worry Greg now, something was up and he had to get to the bottom of it. \u00a0He promptly left the kitchen and returned to his room starting up his laptop as he dropped onto his chair. If there was anywhere he could find the answer to his problem it was the Internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacebook popped up onto the screen. He would start here to look for clues. After a few seconds of flicking through various photos of Jill he realised something was up. Rather than wearing sporty and occasionally revealing clothes she wore plain, dark jumpers and baggy jeans. Louisa's photos were more puzzling, however, with one photo causing him the most confusion. It was a group photo of Louisa and some of her Spanish friends standing in a line and all wearing swimming costumes. He vaguely remembered seeing it before one night when he was 'browsing' his female friends photo albums, noting that all of them were wearing one-pieces which seemed a shame as one of them was pretty hot. But this time one of them was wearing a bikini and was considerably hotter than the other girl. This girl was Louisa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no mistaking it, Greg never forgot a hot girl in a bikini and he knew he had seen this photo before. Something had happened to alter that image, and perhaps reality, this worried him the most. His mind went back to the package he had seen on the table and the wristband he had taken and was currently wearing. It had to be what had caused this change somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt like Phoenix Wright, spotting the contradiction in his current reality and this photo was the key piece of evidence. Greg was now at an impasse, he could either confront Louisa with his revelation or just ignore it for the moment it did seem a little farfetched but it was the only way he could explain it. He knew something wasn't right.</span></div></div>",

Uh Jill <br>\r\nLouise then opens her mouth and feeds Greg's cock in her mouth.<br>\r\nGreg. (Thinking) well the blow job isn't the best.

Ok Jill how bout this I'm going to prop your head up at the top of the bed so you can see just how good I use your old body for Greg and you no longer have a ugly fat short body. How's that!<br>\r\nOf course Jill starts screaming again so using the remote she freezes Jill so she can't move and muscle in her face <br>\r\nLouise. There now I can look you in the eyes while I'm using your old body to please my new man. <br>\r\nOh but let me change your screaming horror look........(she makes her smile with an approving look) hahaha well Jill judging from your sweet smiling face your approving of your body being stolen!<br>\r\nLouise. Now where were we Greg <br>\r\nGreg. Well just for clarity you are changing everything back to normal after right? ( feeling sorry for Jill)<br>\r\nLouise.

Of course I would thus is the most erotic thing I've done but what about jill I know she knows what's going on judging from her slight scream at what she just heard but unable to stop sucking.<br>\r\nLouise. Well I could alter reality for her and the people in the school.<br>\r\nI would truly be jill and she would be louise but I couldn't alter the whole world so if we came across Jill's parents they would oviosly see there daughters BODY had been stolen lol.<br>\r\nBut jill and everyone at the school would think I'm jill and that I have always looked this way and viceverca.<br>\r\nShe uses Jill's perfect manicured hands to rub his chest and slowly caress his now growing member<br>\r\nLouise.( using jilld stolen vocal chords) what do you think tiger will you be Jill's husband?<br>\r\nLouise. \"Hey jill or actually louise go get my future husband a beer.<br>\r\nJill stops sucking her own stolen toes and blankly says yes walks away and brings back a beer kneels down in front of Greg.<br>\r\nLouise.

He was genuinely intrigued by it after all and the only way he could find out what they actually were was by asking Louisa since he couldn't read Spanish. He walked out of his room glancing in to the kitchen briefly noting that the box was no longer on the table. 'Crap, I guess she remembered she left the box and she must have noticed one of the bands were missing.' As he reached Louisa's door he knocked hoping she would understand his curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" was the reply which took Greg a little by surprise. Louisa was normally a quiet girl and he was sure she'd be mad having noticed that a wristband was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Louisa. I thought I'd better return one of the wristbands your dad sent you. Well I guessed they were from your dad since he sends you... Why are you smiling at me?\" Greg was a little bemused. Not only was Louisa not angry she seemed to be happy to see him. Greg glanced down at her wrist that wore one of the wristbands. She also held a device that looked remarkably like an iPhone. \"Hey did he send you an Iphone? That's pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not an iPhone it's an invention of his! I'm guessing you're wearing a wristband since one was missing. Wanna see how it works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nodded silently, secretly buzzing with expectation. The day had been a real drag and if this device/invention thingy was half as epic as the grin on Louisa's face it had to be pretty cool. She quickly began to tap away on the touch-pad before sliding her index finger from the top to the bottom of the device before looking up at Greg. \"Ready?\" she asked looking as excited as Greg had ever seen her. As Greg nodded she tapped once more on the pad before a bright light flashed from the Iphone like device which was quickly followed by nothing but blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Greg's vision came back he was shocked to say the least.</span></div></div>",

He was weaing Louisa's clothes...and her sneakers, hell...he was wearing her body...as a quick grab at the 'modest' breasts on his chest confirmed. Brushing his now long hair from his face, Greg looked back across at...'himself'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B..but...we've...s...swapped...\" he stuttered in his feminine tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...we've swapped bodies!\" his former voice said, as Louisa grinned at him. \"That's what this little invention does, it can swap anything between two people, whole bodies, body parts, just...anything. And only the people wearing the wristbands will realize what has happened\" Louisa explained in length, as she tried to ignore the erection that was forming in her jeans. \"Great, another hard-on,\" Louisa laughed as she looked down at her crotch, \"that always happens whenever I swap with a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...this is amazing!\" Greg remarked, eliciting a smug nod from his housemate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, pretty much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...it can swap...anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I said!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you imagine the fun we can have with this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to imagine it, I've BEEN having fun with it.

And what was funny was...he didn't feel weird feeling himself up in front of his current body's real owner. \"Okay, I'm swapping us back!\" Louisa informed Greg, before reversing the process. Greg's vision disppeared again momentarily and then came back, and he was relieved...and at the same time disappointed to be back in his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I was enjoying that\" he mumbled, feigning a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, my body isn't exactly stunning, we can get you a better one I'm sure\" Louisa smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we look outside for some 'guinea pigs'?\" Greg suggested with a grin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I slipped the band into her pocket while she wasn't looking, and then Louisa used a special function on the remote to absorb her into it. I don't know why she was going along with it, but she said she could fix everything with the push of a button, so I wasn't complaining. \"Let's wait until we get back to the apartment to morph you\" She morphs you the second you walk in the door.

He slowly looked down, nervous as to what the device had done to him. His view of his feet was blocked off by two mounds of flesh encased in a securely fitting sports bra. He gingerly reached up and pressed his new breasts with his manicured hands. He closed his eyes tightly and opened them again half hoping, half expecting to see his own body when he did so. But he wasn't dreaming, he actually had the body of a curvaceous woman who had clearly been in the middle of working out, she was wearing (or rather he was now wearing) a blue tracksuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're enjoying your new body!\" Louisa remarked laughing at the fact Greg's face was bright red and that he was using his new feminine hands to feel every curve of his sexy body. Greg looked up quickly removing his hands from his tight behind, forgetting he was in the company of his Spanish flat-mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What! I was just ... y-you know... feeling how different it was from my body! What the hell did you do by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd let you have Jill's body since you seem to be so interested in it,\" she explained trying to stifle her laughter. She was referring to how Greg often starred at the American's figure whenever she entered the same room as him. \"Why don't you see how you look in the mirror?\" she said indicating towards the one that hung by her wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg, rather eager to see exactly what had been done to him, shifted awkwardly in front of Louisa's mirror finding the new proportions of his body difficult to get used to. His reflection was interesting to say the least. He indeed had the body of the fitness fanatic Jill, beads of sweat forming on her body indicating that she had been working out. What was perhaps even more bizarre was the fact he had retained his own head and neck, his unshaven face and short scruffy hair looking out of place on Jill's womanly body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird huh?\" Louisa chortled, getting off her bed and stepping behind the bemused Brit. \"Why don't you have a go at using the device? As you can already see (and feel) it has the power to swap things from one person to another. It even changes reality so fit the changes made and only people wearing a wristband can tell that something has happened. They're water-proof so don't worry about taking it off when you shower. It's pretty self explanatory, just select the people you want to change and what you want to swap and fire away! I've already saved a few names in there if you're unsure who to pick.\" She handed the iPhone like device to him before sitting back down on her bed. \"Why don't you make a change to me or something? Oh, and you can reset the change to yourself if you want, don't worry the device will stay with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked down at the screen of the 'remote' trying to ignore the slender fingers that held it considering what he should do. He really wanted to get his body back, as cool as it was having Jill's voluptuous figure it was hard to control the constant urge to 'play' with himself. Then again it was pretty awesome, he had always wondered what it would be like to have a woman's body and you couldn't get a more womanly body that Jill's. He examined the available options before making his decision.</span></div></div>",

As his vision returned he felt the same rush of adrenaline and as he looked down he was greeted by his own body, although it felt a bit stiffer and considerably sweatier than it was before the change. Jill must have been exercising during the change and continued even with Greg's body. Even though they had only swapped for a few minutes or so he could feel the effects of her workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn that Jill sure pushes herself hard, or maybe I'm just out of shape!\" Louisa didn't seem to be listening to Greg and looked a little disappointed, perhaps because he had changed her swap back immediately. \"Hey ... so should I do a swap or something like you said then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why don't you use one of the other options and see how they work, you probably shouldn't use the ones that appear in orange as they haven't been completely finished yet. Oh and make sure you do it on me, I haven't actually seen what it's like yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked down at the device and scrolled through the options, there several marked in orange and about the same amount in white. He flicked between two options, either a mind swap or a head swap. He had guessed that Louisa had done a body swap on him with Jill as they had swapped only their bodies, head swap must swap peoples heads around and mind swap must mean that they completely bodies. Greg wondered whether a mind swap would be a good idea as that would probably mean Louisa would be transported to the persons body and vice versa meaning he would be left with someone very confused in Louisa's body with him and Louisa somewhere else, just a head swap would be safer then. Just as he was about to select the head swap he heard the door to their flat open, that must be Mimi coming back from her shopping ... which would mean he could swap Louisa's mind with hers and they'd be in the same building meaning less confusion! This seemed way more interesting than just a head swap, so he quickly entered Louisa and Mimi into the device before tapping accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now familiar piercing white light filled his eyes but this time there was no blackness, the room just came back into view. In front of him stood a very confused Louisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I in Loussy's room with you Greggy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg suppressed his laughter, hearing Louisa speak exactly like her Japanese housemate was pretty weird, the fact she used the silly nicknames that Mimi had for everyone just added to the amusement. Before Greg could come up with an explanation Mimi had pushed her way passed him and had let herself out of the door. For a young Japanese girl she had surprisingly bad manners. Greg turned to follow her out of the room and found her stood in the centre of the room talking to someone, it looked as though it was...</span></div></div>",

In fact he didn't even miss his penis, that's how fine a fit it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He gave his feminine ass another squeeze, before he remembered that Louisa was still watching him.  'Oh right,' she wanted him to do something to her.  But what were his choices again?  He ran his thin fingers with arched nails, across the screen, there was Louisa's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Now what?\"  He asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  There was his own name too! Now there was a pattern forming in his own mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He could swap something of his own with Louisa.  Maybe Louisa would like to try his penis?  Greg casually began the process... but he couldn't even FIND his own penis in the interface.  Greg frantically began really thoroughly searching the interface for his penis... but he didn't have one according to this machine.  Where did it go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Suddenly feeling an intense sense of loss, Greg looked down at his own flat feminine crotch.  According to the machine Greg had never been male.  This female vagina that was there now, was all that had ever been there, now and forever more.  Maybe he could borrow somebody else's... maybe Jill's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After all this was Jill's crotch between Jill's legs....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, of course!\"  Jill had his own penis, which is why he couldn't find it in his own section of the machines interface.  He sighed with relief.  Now, he could get it back, as he was really missing it... now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He tried imagining his own penis between Jill's legs, well, between his own legs now, and he just got a sense of not belonging.  Strangely he didn't get that feeling when he imagined it between Louisa's legs.  Maybe just knowing, where it was, would be enough...  yes, he could trust Louisa, with his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What's taking so long?\" a concerned Louisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It's just this interface, it takes some getting used to, but I'm on it now.  Prepare yourself for a surprise!\"  Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg found his penis between Jill's legs where he expected it to be and he swapped it for Louisa's vagina, then when the confirm screen came up, he asked her if she was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"As ready as I'll ever be... don't worry, I trust you!  Okay, give it your best shot!\"  Louisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg just touched the screen, as he wasn't really sure... that he was doing the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Then there was the strong white light beam that shot out of the machine and into Louisa, and then when Greg opened his eyes again, Louisa was just adjusting her jeans, as the crotch had become strangely tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  This was actually more fun than he'd given it credit for.  He wandered what else he could swap with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oi, you've had your turn... now hand it over, girlie Greg, as I want a go!\"  Louisa sternly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Does Greg hand it over?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Or does he try to sneak another go, while she is... not totally paying attention to him?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was wearing her usual running clothes, a pair of black joggers and a grey spaghetti string vest. Greg's jaw dropped in amazement. He knew that Louisa's dad was an inventor but had supposed that he just worked for a company like Dyson. It seemed as though, however, as the device's effects proved, that her old man was a little more than a run-of-the-mill brain box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty amazing, huh?\" Jill said, a smug grin on her supermodel like face.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened? I mean you... you teleported and swapped positions with Louisa right?!\" Greg said bemused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even better than that. I am Louisa! I swapped bodies with Jill. So she has mine right now, though she and everyone else in the world think that she's always had my body and vice versa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Greg said, still completely baffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The device!\" Louisa said shaking the smartphone like object. \"It has the power to swap things from one person to another. It even changes reality to fit the changes made and only people wearing a wristband can tell that something has happened. They're even water-proof so don't worry about taking it off when you shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg pulled back one of his wristbands revealing the slimmer one that he had taken from the package left on the kitchen table. \"So only me and you know that anything is different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So everyone thinks that you've always looked like that,\" Greg said indicating to Jill's athletic body. Louisa nodded before looking down at her new form for the first time, suddenly realising how new everything felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wow this feels... different,\" Louisa said as she dropped the device gently onto her bed and began feeling every inch of her new form. \"Everything feels so firm and toned!\" she said in delight as she gripped her new buttocks and \u00a0ran her fingers down one of her now well toned thighs. Turning to face her body-length mirror to get a better view of her transformation, Louisa squeezed Jill's (now her own) sizeable breasts, a wicked smile spreading across her borrowed face. \"I could definitely get used to having these!\" she squealed in delight seeming to forget that she wasn't alone in the room.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg coughed politely, Louisa spinning around quickly and dropping her hands away in embarrassment, her face going a shade of crimson. \"Oh, sorry... I guess I got a little carried away,\" she muttered slightly flustered from the interruption of her exploration. \"It's just being in her body. It feels so different that I'm a little overwhelmed!\" It was true, the difference between her own body and Jill's was great, the two being almost polar opposites of one another. Not only was Jill much taller than Louisa, her body was almost like that of an Olympic athlete; though you couldn't accuse her of being unfeminine, her impressive bust being a testament to this. Jill's face was also a little more striking than Louisa's and this coupled with the former's silky blonde hair meant that the Spaniard faded into the background whilst the American was often centre of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had stood in silence facing each other for quite some time. Suddenly noticing the ominous awkwardness, Greg made it his business to say something. \"Uh, it's funny, I'd never noticed how tall Ji-\" Seemingly within an instant Louisa had closed the short distance between the two of them, pressing herself against her housemate's chest. Before he could even take a breath, Greg's lips were met by Louisa's, her hands pulling the two of them together in this rushed and rather one sided embrace. As soon as it had started, the kiss ended, Louisa pushing herself away and going red with embarrassment though it could have equally been from arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, Greg, I don't know why I did that,\" Louisa said hurriedly. \"Maybe it's because I'm in Jill's body or it's a side effect of the device, but for some reason I feel so... so...\" Louisa trailed off, turning away as if ashamed by what she was thinking and about to say.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine. I mean you're not exactly yourself and we don't know what this device really does,\" Greg said still a little shell shocked, though he rather enjoyed the kiss even if it was only a rushed smooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Louisa replied quickly, turning to face Greg once more, \"I'm not myself. I'm Jill the sexy American athlete. And I'm alone with my dashing British housemate Greg who I've lusted for since the day I first met him.\" An increasingly familiar smile spread it's way across Louisa's face as she crept towards her prey. Greg backed away slowly, more than a little confused at his housemate's sudden change in behaviour.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Greggy, don't tell me you're intimidated by a sexually aggressive woman?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Of course I'm not Lou- Jill,\" Greg said a little unsteadily correcting himself, deciding to play along with Louisa's game. He wasn't exactly going to discourage attention from the girl of his dreams, well at least someone inside the body of the girl of his dreams. Besides, he had always got along well with Louisa and considered her to be one of his closer friends at university. He had even once drunkenly declared that she was like a sister to him which, as he remembered, hadn't gone down to well with her. He had even considered asking her out, but had decided against it, mainly because he had already referred to her as sister like. Perhaps now was his chance to start a relationship with her, with the device allowing the two of them to really get to know each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's mind fizzed with ideas, but right now he decided it would be best to just concentrate on the matter in hand. A little more confidently, he stroked a hand across Louisa's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no,\" Louisa tutted pulling away his hand firmly, \"let me take the lead.\" Pushing him roughly against the wall, she kissed him, Greg eagerly receiving her advances, their tongues roughly swirling in unison. Louisa's hands grasped all over her housemate's body, clutching from his hair to his hips as they continued to embrace. Suddenly she shot her hand down Greg's jeans and boxers before she grasped his hardening member causing him to jolt back in surprise.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm having the desired effect on your little friend,\" Louisa said in a sultry tone. Slowly, she made her way down her housemate's abdomen, before finally reaching his belt. \"Let's see what you have for me,\" she said with wink. As her hands worked on his buckle and zipper, Greg suddenly grew nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jill...I mean-\" a delicate finger quietened Greg.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep quiet and relax,\" Louisa ordered as she quickly hooked her fingers into his jeans and boxers, sliding them both below his knees and freeing his erection. \"My my, aren't you happy to see me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a salacious smile, she opened her mouth and ran her tongue slowly up the underside of her housemate's cock, licking it's full extent and exploring the hole at his tip. Greg gasped and shuddered with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... good at this,\" he said shuddering with pleasure, looking down at Louisa with something very close to awe. The site of the girl he had lusted after since he first laid eyes on her caressing his member with her tongue was almost too much, but he knew he had to hold back to fully enjoy what was in store. The moment was perhaps even more erotic knowing that it was in fact Louisa working Jill's body, his Spanish housemate was truly a dark horse and it seemed as though having someone else's body had unlocked her inner minx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final flick at the tip, Louisa withdrew her tongue. \"It's about to get a whole lot better.\" Without any further talk, she bent down and wrapped her lips around his length. Greg threw his head back, hands clenching at his sides as his housemate slid her hot mouth up and down on him. Louisa relaxed as she got to the base, and then sucked hard as she drew back toward the tip, her cheeks contracting as she pulled on his flesh. After countless minutes of teasing, Louisa began to pick up the pace working ever harder, feeling the pressure building in Greg's rock hard shaft until she heard him panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm...,\" he got out between breaths. \"I'm gonna...I think I'm gonna\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let it go,\" Louisa replied, pulling her lips off him and blowing gently on the tip. \"I'll take it all.\" She immediately took him back into her mouth, as deep as he would go, and sucked as hard as she could. As her housemate twisted back and forth against her bedroom wall, Louisa caressed his shaft, feeling his frantic pulse against her tongue. Finally, Greg cried out and burst in her mouth, painting the back of her throat with jets of hot semen. Louisa kept sucking until she was sure he was done, and then pulled back, releasing his cock with a soft pop, and tilting her head up so he could see her throat as she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now wasn't that worth the wait?\" Louisa said, an impish grin spread across her borrowed face. As she began to get back to her feet she suddenly froze titling her head to one side as if trying to hear something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up? Do you-\" Greg stopped dead as he heard what his housemate was listening out for. The door to their flat had been opened and someone was walking down the hallway towards Louisa's room! In a flash Greg pulled up his trousers and dived underneath the bed just as the bedroom door was swung open. Louisa attempted to act as casually as she could with her unfamiliar body as she greeted who had entered.</span></div></div>",

Is he not with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not, why would he be in my room?\" Louisa said defensively. She paused for a moment realising she was acting suspiciously despite trying her best not to. \"I mean, he's not even in the flat. I think he went to the library to get a book or something,\" she finished hoping that would be enough to satisfy her. \"Do you want to talk to him about something urgently then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, why do you say that?\" Mimi said, a little unsure of what Louisa was getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean you don't normally just walk into someone else's room without knocking without a good reason,\" Louisa said now growing more confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry,\" Mimi gasped putting a hand to her mouth in embarrassment. \"I didn't mean to enter so rudely, but it's just I...,\" she tailed off weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought I heard Greg cry out in pain so I rushed in. Honestly I wouldn't dare intrude if I didn't have a good reason for doing so.\" Mimi said, her face a picture of sincerity. Louisa had to stop herself from smirking. The Japanese girl had heard right after all, though it was a cry of pleasure rather than pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it was someone from next door,\" Louisa added after composing herself, \"the walls are a little on the thin side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that must be it!\" Mimi gasped, glad at the lifeline she was thrown. Both Louisa and Greg, who had been shifting uneasily, still underneath the bed, sighed inwardly in relief that she had bought the lie. The room fell into an awkward silence until Mimi noticed she was fidgeting on the spot. \"I guess I'll get going then,\" she said quickly. \"I still have things to buy, I only came here to drop some bags off,\" she added, turning to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her footsteps echoed down the hallway, Louisa flopped down onto her bed with a sigh. After hearing the front door open and close, Greg scuttled out from underneath, doing up his trousers and fastening his belt. Louisa laughed at his still reddened face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he said smirking. \"I couldn't exactly zip up under there. She might have heard me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not that, you idiot,\" she retorted fidgeting to one side and picking up the remote, holding it above her head. \"Didn't you find it exhilarating? She didn't notice it at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Greg said confused. \"She said she thought she heard me scream! She bloody well noticed something, but thankfully you convinced her it wasn't me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Louisa shouted, exasperated by her partner in crime's apparent lack of understanding. \"I meant the fact that I'm in Jill's body. She thinks I've always been this way.\" Louisa shook the device in Greg's face. \"With this we can be anyone we want and no one will notice a thing! We can live out our wildest fantasies!\" She closed her mouth quickly, wishing she hadn't said that last sentence but smiled a little after seeing the sudden look of realisation on Greg's face. \"But we should probably be more careful not to get carried away. We don't want people thinking we're sex mad exhibitionists,\" she said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You make it sound like it was my fault! You're the one who had my trousers round my ankles before I had a chance to blink,\" Greg said indignantly. Louisa could only laugh at her housemate's reaction. She had been more than a little impulsive, but it had been worth it. She had spent too long on the sidelines watching on whilst others had all the fun. It was her time to seize the initiative and do what she wanted to and sharing the power of her father's device with Greg made her feel alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Greg,\" she conceded. \"Next time I'll let you know exactly what I'm doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... great,\" he said pleased that they had reached an agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we talk about what we should use it for next tomorrow.

Despite spending most of the day together the two housemates hadn't even mentioned using the device until this moment. In the morning their conversation focused on their up and coming lecture and seminar making Greg begin to believe that he might have dreamt yesterday's exploits. Louisa had returned to her own body, but her new found confidence was still there. The two had worked with each other during the afternoon's seminar and Greg couldn't help but notice how much more flirtatious Louisa was towards him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Greg said more than a little pleased that she had mentioned the remote. \"But there's something else I want to talk to you about first.\" He was more than a little nervous about bringing up the topic, but he knew he couldn't avoid it forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Louisa said expectantly. \"What about?\" She said pulling Greg to face her as they stopped outside the entrance to their apartment's block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we...,\" Greg trailed off, suddenly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg inhaled deeply and took the plunge.\"Are we kind of going out now, like boyfriend and girlfriend. I mean yesterday you, well, you know and today you kept giving me that look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been good friends for quite some time and I know I've thought about us being a little bit more than that for a while and I suspected you did as well but I never had the confidence to say anything. But after you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Greg!\" Louisa shouted exasperated. \"Yes we are going out together.\" She blushed a little, realising she had spoken so loudly. \"I mean, we are if you want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, of course I would,\" Greg replied shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled,\" Louisa said grabbing his arm and pulling herself towards him. \"We are officially an item. Now why don't we go inside and see what else we can do with that remote!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir feet hardly touched the ground as they both rushed up the stairs giddy with excitement. After unlocking the door that led onto their hallway Louisa sped towards her room, Greg stopping outside the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just going to get a glass of water, I'll be with you in a second,\" he said. In the kitchen he found that he was not alone.</span></div></div>",

His mother raised a disapproving eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Gregory, is that anyway to greet your mother?\" she said folding her arms. \"But if you must know that delightful Asian girl let me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, I'm just a little surprised to see you,\" Greg said looking down at the ground, unable to meet his mother's gaze. She was somewhat of an expert at staring people down being a secondary school science teacher.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's half term at the moment and, since I have only a few sets of homework to mark, I thought I'd pay you a visit just to see how you were getting along away from home. And looking around here I can't say I'm too impressed,\" she said indicating the pig sty that was the flat's communal kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not always like this. We just had a party a few days ago and no ones really got round to tidying up,\" Greg said halfheartedly, knowing it wouldn't appease his mother, but willing to try anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is part of the problem, Greg. You spend all night drinking and partying and not enough time studying and getting enough sleep. I wouldn't mind betting you haven't had a decent meal since you were last at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a curry last week,\" Greg said pathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's mum rolled her eyes in response, knowing he was clutching at straws, but before she could continue her lecture Louisa came bustling into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Greg, what shall we do-,\" Louisa said stopping herself mid sentence and skidding to a halt. \"Oh s-sorry, I didn't see you there,\" she said suddenly very shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Louisa, I'm Greg's mother, Samantha Perry,\" Greg's mother said remaining in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you Mrs Perry,\" Louisa replied nervously almost curtsying but stopping halfway. The room fell silent for a while, Samantha almost seeming to be appraising Louisa in her mind. Whatever conclusion she came to she gave the Spanish girl a brief smile before getting up from her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I must get going. There are still a few things I need to sort out at the hotel, but I will be back here by 5:30 so we can make dinner together. You need a good, healthy meal and it seems as though I can't trust you to make one for yourself. Besides it will give us time to have a proper conversation,\" Samantha paused for a second as if considering something, turning to face Louisa. \"Louisa, would you like to join us for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... erm, I need to go to the library to study so I'm afraid I can't,\" she replied pressing her index fingers together timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a shame, but I'm glad to hear you're studying, unlike some people I can think of,\" Samantha said shooting Greg a disappointed glance. \"I'll see you in just over an hour then, Greg. Hopefully that will give you enough time to make this room fit for preparing food in. I'll see myself out,\" she said leaving the room. As the front door opened and shut the two teenagers exhaled deeply as the tension dissipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother's very...,\" Louisa said after a while letting her words trail off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Overbearing?\" Greg offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful,\" Louisa said, smiling at the look on her housemate's face as she finished her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Greg said blushing. He had never tried to deny this fact, but it was always awkward when someone drew attention to it. The majority of his friends (specifically his male ones) had at one time or another commented on his mother's good looks much to his chagrin, some even labelling her as a milf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, she sort of reminds me of Sienna Guillory,\" Louisa said with a wicked smile. All four members of the flat had recently completed a Resident Evil movie marathon and Greg had made it apparent that he was a fan of Ms Guillory in the role of Jill Valentine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Greg spluttered going bright red. \"I don't know what you're talking about. My mum's cheekbones aren't nearly as pronounced as hers and her eyes are much darker. Sure her facial structure, nose and complexion are comparable, but their bodies are completely different. Sienna Guillory has quite a petite figure whereas my mum is more curvaceous,\" he finished, coming up for air.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever you say,\" Louisa said still grinning like a Cheshire cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-anyway, why did you say you're going to the library to study? I thought we were staying here for the evening,\" Greg said hoping to get off the topic of his mother's beauty. Louisa obliged him, thinking he had done enough squirming, for the moment anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, I was thinking...\"\u00a0</span></div></div>",

I thought the remote could only swap people's bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smug grin spread across the Spanish girl's face. \"You don't even know half of this devices power,\" she said shaking it in her hand. \"I'll just make a life and body swap, taking the place of your mother. I'll even have all of her memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, what will happen to your own body and life? I mean, will my mum know she's you?\" Greg asked still getting to grips with the proposed swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. She's not wearing a wristband so she'll be completely unaware of any change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she'll thinks she's always been you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Louisa said now a little unsure of the implications of the life swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the remote? Will it follow you to my mum's body or stay with your own?\" Greg said increasingly worried that something might go wrong. \"There are so many things we have to consider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of losing confidence in her plan, Louisa's face brightened. \"But isn't that part of the fun? Not knowing exactly what will happen and finding out on the way. My father's invention is more powerful than it looks and does much more than we've already seen. There's no point having it if we're not going to keep pushing the boundaries of what we think is 'safe' to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smiled, impassioned by Louisa words. \"Ok, I see your point.\" He moved across to the sink which was overflowing with unwashed cutlery and cooking utensils and began filling it with hot water, squeezing in a good measure of washing up liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Louisa said, slightly confused as to what her housemate was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Washing up and then I'll clean the rest of the room. I need this place tidy for when my m-,\" he stopped correcting himself, \"for when you come round for dinner.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa laughed, pleased Greg was already starting the role play, though she suspected he wasn't doing it intentionally. She pulled out the towel from its place on the oven door handle and began drying a plate that Greg had already washed up. He turned to look at her surprised she was still there. \"Aren't you going to make the swap now?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd help you clean up first. I'll swap places with your mother at 5:00 which should give me some time to get to grips with being her so I can properly take on the role of Samantha Perry.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Greg said shocked. \"You didn't say anything about taking on her 'role.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Greg, where's your sense of adventure?\" Louisa said wickedly.\u00a0\"I promise not to lecture you too much.\"</span></div></div>",

I hope you enjoy the meal with your mother,\" she said turning to leave the kitchen, \"I'm sure it will be an eye opening experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg gulped as the current Louisa left the flat. It was going to be an interesting evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours, Greg finally heard the knock at the door he was dreading. Getting up from his seat, he slowly left the kitchen and walked down the hallway to the flat's entrance. He stood in front of the door and took a deep breath before opening it wearing the best smile he could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello mum, come on in.\" Greg's jaw dropped and he struggled to stop his eyes from popping out from their sockets. His mother was never one for dressing conservatively, but what Louisa had chosen to wear left little to the imagination. She wore a black and blue striped, low cut summer dress that wouldn't have looked out of place on the red carpet of a Hollywood movie premiere. Her feet were encased in a pair of black, open toed high heels and her hair was tied up in a loose bun. His mum looked stunning, there was no other way to put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought everything we'll need to make my patented caesar salad,\" Louisa said proffering two heavily laden bags. \"Would you be a dear and bring them into the kitchen for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few seconds for the words to reach Greg's brain. He was still trying to take in the outfit Louisa had dressed his mother's body in. \"Oh, yes, of course,\" he said taking them, his face bright red. Greg stood there as if brain dead, his mind still on his mother's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to take them into the kitchen?\" Louisa said coyly, rather pleased with how things were going so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Greg replied turning quickly, leading her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can help me make them, there's very little cooking involved,\" she said following him. As Greg placed the bags on the table, Louisa washed her hands, instructing him to do the same. \"Right, I'll make the crotons whilst you can coddle the egg,\" she said motherly, very much enjoying her new role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began their respective work, a light conversation starting between them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You did a very good job of cleaning in here, it's almost unrecognisable,\" Louisa said as she cut the baguette into cubes. \"Did that pretty Spanish girl help you?\" she continued idly, resisting the urge to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg laughed a little, seeing what she was doing. \"She did actually. We make a pretty good team together sometimes,\" he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is good to hear. You know, I think the two of you would go well together. Or maybe you're already going out,\" Louisa said not turning away from her work, coating the crotons in oil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We kind of are actually,\" Greg said smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really! You don't sound too sure about yourself,\" Louisa said putting the finished crotons onto a baking tray and sliding it into the oven. \"Have you only recently become a couple then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that,\" Greg answered smugly, removing the egg from the heat to let it cool and then moving on to chopping the lettuce into long strips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Louisa said as if considering it deeply. \"How far have you got with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Greg said blushing, it was rather unsettling hearing his mother ask about his sex life, even though he knew it wasn't actually her asking the questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa laughed at Greg's reaction. \"I was just kidding sweetie. I'm glad for you. You two seem like a good match for each other,\" she said winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe salads were finished in no time at all as the two chatted away casually, Louisa using Samantha's memories to full effect. To any observer it would seem she was Greg's mother. In fact, by the time the two of them had sat down to eat, Greg had almost forgotten that he was dining with Louisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you still have a taste for my secret blend of salad oil,\" Louisa commented as Greg slathered his salad in yet more of the dressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only thing that makes eating a salad worthwhile,\" he said before eating another mouthful.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a complement,\" Louisa said, happy to take the credit, she was Samantha Perry now after all. \"It's always pleasing for a mother to hear that she's satisfying her son,\" she added, her tone more than a little flirtatious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum!\" Greg said squirming under Louisa's lustful gaze, which was somewhat unnerving considering she was wearing his mother's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Louisa said innocently, batting her eyelashes. \"Is mummy making you feel uncomfortable?\" she asked leaning across the table, giving Greg a perfect view of his mother's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not...,\" he answered as casually as he could whilst turning away. Greg tried to go back to eating his salad, but ending up dropping his fork, sending it skittering under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smoothly done,\" Louisa said, giggling.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the sarcastic comment, Greg backed up his chair and ducked under the table to retrieve his fork. As he found it and picked it up, his eyes inadvertently wandered upwards, coming level with Louisa's (his mother's) uncrossed legs. The dress was short enough and her legs were wide enough apart that he could quite clearly see her neatly trimmed pussy. She wasn't wearing any underwear! Greg banged his head on the underside of the table as he tried to retreat back onto his chair as quickly as possible.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch, that sounded painful,\" Louisa said sounding concerned though it was apparent she was a little pleased with the reaction she had garnered. \"Want me to kiss it better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine,\" Greg said indignantly as he tried to simultaneously rinse off his fork and rub his head. He couldn't quite believe the way Louisa was acting as his mother, but then again, part of him found the whole thing somewhat... erotic. But it was his mother's body for goodness sake! He shouldn't be feeling this way towards her.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's mind span as he returned to the table to finish his meal. Part of him wanted to confront Louisa on the way she was acting. But then again, there was another part of him (the more southerly part) that wanted to carry on and see where the evening took them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The evening had continued on relatively normally since the incident under the table. Greg and Louisa had finished their salads and had begun to wash up. The conversation was fairly ordinary and Greg was pleased that he had decided not to mention Louisa's flirtatious behaviour... and lack underwear. He began to consider that it had been an innocent mistake and that Louisa had simply forgotten to wear any panties... No, she wasn't the type of person to make an error like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaydreaming a little whilst waiting for the next item to dry up, Greg hardly noticed the splash of water across his arm. He looked up at Louisa, but only saw her wiping at a plate with the dishcloth. It must have been a mistake. Staring out of the window once more, Greg began to get lost in his thoughts. He wasn't lost for long though as a larger splash hit him across the chest, soaking the front of his t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you do that for?\" he said dabbing at himself with the tea towel. \"You've got me soaking wet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a baby,\" Louisa said smiling. \"A little bit of water isn't going to hurt you. Come on, once you've dried up this plate we've only got the cutlery to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg returned to Louisa's side cautiously and began drying up the plate, sulking a little. Once it was dry he returned it to its place in the cupboard, closing the door. \"You know, we cou-,\" his sentence was cut short as a cupful of water slapped him in the face. Louisa's jaw dropped and she covered her mouth with her hand before bursting out laughing. \"That's it, you're gonna get it now!\" Greg said running over to the sink as Louisa ducked to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No come on, I was only joking! This dress is wor-.\" It was Louisa's turn to be stopped mid sentence as half a cupful of cold water hit her across the chest. Greg burst out laughing at the look of horror on his mother's face. \"That was freezing cold! I used bloody warm water, you turd!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing his mother's voice insult him like that only made him laugh even more as Louisa dashed for the sink whilst Greg had already refilled his cup and was trying to take shelter behind a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began a full scale water fight, trying to soak one another whilst avoiding being soaked themselves. After several minutes of flinging water around the room at one another, the pair were completely drenched and panting for a truce, their clothes sticking heavily to their bodies. Louisa was particularly wet, her erect nipples making clear indents through her summer dress which clung to her breasts. She noticed the look that Greg was giving his mother's body and decided to pounce.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" she said coyly, \"looks like you've gotten me all wet. I'd better take of this soggy thing, I don't want to catch a cold.\" Louisa slid off her waterlogged dress, dropping it past her legs and onto the floor. \"You had better take your clothes off as well, sweetie. Mummy doesn't want you to get sick,\" she purred, slinking over towards a paralysed Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowerless to her advances, he stood there, only moving to aid her remove his clothes. Within seconds he was also naked and becoming increasingly turned on by his new mother. Despite his misgivings for Louisa's plan initially, Greg was suddenly enthralled by the possibilities and willing to follow her lead blindly. Louisa was more than happy to lead on. Bending over seductively, she reached down to pick up her dress, but stopped midway giving Greg a perfect view of his mother's glorious behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, is seeing mummy's arse turning you on, sweetie?\" Louisa said, gawping at Greg's rising member. \"Why don't you come over and put that thing to use?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You know I've never taken it in the arse before, not even for your father,\" Louisa said using his mother's memories to great effect. She reached back with one hand and pulled her arse open even more, exposing Greg's mum's red, horny hole to his eyes... and his cock. He may have been new to anal sex, but Greg had read somewhere about it and realized that it would be easier if there was some lubrication.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay like that, don't move,\" he said a little nervously, moving over to the kitchen table and grabbing the cruet of salad oil. Greg moved back behind Louisa and nestled his cock in the crack of her arse, then dribbled some of the oil between her checks and onto his cock. Louisa felt the cool oil on her hot skin. Greg put the cruet on the counter and rubbed the oil around with the head of his shaft. It was such a wonderful tease that Louisa arched her back and stuck his mother's arse out even more as she waited for her housemate to enter her. Even as hot as she was, she tensed when his cock started pressing against her sphincter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God Greggy,\" she breathed. \"Go slow at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe applied more pressure and Louisa felt her arsehole open to his entrance. She moved the hand on her arse to the counter in front of her and gripped it with both hands, moaning at the stretching she felt behind her as his shaft slowly made its way inside her rectum.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body's natural reaction was to tighten her sphincter muscles around Greg's shaft. There was something so special and erotic to Louisa in the thought of having her backside forced open like that by a throbbing member inside her; to have it actually happen to her drove her crazy.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at her partner she smiled. Greg's eyes were wide open and full of amazement at this new and exciting event. Louisa brushed her fair hair to one side so she could watch Greg's reaction as she pushed back against his cock and buried it further in her arse. She got another inch and there was no pain. She reached back and felt his cock, gauging how much was left. As full as she felt, there was still an inch or so left. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, mum,\" Greg exclaimed, feeling his mum's fingers on his root.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok sweetie,\" Louisa soothed. \"Just relax for now.\" She wanted all of him and she wanted him to last. She pushed inside her bowels to open her muscles, then pressed back more until she felt his thighs pressed against the firm globes of her arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg stared down as the remainder of his penis was consumed by his mother's beautiful behind until it was all the way inside. It wasn't as though he had dreamed and fantasized about sex with his mother, but now Louisa was in control of her body he found her unbelievably attractive. Not only was she a remarkably beautiful woman, she was also the woman who had birthed and raised him. And the things that Louisa was letting him do to her, it was an experience that was too perfect to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa let out a sultry moan and started slowly moving, sliding herself back and forth on his shaft. \"Oh God,\" she groaned. \"This feels...so good.\" Louisa herself had always wondered what having anal would feel like but had never had the confidence, or opportunity to satiate this desire, but with Greg she felt she could do anything. The added element that she was using his mother's body coupled with her newly acquired memories made it all the more enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum,\" Greg replied, eagerly continuing the roleplay. \"You have no idea how good it feels from my end. Your arse feels so incredibly tight.\" Greg brushed her silky dark blonde hair aside and grabbed onto her shoulders with both hands. He used his grip to hold her still and began to actively penetrate her arse, slowly filling her with long strokes as he watched in amazement where his cock disappeared between his mum's surprisingly firm cheeks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you like fucking your own mother's behind?\" She found it exciting to actually use those words. She was his submissive slut, bending over as he slowly but steadily rammed her with the long strokes of his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought burst into Louisa's head. She was his mother now wasn't she? She hadn't just swapped bodies with Samantha, but lives as well. Why should she submit to him? She suddenly felt the need to be in control; to assert her new found authority over 'her son'.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg stop!\" she commanded, delighting at the shock on his face as he ceased pumping into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" he asked, full of concern, almost convincing himself that his mother had somehow returned to control her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to sit in the chair,\" she directed him. He slid his cock out of her arse, leaving it feeling distinctly open and empty. He paused for a moment, looking down as her sphincter gaped in front of him, then moved to the chair and sat down, looking up into his mother's face expectantly. Louisa straightened up and walked over to him. She turned away from him and, standing between his legs, lowered herself back down onto his cock. There was a twinge of pain as his flared glans pushed through her sphincter again but the pleasure of being refilled was exquisite.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit,\" she exclaimed. \"That is so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering herself further, she sat impaled on his long cock. The addition of her weight drove it further into her arse than his earlier thrusting had. Placing her hands on his knees and leaning forward, she was able to slowly lift herself up off of him, feeling his long veined shaft coming out of her behind. That incredible sensation drew her eventual orgasm closer and she sank down, impaling herself on Greg's cock once more. She developed a rhythm as she moved up and down on him, increasing the pace.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she felt her orgasm approach, her arms and legs began to get tired. Louisa knew she was on the cusp of having an orgasm and the fatigue pushed her back from the climatic edge. She so desperately wanted this climax and it was starting to elude her.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum, I think...I'm going...to cum\" Greg panted. He reached his hands around and cupped her firm breasts, causing her to moan loudly. Just then Louisa felt his cock throb and shoot cum deep inside her bowels. As he did he squeezed at her breasts, pulling her tight to his chest, which was enough to catapult her into a huge orgasm. Tilting her head back, Louisa screamed in total ecstasy as wave after wave of earth shattering pleasure spread from her rectum throughout her entire body. Greg held her upright as she spasmed and shuddered in his lap, completely lost to the ravages of this incredible orgasm. Fluid shot from Louisa's pussy and dripped to the floor as she experienced a torturous satisfaction that she wished would last forever. There was a distant awareness of Greg's moans as he shot the last off his load into her arse, but it was the waves of her own orgasm that were the focus of her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very long time before Louisa could breathe normally. As her awareness to her surroundings grew, she found herself amazed at the quiet; her screaming had been so loud. Her wonderful son, she felt a strange eroticism in thinking of him as that, was still softly holding her breasts as he held her upright on his lap. Still trembling, she turned and brushed her long hair away from him. She looked into his handsome face and saw the pleasure that she had given him. Reaching out and pulling his face to hers, Louisa kissed Greg passionately for a few moments. When she released him, she tenderly wiped the sweat from his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See sweetie, spending time with your old mum isn't always that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg laughed a little as his penis slowly deflated in the recesses of him mother's behind. \"Yeah,\" he said grinning, \"I suppose that wasn't too bad.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After several minutes of holding one another, basking in the afterglow of their incestuous act, Greg and Louisa came to their senses, realising the mess they had left the kitchen in. It was almost seven o'clock and it wouldn't be long before their housemates returned to find mother and son naked in each others arms.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later and they had returned the room to normality; the floor mopped and the discarded clothes, which were far to wet to put back on, collected up and ready for laundry. Greg was wearing a fresh pair of jeans and a t shirt, but Louisa was forced to wear some of her own clothes, having nothing of Samantha's to hand. She was wearing a pair of black, tight fitting leggings, a loose t shirt and the high heels she had worn previously. Louisa was able squeeze into a pair of her own panties, but failed to fit Samantha's sizeable breasts into one of her bras, forced to make do without one, hence the loose t shirt. As she fidgeted in her new, less-than-a-perfect-fit outfit, Louisa couldn't help but notice the look Greg was giving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" she asked as she adjusted the top of her leggings. \"Do you think the jeans would look less conspicuous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No,\" Greg said looking away quickly. \"It's just... I've never seen you wear those leggings before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa frowned. \"Come on Greg, you're a terrible liar,\" she said folding her arms. \"What do you really want to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...,\" Greg said rubbing the back of his neck nervously. \"It's just, you've changed. I mean, aside from the whole fact that you're in my mum's body. You're so much more confident and forward than you were before you started using the remote. It's almost like you're a different person.\"\u00a0Louisa laughed at the irony of Greg's last sentence.\u00a0\"You know what I mean,\" he said indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not,\" Louisa said smiling. \"I'm the same person I've always been, no pun intended. It's just that I feel so much more confident with your mother's body. Maybe it's because I'm not myself or maybe it's something to do with the buzz I feel after using the remote, but whatever it is, it gives me the confidence to act upon my pent up sexual desires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg stood there for a moment in silence, contemplating what Louisa had just told him. In a way it made sense. But then again, why did she have to release these built up tension with him as his own mother! Greg's brain whirled as he thought of the repercussions of this evening's actions. He had just had sex, well anal sex anyway, with his mum. No he corrected himself. He had had sex with his new girlfriend who happened to be in the body of his mother after swapping lives with her using a miraculous device. Greg sighed knowing it made little difference. Though it was technically Louisa he had made love to, it was still really with his mum whatever way you put it.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it anyway?\" Greg asked, desperate to escape his train of thought. \"Being my mum, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\" Louisa replied within an instant. \"It feel completely different to when I just swapped bodies with Jill. I'm actually Samantha Perry! I'm still myself, of course, but I feel like I'm your mother as well. I have her memories, her thoughts, her emotions. You don't want to know what she was feeling about an hour ago!\" she added wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what happens when you swap back?\" Greg said starting to feel a little concerned. \"You just said you knew what she was thinking. Does that mean she'll remember what you did as her?!\"</span></div></div>",

We wouldn't be able to experiment as much if this wasn't the case and that wouldn't be any good for my father's testing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg let out a relieved sigh. The thought of his mum finding out what he had been doing to her, even if she believed that she was also implicit in the actions, was something altogether unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had some time to figure out how to do it last night, whilst I was thinking about what to use the remote for next,\" Louisa continued. \"It's relatively simple really. Once you've activated the memory changer setting it automatically replaces any memories of doing things that would be out of character with vague recollections of something more normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my mum will believe that we just had a normal evening preparing and eating dinner?\" Greg asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" she said nodding. \"I wouldn't have been so compliant to your sexual desires had there been no way to prevent your mother from recalling anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>My</i> sexual desires!\" Greg said aghast, shocked Louisa would suggest that he was the guilty party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Greg?\" Louisa said arching an eyebrow. \"It didn't exactly take too much convincing for you to have your way with mummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg desperately wanted to object to her comment, but knew he would be lying if he did. There was something about Louisa playing the part of his mother that he liked. A lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short period of silence was broken by the sound of the front door being opened. Greg and Louisa stood motionless, listening to try and gauge who had entered the flat. They didn't have enough time to guess as the intruder revealed herself to be the temporary Louisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello,\" she said with a little smile. \"What have you two been up to?\" The question was laced with sarcasm, making it apparent she had a fair idea of what had taken place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the-\" Greg started but was cut off immediately by the Louisa (the real one) in his mother's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is essentially me, Greg,\" she said. \"I don't think she knows exactly what happened, but she knows what I was thinking up until the swap and she can see that we've changed our clothes. She has enough evidence to suspect that we've done more than share dinner,\" Louisa finished with a flourish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are quite right, Miss Mendoza, or should that be Mrs Perry? You know yourself too well,\" the temporary Louisa said with a smile. \"However, there is something more urgent I have to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on,\" the original Louisa said, clearly enjoying the feeling of authority she was getting from the way her old body\u00a0talked to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't much time until both Mimi and Jill return to the flat, and it is my belief that they would find it odd to see you dressed in someone else's clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa looked down at herself, remembering that she had borrowed some of her own clothes as Samantha's had gotten soaked during their antics. \"Good point, I'll leave in a few minutes then,\" she said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temporary Louisa appeared to almost bow before leaving the room. Greg and Louisa looked at one another with raised eyebrows, continuing to be surprised by the remote's powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" Greg said after a few moments, \"Are you going to swap back now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up? You almost sound disappointed; like you want me to continue being your mother,\" Louisa said playfully, tickling Greg under his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he replied none to convincingly as he squirmed away from her tickling fingers. \"I was just asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

Despite finding it difficult to think about anything other than what Louisa had in store for him tomorrow, he eventually drifted off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning he was awoken by the buzzing of his phone alerting him that he had received a new text message. Groggily, he shifting himself over to his bedside table and picked it up, his brain slowly comprehending the message displayed on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll be over in 15 minutes. Be ready!' the message read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg shot out of bed and dashed to the kitchen to eat some sort of breakfast. His alarm was disabled on a Thursday, due to the fact he didn't have to go into campus, allowing him to sleep in until he naturally woke up. He had failed to set one in preparation for Louisa's visit and would have to try and get ready in what little time he had now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating a bowl of hurriedly poured cereal, he quickly shed his clothes and dived into the shower. Although speed was of the essence, he still took the time to ensure he was ready for what essentially was a date, even going so far as to put on a little aftershave. Greg was beginning to think he might manage to finish getting ready before Louisa arrived, but this hope was shattered when he heard a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening out, he hoped to hear it being answered by one of his housemates. After a while, it became clear he was alone and would have to answer it himself, wearing only a towel around his waist. Greg didn't really want to keep Louisa waiting and besides, she had seen him naked over the past few days and they were supposed to be going out now, weren't they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the bathroom, he walked down the hallway and eagerly opened the front door.</span></div></div>",

Greg started to panic, thinking perhaps Louisa had swapped back and this really was his mother! He automatically clutched at himself with his arms in a vain attempt to cover up more of his body and felt his face go bright red. Greg's heart began to settle as he saw his mother's face break into a smile and eventually laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love your little reaction's when you think it's really her!\" Louisa said between chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not funny...,\" Greg said sulkily, his cheeks still flushed with embarrassment, as she walked past him into the hallway. He couldn't help but notice what Louisa had dressed in as he closed the door. It wasn't too unlike what his mother would wear when teaching at the secondary school; a low cut, wine red blouse and a simple, black pencil skirt that stopped just above the knee. But somehow Greg was enchanted by it now, his mother's assets on show perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you just going to stand around all day in that towel or are you going to get dressed?\" Louisa said, hands on her hips, as Greg stood there gawping at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" he said coming to. \"Do you want to wait in the kitchen or something? I'll only be a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I come with you to your bedroom?\" Louisa said innocently. \"It's not like I haven't seen it all before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Greg said blushing. \"Suit yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering his room, Louisa sat on Greg's bed whilst he fished out some clothes from his wardrobe and chest-of-drawers. Turning to begin to put them on, he smiled awkwardly as Louisa appeared to watch him with interest.</span></div></div>",

Stumbling backwards in shock and throwing the clothes he was carrying on the bed, Greg noticed the look of lust painted across his mother's face. Instantly he felt himself hardening under Louisa's gaze, to which she arched a discerning eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's a little excited to be naked and alone with their own mother,\" she said getting off the bed and kneeling in front of him. Taking his cock in her hand, Louisa leaned forward to kiss it on the head. A sigh escaped from Greg as he looked down to see his mum's body on her knees before him. Louisa began to lick and nibble the very tip of his penis, his body tensing up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg couldn't believe the pleasure that Louisa was giving him again as she began running her lips and tongue across his long shaft, getting ever nearer to his sperm-laden testicles. He hadn't expected to be treated to this sort of contact so early in the day, but he wasn't exactly going to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa loved the taste of Greg's member. He had showered well this morning, and he smelled of lust and aftershave. His cock oozed precum against her face as her lips and tongue teased his swollen balls. She wanted to play with him until he couldn't take it anymore and would shove that beauty down her throat. Louisa had always fantasized about when a man took control, and wanted to be handled this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa felt she had teased Greg enough and decided to let him know she was ready. She reached up and pulled Greg's hands beneath her blouse and bra to his mother's ample but perky breasts, urging him to tease them. Then she opened her mouth, giving him the signal that it was okay to shove his erect penis into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg didn't know what he wanted more, to feel those tits, or to hold her head. So he compromised, putting his left hand behind his sexy mum's head, pulling Louisa to his cock. His right hand tweaked a nipple, causing her to writhe and moan as his cock entered her lips. Greg was so horny, he didn't know how long he'd actually last. So, urgency was of the utmost importance as he fed her his straining manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg forced his erection deeper into his mum's mouth, now hitting her tonsils and the entrance to her throat. Louisa looked up at his face, smiling as she urged him to go deeper. She wrapped her arms around his legs, pulling him tighter to her. Greg's cock made an impression in his mother's throat, yet another inch slipped deeper.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow mum, I can't believe you are already sucking my cock! I guess it was worth rushing to answer the door,\" Greg laughed. It was almost frightening how sexually charged his housemate, now girlfriend/mother had become since using the remote. Whether the device had caused the change or if it had simply allowed Louisa to express her sexual desires was unknown to Greg, and frankly he was a little to occupied to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last push, his balls slapped his mother's chin, Louisa taking every inch of his large cock. She continued to look up at him, and she seemed to have no trouble handling the amount Greg was forcing down her throat. Then she looked up at him pleading to begin to use her mouth like a pussy. Greg saw the lust in her eyes and began to slide his dick in and out now. Louisa took deep breaths every time he pulled out to the tip, before he plunged fully back down her throat. They soon had a perfect rhythm going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg loved the tightness of his mother's mouth, and he needed to cum badly. The excitement of a blowjob from his own mother was just too much to handle.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa could feel the cock in her mouth enlarging even more, and she prepared herself for the cum-load Greg would give her. With one final push, the first jet of sperm shot forth from his wonderful cock, and she gulped it down before it was followed by another and another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-god mum, you are like a d-damn vacuum cleaner! You're much better than J-Jill was!\" Greg joked whilst quaking from his orgasm in Louisa's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now just had the head of his dick in her mouth, tasting his delicious morning offering. Finally, with Greg spent, she reluctantly let his deflating manhood drop from her mouth, licking the last few remaining drops from her lips.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Louisa said standing up, \"why don't you finish getting dressed and we can go into town.\"</span></div></div>",

As Louisa got to her feet she nonechelantly wiped a bit of cum from her bottom lip and licked it off her finger. \"Hmm, breakfast should always taste like this, shouldn't it sweetie?\" she smiled, teasing Greg again. But Greg was feeling too damned horny and for the time being at least...sexually satisfied to be angry with her. And anyway...how could he be angry at his own mother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hurry up and get dressed\" Louisa grinned, as she fixed her dark blonde hair and paced the room in Samantha's heels. As Greg went away to get dressed, Louisa then checked her wine-red blouse for any spots of cum, but it appeared she had swallowed every drop. She stood there, her manicured hands roaming over her new, 39-year old body, she squeezed her ample breasts and moaned a little, Louisa had never felt this horny before, not even in Jill's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few minutes later, Greg returned, wearing his usual jeans and t-shirt outfit, along with a pair of 'worn' trainers/sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For shopping? Really?\" Louisa muttered in his mother's voice, arching an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sorry mum, my tux is still at the dry cleaners!\" Greg grumbled sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drop the tone young man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Louisa smiled, \"would you like to do a little shopping with your mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...what kind?\" Greg answered, not seeming too enthused. He had always hated having to go shopping, since his mother had spent most of the time buying herself new clothes, and it was no fun sitting outside a changing room for an hour twiddling his thumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mummy's credit card = new clothes, etc.\" Louisa grinned, as she flashed Samantha's visa card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...thought so\" Greg said, feigning a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...with this little marvel...\" Louisa then smiled, waving the remote at Greg...\"we can do more than just shop for clothes, and just think...the shopping mall will be full of people today, all the shops have a sale on\" she continued. The reappearance of the miraculous remote instantly changed Greg mood from one of reluctance...to eagerness. And as he flashed back to just a few moments ago...when Louisa had his mother's lips wrapped around his cock...he began to harden again. He now had a relationship with his 'mother' that no son should have with a parent, a very 'intimate' relationship indeed. He couldn't help but admire his mother's svelte form, which Louisa wore so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, lets go 'shopping' mum\" Greg eventually grinned, getting excited at the thought of what they could get up to at the mall.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Any benefit on your part is purely coincidental. You should consider yourself lucky,\" Louisa said sassily. \"So how about you stop worrying and just enjoy the ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Greg said almost reluctantly, though it was clear he was pleased with Louisa's response. \"Shall we go and catch a film then?\" he said undoing his seatbelt.</span></div></div>",

Why would he think such a thing as that, of course he had his man boobs but they were not in his way.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Greg even looked in the mirror he somehow knew who he was. Call it \"fe-male\" intuition if you like, but there was this familiarity he recognized. Back in the reflection of the mirror he saw Louisa's shocked face looking back at him. Greg didn't know what to think about this, it didn't surprise him that Louisa wanted to swap with him. After all they were boy- and girlfriend now, she might have been curious about his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this happened.\" Greg said to himself noticing he was talking with his voice higher than before. Greg took another look at Louisa, she looked as she just came out of bed which Greg did in fact. Greg prodded his face to be sure this was real and not some magic trick mirror, but it really wasn't his body anymore. Greg felt how soft his skin was and not only that his hands were different too, much shorter and daintier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing Greg didn't understand however was the fact that Louisa didn't tell him she was going to swap them. Greg didn't mind being inside her body, but it would have been fair to Greg if he was being informed about a thing like this. What was Louisa thinking? And then Greg suddenly knew why: Louisa thought it would be a great joke on him if they were to swap in the middle of the night and he would wake up and think he was still himself. Then she would come inside his room to give him the biggest scare. She was already laughing at the idea of his reaction when she used the remote on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. Greg thought. Just like Louisa had done with Greg's mom, he just recalled Louisa's last memories before the swap. That remote was amazing! But that wasn't so surprising as her father was such a genius and..... Hang on a second, did Greg just think of Louisa's father as his dad and did he refer himself as her? Greg realized that he was still in a state where he was recalling Louisa's memories. Greg quickly shook his head as he wanted to snap himself out of the state. If he would think like that he would almost believe he was Louisa, the only thing stopping that would be the bracelet he was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Greg thought about focusing his mind on something else. Something for him to do. It was in the middle of the night so his options were limited. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Greg swallowed hard as he knew what he wanted to do. Not ever before was a man so close to the body of a woman, to be actually inside of it. Greg knew this was the perfect opportunity for it, nobody would barge in on him and he was in the right mood for it. He would be an idiot if he would lose this chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked down at what he was wearing. A pink pajama top and bottom not revealing his anything noteworthy. Greg was a little disappointed noticing that his girlfriend didn't wear anything sexy while sleeping, the thought of her wearing revealing lingerie would stimulate him so much more. Nevertheless Greg decided to go through with it. He undid the buttons of his pajama top fumbling for a minute before he finally finished all of them. Greg was nervous and on the count of three he opened the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down Greg was pleasantly surprised. Underneath the pajama top Louisa wasn't wearing any bra. Here were her naked breasts to be seen in all their glory. Greg couldn't believe how breasts looked different from this point of view, they looked so sexy. Greg couldn't believe why Louisa was complaining about her average looks as she had a nice pair of breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Greg mumbled as he grabbed hold of them. \"Not bad Louisa, not bad at all.\" They felt lovely in his hands, so soft and yet so bouncy too. Greg couldn't keep his hands of them. \"Can't believe girls aren't playing with them all the time.\" Greg commented. He then noticed his nipples felt odd, not like they used to be. They felt more sensitive like the top of his penis sometimes. Greg was curious and so he gently played with his nipples, while at first nothing happened after a short time playing with them discovered they made his body feel so much better. It wasn't long before Greg noticed something happening down by his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg stood up slightly and removed the pajama bottom from his legs. Greg then saw he was wearing a pair of pink panties, nothing unusual with that except for the front part which was slightly wet. Greg realized that his playing with his breasts caused this and the thought of it made him feel even more erotic than before. Curiously he pulled off the panties as well, he was now lying naked on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg thought of looking in the mirror to see the reflection of his vagina, but he realized he didn't need to. As he was staring down there he suddenly remembered Louisa one time checking her body out in the mirror, pure for medical reasons of course. Greg could not help but touch the slit being his vagina, who would ever guess that the night before he was a guy with a penis. Greg also realized that he needed to play with his g-spot would he finally get ready. So Greg slowly began rubbing his g-spot finding himself getting little shocks of pleasant electricity flowing through his body. He could not believe how Louisa's body was reacting to his playing, if he knew this earlier he would have definitely switched with Louisa earlier. Then when Greg felt how wet he was he slowly moved his finger inside his vagina. Greg never felt this before, his finger entering his body. Greg could feel how wet he was, he could almost blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg hurried on as he wanted to have his first female orgasm. He began to rub his g-spot and entering his vagina with his left finger and with the right one fondling his breasts. Greg felt how he was uncontrollably moaning, the sound of it driving him even wilder. So when the orgasm came Greg arched his back as the orgasm hit him. The shock of the orgasm was fantastic as Greg felt his fluids leaking out of his body. He couldn't believe how amazing a woman's body was.</span></div></div>",

Normally when he used the beast he was beaten for the rest of the night, but now with Louisa's body Greg felt like he could go another time. Greg hugged his body as he couldn't believe how good it felt, girls really had some kind of will power not to do this every night to themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg instinct brought his hand to his g-spot furiously stroking it again, there was all this unreleased pressure his body had and he needed to get it out of his system. With his other hand Greg played with his breasts not wanting to ever let go off them. These babies were great, Greg wondered why girls always wanted bigger breasts when they were perfect like this already. Greg could not believe the sensations they brought him, they were amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not already.\" Greg complained as he could feel the orgasm coming. It was much shorter than the first one and he wasn't ready for it. Greg put his hand in front of his vagina and as he arched his back he could feel the fluids exploding from his body again. Greg could only moan softly as he felt how his body cooled off. Slowly he felt his thoughts returning to become his own again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no man. What did I do?\" Greg muttered. Here he was lying in his girlfriend's bed, having masturbated not once but twice! What would she say when she saw him in a state like this? Greg suddenly felt very exposed as he tried to cover up his body. Perhaps it was better to go back to sleep now. Greg pulled on Louisa's panties, pajama bottom and top and carefully lied down in her bed again. Closing his eyes he hoped things would be better in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever not knowing to Greg Louisa was standing outside his room, the door a bit open to let Louisa take a peek inside her former room. She could not believe Greg dared to masturbate twice inside her body. Although she had to admit it was a turn on for her and her member clearly agreed with it indicated by the sperm on the wall. Louisa giggled quietly as she went back to Greg's room and used the remote once more. Greg's adventures with the remote would not be over yet.</span></div></div>",

When I swapped lives with her, I became her in every way that matters. I have all her thoughts, feelings and memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg gaped at her in amazement. \"But ... how can that be? That's impossible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile widened into a broad grin. \"Is it? Any more that swapping bodies? This invention is amazing and wondrous! In all ways, I am now Samantha Perry, your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to Greg and gently took his hand. \"I remember everything as if I lived it. Meeting your father, falling in love, giving birth to you and raising you ...\" her expression becomes more thoughtful and she adds \"...including breastfeeding, potty-training... EVERYTHING.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg managed to stammer out a response. \"But...but then why are you so different - so much nicer to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa took his other hand as she met his gaze evenly. \"It's true I have all Samantha's memories and feelings; I understand her frustration with you and your 'slacker' mentality, how you never seem to take things seriously or really apply yourself...\" Her tone becomes harsh as she starts to sound angry, but then she suddenly stops, takes a breath, and seems calm again. \"Sorry, I CAN fall into the 'old' Samantha's attitude if I'm not careful. As I was saying, I do have all of her experiences. But because of this wristband\" - she holds up one arm - \"I know that I really am Louisa, and all of her experiences and personality are dominant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice softened as she leant in towards Greg, their faces almost touching. \"So I can be your mother and yet be more...\" she whispered as their lips met in a kiss.</span></div></div>",

But quickly the moment was broken as he smelt his mum's perfume and became distinctly aware that he was making out with his own mother, even if Louisa was currently playing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg pushed himself away from Louisa and began to wipe his mouth with his hands, trying to get the taste of his mum's lips off of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you are doing, Gregory Perry!\" his mother's voice suddenly boomed. \"How dare you pull away from me in the middle of a kiss like that! Is that anyway to treat the woman who raised and loves you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mum. Sorry mum,\" Greg replied reflexively, bowing his head like a scolded child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Greg stood their sulking in silence, feeling just like he used to feel so many years ago when his parents would reprimand him, he thought how weird it was to be told off by his mother for not wanting to passionately kiss her. Not only that, but it wasn't his mum telling him off, it was his housemate wearing his mum's body and living her life for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Greg was about to speak his mind about this, it was suddenly Louisa who was the one apologising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Greg,\" she said clearly embarrassed, \"I told you I could slip back into being your mother. It wasn't right to shout at you like that, and to kiss you when like this,\" Louisa added wincing in shame. \"I'm still getting used to balancing my own emotions and feelings with Samantha's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Greg said starting to smile now from the bizarreness of the situation. \"It's not that I don't want to kiss you, but when you look like that it's hard to see you as anything but my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it would be,\" Louisa laughed. \"I can always change the way I look, if that would make things less weird for you. I still want to see what it's like to be Samantha Perry to the world, and I can't guarantee that I won't try anything like that again whilst I'm her,\" Louisa reached for the remote in her current bodies' handbag on a chair, \"but with this there's no reason I can't appear like someone other than mummy,\" she finished, with a wink.</span></div></div>",

He was glad that Louisa had broached the subject as he was beginning to feel as though she was taking pleasure in tormenting him by flirting overtly in his mother's body. Greg had begun to wonder whether he had ever given off any signs to Louisa that he had a thing for his own mother. He certainly hadn't said anything to that effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" she said sounding almost disappointed, \"it just seems like such a crime to waste your mum's amazing body.\" Louisa momentarily began to caress Samantha's hourglass figure, but stopped upon seeing the look on Greg's face. \"Sorry. Why don't you tell me who you'd rather have me look like. Just remember people will still view me as Samantha Perry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you just swap back to your own body?\" Greg suggested quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa rolled her eyes in distain. \"That's not the point of this device! I can look like anyone in the world and I'm letting you pick and yet you'd have me be myself? And don't just say you like the way I look,\" she added preempting his reply. \"I don't mind the compliment, but I know I'm not the most attractive person alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg thought about saying Louisa should have more confidence in her own appearance, but realised that this would probably only make her angrier. Instead he began to think about who he'd want her to look like. If he was honest, Greg was a little overwhelmed by not only having the choice of every woman on the planet, but also how Louisa would react to having to look like the one he chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up, we haven't got all day!\" Louisa chided, growing impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I've got it!\" Greg said more excitedly than he meant to. </span></div></div>",

She had a roundish face with freckles across her petite nose and cheeks. Her chestnut brown hair was tied up in a simple ponytail with a fringe that went over her left eyebrow. She wore a pair of dark skinny jeans as well as a pink fitted hoodie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Hello, Natalie,\" Greg said with mock politeness. \"Why are you in my flat? Haven't you got school or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, it's half-term,\" Natalie said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't you have stayed at home then? Haven't you got friends to hang out with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of them are on holiday with their families so I was bored. Mum was driving me insane as well, asking whether I had homework to do. But I've already done it all so she said she was going to set some for me!\" Natalie said, her face a picture of indignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nodded sagely, it was not unlike his school teacher mother to set her own children homework when she felt they weren't being challenged enough. The two siblings had a good relationship together, down in part to them being relatively close in age; Natalie younger by just three years at fifteen. Greg had often played the supportive older brother; chasing off any unwanted male attention towards his sister and helping her with her schoolwork, though not too much through the fear of their mother setting any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you decided to come and visit me as an excuse to escape her then?\" Greg deduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, kind of. She actually suggested that I come and visit,\" Natalie replied frowning, clearly a little bemused by her mother's suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Greg hummed, looking as if he was deep in thought. \"Were you sent to spy on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!\" Natalie said shocked. \"At least, not intentionally... Do you think that's why she suggested that I come and visit you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Greg said magnanimously, always keen to jump on a conspiracy. \"Anyway, how did you get here and where do you plan to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By train, of course,\" Natalie said sounding pleased with herself. \"Mum paid, but I got here by myself. Your flat is only like five minutes away from the station. And as for where I'm gonna stay, I was kind of hoping I could stay here and sleep in your room,\" she finished awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, I can't exactly throw you out in the street. You have a sleeping bag with you then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yours,\" Natalie said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine?\" Greg said confused. \"You mean I have to sleep on the floor while you sleep in my bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I'd rather not sleep in your bed at all, but it's better than getting back ache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Greg said resignedly. \"Why don't you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I was thinking we could both use it this time,\" Louisa said, charging into the room, remote in hand, and interrupting Greg mid sentence. She almost dropped it when she noticed Natalie sitting at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is my sister, Natalie. Natalie, this is my housemate, well girlfriend, Louisa,\" Greg said blushing, introducing the two girls to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Louisa,\" Natalie said casually. She quickly noticed the remote in Louisa's hand, getting out of her seat to get a closer a look at it rather than to greet its holder. \"That's a pretty cool phone you've got there. Can I have a look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, n-no!\" Louisa said sharply, backing away. \"It's pretty boring really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Natalie said pleadingly. \"I won't break it.\"</span></div></div>",

The 'copy' of Louisa smiled inanely at Greg, which was a little unsettling. He smiled back as Louisa continued, \"she's in control of my body and life whilst your sister's mind lies dormant inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Natalie's asleep in your head?\" Greg asked to clarify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" the temporary Louisa answered with a nod. \"I'm just here so your sister isn't aware that she's in Miss Medoza's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Greg said, finally up to speed. \"But what are we going to do? You can't really swap back with Natalie now, can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there is one thing I could do,\" Louisa said, shaking the remote.</span></div></div>",

He was rather hoping that Louisa would do something similar to what they did yesterday, with perhaps her swapping with Mimi. Or maybe they could have gone somewhere busy and had fun switching people about at random. But it was her remote after all, and if she wanted to be Natalie, she could be Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's not exactly what you were hoping for, but there's just something... exhilarating about being fifteen again,\" Louisa explained suddenly impassioned. \"And there's the added bonus of having you as my big brother.\" Louisa sashayed towards her new brother, putting her slender hands on Greg's hips as she went to pull him into an embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louisa, please,\" Greg said, pulling away and going a little red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, am I making big brother uncomfortable?\" Louisa mocked, pulling a cutesy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Greg barked. \"I don't mind you being Natalie for a while so long as you don't try any funny business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok.

I'm sure Louisa won't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" Louisa's clone said, suddenly jumping to attention.

Greg rolled his eyes and checked on his phone. It was almost three o'clock. They spend almost half a day going through the town, visiting all the must see stuff. Greg couldn't believe Louisa wanted to do this, he wanted her to use the remote but for some reason she didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me Greg.\" Louisa said which made Greg look up from his phone. He saw Louisa had climbed up the statue and was standing on his shoulders. Some passerby's stopped and pointed at her while Louisa waved around. This was so humiliating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get down from there, you're going to get yourself hurt.\" Greg told Louisa as he put his phone back in his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, look at me.\" Louisa said trying to stand on the statue's head. But what Greg knew was that the statue's head was regularly polished, hence the name Squeaky    Mal as in squeaky clean. He heard about it when he arrived first and was given a tour of the city. When Louisa put her one foot on the head and tried to put the other one there, she slipped on the head. Greg saw her falling down. He quickly ran to the spot where Louisa would fall and barely caught her in his arms. Passerby's clapped their hands, but Greg only had attention for Louisa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" He asked concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" Louisa said as their faces were so much close. Greg looked upon Louisa's face, the tiny freckles covering her face, her light gray eyes, her small lips. For one moment he could see Louisa in his sister's face, but then the moment disappeared. Both Greg and Louisa felt the moment and knew that only Natalie's body was the thing preventing them from kissing each other. Greg quickly put her on the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we need to sit down for a bit. Get you something to drink?\" Greg suggested. Louisa nodded quickly as she and Greg headed for...</span></div></div>",

Louisa quickly checked her own body first. Everything seemed to be where it should be, and she didn't appear to be missing anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie realized she felt taller, and she liked that feeling. It felt good, almost a little too good. She realized she was getting turned on; she had never gotten so easily turned on in her life, but it felt a little strange. She looked down to see a strange bulge coming out of the front of her trousers. Even weirder was that she was wearing Greg's jeans. Then she realized she had his entire lower body from the waist down! She couldn't get a good look at herself without a mirror, but she could see Greg. He looked quite awkward with his masculine upper body now on her smaller feminine lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled, \"This thing is AWESOME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting over the bizarre sensation of having his sister's body beneath his waist, it suddenly dawned on Greg that Natalie was aware of the changes made by the remote. Didn't Louisa say that only people wearing one of the wristbands would notice anything different whilst everyone else would perceive things to have always been this way? Turning to his sister, who had already, rather worryingly, stuck a hand down her trousers, Greg pointed an accusatory finger, shouting; \"Wait a sec! How do know you've got the lower half of my body? I thought you had to be wearing a wristband!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like this,\" Natalie said proudly, pulling down one of her sleeves to reveal that she was indeed wearing one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but, Louisa?\" Greg stuttered turning to the smiling Spanish girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she said innocently. \"You know I had an extra wristband, and your sister seemed like the sort of person who would appreciate the remote's powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But when did you have time to give her one? You were with me all morning and most of the afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Most of the afternoon,\" Louisa said smugly. \"When I went back to the flat to collect that book I needed for the seminar I saw Natalie waiting outside. We got talking and I thought, what the hell, she's Greg's sister, I've got another wristband, why don't I give it to her? So I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, she just took it and accepted the fact that you have a device that can swap all manner of things from one person to another immediately, without question?\" Greg asked still puzzled by what Louisa was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" Natalie interjected, pulling herself away from her 'exploration'. \"She gave me a brief demonstration of how the remote worked by swapping bodies with me. She even said I could take her place for the rest of the day and see if you noticed anything, but I was too nervous,\" she finished, blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Greg said with a sigh. \"I guess you could have picked a worse person to let in on the remote's powers,\" he said winking at his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks!\" Natalie smirked, pushing her brother playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously though, I might've suggested to Louisa that we let you in on our little secret if she hadn't done so already,\" Greg said sincerely. \"But, if it's all the same to you, can I have the lower half of my body back now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...,\"</span></div></div>",

And now I've got one, I want to keep it. For a while at least,\" Natalie added with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg couldn't believe what his sister was saying. He could kind of understand that she might be interested in experiencing what it was like to have a man's genitalia, but why did she have to have his! Looking for support, he appealed to Louisa, hoping she would see sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Louisa, it's your device after all. You can't let her do this to me!\" he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see what the big deal is,\" Louisa answered calmly. \"She's only your sister. What's the harm in letting her keep it for a while? She's promised to give everything else back, and besides, the whole point of having the remote is to experiment with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious!\" Greg whined. He felt like the whole world was against him and cursed the day that he found those stupid wristbands. There was seemingly nothing he could say to convince either girl to support his view. He would have to admit defeat. \"Fine,\" he said weakly, \"but I want everything else back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!\" Natalie squealed, hugging her brother. Unsettlingly, Greg could feel something hard grinding into his thigh as his sister embraced him. \"I'll swap everything else back now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white flash filled Greg's vision once more. As his sight returned, he was pleased to see that he was back to his original height and wearing his regular clothes again. However, this did little to make up for the distinctly empty feeling between his legs. Greg hoped that this would be a very temporary swap, and that Natalie would tire of it quickly. Somehow he knew it wouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go into Greg's room now,\" Louisa said whilst checking her watch. \"The others might be back soon and we can discuss what else we should use the remote for in private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three left the kitchen together, Greg helping Natalie carry her stuff into his room. The bulge in her trousers was even more apparent now it was beneath her own skinny jeans. It was slightly disturbing how excited she was, but Greg had to admit he was feeling a slight erotic buzz throughout his body. He tried to ignore the damp feeling in his boxer shorts as they sat around his round and discussed what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps the use of the remote would take his mind off of his missing genitalia, or so he hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Louisa said, satisfied with the group consensus. \"Then let's get going, I want to head into town and do a bit of shopping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shopping?\" Greg said bemused. \"But I thought you were going to use the remote on yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.

Greg followed her to the door, but stopped as he realised Natalie was not following them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you coming with us?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh, no, I'd better stay here and... sort out my stuff!\" Natalie said blushing. \"I can set up the sleeping bag for you on the floor and I need to sort out what I'm gonna wear tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Greg said as he left the room. \"Just don't make a mess!\"</span></div></div>",

The bus that would take them into the centre of town was taking a while to show up and Louisa was becoming increasingly impatient, so Greg decided to distract her with conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want to go to such a busy place to use the remote, we could have easily done it at the flat?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we can,\" Louisa answered smiling. \"Sure we could have stayed at the flat and used it there, but if we go to somewhere as busy as the mall we have so much more choice!\" she explained animatedly. \"Besides, I'll feel less guilty for stealing body parts off of total strangers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I don't think you have to change the way you look,\" Greg said blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa laughed, shoving Greg playfully. \"Thanks, but I'm not doing this for your benefit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes the bus arrived and, despite it being surprisingly busy, they managed to get two sets next to each other.

After a few moments a list of perhaps two dozen names popped up on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are they?\" Greg asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone on the bus. I just used the scan function so I could more easily make swaps without having to individually add people's details,\" Louisa answered still focused intently on the remote's screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So you've already picked potential targets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa nodded silently, indicating two women sitting across from them. One was a redhead who was probably in her early twenties, perhaps a student of the university like them. She wore a dark pair of jeans and a black, low cut, spaghetti strap vest which contrasted against her paled freckled skin. Greg supposed that it was the girl's sizeable breasts that Louisa had taken an interest in. Next to her was a smart looking business woman wearing a skirt suit who was perhaps in her mid thirties. She had a striking face framed by a blonde bob, but it was her legs that really caught Greg's eye.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned back to face Louisa a now familiar flash of light filled Greg's vision. His sight returning, Greg noticed that Louisa had indeed already made a swap.</span></div></div>",

He reached around and dug his fingernails into it, then he looked across at the redhead again.

I know they're not quite as big as yours, but hey...\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Greg could do was grope his new bosom and fidget a little as he tried to get used to having a bigger arse. \"Yes...they look great!\" he muttered, \"And so do yours!\" he winked at Louisa, who just shared his amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now what?\" a giddy Greg inquired of his friend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In a way she felt that she owed her brother something. He didn't moan too much when she insisted on sleeping in his bed whilst she was visiting, and, perhaps more importantly, he was letting her keep his penis for the moment. Natalie began to feel her borrowed genitalia shift beneath her jeans, and she struggled to keep her hands from dropping to it to give it the attention it so desperately yearned for. She needed a distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving back to her bags, Natalie began to sort through her clothes, deciding she could always plan what she would wear tomorrow. Realising that wearing leggings would draw attention to her new equipment, she settled on wearing another pair of jeans coupled with a pink, spaghetti strap top. She knew that a bulge between her legs would appear normal to everyone but Greg and Louisa, but she still didn't like the idea of anyone looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked for some underwear to go with her outfit, Natalie noticed something had changed. Whilst she still retained all her bras; her panties and knickers had been replaced by briefs and boxer shorts. Frowning in confusing, Natalie dug through her various bags, but still could not find any feminine underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly realisation hit her. Louisa had said that the remote adjusted reality to accommodate any changes made. Her new underwear was part of this adjustment then. Natalie laughed to herself as she looked through the silky panties in one of Greg's drawers, the same applied to him after all now he had her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued as to what it would feel like to wear boxers and realising that her panties were not really made to fit her current private parts, Natalie decided to change into some of her new underwear. She selected a simple black pair of boxers and slipped off her jeans and panties. Watching her brother's cock spring out as it was released from her underwear sent a buzz of excitement through her body. Natalie quickly lost interest in the boxers, dropping them to the ground. The slowly rising and hardening member between her slender thighs was far more enticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to get a better look at it, Natalie shuffled over towards her brother's body length mirror, her mouth gaping at what she saw reflected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg's dick is massive!\" Natalie gasped in amazement. In truth it was somewhat average, perhaps a little bigger than most, but on Natalie's petite fifteen year old frame Greg's cock looked considerably larger. Tentatively she grasped it in her right hand causing it to harden even more. Slowly she released her grip and reached beneath for her balls, cupping them in her smooth palm. \"I can't believe this is real. I have dick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, Natalie gripped her solid shaft, but this time she began to slide it up and down, from root to tip, quickly accelerating her pace. After just over a minute of pumping, spurred on by the image of herself in the mirror, Natalie felt her body shake in orgasm as an eruption of hot semen sprayed out from her efforts. It was like nothing she had ever felt before, the pleasure focused entirely on her borrowed dick. As the last few jets fired off she knew she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully wiping the ejaculate from her brother's mirror, Natalie hoped Greg and Louisa would be out for quite a while yet.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't identity the feelings he was experiencing, he knew he liked having a vagina...but the one between his legs was Natalie's, his own sister's.

Most of them were teenagers (mainly girls) just after a quick bit of cash in their spare time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the rush?\" Louisa asked, giggling, as she took the remote from her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding right?\" a frustrated Greg replied, his voice going high for a moment, probably due to the estrogen now flowing through his body.

What was evident to Louisa was that Greg was getting 'wet' between his legs whenever he looked at an attractive girl. \"Missing your erection?\" Louisa then asked with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" Greg mumbled, almost incoherently. \"I bet Natalie is masturbating back at the flat\" he then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can't blame her, she'll be curious about her new 'anatomy' right?\" Louisa responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess!\" Greg shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa's smile disappeared for a moment, only to return moments later. \"Look...if you want I can swap your 'bits' back?\" she offered, even as she eagerly scanned the restaurant for people to use her father's wonderous invention on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better leave my dick where it is for now, Natalie will only whine at me when we get back\" Greg sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but now how about we play a little switcheroo?\" an excited Louisa giggled.

She looked about 30-ish, her light brown hair was in a ponytail and she was quite petite. She was quite pretty, but not stunning, and she had a band of fat around her waist that was emphasized by the hip-hugger jeans she wore. Greg's eyes widened when he saw the size of her breasts, which were stretching her black tank top to its limits. Greg couldn't help but stare at her as she walked up to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa turned to look at what had Greg so captivated, and she let out another chuckle when she saw the woman. She wasted no time in scanning her, and her name appeared on her device's screen. \"Elizabeth Stanley, age 30, 5' 4\", married, two teenage step-children. Bra size - 30H, wow!\" Louisa said, reading out the details to Greg. \"No wonder she's a little chubby if she eats here all the time\" she then noted, as she studied the woman's waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teenage step-children? I guess her hubby is older than she is then\" Greg surmised, as he observed the woman from behind. \"You sure you haven't swapped her already?\" he then laughed at Louisa, noting how large 'Elizabeth's' breasts were, they looked out of proportion on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I haven't even seen her before\" Louisa answered with a shake of her head. While Greg continued staring at the woman while she was getting served, Louisa then took the liberty of scanning a cute looking guy a couple of tables over, who was dressed in a shirt and tie, black trousers and loafers. <i>'Scott Riley, 25, 6' 1\", single'</i> Louisa couldn't see his crotch because of the table, but taking into his account his height and his broad shoulders, she assumed he wasn't 'small' in the genital department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking her tongue, Louisa pondered her next move, even while Greg again rubbed in between his legs. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Staring at its interface, Greg thought intently about what sort of swap he wanted to make. There was a rather overwhelming array of options, ranging from a simple body part swap to a complete life swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, slowpoke,\" Louisa said, folding her arms impatiently. \"We haven't got all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking!\" Greg whined, not looking up from the device's screen. \"It's just I'm not sure what to do.

It was amazing how lithe and taut and..., well, sexy Jill's body felt beneath his neck. Lifting his now feminine hands to his new chest, Greg cupped both breasts, feeling their weight. A shiver of pleasure rippled across his body and he felt his nipples begin to harden and indent against the fabric of Jill's bra. Greg was beginning to understand why Louisa had acted so impulsively a few moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look so eager to part with her body now, do you?\" Louisa laughed, looking up from the remote's screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whuh?\" Greg said embarrassed, pulling his hands away quickly. \"What's taking you so long?\" he barked red-faced. \"I wouldn't have got distracted if you had used the remote instead of just staring at it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Mr Stroppy-pants, I was just looking through some of the remote's scanning capabilities,\" Louisa responded, chuckling at the look on Greg's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will that help you do?\" he asked, still sulking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It saves me from having to individually enter people's data, thereby allowing me to make swaps more efficiently,\" Louisa explained. \"Wow, literally anything I say with Jill's voice sounds sexy! I have a severe case of diarrhoea,\" she said as a means to test her theory. Greg raised a perplexed eyebrow. \"Ok maybe not everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to use the remote or just keep nattering on?\" Greg said, folding his arms to emphasise his point, but causing his sizeable breasts to jiggle with the movement. \"I wouldn't mind having my own body back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you don't have to get your knickers in a twist,\" Louisa chuckled just before the increasingly familiar flash of light filled their vision.</span></div></div>",

And besides, I like how much taller and stronger I feel with your body,\" she finished, flexing one of her masculine arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're being entirely unreasonable now!\" Greg was beginning to get a little worked up now. \"You said you were going to share the remote's power, but instead you're... is that you're phone?\" he said, broken from his tirade by the chirpy music coming from his housemate's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, give me a sec,\" Louisa said, picking it up, glad of the interruption. \"I'd better answer it, it's my sister, Rosa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg sighed, hoping she wouldn't be talking for too long. He wasn't as angry as he was before, but he wasn't going to let Louisa get away with treating him like some sort of toy she could play with, swapping around its parts.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Greg mulled over what he was going to say to convince her to change her mind, even considering taking the remote by force if he had to, Louisa was deep in conversation with Rosa. They were speaking in Spanish, of course, so Greg had absolutely no idea what they were saying, but from the look on Louisa's face and by the tone of her voice he could tell she was apologising. Greg began to consider what Louisa could have done to her sister, when suddenly it became glaringly obvious. Louisa had just used the device to swap body parts between her sister and himself when suddenly she gets a call from her. Wouldn't it make sense for Rosa to also be wearing a wristband, it was her father's invention as well after all, and therefore be aware of any changes made by the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg began to laugh a little inside, pleased that he wasn't the only one that was annoyed with the way in which Louisa was using the remote's powers. Perhaps now she would return everything to the way it was and use it for his and her benefit rather than using him as a test dummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the phone conversation appeared to be coming towards a climax, Greg waited with bated breath to see the outcome of Louisa's reprisal at the hands of her sister.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From the look on Louisa's face, Greg could tell that she was a little shaken from her conversation with her sister. In fact, he was certain that he would be feeling bad for her if it wasn't for the fact that she had been tormenting him. And he still didn't have his own body back yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Greg could ask for Louisa to return things to normal, the remote's trademark flash of light filled his vision and was swiftly followed by blackness. His sight returning, Greg could see that he still had Jill's body below his neck with the addition's of Rosa's larger breasts and buttocks. He was about to say something when he noticed the grin spread across Jill's supermodelesque face. Surely Louisa couldn't have changed mood so quickly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you handsome!\" came the sultry American tones from the person standing opposite Greg, who he was quite certain was not Louisa anymore. The fact that whoever they were had his body beneath Jill's neck worried him even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?\" Greg asked nervously, just resisting the urge to back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I'm Rosa Mendoza, Louisa's older sister,\" she said as if it were obvious. \"And you must be Greg, her prospective boyfriend. I've heard a lot about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Greg answered uncertainly. It was a little unnerving to hear someone he had only just met, and indeed heard about, announcing they had 'heard a lot about him.' He rather felt he had escaped the frying pan only to tumble helplessly into the fire. There was something about the way that Rosa looked at him with Jill's crystal blue eyes that made him wish he was anywhere but here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you have something of mine,\" she said indicating towards the parts of Greg that originally belonged to her. \"And I have quite a lot of yours,\" she added looking down at her current (and Greg's old) body, cupping her new package with her hand. \"Not bad,\" she said as she appraised the rest of her new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, yes. Well it wasn't my idea, it was Louisa's. I wanted her to give me my body back, but she... well, you know,\" he said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have been told,\" Rosa said, raising a discerning eyebrow. \"My sister was quite adamant that it was all her idea and that you \u00a0are blameless.\" Turning her attention to the remote in her hand, Rosa began to quickly input data into its touch screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, that isn't the same remote that Louisa had, is it?\" Greg asked. The device that Rosa held was white rather than black and appeared to be a little larger than the one Louisa had been using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm, my father made more than one remote and this is mine. How did you think I swapped places with Louisa? She certainly didn't do it and she won't be back here for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But can't Louisa just swap back with you since she has her own remote?\" Greg asked, a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the beauty of being the older sister,\" Rosa grinned. \"She can't contradict anything I do with my remote.\" She finished tapping commands into her remote and, after a flash of light, Greg's body was his own.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting himself down in relief, and checking everything was the way it should be, Greg noticed that Rosa had changed to. Her face was not too dissimilar from Louisa's, she had the same dark eyes and button nose, but somehow she was more striking and, well, beautiful. She had similar shoulder length straight black hair and tanned skin, but it was her body shape that really separated Rosa from her sister. Greg had seen (and felt) her breasts and buttocks for himself and the rest of her body was equally curvaceous. The slim fitting, black pencil skirt and white blouse that she wore certainly accentuated her features, and these coupled with her formal heels seemed to indicate that she had been at work before the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now that we're back to normal we can have some fun,\" Rosa said with a wink. \"We should have quite a while until Louisa musters up the courage to return here.\"</span></div></div>",

The two of us are alone in a bedroom, and you can't pretend you're not attracted to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're Louisa's sister!\" Greg said, shocked at Rosa's apparent lack of conscience. \"And I've only just met you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Rosa said, shrugging her shoulders, \"that makes it all the more fun doesn't it? And besides, to the rest of the world I <i>am</i> Louisa.\" Greg's face was a picture of confusion. \"I swapped lives with Louisa, that's how I got here! The remote isn't a transporter, you know.\" Rosa rolled her eyes in disdain, dissatisfied with both Greg's stupidity and his reluctance to fool around. She was used to getting her way with men and she wasn't going to let now be an exception. It was time to change tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Louisa really likes you, Greg,\" Rosa said, suddenly sounding sincere, as she sat on the edge of her sister's bed. \"She's had a crush on you since day one, and she's known you've had a thing for her for a while now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Greg said, rather taken aback by Rosa's sudden change in tune. He sat down next to her on the bed. \"Has she been talking to you about me?\" Greg asked, perhaps now believing that Rosa had stopped trying to seduce him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit,\" she said, smiling. \"But now I've swapped lives with her I can finally see what she sees in you for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Greg said, blushing. \"So you can feel everything that Louisa would feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Rosa said sweetly, resting her hand gently on Greg's thigh. Greg looked up into Rosa's eyes, a little startled by her sudden contact with him. Rosa smiled warmly at Greg before leaning in and kissing him softly on the lips. As quickly as it had started, Rosa had pulled away as if embarrassed. \"Sorry Greg, I shouldn't have done that,\" she said as if ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine, you're just acting on Louisa's impulses,\" Greg said as he pulled her back to face him. Rosa grinned, before launching herself at him once more. This time Greg reciprocated the kiss; half fooling himself that he was really kissing Louisa and half caught up in the heat of the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa pushed Greg back so he was laying down on the bed, his head on the pillow. She crawled back to his face and returned to kissing him as she settled in on his lap. Her crotch found his groin and she pushed down against him. Rosa ended the kiss and looked Greg in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why Louisa is so infatuated with you,\" she said as her heart raced, reaching back for her remote, straddling Greg between her legs. \"But I feel like I need to make a little change.\" After a quick flash Louisa's head and neck were resting comfortably on Rosa's shoulders. \"Thats's better,\" Rosa giggled in her sister's lighter voice. \"Now I really feel the part!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa grabbed Greg's bottom lip between hers and sucked it into her mouth making him almost melt into the pillow. She ran her sister's tongue across his upper lip before returning to kiss him deeply. Greg let his hand slip down to Rosa's firm behind and her kissing became more intense. His fingers traced her curves for a while and her kissing became relaxed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little more adventurous, Greg ran his hand up under her blouse and undoing her bra, causing Rosa to kiss him more deeply again. His hand slid lower again until it met the beginning of her skirt. At the same time Rosa lifted up his t shirt, breaking their embrace only to pull it off completely and throw it to the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rosa started to undo his belt and jeans, Greg slid a hand up her thigh only to realise he couldn't find her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woops, looks like I forgot to wear any,\" Rosa cooed, slipping off Greg's jeans and boxers in one move. After quickly ditching her blouse and skirt, the two of them were completely naked, Rosa returning to straddle his legs, her eyes focused on Greg's hardening member.</span></div></div>",

At this point Greg was beyond caring who did what, his earlier blowjob seeming an age ago. In fact he had all but tricked himself that he was about to have sex with Louisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa just smiled and bit her lower lip. Greg looked deeply into Louisa's eyes as his rock hard penis began its charge. He moved slowly and steadily as he let her pussy adjust to him. He never broke eye contact, both to deepen their connection and to watch for any sign of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was none. Rosa was so wet and so horny, Greg's length entered her like a warm knife through butter. When he was fully encased in her moist chasm, he began to move rapidly in and out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so in love with you,\" he said, as he kept up the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single tear rolled down Rosa's cheek as she replied, \"You have no idea how long I've dreamed of hearing you say that. I have never loved anyone like I love you,\" she said, eagerly using her sister's memories and feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued the urgency began to build. Rosa started moaning and whispering, \"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was trying to absorb everything so he would never forget a single second of this first time. He could feel the hair on his ball sack begin to twitch as his balls got ready to empty. He started paying more attention to grinding the top of his dick and his pubic bone into her clit. It was working. Rosa started moaning louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God ... harder, harder, harder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg pounded into her flower, her pussy milking and massaging his manhood with every stroke. Sweat started dripping off of him. Rosa didn't notice. She was lost in the mixed emotions of cheating with her sister's prospective boyfriend and the feeling she was getting of being Louisa and fulfilling her desires with Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's rhythm became more frantic. He knew he wasn't going to hold out much longer, and he knew Rosa was close because of the pace of her breathing.\u00a0To speed her up Greg reached down and soaked his finger in her nectars. Then, he gingerly started rubbing her bloated clit. That pushed her over.\u00a0Rosa pulled up her legs so Greg could get in even deeper and grabbed the skin of his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jesus Christ, I love you!!\" she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg let go and started spraying her deep and hard with his thick, hot cream. The rhythm of her pussy walls kept pulling more and more out of him. He didn't make a sound. He wasn't even sure if he was breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg came so hard and full, that Rosa's orgasm was heightened by the sheer force of his cum pouring into her. When he finally finished, he collapsed on her, holding her close. She clutched him with her arms and her hands and her legs. It was almost as if she was trying to pull him completely inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, they loosened their grips on each other. Greg's happy, spent dick simply slid out of the warm ocean of their combined fluids spilling out of her. He rolled over on his back and pulled Rosa to him. She laid her head on his chest and let out a totally satisfied sigh.</span></div></div>",

He rolled over in the bed to give Rosa a kiss to find that she was no longer in the bed with him. She must've also taken the band off his wrist, as it was gone. He couldn't help but think she had done something to his body that she didn't want him to know about. He sat up in bed, thinking about the possibility when Rosa returned to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave Greg a smile. \"Want to go for round two?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nodded. He started by playing with Rosa's breasts and slowly running his hands along her curvy body down to her penis. He held it in his hands and began to stroke it before leaning his head down to give her a great blow job. He stopped right before she was about to explode, opting instead to allow Rosa's penis inside his own vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg couldn't help but notice how giddy Rosa was, seemingly even more excited than last night. Of course, that was because Rosa was fully aware of the changes she had made. She had swapped her genitals for Greg's, and she was about to experience a male orgasm for the very first time.</span></div></div>",

Greg felt like his orgasm was different than usual, but he could quite place how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey cuddled for a few minutes before deciding to start their day. Rosa had to stop herself from giggling as Greg reached down and put on panties. She was a bit more surprised when he put on a frilly nightgown. He gave her a quick kiss before heading to the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa put on Greg's underwear and a robe. She had just intended to switch genitals for a love-making session, but this switch seemed to have unintended consequences that fascinated her. She decided to do a bit of observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg exited the shower with one towel wrapped around his chest and another around his head like a woman would; he had also shaved his legs. Rosa saw him enter his own room and close the door. He wasn't in there for long before she heard him shout, \"Mimi, could I borrow some clothes from you today? Mine just are not doing it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Girl!\" Mimi yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa spied Greg leaving his room still wrapped in the towels and enter Mimi's room. Greg took a while in there, but Rosa was shocked when he emerged. He was wearing leopard print high heels on his feet. The now smooth legs led up to a tight black vinyl skirt. A frilly white blouse was above it. She could sort of see the outline of a bra under it. He had some bracelets on his wrists, necklace around his neck, and full makeup on his face. Rosa thought that if he had a wig on, he'd make a very good drag queen. Then again, she thought about it. He wasn't technically a drag queen at all. Considering what was really between his legs, he was actually a woman, and he was certainly dressing the part!</span></div></div>",

She tried her best to hide her smirk, but after only a few seconds she was flashing one of Jill's glamorous smiles...showing off her pearly white teeth. Louisa could still taste the cum in the back of her throat and she couldn't help but get turned on as she watched Jill walking around in her form....oblivious to the fact they had been swapped. <i>\"Oh by the way Jill...I've just been sucking Greg off with your slutty little mouth, hope you don't mind having a healthy deposit of semen coating your stomach lining for a while,\"</i> Louisa imagined telling Jill...with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Louisa!\" Jill responded, as she took a swig from her water bottle. \"Greg or Mimi not home yet?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope...just little ol' me, er...and you, of course,\" Louisa replied, as she jerked her head from side to side, her ponytailed blonde hair swishing around behind her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ok, they'll probably be back soon, no need to worry,\" the America girl then muttered...in Louisa's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, they probably will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout muttering another word, Jill then went about doing her usual routine, mainly eating healthily and exercising as well as studying. Luckily for her the latter two fell into the same category. Though with Louisa's body...Jill was nowhere near as fit as she normally was. That tall, blonde, toned body of hers currently belonged to her mischievous Spanish housemate. \"Okay, you can come out now,\" Louisa giggled, as she whipped the bed sheet up, revealing Greg's prostrate form underneath the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Greg clambered out and to his feet, he found himself again staring at Jill's ample breasts, hidden underneath the grey spaghetti string vest that Louisa now wore. And just like that...his already aroused, saliva-coated penis began to harden again. Louisa just rolled her eyes and giggled again. \"God...you want more? I'm sure I can oblige,\" Louisa cooed in her U.S housemate's voice, as she puckered her lips and approached Greg again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she stopped in her tracks...and switched her attention to her remote again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg just frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Greg couldn't help but feel giddy with anticipation as his Japanese housemate's form ably piloted by Louisa stood before him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin an instant the two of them were in a frantic embrace, Greg discarding his clothes quickly (they were barely back on), Louisa shedding Mimi's shoes, top and bra. But before she could remove the rest of her clothing, she was already on her bed, Greg kissing her more deeply and allowing a hand to slip beneath her panties and trace the folds of her borrowed vagina. Within moments he was teasing her with several fingers, and to both of their surprise, Louisa was already very wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed him to fuck her badly. Greg knew what she wanted too and he badly needed to stretch the tight pussy he'd played with. Wasting no time he let her up to remove her final articles of clothing. Slipping her shorts and knickers off he thought it a waste to take the socks off, so he left them as he slowly kissed his way up her leg and to her pussy, savouring Mimi's sweet aroma as he got closer, he eagerly flicked his tongue at her swollen pink lips. Tenderly licking the outside Greg used his fingers to part her pussy lips and allow him a good look inside her sweet little hole. He couldn't believe how tight it looked and he pressed his tongue against her opening. Greg was sure Mimi couldn't be a virgin, she seemed to always have a boyfriend on the go, but she was incredibly tight.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa writhed in Greg's grasp as his tongue explored her. She was desperate to be filled and she cried out for him to fuck her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding no encouragement Greg knelt between her legs and eased himself down on top of her as his cock pressed against her tight entrance.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and...,\" Louisa started. Before she could finish Greg's tongue probed her mouth, silencing her as his cock pushed all the way inside her narrow young cunt.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn he feels big,' Louisa thought as Greg's dick pushed her apart. He pulled away from her lips as he slowly and steadily thrust in and out of her glistening pussy. Needful moans filled the room as Greg thrust harder and faster, his hands roughly pushing Louisa's legs onto his shoulders. The depth of his penetration sent Louisa into a frenzy, screaming in pleasure as she came, her hands holding the duvet for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg tried desperately not to cum as Louisa came over his cock. Her pussy cum made her so slippery he felt he could pound her all night. He gripped her legs tighter and rested his full weight on her so she could feel the full force of his cock with every hard thrust. Louisa's juices splashed against Greg's balls and he ground his cock harder into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to be more dominant Greg wanted Louisa on her knees. Obliging, Louisa twisted over, allowing him a good look at her tight arsehole too. He could barely see how he'd get a finger in there, but where there's a will there's a way, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn all fours, Louisa gasped as Greg eased back into her soaking wet pussy. Expecting him to fuck her hard and fast he stayed still, his fingers working their way around her juices. Suddenly she knew what he was doing as his finger eased into her arse. All the way until he knew it was as deep as it could go, and then he pounded her. Louisa had never been fucked so hard in her life. She'd gone wild with her toys before but never this hard for fear of hurting herself, but with another person's body there was no worry of that. Reaching down with his free hand, Greg gripped Louisa's tits and pinched her nipples, his chest against her back and his mouth nibbling her ears and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you are fuckable Mimi!\" Greg breathlessly whispered into Louisa's ear. Her pussy was wild now and just as she thought she couldn't get any more pleasure she felt her arse stretched even more by a second finger.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arghhh oh FUCK!!!!!\" She cried, feeling pain and pleasure together. His fingers working her arse she knew he was stretching Mimi's behind to its limits. Louisa could hardly stand the sensations any longer and came for the second time, her cries louder this time. Greg was a man possessed as he felt his orgasm approaching. Pulling out of her pussy he slid his cock almost all the way into her arse, splitting her hole roughly before exploding deep within her incredibly tight arse, burying three fingers in her dripping pussy to make sure she was filled. Louisa yelped in pain as Greg's cock impaled her. Yet pleasure took over as she felt hot jets of cum filling her forbidden hole. The sensation of Greg's fingers stuffed in her pussy drove her crazy. Lying still she let Greg finish pumping before he gently slipped out, careful not to hurt her and turned her body over. Her long black hair was stuck to her face and her eye make-up running down her cheeks, making her look a total slut. Greg loved it and loved how the remote could make anyone a potential sexual partner, especially with Louisa's readiness to experiment.</span></div></div>",

After several minutes of quiet repose, Louisa slinked from the bed and stood in front of her mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I love the just fucked look, especially with Mimi's cute body,\" Louisa said as she examined her reflection. Greg had to agree with her, she looked pretty amazing. \"But I'd better give Mimi her body back now.\" Louisa reached for the remote, stopping midway. \"Whoops, better get some clothes on first,\" she giggled, realising it would be awkward for her housemate to suddenly find herself naked but for her long socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter slipping on Mimi's discarded clothes and halfheartedly attempting to make herself look less dishevelled, Louisa finally retrieved the remote. \"I think I'll leave your cum in here,\" she laughed, patting the shorts that now concealed her tight buttocks. \"That way you'll have two girls carrying your seed, though not in the right place!\" She turned back to face Greg after using the remote to regain her own body and couldn't help but smile as she saw her kinky talk had excited him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really do have an insatiable appetite, Greggy,\" Louisa purred as she lay back next to him and began to stroke his rising member with her right hand. \"Why don't I give you a final treat before we call it a day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, sure,\" Greg stuttered, a little overwhelmed, though he liked the sound of what Louisa was suggesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If our previous 'experiment' was anything to go by, I'd say you're somewhat eager to fully experience the delights of anal,\" Louisa said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you could say that,\" Greg said, beginning to grow in interest somewhat literally. Louisa laughed at seeing his apparent enthusiasm, grasping his penis more firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about I give you a go on a 'rear of the year'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Greg said, his ears pricking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, I know about your little obsession with Carol Vorderman's backside! I'm afraid you weren't too careful with removing your computer's search history when you let me borrow it,\" Louisa said, causing Greg to blush and avert his gaze, embarrassed. Ever since he started to become interested in the other sex as a boy, he had always seen the curvaceous TV presenter as the epitome of the female form.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Greg, it's nothing to be ashamed of. Everyone knows I'm a total milf,\" came the mature tones of an all too familiar voice. Greg had to stop himself from exploding there and then as he found himself laying next to the woman he had masturbated over for much of his adolescent life. \"So, Greg, want to see my arse in all it's naked glory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg could only squeak a barely audible 'yes' in response as Louisa shifted from the bed and began to slowly strip off Ms Vorderman's outfit.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her back to Greg, Louisa started to hum a playful tune. She swayed her hips to the rhythm of the song, and her perfect, round arse pulled tight to her black, knee length tube skirt with each swing. Louisa must have been unbuttoning her shirt with her hands, because when she turned around her white blouse was wide open, revealing most of the black lace bra underneath. She started to walk towards Greg very slowly, still humming some kind of tune, and let her shirt fall off her shoulders slightly, displaying her tanned chest and her dark bra. Then she stopped, and reached down to unzip her skirt with one hand while reaching inside her shirt with the other. Her skirt fell to the floor and she continued to dance towards Greg, humming along.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shirt covered her arse just enough to make it seem like she wasn't wearing anything underneath. As she reached Greg she pulled up her shirt ever so slightly to show her matching lace panties underneath. She spun around and lifted her shirt up at the back to unveil Carol's sumptuous, round buttocks being hugged by her tight undergarments. Louisa rubbed her arse slowly and tantalisingly, causing Greg to groan at the closeness of what he was desperate to feel. She returned to swaying her hips to her tune as she had before, and after a few moments her shirt fell off, and she stood before him with nothing but Carol's underwear on. Louisa turned around to face Greg, as she squished her boobs together. She rocked her hips and stared him in the eyes as she reached behind her back and undid her bra, and let it fall to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's your two from the top,\" she said, in her new, mature voices sultry tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Greg had expected, her tits were fairly large, but to his surprise they were still perky with cherry red nipples. Louisa began to rub said nipples and her boobs, and flashed a grin as she bit the side of her lip. She then worked her hands down to her panties and turned her back to Greg again. She played with the elastic at the sides, pulling them down to cover half her arse. She let Greg take in Ms Vorderman's remarkable bottom for several seconds before pulling her underwear back up, delaying the final reveal. Louisa spun around again and returned to rubbing her boobs, but started to move towards Greg, slowly letting her humming die down to nothing and making the space between them even closer. In the silence Greg became distinctly aware of his sharp breathing as he struggled to resist touching the scene in front of me. Louisa leaned down to his face before she spun around and sat on his lap, right on top of his raging hard-on that was only denied contact with its desired target by her lacy knickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to move her hips from side to side, slowly at first, but then picked up speed. Before long she was fully gyrating her hips on his crotch, her bum furiously massaging Greg's cock through her black panties. Louisa leaned back and led his hands up to her breasts. Needing no further invitation, he began rubbing and massaging her nipples. Louisa started to breathe heavily with Greg as she continued to move her arse from side to side, all over his rock-hard crotch. He started to moan from the pressure of her bum and thighs attacking his member, the wait was starting to become too much. After a while Louisa slowed down and eventually stopped, knowing that Greg was probably in danger of nearly blowing his load. She turned to face him with a seductive grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for your one from the bottom?\" she cooed.</span></div></div>",

As he had expected, Carol's bum was perfect. Despite her years Taking something tucked away in one of its bottom corners. She returned to sit on the bed handing Greg what she had retrieved, it was a bottle of lubricant. Greg raised an inquisitive eyebrow, making his surprise at Louisa having something like this ready apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to do me up the arse or not?\" Louisa retorted, clearly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Greg said more eagerly than he wanted to. Pleased that he was just as desperate to start at she was, Louisa positioned herself on the bed, giving Greg a sly wink as she arched Carol's back.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to contain his excitement, Greg removed the cap from the lubricant and inserted the neck of the bottle into Louisa's arse. She moaned happily when she felt the lubricant squirting into her, and again when Greg eased his finger into her to spread it around. After he had covered the inside as far as he could reach, he applied some to his cock, and they were both ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go ahead and stick your consonant, vowel, consonant, consonant in my vowel, consonant, consonant, vowel?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying flat on her stomach, her backside positioned upwards and with her legs wide apart, Louisa reached back to spread her arse cheeks ready for entry. Greg knelt between her thighs and reached between her succulent half-globes to pull the slippery sides of her behind apart, creating a small hole. Keeping it open with the fingers and thumb of one hand, and guiding his cock with the other, Greg pressed the tip of his dick against the opening. With a firm but gentle push, he wedged the head into Louisa, eliciting a happy moan from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both their hands held her rear passage open, Greg gave another strong thrust and almost an inch of his cock slid inside Carol's welcoming behind. With another thrust, Louisa started squirming on the bed from the pleasure she was already getting, as Greg's cock stretched her anal cavity. Her movements made the rest of his entry easier, and with one more thrust Greg imbedded the majority of his dick inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa's upper body was being supported on her elbows as Greg leaned forward to put his hands flat on the mattress beside her. Greg slowly drew back, pulling most of his penis out of her, paused, and ploughed back in, going even deeper than before.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God, that feels good,\" Louisa whispered.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels more than good,\" Greg whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, he drew his cock back and plunged it into Louisa. This time, when she felt it surging back into her, she pushed off with her elbows and fucked her arse back towards him. They both moaned from the intense pleasure, and this time, Greg penetrated her as far as possible. Greg's dick was so deep inside, he could even feel the soft skin of her cheeks against his scrotum.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving slowly and taking their time, wanting to sustain the eroticism for as long as possible, they continued their respective roles. Over and over, with Louisa pushing back to meet Greg, as he plunged his cock into her award winning rear. As Greg had imagined, Carol's behind was tight, and seemed to caress his penis perfectly, sending pleasure flooding through his body every time he burrowed into her. From her moans and whimpers of ecstasy, Greg could tell Louisa was equally enjoying the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExquisite though the pleasure was, Louisa wanted more. She began to stimulate her already moistening sex as Greg began to increase his rhythm. \"That's it, really give it to me now, Greggy,\" she moaned.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time Greg ploughed into her, hid legs pressed against Carol's succulent cheeks, Louisa allowing him as deeply into her arse as she could. Greg's balls slapped gently against her pussy adding extra pleasure to both himself and Louisa. Greg could feel his climax boiling to the surface, but it was Louisa who came first.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh!\" she cried out ecstatically as her movements got even more frenetic. \"Yes! Yes! Keep fucking me!\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg realised she had started cumming, which only encouraged him to pound her harder. Over and over, he slammed his cock into Louisa. She was no longer fucking her arse back to meet him but the other movements of her body, violent and strenuous, made up for it. Abruptly, she climaxed, all her muscles clenching, followed by relaxing completely as she collapsed onto the bed.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden hard squeezing of his cock produced \u00a0Greg's climax as well, his penis releasing jet after jet of hot semen into Louisa's tight hole. As the last drop escaped, Greg pulled out with a satisfying pop and lay next to Louisa, holding her new mature body in his arms as they slipped into subconsciousness.</span></div></div>",

They skipped a good number of classes and often only exited for meals. Nothing was off limits for them. They each tried out all sorts of different bodies and combinations. They had reversed genders, done girl-on-girl, guy-on-guy, shemale-on-girl, shemale-on-shemale, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one lunchtime when they decided to take a break from their escapades. They went out to the communal kitchen. Greg and Louisa had their own bodies -- mostly. They had switched genitals to stay a little kinky while they ate, figuring no one would notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi was sitting at the table with a worried look on her face. She asked to speak with Louisa alone for a minute. Greg excused himself to his room, figuring he could spend the time masturbating the borrowed vagina between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi struggled to get her words out, \"Louisa, I needed another girl to tell this to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa nearly laughed knowing what was currently between her own legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi continued, \"I'm...I'm late! And...and I took a pregnancy test...and I'm preg...I'm pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa rolled her eyes a little bit, but still tried to be comforting, \"Do you know which one of the guys it was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi took a long pause, \"That's the thing. I'm a virgin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa could only look at Mimi in shock for a moment until she spoke, \"But all those guys...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't sleep with a single one of them.\" Mimi confessed, \"It's why I've gone through so many guys! None of them want to be with me unless they can sleep with me! I let them lie about it in the hopes that maybe one will stay with me until I'm actually ready. But none ever do. Which...still..how could this happen? I'd feel it if one them did this to me in my sleep, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa remembered borrowing Mimi's body several times throughout the week; Greg had as well. They had assume she was sexually active and on the pill. They had been a little less careful with her body because they had thought she was more than a little bit slutty. They were wrong. They had both probably left a lot of seed in Mimi's vagina, and now she was pregnant. The poor girl had no idea why.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Louisa could clearly see that her seventeen year old housemate was distraught. Not only was she clearly too young to deal with the stresses and repercussions of being pregnant, she hadn't even had sex yet! There was no way that Louisa could let Mimi go on thinking that she had been raped in her sleep or believe that this was some sort of miracle. She would have to tell the truth about what she and Greg had been up to. She would have to show her the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi, I know how you got pregnant,\" Louisa said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Mimi almost gasped, her face a picture of confusion. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here a second, I have to show you something.\" Louisa left the room, leaving Mimi alone and very confused. How could Louisa know how she was pregnant? And what could she be getting that was related to her predicament? Mimi's mind spun with these questions and more as she waited for Louisa to return.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so Louisa returned holding the last of the slim, black wristbands her father had sent her, as well as the remote, but, of course, Mimi only supposed it to be a smart phone of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put this on,\" Louisa instructed, holding the wristband out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Mimi said incredulously. \"What the hell does a wristband have to do with me getting pregnant!\" The Japanese girl's fear and worry was now replaced by anger. She had opened up to Louisa, hoping to confide in a friend about something that truly frightened her. The idea of her being pregnant at seventeen despite not having sex terrified her, but Louisa seemed to be treating it like it was some sort of joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put it on and everything will become clear,\" Louisa said calmly, desperately hoping Mimi would accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Mimi said, snatching the wristband from Louisa's hand and sliding it onto her wrist. \"But this had better explain everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Mimi would probably storm off before seeing the effects of the remote if she explained them first, Louisa decided to give her a practical demonstration straight away. After a blinding flash the two girls felt as though they were floating; but no sooner had their vision disappeared it returned, both finding themselves looking at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck did you just do?\" Mimi screamed in Louisa's voice, shocked to be sitting across from her own body and inhabiting her housemate's. She was even more surprised to have a penis attached between her new legs. \"And why do you have a penis? Is this... is this Greg's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swapped our bodies using this device,\" Louisa said as she indicated the remote. \"As you are now wearing a wristband you are able to bear witness to any changes made by it, including any active changes made prior to you wearing the wristband. And to answer your last question, yes, that is indeed Greg's penis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Mimi said bemused, still trying to come to terms with the remote's effects. \"But what does this have to do with me becoming pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Louisa said, worried at how Mimi would react to finding out the truth, but knowing she couldn't lie to friend. \"You see, Greg and I have been... 'experimenting' with the device for quite some time now, and during these 'experiments' we may have used your body a few times without much thought as to the long term consequences of our actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room sunk into a deathly silence as Mimi's face darkened, realisation creeping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you used my body... you used my body for sex?\" Mimi said disturbingly calm despite the magnitude of this sudden revelation, as tears began to form in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" was all Louisa could say. She felt awful. She had used her friend's body for countless acts of sexual deviancy without a seconds thought as to what might happen afterwards. And now her friend was pregnant, and she couldn't even be sure who's seed she was carrying or even whether it was her or Greg who had been using her body at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Louisa thought desperately for something to say to try and help matters, Mimi had already made up her mind</span></div></div>",

By this time of course Greg's cock had hardened as much as it could and it was straining to be out of his pants. <i>\"Hell with it!\"</i> he thought, reaching for Jill's large breasts...only to have his hands slapped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right!\" Louisa laughed in Jill's voice, \"You think I'm that easy?

He almost blacked out and then he felt so much better... until he looked at Louisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Only that wasn't Louisa, that was himself.  What was he doing back in there?  He was supposed to be out here... with... himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He looked down at himself for confirmation of who he was... but he didn't get the confirmation that he was expecting.  He saw a close up of Jill's breasts, as seen from above and behind.  It was almost as if they were on his own chest, he could even feel a bra, going around his torso.  And he could feel the straps going over his shoulders to meet up with the cups on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  This was too odd to be an hallucination so Greg pulled his hands up to meet the objects on his chest and they felt warm and bulky, and buoyant, and really there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Then he moved his head forwards to see what else he could see and something blonde slid off his right shoulder and rested there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What's going on?\"  Greg asked in his cute female Chicago accented American voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What was that about being nobody's sister?\"  His body gruffly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg tried to lower his voice, but with no effect, he still spoke with an alarmingly high pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I am nobody's sister!\"  He said.  But then he felt unsure of himself and he walked up to the mirror in Louisa's room and moved his head to take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The mirror must have been one of those special circus mirrors, because it only showed Jill... in all her magnificence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Damn... she still had a great ass.  And as for her breast's, they were really peachy today!\"  Greg muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg got the feeling that nobody would tell him off for looking now, so he continued staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Strange!\" Greg said as he noticed that she blinked, at exactly the same time, as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He rubbed his hands in his eyes, at exactly the same time, as she did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'There was something very fishy with this mirror!'  Greg thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Then his body walked up behind him / her in the mirror and put his hands directly on her ass... at the same time as Greg felt hands on his own ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg then realised that the mirror was only showing what was in front of it... Greg and Jill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Only Greg wasn't looking out of his own eyes... he was looking out of Jill's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'But how could that be?'  He asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Then Greg became afraid as his Greg body moved, and spoke, without him telling it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Come on, surely you can't be that dense!\"  Was what it said to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Who... who am I... no, who are you?\"  Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Why, Jill, you know me, I'm Greg!\"  His body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No... no, you're not, I am!\" Greg said, patting Jill's ample breasts on his own chest as he said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, if you'll check your records, I think you'll find... I'm telling the truth!\"  His body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"They're in your room!\"  His body said when it saw him hesitate outside Louisa's room door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It's that one!\" his body said pointing to Jill's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What do you think I am... stupid?  No, don't answer that!\"  Greg answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He saw the shadow outline of Jill's body, for a couple of seconds, on Jill's door... before he tried his keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Obviously they didn't work, and he was only... very surprised, when his body answered the door breathlessly.  He said \"yes... Greg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg stared at him for a few seconds before he cottoned on and he said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Louisa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Behind you!\" his body replied pointing over Greg's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He looked over his shoulder where he saw Louisa, in her own body, in her own room, who gave a pretend shy smile and a little wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Suddenly Mimi's voice said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Jill... hurry up, if I have to hold this position for much longer... Jill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  ... From behind... Jill? And Greg pushed past his old body and opened the interior bedroom door where he saw Mimi from the rear resting on her side giving a nice view of her bum.  Oh, they were playing twister.  Suddenly Mimi became aware of Greg and she sprang into an awkward position with arms and legs splayed all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, hi Gregie, I thought you were Jill... where is Jill anyway?\"  Mimi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hi Jill... err... ancient Japanese method of controlling body... so it uses no energy and stays in position.\"  Mimi said trying to bluff Greg's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh... don't give me that crap, your right hand is supposed to be on the blue circle, and your left is supposed to be on the red... not the other way round.\"  Jill responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I am SO sorry, please accept my humble apologies?\"  Mimi answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Anyway Greg, what's with you busting into my room, and interrupting my game?  I really think you are taking this 'dumb blonde' thing a bit to far!\"  Jill said and... \"That reminds me, have you heard this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"There's this blonde out for a walk.  She comes to a river and sees another blonde on the opposite bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yoo-hoo\" she shouts, \"how can I get to the other side?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The second blonde looks up the river, then down the river, and then shouts back,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You ARE on the other side!\"... Boom, Boom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Pretty funny, huh?\"  Jill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Not even close!\"  Greg replied acerbically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Look... your room is over there!\"  He said, pointing to what Greg still thought of, as his own room.</span></div></div>",

Oh yes... to get proof that you weren't Greg!  But you've already answered that!  Haven't you Louisa?\"  Greg answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes!\"  Louisa then stated having already decided that honesty was the best policy, from now on, and anyway the cat was out of the bag.  There was no fun to be had, now, from treating Greg as Jill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Wouldn't you like to get your hands on Jill's underwear?\"  Louisa asked, as knowing Greg was really a male she wanted to appeal to his baser instincts... while he still had them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I bet they are small, and silky, and soft, and wonderfully smooth!\"  Louisa added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, come on, then, before you do yourself... an injury.\"  Greg said, then he smiled, giving Louisa a look at Jill's pearly white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg approached his door, reached between his breasts, and pulled out a couple of keys, which were on a thin gold chain around his neck, he bent over and inserted one of them into the lock and turned it.  Then he took the key out of the lock, pushed open the door, straightened up and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Home sweet home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"God I need a drink.  Do you want one?

There is only vodka and whiskey in here, all of the lager is gone!\" Greg stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, Jill likes vodka and black, see if there is any blackcurrant concentrate about?\"  Louisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, Jill is a health freak, she only likes blackcurrant neat, not even mixed with water.\"  Greg said, sort of defending Jill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, you are so... naive, that is blackcurrant mixed with vodka!  Jill considers it a well earned treat after a particularly long run.\"  Louisa replied.  She chose not to mention the burger and milkshake that Jill also had at the halfway point, about 5 miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Are you not going to make us a vodka and black?\"  Louisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Why are you asking me?  None of that is mine!\"  Greg stated sitting down on the pink sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well... this is your room.

What's your point?\"  Greg counter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"That PINK hooded jogging top?\"  Louisa finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What?  No... no, it's black!\"  Greg said as he violently jerked his head to the left, which caused the blonde hair of his ponytail, to slap his right cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, that WAS black, but now it isn't!\"  Greg stated numbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What is your problem?  Girls are allowed to wear pink!  It's just guys, who look like freaks, when they try.  You are currently a girl and I bet there is, plenty more pink, in your underwear drawer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I bet there isn't!\"  Greg said as he tried to beat Louisa into his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Nice bedspread!\"  Louisa said over his shoulder as he beat her in there and then stopped just inside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I really like all of those pink pillows and cushions....

SO sexy, when you say it like that!\"  Louisa responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'm warning you! Don't touch that handle!\" Greg said slapping his own Jill sized ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise that you wanted to do it!  Come here, baby, and sit down next to me and we'll go exploring together!\"  Louisa replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Which part of privates, don't you understand?  They're... MY underwear!\"  Greg said emphasising the 'my' when he realised that they were his underwear, NOW, and he didn't want anyone else seeing them before him.  What if there were lots of kinky and slinky crotchless panties?  She might think that Greg actually wore them, whereas Greg had never found those kinds of panties suitable to be worn by any male, certainly not Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  True Greg's favourite fantasy until now, had involved Jill wearing nippleless bra's, and crotchless panties.  But what if it were true?  Greg had to protect her reputation AND his own, because he had her body and therefore the contents of her underwear drawer, were now HIS too, and Greg would have been horrified to see Louisa pull that kind of underwear out of 'his' drawers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh... boring.  If you've seen one pair of panties, then you've seen, them all.\"  Louisa said as she pulled open the drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The drawer contained lots of practical and sensible underwear, with only the minimal amount of skimpy panties and bra's.  There weren't any crotchless panties, or nippleless bras, thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"God... damn... it!  What did you do that for?\"  Greg shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What?  I didn't see any harm in looking.\"  Louisa answered truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You know what I'm going to have to do now?\"  Greg said balling his feminine fists and feeling his new nails as they dug into his palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, come on, then.\"  Louisa said standing up and shaking her tail feather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No!  I'm going to go for a... a run!\"  Greg said then he sighed in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Do you want me to come with you?\"  Louisa offered even though she didn't fancy a 10-mile run, not with the way the weather was turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No... it's you I want to get away from!\"  Greg said truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Now get out!\"  Greg said stamping his right foot and pointing to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, we need to discuss, what is bothering you!\"  Louisa calmly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You are!  No, it's these!\"  Greg said gesturing to his abundant cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What are you saying?  That you are not man enough to be a woman for a few days?\"  Louisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, I'm saying please leave!\"  Greg stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"How about a week, or two, or three?\"  Louisa casually asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Please... go... now!\"  Greg stated again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"How about a month, or even two?\"  Louisa asked less casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"How about I lock you in here while I go for my run?\"  Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  To which Louisa replied...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Fine!\"  Greg responded and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I hope you won't need the toilet for the next couple of hours because I'm feeling very fit!\"  Greg said as he slammed and locked the door, locking her inside.</span></div></div>",

She was already on her second vodka and black and now she was reading his Cosmo, on his wonderful pink bed.  Greg should really appreciate sleeping in this bed, as it was SO comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Then the whole room darkened, enough to turn the lights on, and it started raining, quite heavily, judging by the size and frequency of the raindrops splattering on the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She didn't envy Greg, what with him being out in this; in Jill's body, dressed as it was, in the cleavage showing white T-shirt under the burgundy-jogging top which was also above hip hugger jeans and mostly white trainers.  And that is not to mention the probably inappropriate underwear, which would probably cause chaffing and not offer enough support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She went into the kitchen/dinette/living room and poured herself another vodka and black.  She took a swig and then decided to make Greg one too, after all this was HIS vodka and black she was drinking, and she wanted to get him tipsy when he returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Now Greg had Jill's body, maybe she could finally get her hands, on Jill's boobies.  Louisa was actually a lesbian, but Jill wasn't, Jill was straight as an arrow, she only liked boys.  The last year had been hell, since she came out to Jill, because she was so understanding.  Maybe it would have been better, for Louisa, if Jill had hit the roof, but she took it calmly and gracefully; even understandingly, some might say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But Greg was straight as well, since he only liked girls too, even though he was still a virgin in his own body.  So that made it okay for him to have Jill's body.  For the first time in her life, everything was working out great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She had Greg in Jill's body, not knowing how... awesome, Louisa found THAT idea.  He didn't know the power his breasts had, over Louisa.  Actually she had better get him some towels and stuff since he would probably be like a drowned rat when he returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She heard wet sounding steps outside the door followed by the sound of a key jiggling hopelessly in the lock!  Who was at the door?</span></div></div>",

Then again, there was a certain amount of guilt already seeping into his head, he had been brought up not to take things that didn't belong to him. This was an internal tussle that he had experienced before, but not for a long time. When he was younger he had stolen an 'adult' magazine from an old man's newspaper stand. That hadn't belonged to him, yet he still took it and didn't return it either. At least the wristband he now wore belonged to one of his housemates and he could return it at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was snapped out of his self-directed musings by a sharp knock on his door. For a split second he was unsure what course of action to take, and it wasn't until there was a second knock on the door..did he respond. \"Come in!\" he called out nervously. He knew it could only have been either Louisa or Mimi, since Jill was normally out running at this time. He watched as Louisa walked through the door, but something didn't seem right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louisa?\" Greg murmured, when he saw that she seemed to be wearing Mimi's clothes. Closer inspection confirmed this, Louisa was indeed wearing Mimi's brightly-colored t-shirt, purple cardigan, denim shorts, striped knee-socks and white training shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the person I want to see\" Louisa smiled, though Greg could tell she was 'suspicious' about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? And...why are you wearing Mimi's clothes?\" Greg frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise looked down and grinned, then she shrugged and looked back at Greg. \"Not what I would have picked to wear, but hey...I didn't choose the outfit\" she said. That reply though didn't really answer Greg's question. Louisa's eyes then darted to Greg's wrist and she saw her missing wristband. \"I see you helped yourself to one of MY things?\" she muttered calmly, as she sat on the bed beside Greg. This allowed him to inspect Louisa more closely, and he noticed her fingernails were painted all different colours...just like Mimi's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er....yeah...s..sorry. I didn't think you'd mind\" he replied nervously, acting like a child who'd been caught stealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky for you I don't\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a relief, but I'll ask you again...why are you wearing Mimi's clothes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she happened to be wearing these when I swapped with her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swapped? Swapped...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bodies you idiot, can't you tell...this is Mimi's body. Well more accurately...I switched heads with her. I would have preferred Jill's body, but she's not back yet, so I decided to borrow Mimi's instead\" Louisa explained to a confused Greg. \"See...my father's latest invention...\" she then said, showing Greg her new remote. She explained in length just what the device was capable of, and then stood up and modeled her petite new Japanese body in order to prove it to him. But she could tell the skepticism was deeply entrenched...despite the obvious evidence that was staring him in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you want more proof?\" a frustrated Louisa sighed, after Greg had thrown a disbelieving stare in her direction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Louisa quietly opened the door and scanned her with her device, then she closed the door again and walked back over to Greg, who was just watching with interest. \"Don't move!\" Louisa told him, as she also scanned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you up to?\" a suspicious Greg inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see!\" Louisa replied, a cheeky grin etched on her face as she used her new 'Mimi hands' to activate her device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg got to his feet...only to feel a bit disorientated. At first he just thought he'd stood up too quickly, but then his vision blurred...and a moment of blackness followed. A few seconds later he could see again, and Louisa was eyeing him up...head to foot. Greg frowned a little when he felt an unfamiliar weight 'tugging' on his chest, and he suddenly felt quite exhausted and sweaty as well. He almost fell over with shock when he looked down at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, what the fu...?\" Greg blurted out, as he saw two fleshy globes, glistening with sweat, stretching out the pink, spaghetti-strap vest he was wearing. He reached up to check that the breasts were real...and he noticed his expertly manicured fingernails and his smaller hands. As he rested those same hands on his new boobs, Greg peered further down his body at the black jogging bottoms and white women's sneakers he was wearing. Perspiration actually covered his entire body, and his legs were aching..especially his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" Greg asked Louisa, looking up at her. He realized his voice hadn't changed at least...or his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on stupid, don't you recognize those boobs?\" Louisa scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg took another look down at himself and kept squeezing his breasts, and as he did so his nipples starten to harden. He felt an unfamiliar...but pleasant sensation between his legs as he grew aroused. \"Oh my god...they're Jill's!!\" Greg exclaimed in surprise. \"I'VE GOT JILL'S BODY!!\" he then shouted in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, keep it down a little!\" Louisa told him. \"And yes...I swapped you with Jill from the neck down, you always did like her body...right?\" she then giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yes, but...I only fantasized about screwing her before, not BEING her\" Greg answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not her, you're still you...technically\" Louisa pointed out. She then remained silent for a moment as Greg ran his hand over his curvy new body, the sight of him with Jill's casually-attired, sweaty body from the neck down actually got Louisa's motor running a little. \"Nice ass!\" she complimented him, causing Greg to reach around to his new backside and dig in his french-tip manicured nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...thanks!\" a horny Greg muttered in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...you want some time alone?\" Louisa grinned, knowing that Greg would probably want to 'explore' his new anatomy. \"Or...would you like me get my little Asian fingers busy pleasuring that moist new pussy of yours?\" she cooed, wiggling the fingers on her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg decided he wanted to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Louisa was watching Greg, as he almost indecently molested, his own female Jill body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Need some... alone time, do you, Greg?\"  Louisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What?  Erm... yes, please!\"  Greg answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'll be back in half an hour, try and keep the screams to a minimum, okay?\" Louisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Sure... I'll be as quiet as a mouse!\"  Greg advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Have fun!\" Louisa suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Ooh, yes, I will definitely have some of that!\" Greg replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, I'll see you, soon!\" Louisa advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, can you shut the door, after you... thanks?\" Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg waited for a few seconds after she left the room, before he got up and locked the door. Then he stood in front of the mirror and struggled to remove his pink spaghetti strapped feminine vest that he was now wearing.  The bra soon followed, until he was topless.  Strangely, none of the other times he'd been topless, did he feel as naughty, as he did, right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg put his hands under his nipples and gave them multiple squeezes.  His areolas seemed to shrink until they were still larger than his male areolas.   But his nipples were fantastic they had grown until they were at least a quarter of an inch long and just as wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Greg gently grabbed both nipples and gave them a tweak followed by rolling them between his fingers.  He was now experiencing a moist, rising heat, from his flat crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Foreplay, that was the key to a female orgasm.  Greg would have to gain access to his hot female crotch, only then could he be assured of an orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He pulled his worn, well-used, female trainers off of his little female feet and then he rolled his jogging bottoms down to his ankles and popped them off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh good... pink panties!\"  He said as he grabbed them and inserted his thumbs inside of the waistline.  Then he slowly shuffled his hands down his legs, watching for his, hopefully, blonde pubic hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Yes, there they were, Jill was a natural blonde, not a bottle blonde.  He was so relieved, he had almost expected her to be a bottle blonde, even though he had seen her blonde eye brows, but there was only one way to be certain; and now he had proved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg kicked his panties onto the end of the bed. Now he could feel the coolness of the air, in the room, on his lower lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Jesus, Greg, are you... hot to trot?\"  He asked himself as he sat on the bed and felt the cool sheets on his vagina.  He scooted up the bed until he could feel the headboard with his head.  Then he lay down feeling his breasts as they aimed for his recently shaved armpits.  His butt still felt huge to him; it was taking up more of the bed, than he was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Then with a lot of apprehension he moved his hands to that still unfamiliar opening between his legs and felt the lips that were there.  Greg then felt like making manoeuvring room, so he opened his legs wider than he thought was possible, and placed his hands at the top of his legs, on either side of the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Now what?\"  He asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Just play it by ear!\"  He advised himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You will know when you are close... when you are doing it right!\" he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He moved both index fingers around the edges of his opening; then feeling more adventurous, he put his left hand, palm covering his pubes and fingers on each side of his slit and separated his index and middle fingers. This caused his lips to part and exposed his innards to the still cool air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This in turn caused Greg to shiver as a fascinating sensation went up his spine, causing his nipples to tighten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Don't forget your nipples!\" Greg said as he moved his right hand up to them and gave each of them several flicks with his right index finger nail, until both of them were erect again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then he moved his right hand, back between the fingers of his left hand, and probed lightly INSIDE of himself, using just his index and middle fingers; those fingers felt the warmth of his feminine crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Then satisfied that he understood which direction the vagina went he removed his left hand and gave both nipples another couple of flicks followed by twisting his nipples like a radio button.  This caused his nipples to stand FULLY erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Don't forget what you are really here for!\"  Greg said outloud as he remembered what he was supposed to be doing in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg then started moving his right hand, that was still inside himself, inwards and outwards building up a delicious friction, which caused him to feel like he wanted to melt into his own hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But he wasn't even started yet... this could only get better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Greg continued pumping his own right hand fingers inside his own crotch, attempting to attain his goal of a female orgasm, before Louisa returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  There was a knock at the door while Greg was whimpering and groaning, Greg bit his lower lip in response.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In actual fact, Greg didn't decide anything, it was Louisa who decided for him. \"Sit down!\" she ordered him rather bluntly...gently placing her fingers between his ample breasts and pushing him back onto his bed. His bed wasn't that comfortable, but the 'extra padding' he now had on his backside made for a soft landing. \"Now don't move, don't say anything...and just observe what I do\" Louisa then cooed. \"Oh...and try and keep the moans down to a minimum\" she winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg felt Jill's healthy heart pounding away in his chest as he watched...and felt Louisa removing Jill's running shoes from his slender feet, and then she grabbed the bottoms of 'his' jogging pants and pulled them off, revealing his long, supple (and smooth) legs. \"I always wanted legs like this!\" Louisa murmured as she ran Mimi's dainty hands up and down Greg's new legs. Using her Japanese housemate's fingers she then took hold of Greg's knickers...and pulled them off too. \"Oooh...shit!\" he moaned, as he felt the cool air caress the neatly trimmed vagina that he now had nestled between his feminine thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel being a girl?\" Louisa suddenly asked him quietly, as she began tracing the outlines of Jill's moist pussy, making Greg moan even more. The lack of a coherent answer told Louisa what Greg was thinking right now. He was loving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa then maneuvered herself into a position so she could lower her head towards Greg's crotch, and so she was sat with Mimi's sock-clad legs underneath her. As she got closer, she could smell the sweet scent of Jill's sex, mixed with the smell of tousands of sweat drops that had formed during her run. Louisa smirked a little, then exhaled...blowing hot air on Greg's 'snatch'. He just closed his eyes and tipped his head back as he fidgeted on the bed. He was feeling REALLY horny now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, enough teasing!\" Louisa suddenly remarked, as her tongue exited her mouth and licked her lips. Greg looked up just time to see Louisa 'going in', and he groaned quite loud as he felt her tongue make contact with his labia...and skilfully work its way inside his new orifice. Greg had to wonder whether Louisa had done this before, since she seemed to be so good at it. As she lapped away at his crotch...he began down the path to what would undoubtedly be an unbelievable orgasm. Louisa seemed to do everything right...he assumed, not that it would take much to make him cum. Simply having Jill's gorgeous, fit body from the neck down had got him halfway there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...GOD!\" he moaned...biting his bottom lip as he reached his orgasm, and a grinning Louisa was there to eagerly lap up Jill's bodily fluids as he came. \"Shit...that was amazing!\" Greg exclaimed, somewhat out of breath as he gazed past his large, clammy breasts and into Louisa's eyes. \"Sod going out for a run, this is the only work-out I'd need if this body was really mine\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd enjoy that!\" Louisa nodded, as she savored the taste of Jill's 'nectar'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an understatement,\" Greg mumbled, tipping his head back again, \"and the funny thing is...I'm ready to go again\" he said with a cheeky smirk. All what he'd heard about women being able to experience orgasm after orgasm must have been true, and he definitely wanted more having experienced most of what Jill's body had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not licking you out again\" Louisa giggled, \"but maybe there's something else we can do...\" she then smirked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do me!\" Greg replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Louisa thought that Greg's head, whilst good looking, looked out of place on Jill's body.  So she slid her female fingers across the device for the last time, and swapped it for Jill's head and voice.  Then she swapped her own female body for his male body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Louisa now had Greg's head and body and voice, while Greg was just a girlie like the original Jill, now she felt in control again.  Being Jill was just a means to an end, her parents had trained her well in femininity, so she could easily handle Jill's body.  In fact she really thought that being breasty Jill, had brought her distaste of being female, to the fore of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But how else could she take revenge on the society that had created her... disappointment?  The man and woman who were primarily responsible for her being a girlie girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Louisa never wanted to wear skirts; she would have burned them all.  Except her mother would have brought, or made, her some more.  Finally her father had created a way out of this mess, for her, and now she was a 6-foot tall male she was NEVER going back to being a soft little 5 foot 5 inches tall, skirt wearing, girlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  So Jill was now 6 inches shorter and a different nationality... at least she was still the same sex.  Greg was just an inch shorter but he would have to get used to being a different sex.  That just left Louisa who was gloriously male and seven inches taller, and was now the sex that she was always meant to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Louisa looked at the totally female Greg, who was panting on the bed, ready for more.  More of what she was now equipped to give him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"God!\"  Louisa exclaimed, she had only been male for a few seconds, and now she had a 'woman' begging her for sex.  Life as a male was good... and it would only get better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Louisa looked down at her crotch, at the penis that seemed to be growing out of her, and she didn't believe that it was... already getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Honey... what's wrong?\"  Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Nothing, it's just... that thing!\"  Louisa vaguely said, stalling for time, as she'd suddenly felt really guilty about everything and nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, I've already spoken to my parents about it and they're okay with me doing it, just as long as I keep the same surname.\"  Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Huh?\"  Louisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You know... about me having a guys first name!\"  Greg stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh that!\"  Louisa said although she had no idea exactly what he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It doesn't matter how well you try to hide it, I can tell that it makes you uncomfortable, but try looking at it from my point of view.  Me with my guy's name am planning on sleeping with you, with your girlie name.  It's lucky we don't have to give certificates about it afterwards, otherwise it would say that I slept with another girl, and you slept with another guy, wouldn't that be silly?  Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Err... yes!\"  Louisa said finally catching what he was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Have you thought much about it for yourself?  Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Err no.  I feel like a Louisa, and it doesn't bother me that much.  Plus British legal documents don't mean shit back home....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh wow!  You said shit!\" Greg said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yeah so what?\" Louisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"... And it didn't even sound forced, it just sounded entirely natural!\"  Greg stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"So?\" Louisa queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"So... do you want me to tell your parents that you now, in English, swear with confidence?\"  Greg giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh god, no... don't even joke about it!\"  Louisa replied... she was sure that her parents would still see her as their own little girl and would ground her for a month when she returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Does Louisa 'demand' the wristband, the remains of which are currently around his right wrist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Or does she 'do' Greg with his own penis?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg Perry - A typical 18 year old British student interested in football, beer and (the opposite) sex. He is 6 foot, has short brown hair, light brown eyes and a slim physique. He rarely wears anything more adventurous than jeans and a t-shirt. He 'studies' law in between going to the pubs and clubs around campus and playing football with his friends.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa Mendoza - A very reserved, shy and self conscious Spanish 18 year old who happens to be studying Law along with Greg. Just like her personality her appearance is fairly meek and unremarkable; shoulder length black hair, and a very skinny and modest figure. This, coupled with her fairy average 5'5 height means she tends to blend into the background, though she is quite pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill Cooper - A pretty and athletic American 19 year old studying to be a P.E. teacher. She has apparently endless energy joining as many sport clubs possible rarely stopping to rest. This has inevitably led to her being in peak physical condition with a surprisingly curvaceous body. Her height of 5'11, long blonde hair, crystal blue eyes and amazing breasts making her a target for many of the male students.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi Kawasaki - A bubbly and outgoing 17 year old Japanese Maths student. She is regarded as somewhat of a genius and would have perhaps finished her degree by now if it wasn't for the many male distractions. Her amazing intellect is coupled with her beauty, which perhaps explains her numerous boyfriends, to make her quite a popular lady. She has long black hair that extends beyond her shoulders, dark brown eyes and a 5'3 figure most girls her age would be proud of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan Omondi - An outgoing, good looking British 19 year old studying for a degree in English. His Kenyan parents are good friends with Greg's which naturally led to the two boys becoming good friends, and rivals, as well. They have known each other for most of their lives sharing a keen interest in girls, video games and alcohol which has kept them close friends despite their difference in studies. He stands at a lofty 6'4 and his passion for Track and Field events have kept him in good shape.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Alice Springer - A 32 year old lecturer and tutor of Law. Her erratic temper and strict attitude and work ethic has caused her to be both feared and respected by her students and colleagues. Her small stature (she is only 5'2), librarian glasses, and her all round attractiveness contrast her fierce nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha Perry - Greg's 39 year old mother. A generous and kind hearted woman though she is more than a little over protective. Considered by many of her son's friends to be a milf, much to his annoyance. Her ample, but firm bust and buttocks, as well as her often less than conservative dressing style grab the attention of many a passersby. She has greeny-brown eyes and medium length dark blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie Perry - Greg's 15 year old sister. Though she would like people to think she was more mature than she was, Natalie is prone to being very childish at times. She and Greg share a close relationship, though they are prone to heated arguments. She is more petite than her mother, but still shares her natural beauty. She has chestnut brown hair and light grey eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa Mendoza - Louisa's 23 year old sister. Rosa has shared a strong rivalry with her little sister since the day she was born. This has resulted in many an argument with Rosa almost always coming out on top. She is often quite arrogant and has a tendency to talk down to people. Her natural good looks get her a lot of attention, much to Louisa's chagrin, and she is prone to stealing using her charms to steal other people's boyfriends, again much to Louisa's chagrin.</span></div></div>",
