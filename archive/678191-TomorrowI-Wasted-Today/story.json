You lick your fangs in anticipation as the group moves closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, these are not dinner.  These are the only hope for your future.  You lean back against the brick wall and cross your arms, wondering why you must stoop to alliances.  You are powerful, untouchable, rare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run your fingers through your thick black hair that hangs just past your shoulders.  You wish you had taken advantage of the lonely woman who begged for death.  At least then you wouldn't be tempted to damn the mission and feast upon the willingly innocent before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey step into the dim street lamp's circle of light and you shut your eyes briefly.  You can hear their blood circulating, smell their fear, hear their hearts pound beneath tender flesh, smell their sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ernoth?\"  Comes a sweet tendril of purity, a young woman standing closest, smelling sweetest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my dear, but do not call me that.  The name is Bloome.\"  You say as you open your eyes and drink in her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Lily.\"  She says, her human form young and shapely, her dark green gown clinging to her maiden form.  You swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Snarl.\"  Comes a deep growl.  You roll your gaze over to the troll whose stench is overpoweringly strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Shyntar.\"  The dark skinned man moves forward and tosses his thick cloak over his shoulders, showing you his sharp sword.  You fight down a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warrior?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worse than that.\"  He says and you know not what he speaks of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Eternelle.\"  Comes the lilting female voice.  You start, realizing for the first time that an elf stands in your presence.  A vampire and an elf...now there's a pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Ryan Shard.\"  The oldest member of the group says and you incline your head slightly.  \"Yes, vampire, I am a wizard.\"  He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\"  You reply.  You know you must choose one of them to accompany you but you feel the hunger of blood pressing so near you.  \"I will decide tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow?\"  Ryan asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can rest here.\"  You say as you indicate the hotel against which you are leaning.  \"They are very discreet.\"  You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\"  Eternelle replies and you allow yourself to bask in her purity.  Even the purest mortal pales beside an elf.  Even you, a hardened vampire, would never drink the blood of an elf.  The consequences are too great, the death too painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou straighten up from the wall and lead the group inside.  As you all seperate, you head for your room, your mind racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why must I choose only one?\"  You ask the shadowy figure that occupies the chair in the corner of the small room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said one.\"  It hisses as you lay upon the bed.  \"You complained so much I assumed you only wanted one.  Take all of them for all I care!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.  Two will be enough.\"  You say as you stare at the open curtains.  \"Don't you need to close these?\"  You ask coldly.  You are the only vampire able to live through sunlight.  A blessing...and a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  I will be gone before the sun rises.\"  It hisses and you shut your eyes.  \"When will you choose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow...I wasted today.\"  You say as you fall into comfortable slumber.</span></div></div>",

However, her fingers have stopped drumming on the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have it your way,\" you say as you rise to your feet. \"If the two of you are ready to go we should head out. We can discuss the mission on the way.\" Both Lily and Shyntar follow suit and stand up. Lily places some coins on the table for her meal. Shyntar likewise places a coin on the table for his ale, despite the fact that he did not drink a sip. Smiling you lead the two outside where everything is ready.</span></div></div>",

You try to recall who he is but you can't bring a name to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You ask as you look over his shoulder at the tavern's door. \"I paid.  I paid <i>double</i> actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have not paid enough.  You killed my brother.\" The man says, his voice harsh and emotionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your sister more than likely.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a sister.\" He growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then consider yourself blessed, for, if you had a sister, she too would have fallen prey to me.\" You say as you suddenly remember his brother, who looked so much like the man before you.  As he moves forward, you reach up and grab hold of his head, giving it a cruel twist.  A snap is heard and you smile slightly as his large body falls to the floor.  No one pays you any mind as you step over his body and out into the bright sunlight.</span></div></div>",

Death, whenever it came to claim you completely, always excited you when you beat it, once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the Inn and see Ryan tracing a shape carved into the table.  He is tall and slender, even sitting, but you can see the shape of his muscles through his thick clothing.  You silenty think that you never want to be on the recieving end of his vengeance. Shyntar is nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close in on him, trying to avoid alerting him of your presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are here, Bloome.\"  He says as he continues to trace the crude carving with his index finger.  \"When do we leave?\" He asks, his voice deep and soothing, reaching you effortlessly although you swear he is whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon. Where is Shyntar?\" You ask and he shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, we wait then.\" You say as you take the chair opposite of him and wave the serving wench over. \"Ale.\" You say.  The girl leaves to fulfill your request.  The sway of her hips brings a smile to your lips.  Ryan lifts his gaze from the shape on the table and lifts an eyebrow. \"What?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A vampire drinking ale?\"  He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And walking in sunlight.\"  You reply coldly.  \"Where will it end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan shrugs and returns his gaze to the shape on the table top. You look away and wait for your ale to arrive. You won't pay for this ale, you decide, since the last time almost got you killed.</span></div></div>",

You watch him stand at the base of the wooden stairs, his dark gaze sweeping the oblivious people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at Ryan, wondering how much power he truly possesses and how much is just tricks.  You lean back in your chair as he lifts his eyes and meets your gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very powerful, undead one.\"  He says proudly before lowering his gaze to the table once more.  \"Our long lost third has returned, evidently.\"  He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou allow your eyes to fall upon Shyntar as he steps away from the stairs and moves toward you.  His thick black cloak floats behind him like a dark angel's wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis steps are slow and purposeful, light and easy.  You notice how he seems to float toward you, his cloak drifting back with every third step, revealing the taunting glint of metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before Shyntar reaches you, you know who he is.  A slow smile touches your lips as you understand the importance of your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we prepared to leave?\"  Shyntar asks, his voice smooth as silk and just as cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the hurry?\"  You ask, content to bide your time.  Assuming your guess is correct, you allow your smile to broaden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Bloome, what you intend to do here?\"  Shyntar asks as he slides into the seat between you and Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave the maiden over and she places a fresh mug of ale before you.  \"Drink.\"  You say as you swallow.  \"And talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About?\"  Shyntar asks as he catches the girl's eye.  You are silently impressed at the haste with which she fetches his ale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean back, open you mouth and speak.</span></div></div>",
