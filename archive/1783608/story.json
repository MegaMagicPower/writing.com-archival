Not that much of a difference from how he had been, a balding, middle-aged loser and petty criminal with a very noticeable beer gut. The difference was age. This person was still in their teens (about 16 something told James) after all. James wasn't sure how it happened as one minute he was running through this forest in an attempt to ditch the police and the next thing he knew he was a chubby 16-year-old kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that James looked down and saw his body lying there on the ground. No movement, no breathing, nothing. It was dead and James finally understood what had happened. He had died and somehow this kid had happened upon his body and, through unknown means, James had possessed him. While if he was going to be a new person he'd rather not be a fat kid he still got a chance to essentially start over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny? Hey, Danny!\" came a voice from behind James. Suddenly he felt a tapping on his shoulder and at that moment felt himself being pulled and instantaneously he was looking out a new set of eyes at the teenager who he had just been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, Ryan!\" exclaimed Danny turning around. \"Sorry I kind of blacked out there for a few minutes. What'd you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Amy needs us to get back to the campsite so we can start packing up.\" James replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny just looked at James and grinned. \"Well in that case we better hurry huh? I'm sure you'd like the chance to show her how strong and reliable you are.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded and the two began walking back to the campsite. He wasn't sure how he knew any of that but his best guess was that being in a body gave him access to the person's memories and all of that. But what happened? Wasn't he in that fat kid's, Danny's, body? He had switched into Ryan's when Ryan touched him so looking and thinking about it he reached a hand out and touched Danny's shoulder. In an instant he was looking back at Ryan who was a gangly-looking kid. Actually Danny's memories of Amy showed that she was a bit of a geek too but in a way that was kind of cute and endearing so it seems, at least, that James' body had been discovered by a trio of geeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould be worse, he realized, and thinking he figured it would be nice to get a better handle on his abilities. Looking at Ryan, he \"tripped\" a bit and stumbled grasping onto Ryan in an attempt to catch himself. He concentrated, however, on <i>not</i> switching and much to his surprise (or probably not) he stayed in Danny's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, sorry about that man.\" said James. Still holding grasping onto Ryan he then concentrated on switching and in a flash he was back in Ryan's body. \"Don't worry about it. You tripped, it happens.\" James replied as Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they made it back to the camp where Amy was waiting for them having gotten started on packing things into her SUV... well her parents' SUV Ryan's mind reminded James. Amy had her own car but it wouldn't have been able to hold all of the camping equipment they needed. The trio got to work loading things in and James could tell, confirming what Danny said earlier, that Ryan had a massive crush on Amy. And after a while Amy had asked \"Ryan\" to help her get some stuff out of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the tent James, perhaps due to Ryan's hormones, admired Amy. Her brown hair was a bit unkempt due to the work and hung over her glasses-framed face. Her legs, shoulders and entire skin glistened with sweat brought about from the work. She was a geek no doubt but there was something about her, maybe it was her large breasts, that was undeniably attractive. The hormones and situation overwhelmed James and he lunged at her, pinning her to the ground. She started to protest but James forced his tongue into her mouth and began kissing her. She resisted but at that moment James, partly on instinct, switched into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy, James took the lead and eventually unzipped Ryan's jeans, reaching in and pulling his dick out. \"She\" began massaging his shaft giving him a quick handjob. \"God, Ryan, you have no clue how long I've wanted to do that.\" James said, \"Just don't tell anyone, you know how my parents are, and maybe there'll be more for you in the future!\" he exclaimed with a wink before walking out of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, at Amy's house, James laid on the bed in Amy's anime-plastered room in the afterglow of a quick but intense masturbation session. This power that he had been given, he realized, was incredible. He could be anyone and do anything, get back at the people who had wronged him in life, get any girl he wanted, be rich, be powerful... cause havoc! Nobody would be able to catch him and nobody would know, he could ruin the lives of others if he was so inclined or just use them for his own ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn life he had been a fat, dumpy, middle-aged loser. In death, however, he was anyone he wanted to be: from the handsome athlete to the powerful politician to the sweet anime loving 17-year-old girl whose body he now occupied. He smiled an evil smile that looked out of character for Amy. He now had all the power and he was going to have the time of his life with it.</span></div></div>",

And he briefly rubbed Amy's vagina through her clothing again...groaning as he did so. He then grinned once more before grabbing her car keys and heading out of the house. Getting into the car, he slammed the door shut, started the engine up and took a look at his \"borrowed\" face in the rearview mirror. \"You're not a bad ride Amy, you know that!\" he laughed to himself, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his delicate nose and then groping his stolen breasts in his petite hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, can't sit here masturbating all day\" James said to himself, before pulling out of Amy's usual parking spot, the tires of her car screeching as he sped away in the direction of Alice's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long to get there after he'd ran several stop signals and narrowly avoided a collision with cross-traffic. James parked Amy's car a short distance away from the front of his ex's house, and just sat there for a while, tapping his fingernails on the steering wheel and and passing the time with a little more masturbation. He certainly liked the way it felt being in a teen girl's body, geek or not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he needed a plan if he was to get back at Alice.

He needed someone closer to Alice before he could have his revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo James looked around the neighborhood for someone to \"borrow\". It was a nice neighborhood, not too shabby, but he had to admit Alice always had great taste even if they didn't agree on everything. Looking around he saw a couple of girls playing together. It was at that moment that he saw one of the girls was Danielle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames felt his his heart pumping faster as he looked at his little angel. James didn't see her for a few months since the divorce, but looking at her she made him feel proud again. \"Danielle, my little angel.\" He said looking at her longing. How he wished he could take her up in his arms again. But looking like this, she would never allow it. Although, he could use her body to get to Alice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't his first choice, but it was good to keep her in mind. James then looked around further again. The street was almost empty until a large Sedan showed up. James looked up as the Sedan was familiar to him. Almost like...Jessey!!! His wife's best friend. She was probably here for a visit. James wouldn't mind taking her body, she was hot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames decided to take...</span></div></div>",

He'd forgotten how hot she was since its obviously been a few years since he saw her, but she has sure aged well. She was a shorter brunette with a beautiful face and an athletic body, but more importantly to James, had just a perfect set of D-cup boobs, which were currently begging to be freed in her tight green t-shirt that she wore. James remembered all too well those big boobs, as they got him in trouble with Jessey and Alice several times when both of them caught him staring at them. For that reason, Jessey hated James, but for right now, James didn't care because he had the opportunity to use Jessey to get to that bitch Alice. Plus he wanted those big, juicy boobs to hang from his chest. It was a no-brainer for James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't really have a good plan to possess Jessey, so he decided the best option was to simply walk up to her. He began yelling, \"Jessey! Jessey!\" Jessey turned around, confused why some random nerdy girl was approaching her and calling her name. James walked up to her and gave her a big hug, enjoying the sensation of Amy's boobs being pressed against Jessey's. He then said, \"Jessey, it's so good to see you, it's been so long!\" Jessey remained weirded out, \"Um do I know you?\" James, still having his girly arms around the woman, could only give her a smile, \"Well of course you do, because I'm you!\" Before Jessey could even react, James concentrated and switched into her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, or now Jessey, smiled as he gave his huge tits a generous squeeze, \"Damn I've always wanted to squeeze these big knockers, just never thought it'd be while I'm in this bitch's body.\" James then pushed his old meat suit away, \"Thanks for the lift Amy, I'm sure I'll be using your sexy body again.\" Amy could only stand in confusion, as she had no idea where the last few hours of her life had gone, but James didn't care as had new priorities. Now as Jessey, James had easy access to his new \"best friend,\" his ex-wife Alice. He walked his way up to the door and rang the doorbell, eager to get his revenge.</span></div></div>",

More than two decades ago, the much younger and fitter James Corben was looking forward for the life ahead, his head was sporting more hair too. James wasn't born a criminal, his parents instilled honesty and hard work, a lasting lesson that continued for much of his life, even after the violent break up of his parents, which saw his father obtaining custody of little James Corben. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames felt the miniscule droplets of rain hit against his face and swiftly made his way inside, followed by other students who had the same thought. A deafening thunder could be heard and the sound of rain pouring down thereafter, but James didn't care about any of them. Calmly, he made his way through the bustling teens, Westfield High didn't impose a uniform on a student, but important events generally require one to be worn. James smoothly navigated Amy's body, once or twice, his attention was captured by certain students, but decided to walk on until he reached Amy's class, and easy task, considering he had made himself very intimate with his host's mind, prying into every nook and cranny of her secrets, as well as her body in the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Amy.'', a rather flustered Ryan greeted James. He was accompanied by Danny. ''Something's different about you today.'' The guy tried to call Amy's phone on the weekend, only to be told to talk later on Monday by James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother uncharacteristic smile popped on Amy's face. ''No, not really. Why?'', James knew he had Ryan on the grip of his hand, or rather, Amy's. James took down the hoody covering his host's head to reveal smooth flowing brown hair, but he didn't bother to change anything else of his host. He dressed Amy as she usually would, stretchy chino pants and plain t-shirt with a hoody over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ryan was about to say something, the bell rang, which sent him hesitating for a few moments before quickly scampering to his desk, while Danny made an abrupt exit to his class. As much as a geek she was, Amy wasn't that bright, which came as a surprise to James, who planned to rely on her brain to cruise through Math on first period. He did though, get a good look at the other students, some were definitely better looking than Amy, although less endowed. There were also a few jocks at the back of the class, not giving any attention to the Mr. Roberts at the front of the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a relieved sigh, James perked up. Another bell rang clear through the school indicating the end of first period and the start of the next one.</span></div></div>",

One caught his eye; a timid redhead struggling to pack up towards the front of the classroom. \"Easy pickings...\" he mumbled to himself as he approached the girl, the classroom otherwise empty.<br>\r\n\"Hi, how are you doing?\" he said in Amy's voice with a fake smile.<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh...\" the girl responded, not expecting someone to talk to her. \"I'm okay, I guess...\"<br>\r\n\"Have you been a bit bored recently?\" 'Amy' asked as she 'adjusted her bra'.<br>\r\n\"Uh, a little.\" the redhead answered. \"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna make sure you have a ton of fucking fun!\" he said as he straddled the redhead and went in for a kiss. It soon devolved into a sloppy, one-sided makeout session as James vigorously groped the redhead's body and his current host's. When he felt like the girl was about to scream, he switched bodies with her, letting Amy fall to the ground. The sudden perspective change caught him off-guard. Scanning his host's memories, her name was Anna, and she had a younger sister in middle school, a single mother, friends with the nerdy girls, and most importantly to James, two perky B-cups.<br>\r\n\"Not bad at all...\" he muttered as he looked down Anna's shirt to reveal her tits in a lacy bra.<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" Amy asked as she got up, confused. \"Is class over?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you just slept through all of it!\" 'Anna' responded with an uncharacteristic giddy tone. \"Better hurry or you'll be late!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, thanks...\" Amy muttered as she made her way towards the hallway with Anna by her side.<br>\r\n\"Seeya, gorgeous!\" James gave a sly wink as he grabbed Amy's ass, and then walked away, leaving the anime geek flustered and unable to respond.</span></div></div>",

Anna was more intelligent than Amy and James had no problem answering questions during Anna\u2019s classes. In between Anna\u2019s physics and history classes, James spent a free period exploring her body in a seldom used bathroom. He had been quite happy to get a look at Anna\u2019s body naked in the bathroom mirror.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAs James walked into the cafeteria he saw Anna\u2019s friends sitting at a table in the corner of the room. He walked towards the table and identified each of the girls sitting at the table. There was Gretchen, an African-American girl who was pretty quiet during school and played on the Girls\u2019 Varsity Soccer team. She was 5\u20198 with black hair tied back in a pony tail and an athletic body with B cup breasts. Sitting next to her was Whitney, she was petit white girl black hair and C cup breasts. Standing at 5\u20193 with large breasts Whitney didn\u2019t find interest in sports, instead she focused on leading the Model UN club. Across from the two of them was Samantha, a red head with a fuller body than Whitney. Samantha was interested in film making, she had started the Movie Critic club when the four girls had been in 9th grade. They created it to watch movies and put another extra curricular activity on their resumes. The club had a meeting after school that day. Whitney, Samantha, and Gretchen were discussing the movie selection for the meeting as James made it to the table.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nJames sat down and smiled like Anna normally would before pulling out the lunch Anna\u2019s mother had made. James had never heard of the movie before but Anna apparently really liked it, so he joined in on the conversation.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cLook I know we watched it last month but I really think the director\u2019s style sets it apart from any other movie from that time.\u201d James cut in. \u201cPlus I know Samantha has a crush on the lead\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nWhitney and Gretchen giggled along with their possessed friend. Samantha blushed a little bit.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHey! that\u2019s not the only reason I picked it!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cI happen to agree with Anna about the director, I think our two styles are very similar\u2026and yeah I think Mark is hot.\u201d She smiled as she said the last part. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe conversation at the table lasted the entire lunch period. The bell rang and the four girls packed up their things and began leaving the table. James had not been interested in the conversation at all but felt it necessary to converse to keep up his impersonation of Anna. He was more interested in Anna\u2019s body along with those of her friends. He was looking forward to a dark room with a loud movie playing in it for a more intimate setting to grope Anna\u2019s body more.</span></div></div>",

He had to admit, being a girl was kinda hot... certainly different, and being a teenager again was just awesome. But there was no way he was going to be sticking to just one body when there was over 7.5 billion people in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter masturbating for a while longer, James jumped up off Amy's bed and decided to hit the streets, despite it being 9:30pm. \"Honey, where are you going? Its late!\" Amy's mom, Jeanne, asked who she naturally thought was her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for a walk mother, don't get your panties in a twist, I'll be back soon.\" James replied, grinning as he glanced over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving a stunned Jeanne in his wake, James took Amy's geeky body out into the darkened streets, straightening her glasses on his borrowed face and then reaching up to have another feel of her tits on his chest. \"Who knew nerdy girls could have have such a big rack.\" James almost giggled in Amy's voice again. He walked off Amy's street and into the night, intent on causing some kind of ruckus to get some police to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, did he want to do this while he was in a teenage girl's body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short answer, course he did, and he knew exactly how to do it. And being in a girl's body was perfect, since as long as he was, James had a craving for cock. Amy might have been a geek, but she was a geek with a high libido and some nice tits to suck on, not to mention a sensitive pussy to bang. James made his way over to where prostitutes normally hung out sometimes, but was surprised to see only one 'working girl' on a street corner. She looked like a Latina, maybe mid 20's, 5'8\" in her 3-inch stiletto boots... which went nice with the short white skirt and black halter top she had on, exposing her juicy C-cups to anyone watching, including James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames knew that the police often patrolled this area, and his plan was to get caught soliciting with a guy. Thing was now, he wasn't sure whether he wanted to do the dirty in Amy's sweet, innocent body, or upgrade to the dark-haired Latina hooker across the street. Her body did look svelte... and inviting, and as James felt Amy's snatch tingling between his legs a little, he had to wonder whether his teenage host was actually bisexual. He was sure he'd have sensed that, but who knows, maybe he didn't know <i><b>everything</b></i> about a person after possessing their body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, James soon made his decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And without another word...James lunged forward...planting Amy's lips firmly on her mother's and shoving a hand down her pants onto her fabric-covered pussy. The usual struggle and muffled cries followed but it didn't last long, because James quickly switched into Jane's body...then drew away from a very confused Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think somebody needs to get laid sweetie, sexually assaulting your own mother like that, tut, tut!\" James chuckled to Amy. \"Tell you what, I'm sure young Ryan will be willing to get you into his bed if you just ask him\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames then looked down at his new body, in its late 30's but still in great shape, he ran his manicured hands over Jane's large D-Cup breasts and grinned maniacally. \"I can see where you get your big tits from sweetheart\" he then winked at Amy. \"Mom?\" Amy mumbled in shock and befuddlement, as she watched her own mother feeling herself up in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go back to your room sweetie, mommy's busy!\" James told the girl, before turning on Jane's modest, 2-inch heels and walking downstairs, idly chucking the towel he was holding to one side in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Amy had no idea what was happening.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he searched through Jane's memories, James found out that she was a rather horny woman...which meant he was now. He had her body...her sex drive. \"And hubby is at work!\" James muttered to himself, as a wicked grin formed on Jane's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect timing!\" James suddenly said, as an 18-year old boy walked past the gate, on his way to college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames quickly exited the front gate to the yard and jogged after the boy, feeling Jane's tits bouncing in her white lace 'prison' as he went. \"Excuse me kid!\" he said, as he spun the boy around and planted a kiss on him...while at the same time pushing him against a wall and running one of Jane's manicured hands over the boy's crotch. \"Nice huh?\" James laughed, drawing back for a moment and winking at the surprised college-aged boy. He then resumed his kissing and rubbing...drawing the attentions of several people nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say, am I a slut?\" James then asked the boy, who just stuttered in response, unable to make a coherent reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping a hand down the boy's pants, James took a firm hold of his now erect member and began 'tugging' on it, eliciting moans of pleasure from him. All the boy could think was how much better this was than college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show was cut short however when Amy leaned out of her bedroom window and saw her mother making out with a kid her own age. \"MOM!\" the girl shrieked in shock, causing everyone...including James to look up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya sweetie, just having a little fun, I'm horny!\" James again shrugged, with a smirk. \"But...\" he then said quietly to the boy, \"I suppose its time to move on right?\" he winked at him. For a moment...James tightened his grip on the boy's dick...then his vision blurred momentarily as he transferred his spirit into the boy's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the handjob lady\" James said to a horrified Jane, as she withdrew her hand from James' jeans and staggered backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!!\" Jane cried out, before looking around her and bolting back in her house, where an interesting conversation with her daughter no doubt awaited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some bitches just can't control themselves can they?\" James addressed the surprised...even amused bystanders, as he neatened his disheveled clothing and started walking down the street...still sporting the boy's erection. \"That's her reputation ruined I think\" he laughed to himself, wondering whether Jane's husband would find out about her 'public display'.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James was walking around aimlessly for a few minutes when he realized something. He has all of his host's memories. His current name was Matt, and he was a student at the community college down the street. He got relatively good grades, and sometimes got in trouble for partying too hard, but aside from that was a generally good kid. He also had a smoking hot girlfriend names Kelly, who he was on the way to see before being stopped by James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Matt. I think you're little girlfriend will be a nice place for me to stay. Let's go see her.\" He said to himself. He continued to walk and used Matt's memories to find out where he was meeting Kelly. They were going to meet for lunch in a local diner and then go to see a movie. James had a better idea for what to do afterwards though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got to the diner, James's jaw dropped at the sight of Kelly. She was tall and slim, with a curvaceous body that caused every guy in the area to stare at her. Her breasts were some of the largest Jame's had seen, and she had undoubtedly the best ass. She was wearing a short form fitting black skirt and a tight short sleeve shirt that was cute to give anyone interested, a view of her considerable cleavage. She had long golden blonde hair, and very cute blue eyes. Her golden tan seemed to radiate off of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's memories told James that Kelly was by far the hottest girl in college and  James could easily see why. Matt's memories also said, that despite her looks, she wasn't a slut. James had a feeling he'd be changing that as soon as he got into her skin. There was no way he'd let a bitch like that get away. Hell, he might even keep her body for some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, baby. did you miss me?\" Jame's said, giving 'his' girlfriend a kiss on the cheeks. He wanted to get inside that body of hers, but he wanted to have fun with it. He'd wait until she were comfortable and then take her over when she least expected it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. so how was your homework?\" she asked, referring to the work Matt said he had to do before meeting her. Matt didn't really have any homework, he just wanted to have extra time to prepare himself for their date. They had only been together for a week and he was still nervous when they were out together. Luckily, James was never the nervous type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good. But not as good as the time we're going to have today.\" James said, putting his arm around Kelly. Kelly smiled and looked up at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright? You seem...different.\" Kelly said, clearly noticing the change in personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess you can say I've had a bit of a personality change..\" James said, smiling to himself at the truth in the statement. He kissed his new girlfriend, and soon to be body on the lips passionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But let's talk about all this after lunch.\" he said. Kelly smiled at him. apparently she liked the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch had been pretty boring. The two of them just talked about different classes they were taking and teachers they liked and didn't like. It would have been hard had Jame's not had Matt's memories, but since he did, he was able to play the part perfectly. Once they finished eating, James payed the bill, using Matt's credit card and the two left hand in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember when I told you I wanted to see a movie?\" 'Matt' asked. Kelly nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You wouldn't shut up about how you wanted to see that new horror movie. About the guy who could possess bodies.\" She said. James laughed at the irony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I decided I wanted to do something else. Why don't we go back to your place and talk some more.\" James asked. Kelly smiled at him seductively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can do more than just talk...\" She said. Oh, this was going to be fun...</span></div></div>",

One handsome cop and the other a beautiful one. Both looked young, probably still in their mid 20s. As he answered, James began formulating a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, officer. My daughter who just came home saw a man openly holding a gun just across the street. It seemed like he was looking for someone. But then just after I called 911, I saw a car pulled up near him and he got into it. Then they just drove off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of car, maam? Did you see its license plate?\" the female cop asked, pulling out a pen and a small notepad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a black sedan, I don't know what type. I am not familiar with cars... Also, since I saw it from inside my house, I couldn't see its number clearly,\" James spewed out another lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Well maam, if you see another suspicious activity, you can report to us again,\" the female said, pocketing her notepad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much, officers. I am sorry for the trouble. Would you like to come in and have a cup of tea? Coffee maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much for your offer maam, but we are on duty right now. We'll take our leave, then,\" said the female cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, then please wait here a minute. Please,\" James said as he turned around and jogged to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was happened to buy a dozen of donuts earlier today, and she had just re-heated them on the microwave before James took over. James took a small paper bag from a shelf and put 4 donuts in it, then ran back to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, please take this. They are still warm, but you can eat them whenever,\" James said, holding out the paper bag towards the female cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we will take it then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grabbed the bag, James casually brushed his fingers over the cop's hand, subtle enough that her partner didn't see it, but enough for James to transfer himself to his new body. James smiled as he saw the bewildered Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you and stay safe, maam,\" James' new partner said, replied by stuttering approval from Jane as she closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked back to patrol car and put on their seat belt. Soon after the car drove off, James rolled up the paper bag and peered inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we have there, Al?\" The male co asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Several donuts, Lex. Do you want some?\" James replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later...\" he said, focusing on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, or now Alliana smiled at his partner Alex. He picked a donut and started munching. He liked his new body so far. It felt lighter and more fit than the two mother-daughter earlier. Looking down, James saw that Alli's breast were a little too small for his taste, but he could cope with it. Unfortunately, he couldn't feel his body around with Alex driving beside him. James paid attention to Alex as he devoured his second donut. Alex didn't look like an overly built muscle cop like in some movies, but he sure looked like he spent a lot of time at a gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished his donut, James remembered that after coming to Jane's house, Alex and Alliana...</div></span></div></div>",

The other workers just put it to old Howard's eccentricity, the head gardener could be a bit odd sometimes but he was a great boss and friendly person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Howard, James walked up to the front door and rang the door bell. When the mayor opened it, James grinned widely to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening Mr.Mayor!\" He said, adopting his host's mannerisms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor privately wondered why his head gardener was ringing his doorbell but after nearly 40 years of loyal service, he supposed he owed it as a favour to him. \"Good evening Mr.Gibson, how may I help you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mr. Mayor, I had a question about the new hire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What new hire?

In an instant, he felt himself now wearing a silky black suit with a crisp dress shirt and tie. Turning around, he smiled at his old host and who was now his head gardener. \"Good evening Mr. Gibson, how may I help you today?\" repeating what the mayor had said to him while he was possessing Howard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward looked extremely confused and quickly excused himself, muttering something about getting too old for the job.

He can control whether or not he jumps into a body when touching someone and when possessing them he gains instant access to all of their memories in order to effectively \"be\" them if he so chooses.  Likewise James exists <b>only</b> as a spirit as his physical body is dead and thus unusable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames is a character with no particular morals.  As he was a loser and a criminal in life, his death left him feeling bitter, hateful and resentful at the world.  With his new power, he feels that he can get revenge and do anything he wants without impunity and thus he can, and most likely will, abuse his power for whatever desires he may have no matter how depraved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I feel that new rules or anything of that nature needs to be specified I'll add it here.  Otherwise enjoy and be sure to add.</td>",
