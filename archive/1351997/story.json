Remember when you tried to kidnap Mario and Luigi when you were a child, and we can time travel with E. Gadds machines. Well I thought why not stop their parents from meeting, that way they wouldn't exist, to stop you.\" Kamek said while standing up exposing his stomach. \"Well, how do we get Gads machine without alerting someone.\" \"We could buy it, like we did with my paintbrush, and his portrait ghost machine to free king Boo.\" said Jr. whose face was covered in cake. \"Yeah, that's right he always was a sellout, let's send him a request.\" Bowser said, while unhooking his wristbands, allowing his arm some freedom.</span></div></div>",
