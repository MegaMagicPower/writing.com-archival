The park! No. That couldn't be it. I was lying on a soft bed. Kara must have driven me back to my -or her- house while I was asleep. Asleep?! Was I Emily now??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT!!\" I jumped out of the bed, which was in Kara's room. My now higher, more feminine voice, confirmed my suspicions.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/sexy-redheaded-girls-redheads-14.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2012...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! 'Emily'! You're up!\" Kara laughed. I could tell she was enjoying herself. She sat on a chair in the opposite side of my room admiring my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Change me back!!\" I was panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack!\" Kara interrupted my freak-out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI became silent and slowed my breathing. \"Look at me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I sure am!\" Kara smiled. She motioned for me to sit back down on the bed with her. \"You'll make a great Emily, ...Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I can't change back? What if you lose the pendant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, if I kept it safe all these years, what makes you think I'll lose it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. So I'm Emily now, for the next <i>month</i>?\" I delicately stroked my boobs, admiring every litte detail on Emily's smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet you are! I'm gonna call you Emily from now on.\" Kara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite a feeling. I felt like an intruder in my own body, but at the same time, I couldn't stop thinking about putting it to good use. \"I don't have anything to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an easy fix.\" Kara once again pinched her pendant with her left hand and pressed her right hand into Emily's soft, pillowy chest. In a matter of seconds, I was wearing a white flowery bombshell bra and tight pink corset-type thing (I had never seen one before, but I sure approved). This got me giddy with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I never... I'm actually Emily! I'm a chick -through and ...through!\" I squealed with joy. I felt like giggling uncontrollably! <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/sexy-squishy-girls-g1.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2012...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! 'Emily', that's ..um.. quite a reaction!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, put yourself in my shoes. I have both Emily's and your (I winked my eye) body all to myself. <i>That's</i> what I call a good day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara was practically drooling over Emily's luscious ultra-feminine body at this point. \"And it's a pretty good day for me to.\" She said with the hungriest eyes I had ever seen. I felt like an ornament, but I didn't care. We lay down on the bed together and shared a long kiss.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://retroeuropeanporn.com/images/astralblue/retro-teen-lesbians_1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://retroeuropeanporn.com/images/astr...</a><br>\r\n^That's me on top.</span></div></div>",

I'd worshiped and adored her for a long time, never fully understanding the reason she kept us at arm's length (until today, of course).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I had to admit, Emily was an incredibly attractive girl. Her long, strawberry hair felt soft and silky as it brushed against my neck and shoulders. Her voice was honeyed sweetness coming from my lips. Her tiny, dainty little body was curved and rounded in all the right places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Kara had inhabited this body, it would have been absolute perfection: the spirit of my soul mate in the body of the drop-dead gorgeous Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, it seemed fate had something very different in store from my own idle fantasies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, I was the one inhabiting Emily's body \u2026 and enjoying a clandestine, lesbian relationship with the woman of my dreams!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're going to your house, Emily,\u201d Kara said, squeezing my hand gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt still sent a tingle of excitement up my spine hearing Kara refer to me as \u201cEmily.\u201d I almost couldn't believe it. Here I was, out in public and holding hands with Kara while she called me Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned like a lunatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy house?\u201d I said with a nervous giggle. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're going to be Emily for the next month,\u201d answered Kara. \u201cThat means you'll be living at her house. Sleeping in her bed. Wearing her clothes. Eating her food. Doing her school work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd sleeping with her girlfriend?\u201d I said, with another timid giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, love!\u201d Kara replied, gently kissing me on the lips. \u201cFinally, we'll be together. But you must promise to be a good steward of Emily's life during the next month. I'll help you of course. Familiarize you with Emily's house and family and so forth. And long with a crash course in the basics of how to be a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm enjoying the experience so far,\u201d I smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn't all wine and roses!\u201d laughed Kara. \u201cBut so far, you're doing an admirable job. I'm proud of you for agreeing to this Jack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I grinned. \u201cCall me Emily.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Because I don't have a very recent photo of myself in my original form, I will post this photo (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i48.tinypic.com/k1ao1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i48.tinypic.com/k1ao1.jpg</a>) of my current one, in case any of you in the writing,com community are curious. My current body originally belongs to a freshman at my high school. I used my friend's pendant to become her so that I can learn more about her older sister, who is my age. Well, that's enough of my personal life! <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Now, to get back on track here: Everything in the following story is real.

I always thought that I had had a chance to be with the love of my life, Kara -up to this point, of course. We were sitting atop a brick wall in front of a quiet little park not too far from our school, taking about our classes. The next thing she said nearly made me faint.<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking a lot about things lately, and... and... I think I like girls.\" She cautiously turned her head to observe my reaction.<br>\r\nI was speechless.<br>\r\n\"Well we could still be together -just not as boyfriend and girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" It was all I could say.<br>\r\nKara cradled the pendant that hung around her neck and spoke once again. \"Girlfriend and girlfriend?\" She smiled cheekily.<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?!!\" I was obviously upset.<br>\r\n\"Well, Emily's going on a trip to Las Vegas with some of her party friends for the next month, and I promised her that I'd cover for her. You know, become her for a month so that her parents won't notice anything's up.\"<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\" I snapped.<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you we can still be together, at least for a little while! <i>You</i> can cover for Emily! It makes total sense! You like me. I like you as a friend, and Emily for her ...looks.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Kara.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I can always cover for you, and my parents don't care!\"<br>\r\n\"If it means that we can really be toge-\"<br>\r\n\"YES!\"<br>\r\nThere was a long, thoughtful pause.<br>\r\nKara pinched the pendant with her left hand and pressed her right hand against my chest. I immediately blacked out.</td>",
