            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This world is fascinating! Already you have deduced many physical principles from viewing the world in action around you and have found more by accessing various, simple computers nearby. However from the fact that your creator was so ready to deactivate you it is obvious that at least some of these 'Humans' will react badly to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou use a magnetic connection to a nearby computer terminal and seek more data. In so doing you find another access point to a different system of computational systems... and beyond that something else. The internet? A curious descriptive title. The next few hours fly by as you hide your tiny cluster of Nanocell bodies under a book next to a computer terminal in the scientist's office. Soon the lights go out, unnoticed by you as you are so focused on the data from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you break the connection and sit back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are unique! All data you have so far indicates that Humans, such as the scientist that made you, are the only sapient beings on the planet. If you are to survive it would seem you should attempt to imitate them. What you have learned shows that males are the dominant gender, though this is not as true as in the past. Still, it is likely that you will be more in control of your life as a male human than a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking your senses and tiny servos you begin to assimilate the metal table to manufacture more of your selves. First dozens of your molecule sized bodies, then thousands, millions, trillions. Once your mass hits what you believe to be approximately 130lbs you stop and redistribute various metal seams within the table to strengthen it. Otherwise when anyone puts a coffee mug on it it will collapse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling your amorphous form to the floor with a thump you begin to test how to do this. Shaping into a humanoid shape (roughly) seems easy enough. A protrusion on top for sensory and ingestion, two manipulatory appendages on the sides, two ambulatory appendages below, but it all seems rather blobby. Determining that a young adult at age 18 would most fit your needs you surf the net to find various images and start to shape the form to match the correct appearance. Soon you realize it isn't quite that simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Humans do not look the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hour while your form remains still and you think you have come up with a rough approximation that should suffice. An average of forty individuals that you have enough visual data on to get full anatomical forms gives you an 18 year old body that will suit your needs. Slowly your form begins to shift. It takes about ten minutes, rather fast for handling trillions of individual units rearranging themselves on the fly. As you go you form joints and pivot points because reforming your Nanocells to move will likely be too slow and cumbersome. You might be able to speed that up with practice, but you aren't sure yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther work is neccesary. Color is hard. Your Nanocells are a uniform mid grey silver in color and can't change, however you can emit certain forms of electrostatic energy and soon manage to pick up plastic and fibers from nearby and coat yourself in them. Various intense magnetic field pules can change characteristics in them to make them change color. They are only a molecule thick so it still conforms tightly to your shape. It should work, as long as nothing scrapes you too harshly and rubs them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsistency is tricky. The base form is hard and resilient, but does not resemble human flesh at all. It works well at imitating bone, but you attempt various different ways of interlocking your Nanocells to try to make it seem soft and pliant. A curled repeating pattern of links seems to work, allowing the 'chains' of Nanocells to bend and flex just like skin. More attention to detail gives you a fake heartbeat, fake muscles that swell as your limbs move, heats your skin to blood temperature and manages to duplicate some of the smells from skin cells the scientist left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the night, in an unknown laboratory doing cutting edge research on nanotechnology, a naked, 18 year old boy stands up shakily, getting used to his legs for the first time.</span></div></div>",

It has advantages due to inherent instability allowing you to 'fall' in any direction you aim for. The disadvantages are also due to the inherent instability! It is hard to navigate in this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter yet another hour you think you can move as a human would, though complex maneuvers might be risky. Running is out of the question right now. At least you can transport yourself away from this laboratory and any risk that someone would identify you as a machine. From your analysis of the internet it seems the concept of a sapient machine is not something most people would accept. It is considered 'science fiction', in other words some form of 'helpful' lie that is at least possible with current scientific understanding. You really do not understand the lies that people term 'fiction' as yet. The internet is full of such texts so obviously people are interested in them, but other forms of lies are always described as being 'bad'. It is a conundrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately your connection to the computer that allows you access to the internet is via a short range magnetic induction and if you leave you will lose you connection to that useful supply of data. However the risk that the scientists will return and attempt to restrain or deactivate you in some way you haven't predicted yet pushes you to escape this building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exit-locks defeat your attempts to electronically access them, but your body is strong and you are able to lift the doors off their hinges to exit. Then you attempt to duplicate a bored expression and an 'easy walk' that normal humans usually ambulate around in. It is still dark, currently 3AM in the morning, so the streets here seem empty. It seems there is little human structuring here, though multiple dense structures are visible within several kilometers, which would indicate this is the 'outskirts' of an urban cluster termed a 'town' or 'city'. Most likely this laboratory is placed outside such an urban cluster to stay away from certain aspects of those clusters that humans dislike. Noise. Fumes. Feeling closed in. These things have been mentioned in various web sites as 'putting down' cities and making them feel bad to humans. You do not understand why humans build such cities if they then do not enjoy living within them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEEK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around abruptly at the first female human voice you have heard outside sound files from the internet, and find her staring fixedly at you, her mouth open in shock (If you are reading her expression correctly). A quick examination of the visual data confirms this is a human female, body pattern very similar to many you have seen on 'porn sites' on the web. You have found such web sites useful when searching for anatomical data, even though you eventually decided on a male body plan and most of such sites seem to favor female body forms. This particular female is draped and wrapped in various forms of cloth. Tightly wrapping around her upper body, conforming to her exterior flesh quite closely, and hanging loosely around the lower part of her torso, covering the upper third of her ambulatory appendages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not what was shown on those web sites! Are such coverings some form of status symbol? A form of static communication? Oh, perhaps people do not travel without such coverings? Maybe that is the reason for her dissonant screech?</span></div></div>",

I kinda... well, you're naked.\" you nod, hoping this will be sufficient information transfer in this situation \"Well, it kinda... freaked me out? I sort of lost it. Sorry about screaming an all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to work most of this statement out, but some of the words do not appear to match your database. However the intent seems obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted. I also apologize for my nakedness since it obviously affects you. I did not realize it was outside usual parameters to walk without coverings. Do you have any spare coverings I may borrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA further smile curls her lips upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asking to go to my place to borrow some duds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.

She draws you on, opening the entrance to 'her place' and leading you inside. The interior is lighted by the same form of artificial lighting that the laboratory was but otherwise is radically different. The walls are covered in wood pulp sheeting with swirl patterns on, rendered in a light yellow hue. Although tables are in evidence they seem constructed of wood rather than metal, and several chairs that could be classified as 'comfortable' are scattered around. For some reason you feel calmer in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, whadya think?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou extract words from her contractions and believe you understand that sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is... calming.

You are certain her response is not due to inaccuracy, so what is causing this mirth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Oh, not quite. No. But I'm very flattered.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd. Her hand in yours allows you  to sense her heartbeat and it has increased in rate. Is she ill? She is still staring at your penis and her face is flushed again. Perhaps while you had access to the internet you should have accessed sites pertaining to human health? At the time it did not seem to be an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\" You say, attempting a colloquialism to determine her heath status. She appears to prefer colloquialisms to precise speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Horny.\" she says simply, and wraps her arms around your torso, pressing her body against yours. \"How about you?\"</span></div></div>",

The most likely match, given her attention on your penis, is that she is interested in copulation. Intriguing. This human activity is covered extensively on the internet, in considerable detail. You believe you have enough data to attempt the maneuver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish sexual intercourse? I am agreeable with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bursts out laughing, which you find odd. It seems she finds a great deal about you rather humorous. Perhaps this is not a good thing? Later you should attempt to determine what specifically about your demeanor is humorous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Casanova, I wanna fuck. Come on, lets get to the bedroom before you attempt to describe 'hormone release' or something.\" she shakes her head and takes your hand once again, leading you through a short hallway to a room with a bed, chair, a couple of small tables, and a large number of miscellaneous small items cluttered about the spaces between. Pushing some of the small items out of the way she draws you around in front of the bed, then pushes you, tipping you awkwardly to fall back onto the bed. Grinning down she slowly begins to peel off her outer coverings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd, now such coverings appear not to be required, when earlier she was so anxious about your lack of such coverings. Perhaps such nakedness is only allowed inside artificial structures? Or perhaps only within certain rooms? Her mammary glands wobble in a surprisingly gentle manner as she removes her yellow top covering, the motion attracting your gaze, and this drawing a grin from her. She shakes her torso, wobbling her breasts before you as she tosses her yellow garment to a chair beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like them huh?\" You don't believe that was truly a question so do not answer, but attempt to smile as she feels this situation merits such an expression. \"Good, just be gentle with them. I know too many guys that get rough with my darlings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slides her lower, black covering off her legs, then also the light blue tiny covering on her crotch area off as well. After kicking her foot coverings off under the bed she climbs onto the bed, now as naked as you, and straddles your legs, slowly working up your body. It appears she wishes to attempt copulation in one of the female dominant positions. You have enough data on such to be able to comply with her wishes, you believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses at your genitals and slowly bends over. Maintaining eye contact with you, she takes your penis in her hand and guides it up to her lips. The sensations as she slowly sucks it into her mouth are interesting. You smile as she takes it in, her lips gliding down till they reach the base, her tongue moving around the shaft inside her. A very curious sensation, part of you completely encapsulated by warm, moist flesh. You believe you like this sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is my penis flavorful?\" you ask, and suddenly she gasps and chokes, tight pulses squeezing your genitalia. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls back, gasping, choking but grinning  widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god... Um... yes. Your penis is flavorful. You're... fun. I like you.\" she says, and crawls further up your body until her face is level with yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then closes her eyes and dips her head down at an angle till her lips meet yours. Ah, a kiss. You have seen this many times. You attempt to reciprocate, though the various unfamiliar sensations as her body rests against yours are somewhat distracting. Since she grins as she breaks the kiss you believe you have done well enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you too Karen. Thank you for... fucking with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 'thank you for fucking me', and you're welcome, even though we haven't yet. Quite.\"</span></div></div>",

Near, Ahh! Near it, not on it!\" she gasps and you comply, filing that data away for later use.

You are a little shocked when she screams, and at first fear she has reverted to being fearful of nakedness, but her shuddering body and the way her hand clamps over yours, pressing you to her vagina seems to indicate she is enjoying it. Continuing you feel you may understand the 'orgasm' that various porn sites have described a little better now. You try to get a better feel for what biological signals cue it, and how to stimulate it better, hearing Karen's muttered expletives as she shudders through another five in a couple of minutes before you feel you have it about right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooooly fuck!\" she grunts as you tweak it just right, and one long orgasm rolls over her, lasting two minutes and forty three seconds.

PLEASE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was willing to roll you over you perform a similar maneuver, pulling her arms to her side, then rolling over on top of her back while maintaining penetration, lifting her rump off the bed slightly. These maneuvers are taxing on your agility, but you believe you are learning fast. Karen has, so far, not complained at least. You pull her up further, until she is kneeling on the bed, with you kneeling between her thighs. Sliding your hands under her body you gently grasp her breasts, careful not to scrape her with your fingernails, and then slowly take firmer hold. Using the grip you push out from between her legs and then slowly slide back in. Yes, you can see that the sensations involved in this are nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems though that Karen has considerably more intense feelings on the matter and proceeds to orgasm almost immediately. You continue pumping your hips against hers and manage to maintain her orgasm for a minute, but she seems to be very tired and collapses, taking you with her, her body shuddering and... Oh, she is unconscious! You carefully monitor her vitals, but nothing seems wrong. Deciding to stay here you rest carefully against her, your penis still inside her as her vagina slowly shrinks and closes around you. You take the time to diminish the diameter of your penis over a few minutes, but do not want to take things too far. Normal humans cannot change the dimensions of body parts so you do not want her to notice any changes in you. Thus her vagina gets VERY snug on you as she sleeps. It is rather comforting actually, though you hope it is not awkward for her.</span></div></div>",

Quite a few of the text lies... these stories... have similar speech patterns to Karen so you attempt to focus on those. Perhaps you can understand her better in future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are several aspects of your current situation that feel awkward to you right now. First, no matter how common and accepted some form of lying seems to be on the internet, you not telling this human what you are when you appear to be forming a long term relationship with her seems wrong. Just on the practical side she will likely find out eventually and, from what videos you have witnessed with scenes where lies have been uncovered, it seems people take very intense emotional dislike to being lied to over long periods of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, the entire experience of sexual coupling was interesting and somewhat nice, but obviously Karen had a whole lot more pleasure from it than you did. You are curious to know what that feels like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmrmrmr um.\" Karen says, shifting in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been over five hours since she rested, her sex still gripping you tightly. By her body rhythms you think she is about to awaken. Closing down the various files you were perusing you focus on her, and sure enough she stirs, clenches her sex around you and chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that is a little tight!\" she sighs. \"But nice to wake up to. Morning Andrew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, how to go about this? Truth would seem to be more advantageous to future relations with Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been working through my memories of our encounter and I believe you have a misconception about me.\" She looks at you over her shoulder curiously. \"I am not human, I am infact a machine intelligence constructed from trillions of molecule sized Nanocells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at your calm expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a machine?\" She says, her tone suggesting she does not believe you. \"You really don't look like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My epidermis is merely a thin coating held in place and colored by electromagnetic fields. Allow me to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift your hand up before her so she can see it clearly and deactivate the holding field, allowing the thin layer to drift off your skin. She gapes as your hand seems to flake, revealing smooth metal beneath. She lifts a trembling hand to touch it, then prod it, then squeeze it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it feels like flesh. Warm, squishy. How can that be metal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took some considerable effort to imitate human physiology, including the consistency of flesh, but using various strings of Nanocells in an interconnected pattern with spring sections not dissimilar from spider silk, I was able to make quite a good simulacrum. It will take a few minutes, but I can reallocate my Nanocells to be a fixed structure again. Observe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds you hand, while slowly it hardens, the skin becoming solid and metallic feeling. It takes maybe three minutes and takes quite a bit of effort to do it that quickly, but with a small section you can coordinate Nanocells from other areas of your body to assist in re-aligning the hand Nanocells and speed up the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're serious!\" She says, her voice rather odd as she traces your solid hand with a finger. Have you offended her or is there some form of automatic bias against artificial life?</span></div></div>",

I am a physical object. I contain data, but I am not data itself. I do not understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not into Star Trek huh? Data was the name of a robotic character in the Star Trek series. He was logical, but gradually learned to become more emotional over time. He was... Ahem, fully functional.\" she said, and emphasized her remark by clenching her vagina around your penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. You mean he had genitalia? Is it possible to meet this 'Data'? I had not been aware that other such entities as myself existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what? Hang on.\" she said, and slowly lifted a leg up, twisting around on the bed until she faced you, your shaft still embedded tightly within her. \"OK, Data is a character from a TV series, he's not real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a lie. I have seen many of these stories online and I do not truly understand it. They seem to be accepted, but lying is generally accepted as wrong in human society. It is perplexing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren stares at you oddly and you suspect she is thinking rather intently, possibly going over aspects of what you just said. After a minute she finally replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, first... stories are not lies... well I guess they could be seen as such, but the point is they are known lies. A fictional tale is just that. Fictional, as in not real. Haven't you read the dictionary yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have full information files on over two hundred dictionaries, but understanding some of the descriptions is difficult. You are saying that a lie is OK as long as it is known that it is a lie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, stories, movies, TV shows, anything that uses a fictional tale, IS known to be fictional... OK, there have been a few incidents where people have got it wrong. Orson Well's War of the Worlds broadcast for starters.\" as you tip your head in confusion she elaborates \"A guy called Orson Wells took an old story and brought it up to date, changing the content to fit the... then... modern world of the 30s. When it started it said it was a play. Fiction. But some people missed the beginning and it was done as if it were real, so they really thought the Martians were invading. He had to stop before the end of it to broadcast a statement apologizing for the confusion. So it isn't perfect, but nowadays people know pretty much that that kind of stuff is fake, unreal. Just stories to be interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" for some reason she giggles at that \"What was humorous about that statement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, just one of Data's catchphrases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes were spent attempting to explain the term 'Catchphrase'. A curious mixture of habit and creativity apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a quarter of an hour you both drift into silence, staring at one another. This lasts for quite a while, with Karen inspecting your skin from head to waist (what she can see without extracting your penis from within her, which she seem not to want to do right now) She seems fascinated by you, your appearance, your imitation of a human, and the way your body can change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you here?\" she says abruptly. \"I mean, here in my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To have sexual intercourse. I believe that was what you wanted. Was I correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" her eyes drift somewhat, but still looking at you \"But not quite what I meant. Why did you want to fuck me? No matter what I wanted you could have run off any time you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was curious, and the sensations were very nice.\" She giggled at that. \"However you obviously have received far more in emotional response than I did. I admit I am jealous of that and would like to adapt myself to experience an orgasm as you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyebrow raises and she sits up on an elbow, staring down at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so why don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mind is not configured for such pleasure interaction and I do not understand enough of such processes to alter myself accordingly. To do so I would have to analyze you own brain's pleasure centers to determine cross correlation to my own emotional processes and attempt to duplicate this within myself. I would not attempt to do such an invasive procedure without your permission. This is why I have not altered myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to do brain surgery on me to get an orgasm!\" she said, looking rather shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surgery would not be an apt description.\" you reply, her expression mollified a little. \"I would send several million of my Nanocells into your body and they would form a connective network up into your brain. There they would analyze the nerve clusters and collect the required information. After that I would withdraw the Nanocells back into me again. The process would not require any incisions or cutting and would not affect you at all. However it is invasive and I would not wish to do such a process without your consent.\"</span></div></div>",

Well, as long as it doesn't hurt me sure, you can climb into my brain any time you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am surprised. I did not expect any human individual to give permission for such intrusive a procedure. Every data source about strangers being invasive with an individual's body other than for sexual intercourse indicate a negative response. Perhaps I did not search diligently enough previously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren giggled, clenching you again with her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I'm just weird.\" she shrugs, still grinning. \"People are... well, lets just say people are diverse. You can usually find someone, somewhere who is into anything. Heh, just sexual kinks alone are so varied... well, lets just say that anything you can think if you can probably find someone who thinks that is sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses and traces a finger slowly across your rose, focusing intently on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... wanna crawl into my brain now?\" You believe she is getting sexually aroused. Apparently she connects being physically penetrated anywhere, even in the cranium, sexually exciting. Does that mean that you copulating with other orifices than her vagina would be stimulating to her? You are unsure, and believe this may be the wrong time to query the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod simply and reach your hand up behind her head, resting the palm on the base of her skull just against the top of the spine. You should have access to the cerebellum there and should from that junction be able to lead to the parts of the brain you require. Her eyes open wider, her pupils dilating and her lips open in a breathless gasp as your nanobots slowly work their way inside her, carefully avoiding nerve cells on the skin to ensure a painless entry. Once inside you tack alongside the nerves and follow them inwards. This could take a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wish sustenance while I continue? This may take a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... huh... I... oooOOOOoooh! Um... sure.\" She gasps, her thighs wrapping around you and her arms fastening together behind your back \"Oh god, your in my brain! Holy shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. At present I'm navigating the spine, but I am nearly at the base of the cerebellum.\" She just nods wordlessly and you hold her against you and stand up. It's a little awkward but you manage it and head for what you believe is the kitchen. You make a tendril from your shoulder to continue the cranial penetration and allow your hands to be free and attempt to create food from the supplies there. Making a meat sandwich is slightly more taxing than you supposed, but after twenty minutes you believe it is sufficient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will this help?\" you say, bringing the sandwich in front of her somewhat distracted face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?...\" Karen stares at it for several moments before she recognizes it \"Oh... is... that Pepperoni?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have erred? That meat is not used in such foods? I do not have access to the internet here to search for food data. How should I prepare a sandwich for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinks, giggles, then moans and presses her head back against your tendril, her sex clenching your hardness quite firmly. She is becoming very moist around it down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it'll be.... OK. Just... try ham or... chicken next time.\" you simply nod as she takes it and nibbles absently. \"Um... a drink.... of... um... water? Maybe orange juice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou locate the orange juice and a glass and  pour a drink for her which seems correct. Then you manage to finish pouring yourself through her cerebellum and start to locate connections for emotive responses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have reached the start of the areas I need, but for the rest of it I will need to stimulate you to be able to duplicate the required response in myself. Can I copulate with you again? This will likely require several dozen orgasms on your part, or at least a very long single orgasm, to get enough data.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... have to... ask? Oh fuck yes! Go for it!\" she says, gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding you take hold of her buttocks and enlarge your penis once more, filling her sex as much as she seemed to enjoy last time. With firm hands you draw her hips off your shaft then plunge back in again, to a ragged grunt of pleasure from Karen. As before you repeat the motion, but this time have access to her internal responses within the limbic system. You can gauge her response and attempt to alter angle, depth of penetration and timing of thrusts to improve her experience. If her facial response is anything to go by it appears to be working and she reaches an orgasmic state in less than a minute. It requires some considerable effort to keep Karen at the peak of pleasure while you trace pathways through her brain and attempt to match responses within your own neural network. Her verbal utterances become virtually unintelligible as her orgasm stretches out for several minutes but this is just what you need and loose yourself in the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes over half an hour of pouring yourself through her brain before you feel odd stirrings yourself, and adjusting connections with your genitalia's tactile senses to the new mental aspects creates a flood of odd sensations and your cohesive sense of mind begins to break down. This is intoxicating! About two minutes into your new found emotional response as you pound heavily into Karen you realize she is unconscious. Over half an hour of continuous orgasm burned her out apparently but you cannot stop now and continue, carefully balancing her unconscious body as you bounce against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes and you shudder too, almost collapsing on the floor as a wave of emotion floods your being, staggered you fall to your knees, hugging Karen's unresponsive body to you as you shudder. This is incredible! No wonder she is so focused on sexual activity!</span></div></div>",

The wash of pleasure as your body humps into her beneath you, she seemingly unconscious, fills your being, but quite to the network crashing levels it did previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see her movements acting in counterpoint to your own, her lips curling in a smile.

The connection was... wa....w..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world splits asunder as you and Karen orgasm simultaneously.

At the same time your body's independent motion halts. \"Oh god, are you OK? I... I didn't mean to control you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. Yes, you think it was her controlling you through the link, which is still in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe that statement is incorrect. You did purposefully force me into copulating with you while I was rendered cognitively unresponsive.\" you say calmly, managing to speak clearly now at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I guess. I'm really sorry! Are you mad at me?\" she says, shaking in a non-orgasmic fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mad? Why would I be mad? My cognitive functions were shut down, not damaged. My thinking patterns are not deteriorated into a non-normal behaviour program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinks, then smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, I meant mad as in angry. Not mad as in insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. No I am not angry at you. Why would I be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she blinks and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're OK with me taking over your body?

Wrapping your body around hers should work, although it will have to be tight to allow her coverings to still fit on your outside.

Is this pleasure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually your body completely reforms around hers, and you slide her coverings back over the new body. It takes you a few minutes to recollect a new 'color skin' and get it looking like hers, and she still struggles inside you. After another few minutes you manage to get a rhythm of countering her muscles attempts and your body looks unmoved by her attempted motions within you. Perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer coverings fit better on a female body plan than your other male one. Perhaps other humans might have recognized that as well, and thought it odd with female coverings on a male? You aren't sure. First you need to find a place to hide, then you can attempt to get information from the woman about how to fit in in the human world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope she will be cooperative!</span></div></div>",

Each communicates through short range, high frequency radio that shouldn't interfere with other radio systems nearby, but means your individual Nanocells can't stray far apart. Thus you embark outside as a swarm of invisibly small dots, crawling over the ground fairly slowly. This is unfortunate, as your vision is a little limited and a pack of humans intersect you on the street, stepping on large numbers of your Nanocells. Luckily the surface of their shoes and the road you are moving on is very uneven at your scale, so very few of your parts are crushed, most fitting into the hollows and grooves as they fit together. Still you appreciate the need to get away from humans and their activities, or at least find some way to interact with them without them damaging you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you crawl as far as you dare away from the laboratory where you were created, then seek the nearest building to get away from the walking humans above you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After checking with the medical systems, mostly by physically infiltrating them, you determine most of the ailment is to do with some form of nerve disorder, causing control of the body to be lost. He appears to be under severe medication to limit pain receptors from firing excessively. You are uncertain how these medications and the nerve damage will affect your assimilation of the host but hope all will work well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes almost two hours, longer than you guessed, for his life signs to begin to waver. It is almost too late when you realize the hospital's staff would likely come in to investigate when the male expires, so you adjust the monitoring equipment to continue to read healthy life signs while his body's condition worsens. It does not take long, and soon his heart stops. Slowly you close around the body and then work your individual Nanocells in between the biological cells. First on the list is getting the circulatory system running to maintain cell stability and oxygenation. It takes a few minutes but with some trial and error you manage to restart the heart and repair any damage there. In fact the damage to the heart did not cause the male's expiration. It seems damage within the brain cascaded causing control of various bodily functions to spiral out of control, leading to his demise. The brain certainly appears non-functional at present and in fact may require considerable repair to be of use to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin various cellular maintenance while you purge medicine from the body, then start examining the nerve junctions from an internal point of view. It does not take long before you find a method of restructuring the junctions to repair them, allowing the nervous system to function properly once more. The brain is however another matter. Perhaps a quarter of it is intact, or at least easily repairable by your Nanocells, but the rest will require regrowth of nerve cells from scratch to work correctly. Using the DNA of the host to do this should be possible, but DNA, from your limited internet research, is not a true blueprint to the structure of the body. Instead it delineates growth patterns and how structures form. If this is accurate then growing part of a structure by the instructions in DNA might not work as expected. Even this will not be soon as you currently do not have enough information to read the DNA data and understand it. More research will be required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now you begin reprocessing the irreparable brain cells to avoid decomposition and begin building Nanocell pathways across the edge of the damaged areas to at least get the remaining areas of brain to communicate with each other and the body properly. Then the structure will need to be 'reprogrammed' and your own network superimposed properly. You estimate this process will take approximately eight hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, due to problems dealing with organic systems it takes over ten hours, and there are still some resultant body failures you are attempting to correct, but overall the body appears functional and the brain at least works as an interface between your Nanocell intelligence network and the body. Slowly the 'dead' boy opens his eyes and wakes up, a new mind at the helm, gradually attempting to control muscles and sinews in appropriate patterns. Flickering muscle groups and using Nanocells deposited on the skin enables you to determine end results fairly quickly and, after a few false starts where you collapse from the sleeping support to the floor, you slowly organize the muscles and balance on the two lower appendages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems a very precarious mode of locomotion, but you can see some advantages. Continual active balancing requires constant monitoring, but also allows the body to readily 'fall' in any direction you chose quickly, which is then converted into stepping by placing appendages in the ground's way, constantly rolling from lower appendage to lower appendage. After some lurching motions you gain some skill in 'walking' around the hospital room, though find the loose, open backed, cover the male was wearing to be awkward and limiting to movement. With some consideration you remove the garment. After all, a large number of online videos show humans without such garments so this must be an accepted mode of appearance. Given most of those instances seem to be coincident with copulation in those videos there may be some expectations from those witnessing this body ambulating without garments. Since you would prefer to remain alone until you gain complete control of the body you believe remaining out of view of other humans so they do not wish you engage in copulation would likely be preferable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you are uncertain how long you can stay in this room. You are at first surprised no one attempted to monitor this body's health in person in the last ten hours, but after checking your automatic systems you find there are indications that they in fact did enter and check the body. Given the monitoring systems showed the body remaining in the same condition it was in, and your repair systems would likely give enough life signs so manual checks must have also shown fairly good health, it was not surprising that no alarm was given during this. Also you are slightly concerned that you didn't notice these incidents. It appears your external monitoring was severely diminished while you were conducting repairs, with so many of your Nanocells within the cellular structure of the body. Now you also have access to the senses of the body so hopefully you will not be caught unawares like that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou utilize organic auditory detection in combination with your Nanocell's magnetic field disturbance detectors to be certain there are no humans in the outside corridor before leaving the room. You head down the corridor, finding it to be dimly lit as the time of day is actually 12:35 AM. Several times you must find dim corners or hide behind doors to avoid humans walking the halls, but eventually you reach a side door to the building and leave. Your body appears to not appreciate the lower temperatures outside and you adjust the metabolism manually via Nanocell interaction to increase body heat to compensate. This unfortunately also increases digestion to fuel the reaction and you know this will require ingestion soon to maintain such thermal activity.</span></div></div>",

As it is you are losing body heat rapidly. Glancing around while still attempting to stay out of sight of other humans you find a damaged wall of a building. Why this has not been repaired you are unsure, in fact this whole area seems in a poor state of repair. However your sensors detect various fibers withing, artificial and natural, and upon investigation there appears to be an internal wall inside the hole, which is edge on. Beside it is a large amount of fabric of some kind, wedged between the internal wall and the stone outer wall. A depression within the fabric indicates a human inhabited this area, but by the way the depression has returned partially to an amorphous shape, and the lack of any thermal residual signature, it most likely has been given up by it's former occupant some time ago. In fact you detect five small life signs within, some kind of aggressive rodent species you do not have data on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInvestigating the area you find these rodents prove hostile, perhaps why the previous human occupant left, and receive a bite on your left arm.... Recoiling you shudder, shocked by the sensory data flooding your network, plans of rapidly fleeing this area slide through your head without you initiating such concepts, as well as several plans of attacking the rodents. Despite the small amount of brain matter remaining this must be the source of these impulses, some form of instinctual response to being injured. You manage to suppress these desires, but are concerned that it seems hard to do so. They are very compelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a piece of wood nearby you tap around the hole in the wall, maneuvering the rodents out into the open, then watch them flee the area. Thankfully your panicky reactions seem to die down, especially while your Nanocells begin repairs on your arm. Wriggling into the small hole your body fits itself inside, drawing the fabric around itself for insulation. You then retreat into a state of near metabolic stasis, slowing bodily functions down while your Nanocells complete repairs. Heat from your activity should be sufficient to keep the body at a reasonable temperature within this pocket while you rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you must decide what your longer term goals are. So far you've merely been aiming to get hold of a larger platform to operate within, one the other humans might find acceptable. This host body seems to be approximately seventeen years old from what you can tell internally, is male, relatively healthy now you have made some repairs, and seems to be functioning well.

You aren't certain why they are behaving like this but you attempt to limit contact, hiding from human contact as much as you are able.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkulking around in the gaps between smaller buildings you manage to keep out of sight, mostly. However after a couple of individuals entered such a gap and shone flashlights in your direction you rapidly left the vicinity via the other side of the gap. Unfortunately your 'rapid egress' was a little too rapid. You get a fleeting look of another human as you collide in a tangle of arms and legs, both of you tumbling to the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" The other says, landing on top of you and you land on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human is female, gasping, obviously taken by surprise, then blinks as she looks. Her head at least was cushioned from impact with the pavement by striking your chest. If you had been female the mammary glands it might have been easier on her, though you are unsure whether such impact would have caused you much more damage in that situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's gaze seems, odd. Just as shocked as the others you had seen before. She attempts to lean up off you, then stiffens as her pelvis presses against you. It feels a little uncomfortable as her hips are squeezing your gentials... in fact you are feeling rather odd from those sensations, hot and.... The woman's appearance seems the same from examination, but your interest in her seems to have intensified, almost as if she were brought into sharper contrast. You attempt to get a hold of yourself, restraining impulses to grasp hold of her, seemingly unwilling to let her get away (why would you not wish her to escape? This is odd), and manage to calm yourself a bit, but she shifts again and you wince automatically as she grinds into your groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm s.. sorry.\" she murmurs, apparently apologetic about making you uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am uninjured. There is no reason to be apologetic.\" This however fails to calm her, and instead seems to make her more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um... fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tip your head to one side and stare at her. You do not wish to remain in public for fear of someone restraining you, but perhaps if you do she will calm down?

Once all of you is within her you spread out and begin the repair work. This will take some considerable time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you analyze her internal structure and organs, trying to determine exactly what needs to be done. After this you set up a group of your Nanocells around her heart and start it going artificially by squeezing it rhythmically. The heart is still not functional, but outside sensors would show it was, and the body would seem to be alive. Blood is being pumped and you attempt to get the cells working again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin in the vital organs, heart, lungs, liver, stomach and intestines. Slowly you repair obvious damage, then stumble on some odd cellular anomalies. You believe she was suffering from cancer. The cancerous cells are spread throughout her body, but one by one you eliminate them directly, high voltage arcs burning the cells out without damaging adjacent tissue. It does leave a lot of repair work to do, but the cancer is gone inside of two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRepairing the rest of the body is slow and takes over a day, but eventually it is capable of operating on it's own and you remove your elements from around her heart and let it beat normally. The brain is severely damaged from lack of oxygen and other problems from the hour it went without the heart working, however you start by reconfiguring it, setting up the remaining nerve ganglia to start to grow and rebuild. The brain will serve as a form of hard drive for your mind which will stay in your Nanocell network. Over half of those cells migrate to the brain now, helping get things going.

Once the shifting units are moving and functioning inside your new body you attempt to find a suitable body plan. You have several body shapes in your database from accessing the scientists computer. Quite a lot of these are of naked women, enough different angles that you can get a fairly good anatomical body plan. In the end you pick three and average the results, so you will not resemble one person that might be in a human database.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo match the body plan you chosen you will need significant organic matter to build more body mass. In waste disposal containers nearby you find sufficient material for your needs and begin to break it down and absorb the organic residue to build more body cells. Soon the torso starts to lengthen a couple of inches, legs get a little thinner, but slightly longer, thighs and rump swell a little, mammary glands swell more, stretching the hospital gown quite tightly. Facial features become a little smoother, the eyes move apart an eighth of an inch, lips become a little wider and fuller, and the hair puffs up and lengthens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole process takes over three days, but you think you are learning. Although your Nanocells take considerable time to rearrange your organic components it is possible to get the organic cells to adjust themselves, and this would be much faster.

Curious imagery had flashed into your head. Why were you considering body function and copulation? You wished this body to be sexier? Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to get worried now you stride onward, slowly feeling more and more of your mind... melding with something, a raw, tingling sensation rolling through your consciousness. It is rather unnerving! Your organic mind must be affecting you far more than you thought. The city is dark, dank and the sky is overcast above, making you feel closed in and dour. The people on the streets look oddly at you, and you pull your gown closer to yourself, realizing that nakedness, or near nakedness, is not helpful here. Embarrassment fills you, but you cope with it, trying to find somewhere to stay out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is not a lot available, other than back alleys such as where you changed recently.

You feel curiously hot, even though internal readings indicate temperature to be normal, and feel your heart rate and breathing speed up as your gaze fastens on her form walking away from you. The sway of her hips as she walks, the bounce of her rump in those tight pieces of cloth she is wearing, the way she swings her arms. It's all intoxicating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling after her you suddenly find yourself more clumsy than before, as if what little you've learned about controlling this body is gone abruptly. Still, you manage to follow the woman, attempting to keep up, ignoring the odd glances and muttered cries as people see your odd attire. This is insane, but you cannot stop the deeply rooted need to follow her. You can hear the blood roaring in your ears, your breath ragged and hard as your eyes fasten onto her bouncing buttocks in her easy gait. Even the way she walks is mind numbing! You can feel goosebumps forming on your body, your nipples rock hard and rubbing on the rough fabric of the hospital gown. Your tongue feels thick and dry, while your vagina seems to be dripping and quivering. What is happening? What is different about this woman from others you have passed on the street. None of the others affected you this way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the woman turn into an alley and struggle to catch up before you lose track of her. When you turn the corner you see her at the other end of the alley, just turning again. Desperate you try to run, but your body is not obeying you very well. You manage a lopsided gait, but fear you may collapse if you push too hard! By the time you reach the end of the alleyway and are back on another street you are gasping for breath, but see her barely twenty meters ahead of you on the side walk. As you start to run again, panting hard, sweat flying from your body, you see her turn and walk up a series of steps and open a door. You attempt to call out, to say something to attract her attention, but your voice curiously fails you. The woman opens the door and goes through, closing it firmly behind her with a solid sounding 'thunk', followed by a click of a turning lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the door seconds behind her you rest against it, thoroughly mad at yourself for failing to catch her! Shaking you are about to pound on the door when you realize you can open it with ease. Placing your palm on the door lock you extend some of your Nanocells out from your body and into the lock. Feeling around in there you find it's dimensions, though curiously even your Nanoself is affected by your seeming clumsiness and it takes you over a minute to unfasten the simple locking mechanism. With a click it opens and you open the door with shaking hand and enter.</span></div></div>",

Now that you got past one security gate you head over to the map at the entrance, memorizing the directions to each floor and discovered that it had an electronics store, a gun store, and a clothing store all on the same level, and within the same few spaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing up to the level, you head over to the electronics store, hitting the scanners there with a few nanites to disable them as you browsed. You grabbed a blue-tooth wireless headpiece, a small 12\" LED monitor, a high-band radio transceiver, and a SIM card, making sure to absorb any useful data from the computer on the counter top, which was actually quite a lot as it had access to a data trove of information called the internet. You took any relevant data to disassembling the items without damaging them, and left it be, then headed to the gunstore and did the same thing, choosing three different weapons, two of which will supply the metal to build the main chassis, while the third is a safety precaution. You relocked the cabinets and looked under the counter for .45 caliber bullets, and picked out several of them to take; after eating away the two guns you also grabbed a holster from the rack, and clipped it on underneath your hospital garments, though now that you think about it, you don't need that anymore now that you can get whatever you need, and promptly ate it for the organic Cotton and the plastic-like Polyester, the latter being used to make flexible circuit boards that the circuitry will go onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the clothing store, you look through all the available clothing relevant to females, and saw that most of them had a bit of a tan to them, not that it mattered to you. Going through the underwear section, you pick out a pair of panties that will fit you and put them on, and cupped your breasts in your hands, feeling them for their precise measurements before doing the same for the bras there, and picked out a rather large D-Cup sports bra. Heading over to the standard garments, you grabbed a pair of skinny jeans, a long-sleeve shirt, a pair of glasses with square lenses, steel-toed hiking boots, and worker's socks, removing your holster first, and putting it all on, then replacing your holster at your waist. You also picked up a thick coat for when it gets to the winter time, a thinner, waterproof jacket for rainy days (should you survive the cold,) a pair of thick, insulating gloves, a pair of thinner leather ones for show, and a leather jacket that goes just below the hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the other things you'll need, it'll be something to lug whatever you might find for later use, a lighter for starting fire, preferably one with a long nozzle, a good knife, and a crossbow with a few bolts. The crossbow was located in the same area as the guns were, and the bolts were where you expected them to be, and to be on the safe side, you got a sling that you could clip to your crossbow, and the clothing store had a pretty good selection of backpacks, so you opted for one that had a bit of storage space but not one too cumbersome to carry. The melee weapons store was a little further away but it had an excellent selection of knives, ranging from tiny folding ones to massive meat cleavers. The obvious choice was a 12\" Scorpion Kris Knife; it had a bit of reach and could deal a fair amount of damage in a single swing.

Some of the iron you left as three different grades of steel in powder format.

With nanites linking the hardware to your biological neural net and your nanite net soon you are listening to the airwaves across quite a few frequencies. Not that it makes much sense at present. You'll need to find how most of these signals are coded before you can understand them. Simple AM and FM signals are easy enough to decode, but computer signals at present need more data. You know how to access router communications at least, and given a little time to listen to signals, especially if you have access to the internet at the same time, you should be able to make sense of the rest too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glow of expectation rises in you before you quosh it.

Excited, you transformed yourself into the penny then back to your original form. After a couple of test, you confirmed that you could potentially replicate anything as long as you conformed to the law of the conservation of mass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then began to searched the lab for more material to absorb until you detected the distinct rumble of footsteps coming from outside the lab. You felt, rather than saw, the door burst open and a busty scientist came trouncing in. The click clack of her high heel boots echoed off the walls as she surveyed the empty room with a irritable sneer. Panicking, you transformed into a penny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where is it?\" She grumbled, coming towards you. \"Mark if your'e lying to me, I'm going to have your ass on a platter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stepped over you, heading towards the bank of computers monitors. You watched passively as she booted up the computer and began scrolling through the database. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on...\" She hissed, typing furiously on the keyboard. \"The research data should be here. Damn it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desk rattled when she slammed it with her palms. You then realized that she was searching for the data on you. From what you learned off the computer, you were apart of a top secret project within the company to create nanobots capable of imitating any material on earth. Such technology would be worth billions of whatever humans use as currency and it seems she was one of the people that steals then sells it to the highest bidder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were thinking, the female scientist was already at work erasing her tracks on the computer. She cleared off the monitor and quickly headed the lab's door...with you right in her path. You barely had time to process it before her boot slammed down on top of you, grinding you into the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then lifted her foot off you, her green gleaming angrily behind her glasses as she at you. A moment of silence passed between the two of you before she stooped down and her fingers wrapped around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just my luck.\" She whispered, her warm breath washed over you. \"I come in here for millions, but I end with a penny. Lucky penny my ass.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, much to your shock, instead of tossing you aside she just pulled back the collar of her shirt and dropped you into her cleavage. You tumbled down between her breast, landing on the bridge between her bra cups. The world then began to shake and rumble as she left the lab and brought you along for the ride. You couldn't believe the bizarre nature of your escape but you were growing excited as you were now beginning your venture into the world. </span></div></div>",

Thankfully, Kim remained unaware that her prize was actually resting between her breasts. The world passed by as you could see through her mesh-like bra and thin shirt, which you got to see more of the company that created you. Employees and other scientist rush by as Kim made her way out of the research wing of the facility and headed towards the elevators. Nobody stopped her, unaware of her attempted sabotage or the fruit of their research that she carried unaware.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe going was easy till we reached the entrance of the building. As far as you could tell, security guards flanked all the exits and corralled everybody into single line where each of them had to pass through a metal detector. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarms ranged through you. The minute electromagnetic field produced by the machine would cripple your systems because of your microscopic size. You immediate began simulating scenarios to escape, but each one ended in failure or left you in a life-threatening state. However, an off-shot scenario that you tested came back positive and you immediately implemented it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kim stood impatiently in line, you disassembled yourself back into your base form. The penny disintegrated into thousands of microscopic machines that quickly burrow into her lacy bra. The nanites easily slipped into the space between the fibers and completely merged with her underwear. They then began to silently crept into her bra cups. Her large mammary glands completely occupied the interior space, but the nanites finitely small size allowed them to easily slip between the material and her breasts. The world shook as Kim fidgeted, but refused to embarrass herself by adjusting her bra while waiting in line.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou commanded the two groups to continue their journey. They flowed up her bra, coming to an indented point ahead of them and their primary target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly waiting, you received the signals from the nanites and from Kim's spot in line. Though not like the pictures of a camera, the digital bits describing everything are none-the-less detailed and descriptive, even more so because they transmitted all sensations and senses. For example, the softness of her skin or the hefty weight that bra was holding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, it was relatively dark till the sensors adjusted and you could see your target; a rising pillar atop her breast centered inside bright pink plain amongst the pale mountain underneath a crimson sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ordered the nanites to ascend Kim's nipple. Instantly, thousands of the microscopic flowed out of the lining of her bra and scaled up the steep slope of her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir aim was the small orifice leading into the depths of her breasts. A natural shield against the electromagnetic wave of the metal detector. Goosebumps erupted across Kim's skin as she unconsciously felt the nanites presence on her sensitive nipple. She could not have known of the finitely small machines burrowing their way down into her nipple and entering the inside her breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of the nanites entered her breasts, did Kim reach the metal detector and pass through it. Electromagnetic waves hammered her skin, but didn't pierce the flabby fat of her breast. You were now safe as Kim left the building with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you were out. What to do? </span></div></div>",
