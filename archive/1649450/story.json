His head hurt a lot... the last thing he remembered was sneaking into the guild at night and saw that someone had left some perfectly good curry on the table! So, naturally, thinking with his stomach first, he'd gone and eaten it. Almost immediately, he had passed out, and was now waking up some time later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... gonna have to tell Mirajane she really screwed that one up...\" Natsu commented as he got to his feet and put a hand out on the table leg to steady himself. Wait.... on the table leg? Natsu looked up and his jaw dropped. \"No way! The table grew!\" He exclaimed, jumping back in surprise. Well, that was Natsu logic for you. He couldn't comprehend that he had been the one that shrunk, instead of everything else growing. He looked around to realize that EVERYTHING was big. Natsu was in awe. \"This is awesome! I gotta show Lucy!\" He exclaimed, running towards the door. Something that, at one inch of height, would take him awhile. As he ran for the door, he suddenly heard booming footsteps and the door opened. Natsu's jaw dropped again. Standing in the doorway was one of Fairy Tail's girls. Namely, it was:</span></div></div>",

Lucy!\" He yelled as the door he was sprinting towards started to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu skidded to a stop with confusion as he heard Lucy's voice. His eyes widened as a high heeled foot stepped towards him.

Lucy's boot was on fire and Lucy ran around the guild hall crying trying to get the fire out. Natsu down below was laughing hard than he ever did. About a few minutes later Mira was be able to get the fire out. Lucy sat down near a table and sighed in relief that her boot was okay. Below Natsu was still laughing and had finally calmed down.

Each one of her steps crushed him with a force comparable to one of Gildart's spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was meanwhile bewildered by the distinct lack of people at the Guild, no noise, no fights, nothing. As much as she hated to admit, she missed the chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll just head back home for a bit,\" She mused to herself before turning on her heel and heading out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of her twist ground Natsu uncomfortably into the ground, where it not for his durability obtained from years of training, he might have be dead. This fact gave the Dragonslayer no happiness. The motion sickness from Lucy's walking and the crushing weight that bore down on him were the only things on his mind as the giant girl began her trek home with a miniature Guild Mate unknowingly wedged in her boot treads. The ride got no better as Lucy walked out into the stone city streets, still wet from last night's rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-cold\" Natsu shivered as Lucy's foot made contact with the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy walked peacefully through the streets of the town she had come to call home, completely oblivious to the pain being endured by her tiny companion. In what seemed like no time at all to her, but a painful eternity to her passenger, Lucy arrived at the door to her residence. Stepping inside, she tugged off her boots and tossed them aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boots flew through air, Natsu was knocked loose, landing in a field of carpet. As he stood, it was obvious to even him that he would need to get Lucy's attention. As cool as being tiny was initially, his experience with Lucy proved it was too painful to stay this size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Natsu is contemplating a way to get her attention, what is Lucy doing?</span></div></div>",

Well technically second, but last time I didn't get to play with you at this size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Play with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, last time you were shrunk I was thinking about how cool it'd be to play with a shrunken guy. And now I get another shot.\" Natsu seemed a little worried, so Lucy reassured him \"Don't worry, I don't plan to keep you like this forever. But if I started now I wouldn't know where to begin. Let's just have fun now and worry about that later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess if you promise it'll be fun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise\" Lucy meant it.

Get comfy cause you might be here allot\" with that she dropped the dragon slayer in her cleavage and adjusted him to her liking. \"Comfy?\" She asked, knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not going to complain\" he knew that Lucy knew he liked it. He just didn't want to say so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This just gave me an idea for a story.\" Lucy Brainstorned \"It's about a boy who's shrunk around his friend and is left at her mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..

She looks at the bug sternly, giving one of her famous frightening stares, and thinks, \"Hmmm...this bug looks strikingly like Natsu\"...she suddenly yells, to the surprise of the people around her, \"You must be a bug trying to impersonate my guild members!!!...I will severely punish you for this!\". Lucy comes over to ask what's wrong. \"What's the problem Erza?\". \"This bug thinks it can outsmart me! I will give it the ultimate punishment, worse than death!\" Erza then begins tugging at her boot. Everyone around her immediately put two and two together and backed up as far as they could go away from her, some even left the guild for the day saying, \"this place is gonna reek for at least the next 2 days, let's get outta here!\". Everyone covered their noses. Even Mirajane began to yell, \"Erza! You don't have to do that! Please! Give the bug some mercy!\".  Erza yelled back, \"Never! This bug deserves this.\" Erza finishes pulling off her boot, and out comes the most horrendous stench imaginable. Some people fainted despite having their noses tapped. When they were children, around 10 years prior, Erza would frequently air out her feet on a nearby table, much to the guild's dismay. One day, the smell was so bad, that the master forbade Erza from ever removing her boots. The smell that was released was the culmination of 10 years of foot stench building up, fermenting, growing, and waiting, inside of her boots. She brought the bug in front of her sole and began wiggling her toes furiously, \"Listen little buggy, you're going in her for a LONG time, so get used to your new best friend!\" She stuck Natsu to the bottom of her sweaty foot, and he simply stayed there. The foot sweat acted like the strongest adhesive known to man. She replaced her foot into the boot, and then sealed it up with the latches. She gave a good stomp on the floor, \"there! now it will learn its lesson\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMeanwhile, inside Erza's boot, Natsu was dying...if only he could. He was inhaling so much foot stench, he was wondering why he hadn't passed out yet, and figured it must be something to do with the shrinking. The inside of her boot was soggy from foot sweat, and smelled disgustingly of cheesy feet, vinegary stench, a type of piercing smell that felt like it drove straight into Natsu's core. He tried screaming, and only ended up drinking foot sweat. Erza then decided to go on a mission alone. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She frequently grinded her sole on him because it felt so pleasing. It seems whatever shrunk Natsu, also made him rubbery in nature. Nothing he could control, but he was gummy in nature. He absorbed an incredible amount of sweat inside of Erza's boot, that it really didn't help his situation in being rubbery, in fact, in made him more so, and he kind of spread out throughout the insole.  This happened at around 5 days after she left for her mission. She triumphantly shouted to herself, \"I have successfully tamed this bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNatsu was having a much worse time. All he could breath was stinky foot stench. All he could see was stinky foot flesh. All he could taste was stinky foot sweat. All he could feel was stinky foot. All because Erza thought he was a bug. Poor Natsu. He felt that he had flattened out to the shape of an insole, yet he could do nothing about it. Five days later, Erza returned to the guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe walked in a noticed and small hint of foot sweat in the air, undoubtedly from her last foot wear removal. She shouted, \"My Friends! Come to me! I have great news to share with you!\". She gathered only the girls from the guild. They were, Lucy, Juvia, Cana, Evergreen, Wendy, Levy,  and Mirajane. She began to tug at her boot again. As the girls tried to scatter, Erza yelled with authority, \"SIT!!\" Afraid of angering her, all the girls sat. Erza removed her boot and tossed the insole looking Natsu onto the ground. He hit the ground with a squelch from how much of Erza's foot sweat he had absorbed. \"My friends, I have found the ultimate foot cushion. The bug that I tamed has given itself to me, and taken the shape of my foot. It even provides a cooling mechanism for my foot. It absorbs my sweat when my feet get sweaty, and it no longer tries to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNatsu was sick hearing this. He didn't try to escape because he couldn't. His magic didn't work, and Erza's constant grinding had reformed him. Erza continued, \"You will all experience the delight of this small creature, clearly built to be under our feet.\" The girls looked a bit skeptical. Lucy, Cana, and Evergreen looked interested, Juvia was only concerned with her love for Gray, and Wendy, Levy, and Mirajane, looked like they felt pity for Natsu. Unknown to them, there was another person watching...It was Ultear. She was still involving herself with dark magic, and was the one who made the food which shrunk Natsu. Erza continued even further, \"Lucy! You will be the first. Come, take of your boot.\" Lucy grew shy. She spoke, \"No, it's ok, someone else can give it a try\", Erza sternly replied, \"Nonsense! You will experience this delight.\" She went over, held Lucy down, and pulled both her boots off. \"There, now we can begin.\" All the girls recoiled at the surprisingly enormously disgusting smell from Lucy's boots. \"I barely have enough to pay my rent! How could I afford new boots?!\" she yelled. Erza was about to shove the Natsu Insole into Lucy's boot when Lucy interrupted, \"Wait!...Isn't that uncomfortable, having it in just ONE insole?\" Erza thought for a moment, and then proceeded to tear Natsu in half. Natsu was in great pain, but for some reason still alive. It was similar to Gildart's separation magic, he was in two, but still Natsu, just in both places at the same time. It was a strange feeling. She then molded him into the shape of an insole again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"There!\" Erza finished installing the new Insoles into Lucy's boots. She then proceeded to stuff Lucy's feet back in the boots. Lucy stood and exclaimed, \"Wow! Unreal! They feel so good. I can actually feel them breathing!!\" Cana and Evergreen looked jealous, they really wanted a try. Meanwhile, Wendy, Levy, and Mirajane still felt bad for the poor thing. Lucy then went home to while feeling her wondrous new insoles. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Natsu couldn't believe this was happening. First Erza? Now Lucy?! Natsu whished there was a way out, a way to simply tell them it was him. Instead all he got was the ever increasing stench of Lucy's sweaty feet. At this point, it felt like he didn't have a normal body...like his lungs were gone. Just a constant inhaling of smelly feet. She could always taste her feet. His whole body gained the ability to taste. It was like his body was becoming an actual living insole. After a bit, Lucy grew tired. She threw her boots off, much to Natsu's relief, however her landlord immediately knocked on the door and told her to put her boots back on, the smell was bothering other tenants. Lucy grew red in the face, and went to go get some socks. Unfortunately, all she found were used socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe missed the feeling of her insoles, when suddenly she got an idea. She went into her boots, grabbed both insoles, and put them on her feet. She then put her stinky used socks over her feet and over the insoles. Now it was like she was wearing slippers with her wonderful new insoles. Just when Natsu thought he could get a break from stinky sweaty feet. Lucy proceeded to go to bed, but she felt cold, so she turned up the heat. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, the socks had the same effect, they held all the stink in, and basically focused it on Natsu. He wondered how he was still sane after everything that he's been through. Natsu tried his hardest to maybe reform into his old self. He felt like it might be possible, but the constant heat was making Lucy's feet sweat directly into Natsu, preventing him from reforming into a solid human shape. In fact, Natsu almost felt like he was melting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the morning, came, Lucy woke up nice and rested. She temporarily forgot about her new Insoles, but not for long. When she stepped out of her bed, she felt like she was stepping on something soggy. She looked down and couldn't believe what she was seeing. It was like her Insoles had fused with her stinky socks. She became very worried. \"Oh no...Erza is gonna kill me! I ruined her insoles! Either way, I have to return them to her.\" Natsu was feeling sick, he didn't even feel human anymore. The heat had caused him to fuse with Lucy's stinky socks, and he felt like her foot smell was a part of him now. He thought this might hurt his chances of ever reforming to human shape. Lucy put on her boots with her Insole/socks. On her way to the guild, Natsu fused even further with the smelly sweaty socks. When Lucy arrived, she gathered the girls and began to remove her boots. \"Erza, I'm really sorry, I slept with socks on over the Insoles, and something happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMuch to her surprise, when Lucy removed her insoles, she didn't see what she had seen earlier. The Insoles had taken the color of her socks, but other than that they looked as they did before. \"I don't know what you mean Lucy, they look normal to me, except the color.\" Erza replied. Lucy figured they must have fully merged with the socks. Natsu felt even worse. He felt like a mix of stretchable fabric, and chewing gum. Additionally, the smell of Lucy's feet was stained within him, like a part of him. When Erza first removed him from her boot, he felt the fresh air around him. He could smell freedom. Now, all he could still smell was the stale odor of Lucy's smelly feet. Like it was constantly around him at all times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tErza began, \"Next!\" and she pulled off Cana's shoes. This time, she applied the Insoles directly to the soles of Cana's feet. They were so soaked with Lucy's foot sweat that they simply adhered. Cana then replaced her shoes on her feet, and left. She scrunched her toes and spoke directly to what she believed to be a bug, \"You are going to have a very smelly day ahead of you bug!\" Cana first went shopping for hours. Then she went drinking for a few more hours. Her feet built up quite a sweat, and the smell increased ten-fold. Natsu couldn't believe Cana could produce this kind of smell. It was like wet old farts with just straight up foot stench mixed in. Like the unmistakable scent of a girls sweaty stinky feet. It was all transferred directly into Natsu. Natsu fought his hardest, but in the end, was still unable to escape these feet as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat night, when Cana got home, she took of her shoes and pulled the insoles out. She give them a whiff, \"whoo! You stink, you need a scrub! Too bad it's not the kind of scrub you're thinking of!\" She began rubbing the insoles up and down her soles, constantly and relentlessly. She kept this up for hours, grabbing a book to read and simply mashing the insoles all over her soles and in between her toes. She finally decided to do something similar to Lucy, and bandaged the insoles to her feet, and then proceeded to go to sleep. Cana arrived at the guild the next day and gave up her wonderful odor-eater insoles.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Evergreen wore very sweaty black stockings, and Natsu was scared that the same thing would happen with her stockings that happened with Lucy's stinky socks. He could still smell Lucy's feet ALL the time. As well as whoevers feet he was under. Additionally, all the rubbing that Cana did with her feet, also embedded her foot scent into him, so now he could smell Lucy AND Cana's feet ALL the time. Evergreen thoroughly enjoyed hew new insoles. She couldn't believe how comfortable they were. She even went to a sauna with her stockings and shoe on. When she stepped out of the sauna, lo and behold, same as Lucy, she noticed that her stockings were fusing with the insoles. Instead of being worried like Lucy, Evergreen simply thought, \"Hahahaha, serves you right you insect! The very essence of my sweaty feet will become part of your being!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that, Evergreen returned home and began to peel off her sweaty Natsu insoles/stockings. They had blended pretty thoroughly. She simply snipped off the leg part of the stockings leaving only the foot part with the Insoles. She put them back on her feet, and tied them to her feet with the stocking snippets. As the night progressed, the same phenomenon occured, and Natsu became one with Evergreens sweaty smelly stockings. When Evergreen returned to the guild, she tossed the insoles to the ground saying, \"I've made my mark!\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Juvia was not paying attention, she was still stalking Gray. Erza went up to her, and without Juvia even noticing, she pulled off her extremely tight boots, stuffed the insoles inside them, and put them back on her feet. Erza almost fainted from the stench that was released upon removing Juvia's boots. They rivaled her own. Natsu's mind couldn't handle it. He thought only Erza had foot stench this bad, but it turns out Juvia did as well. Then again, she never removed her boots either, just like Erza. Erza looked at the insoles right before shoving them in Juvia's boots and said, \"I don't pity you in the least. I would never want to be in your position. And just think, there are still plenty of people left to try you out. You will experience all these feet, and then your punishment is still not over. In order for you to learn, we will all cycle through you for 10 years. Then maybe you will have learned.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUnfortunately for Natsu, Juvia is a rain woman. However, after being defeated by Gray, the rain stopped following her, but that didn't mean she stopped producing moisture. It mostly just went to her feet, and produced the most inhospitable environment inside her boots. The smell was unbearable, but even worst was the sweat. Juvia had by far the sweatiest feet of all the girls in the guild. Juvia was oblivious to the fact that the insoles were in her boots, so she never thought to return them. She went about her stalking practices, a few missions, and other day to day activities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter 2 weeks, Erza remembered that Juvia had not returned the insoles, and went to go find her. She was sitting in the guild, as usual. She pulled Juvia's boots off, again almost fainting, and pulled the insoles out. Erza's hands were soaking wet with sweat, as were the insoles. But suddenly, the insoles became dry. Natsu felt a very sickening feeling. His body just absorbed two weeks' worth of foot sweat and smell from Juvia. He was now stuck with the permanent scent of Lucy,Cana, Evergreen, and Juvia's feet! Smelling their feet, ALL the time, with no breaks. 24/7. As well as tasting them. Natsu''s mind began to crack . He tried to force his way out, but he had simply been far too molded by feet. It had been almost a month since this torture started. One thing did happen though. His face began to appear on the insoles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza inspected the insoles closely...\"Hmm, I wonder why these things look like Natsu...\" Suddenly her expression changed. Her eyes grew wide. She noticed Natsu had been missing since she had found the bug. \"NATSU?!\" she exclaimed. Natsu could not reply, his mouth was no longer present. Erza then grew angry...\"Why didn't you say anything?! Huh?! Respond NOW Natsu!!...\" No response. \"Fine then, I will continue this punishment, since you chose to not respond to me. I have increased your sentence to 20 years of cycling through the feet of every girl in this guild. I really hope you feel that holding your tongue was worth it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tErza then sought out Wendy. She began to place the insoles on Wendy's feet, but Wendy voiced protest to this torture. \"I'm sorry Erza-san, but I don't think I want the bug to suffer under my feet, besides, my feet stink really bad. Even Grandine said so, since I was a baby.\" Erza replied, \"Very well then Wendy, I won't force you.\" Little did Wendy know, that Erza snuck into her house at night, and slipped Natsu into her shoes. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She did notice that they were incredibly comfortable, and somehow cooled off her feet. Wendy had always had a foot odor problem, and she was very embarrassed about it. However, today, she noticed that they didn't stink at all. She couldn't beleive it, little did she know that Natsu was absorbing all of the stink. Wendy went about her day trying to stink up her feet as much as possible as a test to the limits of how much she her feet could handle. At the end of the day, she returned home, and STILL no stink. When she removed her shoes however, the smell exploded. It filled her room like a gas chamber, and made her cough uncontrollably. Luckily she wasn't at the guild. Poor Natsu, Wendy immediately put her shoes began and couldn't understand why this was happening. She ended up sleeping with her shoes on, with Natsu smelling incredible foot stink throughout the whole night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe woke up the next day and tried her limit with her incredible odor eating shoes again. This time however, she used her Support Dragon Slayer Magic to increase the smell of her feet 100 times over. Still no smell. But for Natsu, the smell was out of this world. He was currently constantly smelling the feet of Lucy, Cana, Evergreen, and Juvia at all times, now with this addition, Natsu's incredible spirit was broken. He simply wanted to disappear. Unfortunately, no such salvation was coming for him. At the end of this day, when Wendy got home again, she smell proofed her room, and removed her shoes. The explosion of foot smell was impossible, but she had to handle it. She inspected her shoes and finally saw that Erza had placed the insoles in her shoes. She also saw Natsu's face in the insoles, but it didn't connect to her that it might be Natsu himself. Wendy then understood that it was the insoles that were fighting the smell. She cutely named the bug \"Natsu-nii\", despite her not knowing that it really was Natsu. She then said, \"I'm really sorry about this Natsu-nii\" and used her air magic to suck up all the air in the room, and force it directly into the insoles. It took 3 hours of constant foot stink going into Natsu. it felt like there was a vacuum blowing foot stinky air directly into his nostrils. He was now stained with Wendy's foot scent as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe next day Wendy returned to the guild and gave Erza back the insoles. Wendy even convinced Levy that they were created to suck up foot stink and she should really try them. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew her feet didn't smell bad, but that was only because she used her word magic to inscribe, \"clean\" onto her feet. As soon as she left the guild that day, she removed the \"clean\" insignia. She instead decided that she wanted to use the Insoles for what they were meant for, and she inscribed, \"smelly\" into her feet. Natsu noticed the scent right away. It kept increasing more and more. Levy kept writing, \"smelly, smelly,\" , \"stinky, stinky\", \"sweaty , sweaty\", \"dirty, dirty\", and she ended up having some of the most disgusting feet in Magnolia. Natsu was having a really rough time handling this. He was already smelling so many smelly feet at once, he had forgotten what anything besides feet smelled like, what anything besides feet tasted like, and what anything besides feet looked like.  He even began to hear whispers in his head saying, \"feet, feet, feet.\" It was driving him insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLevy kept this up and was increasing surprised at how much the insole could handle. Eventually, when it was time to return the insoles, she wrote, \"Save Changes\". All the foot smell and foot sweat she had built up was drained into Natsu permanently and \"Saved\" into him. Another scent to his collection. There was now only one girl left to try out the insoles. Erza secretly took Natsu aside and said, \"Listen here Natsu, you are going to experience smelly feet that rival mine, some even say they are worst. She is known as, 'The demon, Mira-Jane'. If Natsu could scream, he would. Erza knew however, that MiraJane would not allow any living this to be tortured under her feet, for she knew how potent they were. And so for the time being, Erza thrust Natsu into her own boots. Natsu thought, \"Not again! I can't handle Erza's feet! It's too much! Too much! Someone! Anyone! Please! HELP ME!\". Erza only smiled and placed her sweaty bare feet into her stinky boots. In the mean time, she plotted, waiting for Mira-Jane to lower her guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOne week later, she attacked Mira-Jane, and they entered into an all out brawl. Erza however, went through with her plan, and during the fight, she pulled of Mira-Jane's boots. The guild cleared out immediately. There were even people outside warning others from entering. It was the thickest, most disgusting smell anyone could fathom. The scent of feet was overwhelming. Just then, Erza pulled off her own boots, and the two people with the stinkiest feet in all of Magnolia were now bare footed. Some poor soul walked ran into the guild at this time looking for a job. Unfortunately, he ran right into the scuffle and got kicked simultaneously in the face by both Erza and Mira-Jane, who said in Unision, \"Don't Interfere!\" For the good second that the guy had 4 bare soles in his face, he thought his life was over. Never had he experienced something that disgusting. The sweatiness, the scent, it overloaded his sense. He was knocked out for a month, unfortunately for him, he was having a constant nightmare that Erza and Mira-Jane were rubbing their feet in his face all the time. <br>\r\n\tMira-Jane quickly became embarrassed about the scent in the guild, and reached for her boots. Erza got in a quick distracting strike, and swapped Natsu into her boots. They finished up the fight, and Mira-Jane noticed how much more comfortable her boots were, unaware Natsu was in them. Natsu was in pure hell. It was terror. He was crying inside his mind. It finally broke him. He couldn't handle it, he just wanted to die. Natsu noticed that in addition to all the girls who branded him before with their foot stench, he know smelled Erza's as well ALL the time. He wondered when she could have done that. It turns out that in the week Natsu spent inside Erza's boot just then, she had been requipping him into all of her footwear, and pushing the magical power of her feet into him, effectively branding him with her feet. Yet another sweaty feet that he must smell permanently. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Erza had planned on leaving Natsu in there for one whole year. Still only 1/20th of his sentence. Natsu cursed his fate. He still couldn't get used to the constant foot smells of all the girls in the guild. Lucy, Cana, Evergreen, Juvia, Wendy, Levy, Erza, and now Mira-Jane. After one month of constant smelling, never getting a break, always inhaling feet, drinking foot sweat, licking feet, something happened.<br>\r\n\tUltear, who had been watching Natsu's torture this whole time, finally decided it was time to move. One night, as the guild was closing up, she released a sleeping spell into the guild. The only person who was present was Mira-Jane who was cleaning up. Ultear went in, removed her boots, and took Natsu. She took Natsu to a secret place that smelled entirely of feet. Clearly her own foot scent. She began speaking to him, \"Natsu Dragneel, this is where you belong...under the feet of women. How dare you do what you did!\" Natsu was utterly confused as to what she was talking about, but was just happy that he was out from under Mira-Jane's feet, even though the sheer length of time he was in there was enough to brand him with her foot stench.  \"You destroyed Grimoir Heart, my future, my everything!...Now you are going to PAY!\" She snapped her fingers and reversed the magic that had been placed on Natsu. She turned him back into his human form. Natsu was overjoyed, though he noticed he really was stuck with the permanent smell of Erza, Mira-Jane, Lucy, Juvia, Cana, Evergreen, Wendy, and Levy's feet. But then he was paralyzed...He could only lay on his back.<br>\r\n\tUltear spoke, \"I want you in your human form so that you know how powerless you are to stop me. You WILL BE UNDER MY FEET!\" And with that she began rubbing her feet all over Natsu's body. It was a very disgusting experience. Ultear had the foot smell of Erza and Mira-Jane, along with the sweat of Juvia. Natsu begged for mercy, he even begged for her to kill him, but Ultear did not relent. In fact- she decided to up his torture. \"You will experience a fate far worse than death.\" She used her Time Ark magic on her own feet and caused toe jam to appear between her toes. She began rubbing it all over Natsu, and it clung to him. She kept going, applying more and more stinky sweaty toe-jam until Natsu was throughly cocooned inside of it. She laughed, \"You're stuck there for as long as I want. You don't even need to eat or breath to live, if I really wanted to, I'd bury you 10 miles underground and no one would ever find you. You'd just be stuck, forever, with my toe-jam to keep you company for eternity. For tonight, I'll let you digest your inevitable fate!\" With that, Ultear left Natsu, trapped in her toe-jam, unable to move, and went to sleep. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Natsu hopped and hopped the whole night through. Eventually morning came and Natsu was still hopping, rolling, making his way to the guild, all while still trapped in Ultear's disgusting smelly toejam. Eventually, he made it to the guild, and it was as lively as ever. At this time, Erza tried to take back the insoles from Mira-Jane, because she wanted that cushioning effect. She simply went up to Mira-Jane, told her that the insoles were in her boots, and Mira-Jane immediately tried to remove them. She found that they weren't in there however. Much to Erza's surprise. She thought, \"Damn that Natsu! When I find him, I'm stuffing him into my stinky boot for the rest of his pathetic life! That is the only proper punishment for those who disobey my punishment.\" Natsu had now hopped into the center of the guild and was completely exhausted. He was breathing heavily inside his toe-jam cocoon, forced to inhale the incredible stench of Ultear's feet. Ultear had woken up a bit earlier, found that Natsu had disappeared, and made quick haste to the guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce again, poor Natsu. He now had two girls that were looking for him, with the SOLE purpose of putting him under their extremely smelly sweaty stinky feet forever. Natsu didn't know what he should do. He wanted to find the Master, who he knew would help him, but he had another rather disgusting idea. He could chew his way out of the toe jam cocoon, and get help right there, people would finally see him, but of course he runs the risk of Erza seeing him. He chose to eat his way out. If Erza found him before he reached the Master, it would mean stinky feet for the rest of his life. As Ultear reached the guild, she tried to charge her way in. She charged full speed into the guild, however found a protective barrier that stopped her. It knocked her to the ground and sapped all of her strength. She lay on the ground, in front of the guild watching inside through a crack in the doors. She peered hard, looking for a little ball of toe-jam, and to her excitement, there it was! She muttered to herself, \"You WILL NOT escape this fate of stinky feet! I won't let you! Smell my feet Natsu!\" and she used the remainder of her energy to fire an ominous spell into the guild that struck the little ball of toe-jam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUnfortunately for Ultear, the spell rebounded off of Natsu, and went straight back at her. She noticed the spell started to take effect and she began melting. She figured, \"Damnit, it must be my toe-jam, my own spell won't work on my own toe-jam!.\" As the spell is almost consuming Ultear, Natsu was furiously eating her toe-jam to try and escape. It tasted utterly disgusting, just like having the taste of 10,000 sweaty feet in his mouth, but he knew he had to. Little did Natsu know, that eating his way out of that toe-jam would be his downfall! Natsu was so close, \"C'mon, almost there! So close! Finally!\", and Natsu broke his head through the surface. Meanwhile Ultear was intensely watching Natsu, hoping he would do just that. She was overjoyed when she saw Natsu break his head through the surface. Just then, the spell that was encompassing Ultear mean a U-turn, and went straight to its original target, Natsu. It flew right into him, and with a bright flash of light, Natsu was gone! Where did he go? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was glowing with majesty. Yet, it also smelled of feet. But not just a tolerable level of foot smell, a ridiculous level of foot smell. The kind that once again, clears out the guild. One member of the guild instinctively said, \"Damn it Erza, stop taking off your boots!\" Erza slammed him to the ground, put her boot in his face, and said if he doesn't want to end up INSIDE her boots, then he better lick the bottoms of her boot this instant. The guy licked and then left as fast as lightning. Now the only people who were left were the eight girls who would recognize that stench anywhere. It was the smell of their precious insole. They all walked to the puddle in inspection. Erza was somewhat confsued...she thought, \"Could this be...Natsu? I sense life-energy from this puddle. Natsu's life energy.\" Erza knew if she wanted to punish Natsu properly, she needed to do it now. She immediately removed both of her boots, and prepared to step into the puddle. She put one foot in and nothing happened, but when she put her second foot in, there was a quick flash of light again. She stepped out of the puddle, and some of the liquid was bound to her feet. The puddle grew smaller. The liquid on her feet quickly drained everywhere into her feet, her soles from heel to toe, and in between the toes too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe knew what had just happened, but in order to properly punish Natsu, she knew she needed to convince the others to do the same. She suddenly exclaimed, \"Hey guys! My feet feel so comfortable, just like when we had the insoles, but looks like we don't need them anymore! Try it out!\" With that, each girls removed her boots and shoes. They each placed both of their feet in the puddle. One by one, Lucy, Juvia, Mira-Jane, Cana, Evergreen, Wendy, and Levy, stepped into the puddle. The same effect happened. The liquid drained right into their feet, and the puddle grew smaller. After all the girls were done, the puddle was just barely there. Erza wondered, \"Hmm, there's still a little bit of him left...\" Just then, Ultear forced her way passed the barrier, and threw her boots off immediately. She flew high and dropped both of her feet right into the puddle. \"I had planned on using you all to myself, but this serves you right Natsu...Have fun under stinky feet!\" The last of the puddle drained fully into Ultear's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs it turns out, Ultear had used dark magic to break Natsu down to a life-energy form. Not just his body, but his soul and mind as well. It was sent to merge him with any feet that he had been in contact with previously. That's why it worked for all 9 girls. Natsu was not having such a great time. He couldn't understand what had happened. One second he has freedom, the next, he's trapped under the feet of every single one of his previous captors. But this time it was different. It's like the smell was in him, it was everything that he was. The smell, the sweat, the toe-jam, everything was forcing itself onto him. He couldn't even fight back. It was utter torture. It was pure foot-flesh encompassing his entire essence at all times. Why, why had Ultear done this to him. Now he was stuck.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for Natsu, he was presumed either dead or lost for good. No one had any idea where he was or could have gone, except for Erza. All the other girls were completely unaware that Natsu had been broken down into Ethernano(magic particles) and absorbed into their sweaty stinky feet. Not to mention that they had thought the insoles were now permanent, so they didn't make any attempts to wash their feet, and some attempted to make them even stinkier. Natsu could not call out to anyone. Unfortunately for him, it seems when you lose your human body, certain characteristics go with it. To list a few: Natsu could not sleep, He did not have to eat(though he did drink foot sweat and eat toe-jam against his will), he was always smelling the feet, and he was always tasting them. The one thing Natsu did have working in his favor, was that he noticed two things: he was ever so slowly losing his sanity, he figured that if that happened, at least he wouldn't have to suffer under feet forever, and would one day rest in peace. The other thing was that he noticed he could ever so slightly lift his consciousness out of the feet and see beyond a stinky sole or a stinky boot every once in a while. To him, this meant that he might one day be free.  As the events on Tenroujima transpired(Acnologia), and Fairy Tail was sealed away for 7 years, everyone in the guild had gone into a slumber, except for Natsu, who still had to stay awake and suffer through the smelly sweaty feet that held him captive.  <br>\r\n--Skip to Grand Magic Games<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Grand Magic games were preparing to begin. Before that however, the founding master of Fairy Tail, Mavis, also decided to attend the games. She had taken a slight interest in Natsu's plight after watching him all those years on the island, being forced to smell so many sweaty feet. Before the start of the games, she appeared as an Astral form to Natsu. She seemingly pulled Natsu into a temporary space, where they were speaking face to face. She spoke in a soft tone-\"Natsu Dragneel. I have a deal to make to you. You can either live out the rest of your days smelling all these feet, or, I can help you out a bit. But it's a gamble. I will restore your human form, so that you may participate in the Grand Magic Games. If Fairy Tail comes in first place, then I will grant you freedom from this hell, however, if Fairy Tail comes any lower, your fate will be even worse than it is now.\" Natsu didn't think twice, he jumped at the chance to be free, and knew with him on the team, Fairy Tail would come out victorious. \"Oh, one more thing...If you try to get help from anyone or tell anyone ANYTHING about your feety fate, you will fail this deal.\" Mavis then swiped her sweaty foot across Natsu's face, and floated away. The sweat she left on his face burned into his skin, forming an invisible seal, binding their contract.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\tWhen Natsu re-appeared to the guild, Erza was shocked to see him. She and the rest of the girls noticed that their feet were no longer so incredibly comfortable as they had been, and the stinkyness returned.   Mavis then went over and explained to Erza their deal. Erza, anticipating Natsu's failure, decided to prepare for the day that Natsu returned to her feet, and went to go train in making her feet as sweaty and stinky as possible. As for the rest of the girls, for the past 7 years Natsu had been absorbing the stench from their feet. Now that he was gone, that 7 years of smelly feet scent all exploded with amazing force, and with no time to wash their feet before the games, they instead decided to wear either boots or enclosed shoes to hold in the smell. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThe whole guild was very happy to see that Natsu was back, though they stayed at least 30 feet away from him at any given time due to the fact that he smelled like feet. The girls in the guild noticed how he smelled, and became somewhat suspicious of Natsu's re-appearance, along with the disappearance of their comfortable feet. The idea was quickly dismissed however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe first battle was decided to be between Natsu and Angel, also known as Sorano. This would have been an ok battle for Natsu, however Erza decided to intervene. She spoke with the council of the games and convinced them that Natsu was an extremely powerful wizard, and that all matches against him would be unfair, and this all matches against him should be 2 on 1. The council agreed and decided that the new matchup would be Angel, and her younger sister Yukino, vs Natsu alone. With this, the match began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNatsu was really fired up and was completely overwhelming the duo. Mavis however, found this to be uninteresting, and activated a secret clause of their contract. What she had said was that she would \"return Natsu to human form\", but she never said in what state.  And with a snap of her fingers, Natsu suddenly started glowing very brightly and began to shrink. In a matter of seconds, he was back to his pre-Ethernano break down state. He was shrunken down, and his body was quite malleable. Angel being the dark mage that she is, immediately smiled and knew the match was hers. Yukino, for the reason of wanting to impress her guild, SaberTooth, also grew confident because she knew now that the match was one. Natsu looked over at Mavis, who was simply smiling, and wiggling her stinky toes at him. Natsu tried to continue the match, but he couldn't even put up a fight. After a bit of tossing him around, Angel went to him and looked down. \"You are complete garbage. An impure human. All humans are impure, but you are even worse than that. You are trash.\" And she proceeded to beat him into the ground with her boot. After noticing that he was kind of squishy, she looked at him with a devious grin, \"this could be interesting.\" she thought, and proceeded to remove both of her boots. Natsu's eyes grew wide, \"NO! NOT AGAIN!!!\".  Without mercy, Angel pounded her sweaty smelly foot into Natsu. She really mashed him in well. He couldn't even open his mouth from how hard she was mashing him. All he could smell was her foot. It smelled of PURE FOOT SWEAT. Some got into his mouth. He really couldn't fight back. He tried igniting his entire body, but all that did was make her foot sweat more. The announcer was yelling loudly, \"Well Ladies and Gentelmen! It looks like Natsu has suffered an unforseen illness. He's tiny! He's about half the size of Angel's foot! And she's really giving it to him! Man, I'm glad that's not me down there under her stinky foot, even some of the fans in the front row are covering their noses!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYukino decided not to interrupt, as her sister seemed to have things under control. After about 15 more minutes of rubbing her stinky soles all over Natsu, the bell rang. The announcer continuted, \"The match is over! The clear winners here are...Angel and Yukino!!!\". Natsu stood at about 5 inches, but as soon as the announcer said the winner, he seemed to have shrunk down to 4 inches. Yukino laughed loudly and looked at Natsu, eyes wide, \"You're coming with me little toy!\" And Angel proceeded to stuff Natsu into one of her boots and put her foot back in. Natsu knew this experience all too well. The constant crushing, the constant sweat, the constant smell. But he was by no means used to it. It was hell each and every time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that, Angel and Yukino returned to the stands. Now the next match was about to begin. As the announcers were reviewing the polls to see which fight the audience wanted to see, the announcer in excitement, began, \"INCREDIBLE!! Ladies and Gentlemen! In all my years I don't think I've ever seen this happen. It's a double header! This time, it's Cheria and Milliana, vs Natsu again!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the announcer announced the match-up, people began looking for Natsu, as Cheria and Milliana took the stage. Cheria and Milliana were both ready to go, they were pretty pumped, as they knew they had the match as well, and even knew what strategy they would use to win. Angel meanwhile, was simply scrunching her toes around Natsu's head, forcing him to swallow copious amounts of foot sweat and eat quite a bit of toe-jam as well. She never intended to release him so that he could participate. The announcer began counting down 30 seconds, and if, Natsu didn't appear, it would be an automatic victory for the other two. \"5...4...3...2...1...0!\" Does Natsu escape Angel's boot?</span></div></div>",

Since Natsu has not arrived, the match is given to Cheria and Milliana!\" They were actually both disappointed, Milliana had this fantasy of rubbing her feet all over him just like Angel. She knew her feet stunk, and thought it would be really funny. Natsu meanwhile was still trying to escape. He heard the announcer, and suddenly gained a bout of strength! He exploded in flames and managed to fly right out of Angel's boot and onto the field. The announcer continued, quite surprised, \"Well, it seems Natsu has made it onto the field. Sorry Natsu, but the time has already run out. You can finish the match, but we'll have to place a handicap on you.\" The current guest at the time was Jenny Realight of Blue Pegasus. The opportunity was given to her to name the handicap. Her decision: bound arms. \"And it's been decided!\" Jenny began announcing, \"Sorry Natsu, but we're going to bind your arms to your back!\" And with that, a spell was placed on Natsu that bound his arms to his back. Natsu knew he couldnt fight like this. Jenny continues, \"Alright girls, you can start the match!\" Milliana looked at Cheria and said, \"You thinking what I'm thinking?!\" Cheria gleefully replied, \"Of course!\" And they both removed their boots. They then charged Natsu. Natsu, not knowing what to do, immediately ran in the direction of Mavis, yelling for her help. Milliana and Cheria were right on his tail. Just as they were going to catch him, Natsu jumped up to try and make it back into the stadium where his guild was, but as he was almost reaching the ledge, Mavis kicked his entire body back down into the waiting clutches of the sweaty feet of Cheria and Milliana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore he even touched the ground, they clamped him between their feet and relentless played with him. Natsu couldn't understand how, but he noticed that no matter how many feet he was under, they all smelled different, but in an equally bad way. Each girl had a different, yet disgusting foot stench. In the end, it didn't matter, all the smells seemed to have one destination, his nose. Milliana made sure to rub Natsu's face in really good with her sole, right where the ball of her foot was. Cheria paid particular attention to rubbing his face in between each of her toes. The combined foot odor was truly something fearsome. This match continued on for another 30 minutes, before he bell rang. After all of the foot stench that Natsu took, he finally passed out. \"And the Winners are!!...Cheria and Milliana!\" Natsu shrunk even further, to 3 inches now. Natsu was taken to the infirmary to recover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile Natsu was in the infirmary, the other members of Fairy Tail had their matches, winning each and every single one. Meanwhile, a bit later that night, Erza pays a visit to Natsu. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The whole time he was sleeping, he had dreams of the girls in the guild rubbing their feet on his face. As he opened his eyes, he saw something that horrified him, Erza and Lucy looking straight at him. He noticed he couldn't move an inch. Erza began, \"Don't bother, I had Milliana put one of her binding spells around you. You're completely immobile. I also had Cheria use her air magic to put a spell on you, whenever the smell of feet is in the area, an air bubble will form around your head, only allowing foot odor in. Natsu was confused, he expected this from Erza, but Lucy too? When did she get on board with this torture. Lucy began speaking, \"Natsu...look, Erza told me everything, how you were our insoles, how you smelled our feet for 7 years straight, the contract with Mavis, everything.\" Natsu opened his eyes wide, \"PLEASE! LUCY! YOU GOTTA HELP ME! THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY! GET ME OUTTA HERE! NO MORE FEET!\" Lucy had a slight frown on her face, as if she pitied Natsu because there was something he didn't understand. She continued, \"Listen Natsu...I thought so too at first, but then Erza explained it all to me. It makes sense now. You never really contributed to the guild. Always destroying stuff. And look, you cost us 2 matches, 20 points in the competition. How much use are you really? When you were our insoles, we were performing exceptionally well. It was like walking on clouds. Plus we never had stinky feet. You served so much more purpose when you were our insoles. Don't you understand Natsu? You belong under our feet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNatsu began crying. How did that even make sense he thought? How could she possible believe that? Lucy finally finished her thought as Erza got up to lock the door, \"Look Natsu, this is GOING to happen. Sorry, but if we want you under your feet, that's where you'll be.\" Erza and Lucy sat down on either side of the bed where the 3 inch Natsu was laying. They began tugging at their boots. Finally, pulling them off with a suction sound, they placed their feet on both sides of Natsu and slowly brought them closer to his body. The stench that filled the room was unbelievable. It was so thick it was almost liquid like. It was like rotten moldy cheesy stench mixed with a typical sweaty smelly feet stench. Lucy and Erza just held their feet there for a bit, letting Natsu take it all in. All he could see was their sweat dripping soles on either side of him, it covered his field of vision. He was still crying. There was no hope. The last thing he remembered before he passed out was being encompassed in foot flesh. It was like he temporarily existed in a world of pure feet. Not just any feet, but sweaty stinky feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen Natsu awoke again, both Erza and Lucy were gone. He wondered if it was a dream, but he could see that it wasn't. He clearly smelled their foot stench on him. It was just breaking dawn, but Natsu was still immobile. He wondered how long the spell would last. He wondered if they planned on continuing the spell so that he would never be able to make the matches and end up losing. Just then, the door slightly opened. Natsu didn't think things could get any worse, but there, in walks Flare Corona. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She kept having these visions of locking him in her shoe, so that he never sees anything but the sole of her foot ever again. Flare immediately got to the point in her creepy yet crazed way of speaking, \"I was sent here to abduct you, so that you can't participate....but they didn't exactly tell me what to do....Since you hate feet so much, I've got the perfect idea.\" Flare removed her shoes and used her hair to pick up Natsu and deposit him into the depths of her shoes. \"You can stay in there for a couple days, my feet get pretty smelly, think you can suck it all up for me?\" She put her shoes back on and left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNatsu for some reason didn't peg Flare as the type to have smelly feet, but just as his luck would have it, it was quite the opposite. Her foot odor was one of the worst he experienced. It was a stinging odor that would seemingly drive its way up his nose. Even when he was exhaling, it felt like he was inhaling foot stink. Unfortunately for Natsu, this time nobody knew where he was.  He remained caked into Flare's foot for quite some time. There was one person though who was keeping track of Natsu's foot torture. It was Minerva. She seems to delight in watching others suffer, and nothing delighted her more than watching Natsu smell endless feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter 2 days of competition, Fairy Tail winning every round that they were in, and Flare never removing her shoe once, Minerva decided it was time for something new. She had her eyes on Yukino. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tMinerva used her abilities to teleport Natsu out of Flare's shoe, and directly into Yukino's boot. Yukino had not previously subjected Natsu to her foot odor. In truth, it was because Yukino is a light-hearted girl, and she knew that he could not handle it. Yukino also knew that her foot odor was much stronger than her sister's, and didn't want to upset Angel. Now Natsu was teleported directly into her boot, and experienced it all first hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNatsu never knew that there could be so many varieties to foot odor. As he realized before, each one had a different type of foot odor, but Yukino's was something out of this world. He would never have expected it from her. This odor smelled so horrible that it consumed his thought. All he could think about was her foot. Her foot plagued his imagination, and the smell just consumed his entire being. She apparently played with her toes quite often as Natsu experienced it first-hand. She wouldn't just let him lay there, it was a constant struggle against her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYukino had noticed that something changed in one of her boots...she didn't pay it any mind however because she thought it felt very comfortable. Actually it only caused her to feel the need to knead it with her sole. Natsu was still holding on, just barely. He still thought maybe he could be free from this situation. His contract with Mavis was his only hope. After the day ended, Yukino returned to her room. She removed her boots and her black stockings that were soggy from foot sweat. Natsu tried to scream for help, hoping that Yukino would help him, but due to the consistency of his body, all the sweating from the past time under Flare's foot and Yukino's foot sealed his mouth shut. He was also still immobile. To top it all off, she stuffed her stinky stockings into the boots, sealing the exit, and the fresh air. Cheria's spell activated, and blocked any fresh air that Natsu would get through the stockings as well, forcing Natsu to inhale pure foot stench. Natsu also noticed that his body was beginning to sink into Yukino's insole from all the sweat he absorbed. It's like his body is becoming one with it. Yukino proceeds to go to sleep. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThis was a dangerous situation. If Natsu became a part of Yukino's insole, he wouldn't be able to participate in the games. As the night progressed, Natsu's body started to slowly meld with the insole. By the time day came, Natsu felt a significant portion of his back was attached to the insole. His mouth however, was now able to open.  Yukino got up and removed the stockings she stuffed into her boots. She noticed she was late and decided to skip a shower and just put her boots on bare foot. Natsu tried screaming, and surprisingly, Yukino heard him. Unfortunately for Natsu, his body was more blended with the Insole than he thought, because when Yukino looked into her shoe, all she saw was that her insole looked a little bumpy. She proceeded to quickly shove her feet into her boots and head out. Natsu was face to face again with another explosion of Yukino's signature foot odor. He needed to get out of there quick before he was completely turned into her Insole! Yukino arrived at the stadium just in time for the announcement of the first match. \"Ladies and Gentlemen!  Welcome back to another great day at the Great Magic Games! It looks like the crowd is loving those antics by our favorite Dragon Slayer, or should we say, foot rag! Unfortunately for our poor little foot rag, the polls have made a clear decision, and ladies and gentlemen never have I ever seen something so crazy. A triple header!! First match is going to be...Jenny &amp; Kagura VS Natsu, followed by Minerva and Flare VS Natsu, followed by, Juvia and Mirajane from Fairy Tail Team B VS Natsu. Ladies and Gentlemen have you no mercy?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was an incredible cheer from the crowd. Natsu could roughly hear what was going on from inside Yukino's boot. While being terribly afraid, he also thought this could be the moment where he finally gets the team some points. As Jenny and Kagura took the stage, Minerva decided to teleport Natsu to the stage as well. Natsu finally outside of Yukino's boot, was lucky, because a few minutes longer and he would have been nothing but the insole of her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe battle started, and much to Natsu's dismay, he realized he was stil immobilized. Erza still thanked Milliana for that. The girls of the guild somewhat felt bad for Natsu, but watching him get rubbed all over by stinky feet all the time was beginning to get funnier and funnier for them. Even Wendy gave a slight chuckle at his predicament. As the battle started, Kagura did not move an inch. She merely stood in the back waiting for the battle to be over. She had no interest in these games. Jenny on the other hand, wasted no time getting to work on Natsu. It was the same thing over and over, except now Natsu couldn't even move. He laid there while Jenny relentlessly assaulted him with foot odor and foot sweat. She forced him to eat her toe-jam. At a staggering 3 inches, she cupped his entire body under her feet. After some more typical foot torture, and subjecting Natsu to intense foot stench, the match ended. Natsu laid there, unable to move, trying to inhale fresh air, but unfortunately Cheria's spell still had him inhaling pure foot stench of whatever foot odor was around him. Kagura then walked over to him and looked him sternly in the eye, \"You are a piece of trash, not worth living a human life.\" She then removed her boot, releasing an incredible odor. The nature of Kagura's foot odor was somehow different. Natsu noticed it made him incredibly sick to his stomach. It was almost like the odor itself was such a strong and confident entity, that it claimed ownership over Natsu's life. She picked him up and deposited him into her boot, as if it were no big deal, then proceeded to walk away without saying a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKagura, unlike Yukino, noticed that Natsu's body was malleable, and wasted no time in trying to smash him into the insole. Incredibly, she was succeeding rather quickly. But instead of mashing him into the insole, his body started becoming a part of her sole. Within a span of minutes, Natsu's entire body was embedded into Kagura's sole. Without even an expression on her face, Kagura thought, \"serves him right.\" As the next match was about to begin, Minerva and Flare yelled at Kagura to give Natsu back. Kagura removed both of her boots, and showed them that Natsu was gone, forever a part of her sole now. Natsu was in a different world right now. He remembered the feeling of being absorbed into feet before, but this was different. Kagura's foot odor commanded a certain amount of power. Natsu didn't feel like he was before, merely a foot. He felt claustrophobic, he felt under a trap that was just forcing a sickening foot smell into his nose. He felt full of fear, like inside of a nightmare. Minerva proceeded to use a large amount of magical power to rip Natsu out of her sole and drop his body right in front of them. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had thought he encountered the worst foot smell possible. He thought it had reached a point that could not go any higher. However, Minerva just proved that wrong. As it turns out, Minerva had the stinkiest feet that Natsu had ever even thought possible.  People in the surrounding rows tried to get up to leave, but Minerva stopped them, \"Next person that tries to get out, gets teleported into my shoe!\" The people just had to sit there and bask in her foot odor. Flare spoke, \"I didn't have enough fun with you little toy...hahaha\". Minerva continued, \"Listen here Natsu Dragneel, I'm about to subject you to the worst foot stink ever possible. You're going to wish you weren't born. You're going to beg me to stop, but I won't. I'll just make you smell my feet some more. More and more foot sweat and stink is all your ever going to get.\" The crowd watched in utter disgust, but at the same time amusement, as Minerva and Flare introduced Natsu to the combined rancid odor of their feet. Natsu truly did wish he had never been born. He begged for Mavis to save him, she was the only who could, but if he could see anything aside from Minerva and Flare's stinky feet in his face, he would see Mavis laughing at his situation. After 30 minutes, the announcer tried to stop the match, but Minerva decided to keep going. She went way above the call of duty, and continued subjecting Natsu to foot stink for another hour. As did Flare. Everyone watched intensly as Minerva and Flare then made Natsu lick their feet clean. Tongue stroke by tongue stroke. They even used him as a toe floss, getting in between each of their toes. Erza watched on in amusement. Natsu's tongue was getting tired. All that licking and licking, and smelling and smelling. He was coated in a thick layer of foot gunk from Minerva and Flare. Lucy felt bad for Natsu, not because of his situation, but because she believed that he should understand that he actually belongs in that situation. That he belongs under sweaty stinky feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally Minerva and Flare decided it was time to end the charade, and left Natsu's barely alive body, unmoving, on the ground. Natsu was hyperventilating, gasping for air. Once again, unfortunately, due to Cheria's spell, that air was just pure Minerva+Flare foot stink. The announcer was finally able to continue. \"And now! For the third match of the day! Juvia and MiraJane from Fairy Tail B, VS, Natsu!\" Natsu could barely move! Three matches in a row was too much for him. But in the end, Natsu seems consistently doomed to feet. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

MiraJane looked at Natsu and giggled, \"Sorry Natsu, but a match is a match, and your gonna get some stinky feet!\" Juvia followed up, \"Juvia-sama is going to make you drink her foot sweat!\" At this point, Natsu had almost resigned himself to what was going to happen. At this point, it was routine. He was going to get subjected to another host of incredibly stinky feet. The only problem for Natsu was that he never got used to it. It was always terrible. They proceeded to do the deed, and wipe their feet all over Natsu. Mira Jan rolled Natsu through her soft yet stinky feet quite a few times. Juvia at one point even made a water bubble of foot sweat and surrounded Natsu in it. She then made him drink it, just as she said she would. Mira Jane was fond of pressing her foot on him with his head in between her big toe and second toe and yelling at him, \"Sniff it!\", while Juvia preferred to keep his face under her sole and force foot sweat into his mouth. The smell was simply unbelievable.  As the match was close to ending, Mira Jane noticed and decided that she didn't want the fun to end. Little did she know she would inadvertently cause Natsu's fun to never end. She had read the rule-book, and found one rule in particular peculiar. She shouted up to the announcer, \"In accordance with rule number 524, article III section B, I demand that this match be turned into a foot-stink off!\" The announcer replied, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, I must say, our favorite foot rag will probably not make it out of this alive! According to the rule, the match is decided whenever it is decided which participant has the stinkiest feet possible. There is no time limit! However, Mira Jane, you cannot compete with Juvia who is on your team!\" Immediately, the Fairy Tail A team selected two people to go onto the field. It was Wendy and Bisca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Alright people! Looks like we have a foot-stink off. Mira-Jane and Juvia, VS Wendy and Bisca! The foot stink judge here will be Natsu. What choice does he have really?\" And so the battle begun. Bisca and Wendy both removed their foot wear. Bisca commented, \"About time I get to unleash these dogs on Natsu!\" while Wendy, seeming genuinely apologetic, \"Sorry Natsu-san, but you're going to sniff my stinky feet.\" Bisca had a tick up her sleeve. Being the sharp-shooter that she is, she shot a sticky trap onto Natsu's mouth, sealing it shut. This way, he wouldn't be able to pick a winner. He just had to lay back and take foot stink. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Natsu finally thought, \"No! No more! I can't take it! I'm running!\" Natsu tried to run away but Milliana who was watching on the side-lines re-enforced her magic spell, restraining Natsu once again. Just to be safe, Bisca shot Natsu with another one of her sticky traps, this time around his body, securing his immobility. These sticky traps are made of Bisca's toe-jam and foot-sweat, so Natsu was forced to inhale that even without being near Bisca's feet. Finally, the four pairs of feet descended upon Natsu, totaling eight feet, and 40 toes. Considering Natsu could not move or speak to choose a winner, the torture just continued on and on. Even Wendy became quite enthusiastic about it, at one point she blew away the other three with her air magic, and took her time making sure Natsu smelled every nook and cranny of her feet. Her favorite thing to do is to make a tent with her feet over Natsu's body and make pretend he lives there. As her foot sweat drips on to his face, she tells him he has a leaky roof. Bisca made sure to get her fill too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust then, the announcer continues, \"PEOPLE! Looks like we have a surprise entry! The guild Crime Sorci\u00e8re has joined the battle. In this guild we have the beautiful Ultear Milkovich, and the beautiful Meldy!\" Ultear and Meldy proceeded to discard their foot wear as well and enter into the ring. Ultear immediately snatched up Natsu with her toes and took him a bit further away from the other 4. \"Natsu, I don't know how you managed to escape your fate of stinky feet, but you're going right back in!\" Ultear and Meldy then put their feet over Natsu's body and rubbed it in. Ultear then activated her advance time ark magic to slow down time right around Natsu. \"Every second of our time, is now 1 whole day in Natsu's time!\" It took 10 whole seconds for one of the other girls to snatch Natsu back up and place him at her feet. That means Natsu actually spent 10 whole days in what can only be described as hell, underneath Ultear's and Meldy's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t The announcer explained additional rules, \"Also, whichever team gets the judge to inhale the most foot stink, gets more overall points added to their respective guild!\" Immediately, all the girls from each guild shouted, \"That's not fair!\" And proceeded to remove their foot wear as well, and enter the ring. What was supposed to be a simple foot-stink off to give Natsu a nice dose of foot stench, was now a foot frenzy!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Along with them were all the members of Mermaid Heel, Kagura, Arana Webb, Beth Vanderwood, Risley Law, and Millianna. Furthermore, Flare, and Minerva along with Ultear and Meldy, and Angel and Yukio, and Cheria and Jenny. Even Mavis joined the field.  In order to ensure her team's victory, Lucy opened up 3 gates at once, Aquarius, Virgo, and Aries, and explained to them the situation. Aquarius turned the lower half of her body into a human form, as all spirits have a psuedo-human form. She also called on Gemini, who duplicated Lucy. Furthermore, she opened up a silver gate, Lyra, and filled her in on the situation as well. Yukino called upon Libra, to aid her as well. Now, with all these people on the field, Natsu couldn't see past them. It was like his own personal hell, a nightmare. He actually closed his eyes, thinking he might wake up full sized again. Unfortunately for Natsu, when he opened his eyes again, all he saw were a bunch of grinning girls with very stinky feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone in the stadium had fled from the foot odor, except for the announcer, who needed to stay to judge the winner. As everyone is trying desperately to get Natsu to inhale their foot stink so that their points could go up, Natsu is actually trying to not get caught by anyone other than Fairy Tail. He remembered Mavis saying that it was just the team that had to win, not him specifically, and by doing this, he was helping the team win! Fairy Tail was indeed winning, after all, they had unleashed 7 years of built up foot stink on poor Natsu. All Natsu had to do was speak out the winner, but his mouth was still sealed shut . After 3 whole hours of constant foot smothering, he was finally able to pry his mouth open. He tried to yell out, \"I Choose MFPPHPFMM\" instantly, Minerva shoved her toe into his mouth. \"You're not going anywhere, foot rag!\" At this point, all the girls decided to come to an agreement to temporarily postpone the foot-stink off, and have Natsu lick every single one of their feet. Even Wendy and Yukino, who were initially reluctant, were now fully enthralled in having Natsu as a foot rag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd so one by one, Natsu licked foot after foot. They all tasted disgusting, some different, some more than others. Erza and Lucy made Natsu scrape the dead skin of their feet with his teeth. At his size, the licking took forever. A whole 12 hours, and the girls still weren't done. They resumed the foot-stink off, and they still had plenty of stink give. They made sure Natsu sniffed each and every groove in their feet. Some of them made nearly-successful attempts at absorbing him into their sole. His vision has been sealed up with feet for so long. He felt so close to victory, all he had to do was shout the winner. Finally, Natsu mustered up all his strength, lit himself on fire, and shouted, \"I CHOOSE FAIRY TAIL!!\". All the girls grew irate. They wanted to keep going. The announcer heard though, and finally stopped the match. The announcer tallied up the final score. \"And the winner of the grand magic games is....FAIRY TAIL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNatsu didn't take the time to breathe a sigh of relief. He immediately sprinted for the exit. He didn't trust Mavis to keep up her end of the bargain, so he decided he'd find someone else to reverse the spell. He actually made it outside of the arena, and instantly, all spells on him were removed. He grew to full height, and took his first breath of fresh air in a time so long her can't remember. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Minerva, Ultear, and Erza were the angriest that Natsu had gone free. Lucy was quite angry as well that he still didn't understand he belonged under feet.  Minerva decided that it wasn't enough, he needed to experience FEET. She focused her line of sight and could still see Natsu on the horizon. The distance was great, but she focused her magic on him, and teleported him right back into the arena. Natsu was greeted with a very familiar stench. It permeated the arena. Natsu looked at Mavis and shouted, \"Hey?! What gives?! I'm FREE now!!\" Mavis then simply said, \"Millianna\". Millianna casted her immobilization magic on Natsu, and he was once again immobilized. He started fighting to get free, much stronger now that he was full sized. Mavis walked over to him and began speaking, \"*SIGH*. Well Natsu, I was going to let you go free, but it looks like destiny has brought you back here and decided that you belong under our feet. \" Natsu yelled back, \"No! Somebody teleported me here!\" Minerva didn't say a single thing, simply watching things unfold. \"It was Destiny Natsu, simply accept it\" Mavis said calmly, as she planted her foot on Natsu's face. \"NO!\" Natsu erupted and broke Millianna's spell. He immediately tried to get away. Mavis sighed and shook her head. \"Let's begin.\" She said. As Natsu was nearing the exit again, Minerva simply teleported him back to the center of the ring.  Erza re-quipped into her strongest armor and blocked Natsu's path. All the girls formed a barricade around him. Bisca shot Natsu with a tranquilizer shot, and Millianna bound him with her rubber tubes. Natsu protested, \"WE HAD A CONTRACT\". Mavis finally spoke up louder and said, \"Yes! We did have a contract, and you broke it. You tried to ask Lucy for help when you didn't know she was actually on our side. You were disallowed from telling anyone about this!\". The rest of the girls grew in anticipation as to what was going to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMavis then spoke to Wendy. \"Wendy, activate your Milky Way magic.\" Wendy was confused, \"That only works on the souls of dragons...\" Mavis continued, \"' In order to summon the Dragon's soul, the soul itself has to be inside the range of the spell. The caster is also not able to summon souls that have already ascended to heaven.' These conditions are all true. Natsu is a dragon-slayer, and you should be able to use the spell.\" Wendy decided to try it. Lo and behold, she pulled Natsu's soul out his body. Mavis continued, \"Now Sayla!\" Almost as if from nowhere, Sayla, said to be a demon from one of Zeref's books appeared. Being a demon, she is well versed in the dark magic of Zeref. She began chanting a spell, \"Written within the Universe Journal, All forces infernal, Within the bounds of this coliseum, This soul be damned to stinky feet, For all time Eternal!\" Natsu began screaming, \"NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!!\" Sayla removed her footwear as well and simply sat and waited. Natsu's soul broke into what seemed like a million tiny yet bright lights. Then the lights began flying every which way. They then all made a change in direction, and flew into the feet of each and every girl there. The lights continued to flow until they were all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSayla spoke, \"It is done\". The girls each noticed something about their feet. They were extremely comfortable. They looked at their feet and saw some peculiar things. Mavis explained. \"In between each of your toes, and mine as well, is a little manifestation of Natsu, constantly inhaling our feet. On your souls you will find that there is a very thin layer of skin, almost unnoticeable. That is also a manifestation of Natsu. In each of your foot wear, you will also see a picture of Natsu embedded in the insole. These insoles last forever, so you need not change them. They are also a manifestation of Natsu. Each manifestation of Natsu acts as his nose and tongue. Natsu is currently sealed in all of his manifestations, our feet, our shoes, etc. Natsu will never breathe fresh air again. For you celestial spirits who are immortal, Natsu will remain at your feet for eternity. For the rest of you, Natsu will remain at your feet for the rest of your lives. When you all die, Natsu will not be set free. He will not go heaven, nor hell, nor my plane of existence. He is sealed to a separate existence, one where he is constantly subjected to our feet. He will remain there for eternity, never to escape. Forever sniffing, forever licking, forever eating toe-jam. But fear not, for when all of you die and go to heaven, you will still be able to feel his inhalation of your foot stink, and his tongue on your feet. You may even visit his plane if you wish to personally torment him with your feet for all eternity if you desire. Right now he is currently in all of his manifestations, as well as sealed in that dimension with our feet constantly rubbing on his face and entire body, considering the feet are larger than him. He will never escape, he will never grow tired, he will never lose his sanity, and the smell will always get worse without limit.\" Upon hearing this, the girls cheered. Upon death, just about every single one of them frequently visit his dimension to personally rub their feet in his face and taunt him about stinky feet. They force him to do all kinds of disgusting feety tasks. The female celestial spirits visit him daily to torture him with feet. Natsu on the other hand, discontinued believing in justice in the universe. But he didn't have much time to think about anything with feet constantly in his face. And to think, this all started because Erza thought a shrunken Natsu was measly little bug. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I do wish to continue it.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in the midst of his happy moment, he is once again brought to a separate space, where only he and Mavis exist. She looks as though she is sitting in the air, as she crosses her legs, one of her bare feet slightly stretched out in his direction. She didn't have an expression that was telling him to do anything with it, so she was presumably doing it in a teasing gesture, as his expression changes from confusion to anxiousness to anger, he let's out a roar, \"Oi! Why the Hell am I here again!? I did what you wanted, didn't I!? Fairy Tail won!\" He looked as though he was about to make himself pass out from all of his yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mavis could only sigh at his outburst and shake her head, \"I'm afraid not, Natsu.\" She uncrossed her legs, and began kicking her legs in a playful manner, though it was more than likely to fan the smell in his direction, to which he flinched at, \" Though it wasn't a victory on your end, Fairy Tail did win, yes. However, not only did you attempt to bring up the details of our contract, you also left the set area before it could be signed, therefore, it has become null.\" Natsu's face dropped, as did his body. He could only stare at the ground, in complete distraught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling both a sense of satisfaction and slight guilt, Mavis lifts her foot out, rubbing Natsu's hair, in a semi-comforting manner. He either, didn't care or didn't notice, as she continued to run his hair through her wiggling toes. He was a fool, who couldn't fully keep up a deal, but he was still a member of Fairy Tail, of her family. On a side-note, she also recognized him as an entertaining toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu was still looking at the ground blankly, only twitching when he heard her voice, \"So, Natsu... Because you have such high potential as an amusing t-- a powerful guild member,\" He still hadn't noticed her playing with his hair, nor did he notice her slip of the tongue, he chose to cling on to whatever hope she was potentially about to offer, \"I will give you two options.\" She held up two fingers as she said this, \"Option number one, you can gain your freedom, and I will explain to everyone at the guild that you are to no longer be used as a an unwilling foot rag... However, in accordance to your previous blunder, you will still be forced to be only a few inches tall.\" Despite the size, it was still a tempting offer, but he decided to continue listening, \"Or...\" A smile grew on her face, as she let more selfish desire to take hold, \"You will belong to me.\" Natsu looked up questioningly, just noticing her foot as it slides down his face, leaving traces of sweat. Not that that phases him anymore. \"I will continue to alter your size to whatever is convenient, but you will be at whatever size you desire during the times that you are with me. You will effectively be my toy, obeying anything I say to you, from if I tell you to return to your former place, but under my soles instead, to if I tell you to tend to someone else. Due to your freedom, and the fact that I won't completely disregard your will, I may even be able to teach you the pleasures of it, that you have been denied all this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu continued to stare, unaware of what she was saying. The joys of being at someone's feet? What did that mean? He was curious, and he would also be able to stay at his normal height from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo his choices were simple... Sacrifice his size but return to his position as an actual member of the guild. Though after that last event, even if Mavis tells them that he is one of them again, even if it was Wendy, he wasn't certain that they wouldn't try something. Though it would definitely be less forceful than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr he could choose to effectively live for Mavis, or whomever she decided for any given period. He is promised he normal height back, even if it is only until she requires him to be small again. He would of course, be around his guild mates, but he isn't obligate to be around them. And apparently, actual joy can be found through feet. That concept seemed absolutely impossible, but if it existed. He couldn't deny his interest in finding pleasure from such dreadful situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, his mental state had more or less been fried through however many years of being under his friend's feet. And no matter which he chose, he would still have interaction with the other side. It just changed how much he has to be with them... Which to choose..? Are either of them even good, are either of them bad..? Natsu lowers his head again to think, whilst Mavis resumes her playing, as she begins to tap her soles across his head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before him were four sets of feet, eight in total, and twenty toes, some of which squirmed in anticipation. He couldn't open his mouth, and the stench was growing closer as they walked closer towards him, their giant forms casting a shadow that covered the entirety of his body. He almost wanted to cry, but in this situation, his main concern was the stuff around his mouth. It had its own peculiar smell as well, implying that it was probably made from something grotesque as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just needed to get it off, since, no matter who he chose, Fairy Tail would win the battle, and bring them that much closer to victory.  He just needed to be given the chance. He stared upwards as they got even closer, varying expressions from a teary-eyed blush to wild ones, that were desiring it a bit too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few moments passed, and now they were within crushing distance, and he could see them all, from Mira to Wendy, lifting their sweating feet, but just before they land, a light surrounds him, causing their hesitation, and he could hear a voice in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsu, though seeing you win is boring, seeing you fight with a chance at victory is also dull.\" Between the voice and the words, it was undoubtedly Mavis, contacting him through his thoughts again, \"So whilst I won't remove that thing binding your mouth, I will temporarily revert you to your proper size.\" His eyes lit up, immediately as everything around him seemed slowed. \"Of course, if you somehow still manage to lose, even after this round is set, I'll be forced to think you actually enjoy your situation... Oh, and as an extra bit of help, I've at least altered the means of removing your gooey muzzle.\" He was now almost wanting to cry for a different reason, it wasn't complete, but he was finally being offered help. \"It still requires you to get physical with the feet in front of you, but all you need to do before you can call out a winner is, rub it off from the side using one of their feet.\" Obviously, it would be something like that, but if they were going to mess with him anyway, at least he could make something of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the girls took a single step back, as the light faded, showing a now standing Natsu, the same size as he was supposed to be. The audience let out noises, both of shock and of displeasure, showing what was likely reflecting on his opponent's mind. Soon after, the announcer takes the stage and shouts out, \"What have we here? He seems to have retained his place as Natsu, leaving his title as 'Foot Rage Behind!\" There were several 'boos' coming from the audience, just how messed up were they? \"But the audience absolutely hates it! But not to worry, folks! The competition has turned into a battle of the smells, and though he may be large and in charge once more, he still needs to free his mouth in order to say a name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe females that he was just about to be flung around and trampled by now looked at him with a tinge of worry. But as much as he may want to, he couldn't obliterate them. It went against every fiber of his foot-smelling being, but he needed to catch one of them, and forcibly rub their foot against his mouth! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that goal in mind, and a glare in his eyes, he took a charge at the small group, hushing the displeased audience, and causing them to flee in response. Of course they would, either due to the fear of his anger or from the smell of feet emanating off of him, they didn't want to be near him. But there were four of them, and the arena was a circle, he should surely be able to catch up with one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he manage..?</span></div></div>",

He slowly sat himself up, as good as he could manage, and looked up, inadvertently slapping his face against the sweat soaked stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glared at the wet piece of cloth, and summoned as strong of a fire as he could muster right now. And once he succeeded, he pumped his fist as hard as he could into his unaware captor's choice of footwear. Though despite it's thin make, he could only barely make a hole large enough for him to fit through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted both of his hands, and then his head through the hole, immediately being met with a whirlwind of toxic air. And thanks to Cheria, this was going to be sticking with him. It was enough to make tears threaten to fall, but he fought them off, and simply put his entire body inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt as though he was taking a bath, since it was completely wet. It was akin to a solid ocean... Or given the smell, more so a swamp. He continued to force himself upwards, trying to ignore both the horrendous smell and the 'squelching' sound that was made every time he attempted to move. '<i>Does nobody wash their damn clothes!?</i>' It was almost annoying how the world's smelliest footed girls, were all acquainted with him in some way, and that he was being constantly forced to absorb their individual smells to the point of memorizing them. It was almost like a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Natsu finally reached the 'ceiling' and just like when he was resting on her insole, he charged a fist of fire to it's max potential, and thrusted it upwards, making no bigger a hole than he had before, that being just barely enough to force himself through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no will to move, after reaching the top, he simply embraced the sweat as he let himself slide down the stocking and on to the floor. He didn't have much reason to worry about his own clothes anymore, after all, they could barely be called clothes at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, now that he was finally out, from one foot to another, he lied on all fours as he scanned the room. On the bed, he could both hear and see Yukino snoring slightly. She was nice enough, from what he gathered, but who knows what would happen if she got a one on one time. He could see one bare foot hanging from the bedside, with the other lying at the foot of the bed. He would without a doubt deal with them in some way, should he attempt it, but it could be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, he could leave, at the risk of finding Minerva, but also making his way out to find someone of his choice. He didn't know who exactly, since he didn't seem to be on any better of terms with his own guild than he did an opposing one. So it was just a case of who was least likely to abuse him as a sweat rag when they first met. Not that he had any idea who that could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in any case, what did Natsu decide to do?</span></div></div>",

Given his own nature as a Fire Wizard, the heat wasn't much of a bother, but it was intensifying the smell and amount of liquid pouring from her foot.

And if she hadn't taken her shoe off for two days, she probably had no intention of allowing him an escape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as he was beginning to run out of ideas, the air around him suddenly chilled, in comparison to the shoe at least. He was... Outside..? He was standing on the ground, that was certain... And then he turned around, due to both feeling a presence and smelling an unwelcome fragrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him was a giant woman, dressed in blue, smiling down at him. He wouldn't be fooled though, he'd been through enough to know that she shouldn't be trusted... And he hadn't seen her for long, but he was fairly certain that she was from Saber Tooth, the guild that the girl with the short white hair, Yukino, had belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now... You don't have to worry, I saved you after all.\" She acknowledged his questioning gaze, however slight and continued, \"My ability involves skills in teleportation.

Natsu, I believe. I will return you to a guild, you can trust me there.\"  He felt himself stiffen. If this were a regular, I've been shrunk and need help, situation, then he would have accepted gratefully. But in his gaze, not even just his own, but every guild around had turned their sights on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis worried expression cause a smile, even bigger than the one on her face to appear on the inside. Of course she knew that he would suffer no matter where he was sent, and that of course was the goal. She wanted to see him suffer, but just not by the same person at all times. She had to keep her composure though, lest he found out. Though, now that he was in her hands, he didn't have much of a choice regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of silence, Minerva closes her eyes tightly, and reopens them as she focuses on him.

He heard the numbers drop, he was almost there... '1...' And with another sudden burst of energy, he took a mighty jump at the last second. '0..!' He had made it, if just barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know! This miniature living foot rag has made it on time after all!\" Both Cheria and Millianna gave a pleased grin. It would have been too boring if he had simply lost by default, they wanted to experience what he felt like underfoot as well, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed his guild members various expressions, some of joy, some in thought, and in particular, the blatantly annoyed expression that Erza was sending his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Mister Natsu, if you would please take your spot on the opposite side of the arena!\" The announcers voice sounded as though it could peace the heavens, more so to his tiny ears, but he did as he was told, his eyes slanted into the glare he had been known for before this whole Foot Hell started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough naturally, it didn't have much impact as his two opponents continued to smirk in his direction, preemptively sliding their individual kinds of footwear, exposing their wretched bare feet to his slightly wavering gaze. It felt really humiliating to falter at the mere sight of a female's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon, the countdown signaling their match started. He swallowed deeply, both hearing and feeling the many different things coming from his Guild's group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'5...' But he couldn't lose, he had to win all of this... '4...' Otherwise he would be put in a position somehow worse than he had been before, if Mavis was to be believed, that is... '3...' That is, if she were to keep her promise in the first place. He had grown very distrusting of Female's as of late, and the fact that she didn't wear shoes in the first place kept him on guard. '2...' But no matter the case, even if she were lying, if he didn't win, then he would be smothered, trampled, and everything else. '1...' So win or lose, he just had to do what he could. '0..!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now it was time to fight, for the sake of a better tomorrow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The fight itself can be described as well, but...) What was the outcome of the fight?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Only moments after he reunited with everyone, he found himself covered in light and in the exact same space that he had just been speaking to Mavis. He turned around, and found that she was massive, just as he had been witnessing in several respects for a little over seven years. '<i>Please, no...</i>' Was his only thought, but given that she could read his mind whilst in this space, she only gave a bright smile in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so Natsu... I must admit that I'm also rather curious about what torturing you underfoot is like.\" She lifts her bare sole, sweat dripping from all over above his face, allowing it to drop on him, \"And don't worry, since this is my space, I can make this as bad or as good as possible for you. Who knows, maybe you'll even learn to like them!\" Both he and she knew that unless he went insane, or she used some kind of magic on him, that would never happen. And what did she mean, 'Don't worry'? She just told him that if she wanted to, this could somehow be the worst experience yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared upwards at the sole looming over him, and soon after acknowledging it again, he heard her give a small laugh, which apparently signaled the first attack. Her wet foot slammed on top of him, causing him to immediately stick to it. His face was forced directly in between her toes, and as she begins to grind him into the bright floor below him, he is forced to eat the naturally made 'jam' in between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he should have expected, the moment he laps it up, it immediately reappears, causing him to repeat the process as he hears the guilds' first master moaning in some kind of pleasure up above. The one thing he hadn't expected was both the taste and the smell... To his surprise, it had both a sweet flavor and fragrance, as though he was eating the produce in the middle of a strawberry field. Somehow, it could actually be described as a proper kind of jam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt tears come from his eyes as the first good smell in years entered his nose... If this was what she meant, then maybe he could learn to like this kind of thing. Now acting unconsciously, he begins to lick the in betweens of her toes at a faster, and more excited rate, taking large whiffs along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever those tears that were born of pleasure and satisfaction, was soon met with tears of despair as the 'strawberry' like substance he had been willingly eating, suddenly began to taste like they were rotting, and the smell turned sour. He kept licking, albeit it slowed as he realized that his sanctuary in his foot-filled hell was suddenly gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes darted upwards as he heard an amused giggle, coming from his current captor, now remembering that she was grinding him from the neck down deeper into her foot. \"Silly bug, surely you didn't think I would let it off at that, right?\" He should have called this, both between being called a bug again and having his day continuously ruined. \"It was amusing, watching you lick away, as though you were a starving dog... But it's more enjoyable to watch you suffer after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her toes around his skull, squishing it in the process, but within a matter of moments, it returned to its original shape. She could truly do whatever she wanted in here, and all of a sudden, the entire room began to smell like in enhanced version of what he experienced for the past seven years. Somehow more intense than eighteen pairs of feet, with girls that intentionally tried to make their feet smell worse. Mavis however, was unaffected, meaning that she was only projecting this on to his psyche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Natsu... Our contract still stands, but after feeling this, now I can't help but want you to fail...\" She licked her lips teasingly, thinking about how he would feel as a permanent insole... Though she didn't wear shoes, so she would need something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Natsu, sadly I'm afraid our time must end... However...\" As she said that, she used the toes of her other foot to peel him off, and once he lied in front of her, motionless, she lifted her foot above him once more. And pointed her toes at him, jabbing them into him soon after. He felt as though his entire body had been pierced, but when she lifted her foot again, there was no damage, as usual, but on the tip of her large toe was something shiny. Had she taken something from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled slightly, once again as the light began to move, settling itself into the toe jam that he had been licking earlier. \"That, Natsu... Was a part of your soul. A part of you, yourself, is now infused within the goop between my toes. You can feel it, taste it, smell it at all given times, I can watch as you struggle during the fights as I effortlessly squeeze a part of yourself between them.\" Her smile widened even more, before speaking again, \"And not only that... I decided to make this fun for you, whilst enjoying your suffering at the same time. The part of your soul I took, was the part that hated feet the most.\" His eyes widened as his body came to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant that the part of him that hated this situation the most, was the part that would be stuck as goop between her toes, meaning there would always be experiencing a small, condensed Hell, possibly worse than anything he has done thus far. And not only that, but if the part of him that hated feet was gone, how would things go during the games, that were bound to go poorly in some way or another, undoubtedly due to Erza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must thank Erza at some point, to thank her for starting such a thing. Though, maybe I should thank whatever it is that shrunk you... But in any case, Natsu, I hope you enjoy your time permanently underfoot. Try to win if you don't want it to happen anymore, though I still hope for your loss... In any case Natsu, it's time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that has happened, it was time to start something more, what was about to happen?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natsu, was in Wendy's shoe, and just as she had told Erza, the smell was hellishly bad. It was as if she had warn these shoes since she was a baby, and went without washing either them or her feet ever since the first time. He wanted to gag, but he couldn't quite move yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so he thought. His new gum like body, due to not being constantly crushed as of this moment, for the first time in week, had finally begun to free itself. And after much pain and many popping muscles, which he probably shouldn't have anymore, his body returned to it's former human shape... Although it was only half of what it was when he had first been shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made sense, after all his body had split in to... Meaning that even if he was free here, he would still feel all of the intensity that Wendy's shoes had to offer, from smell, taste and feeling, though it was admittedly at half it's original potency, which was considerably more tolerable than before... And it would probably be even better when he actually got out of her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main concern now would be if Erza found out what had happened. The moment any smell catches her nose, she will realize something since he was supposed to be absorbing it, sweat and all. She was sure to be surprised, since almost a month had passed without any incident, but that was too bad. If he could help it, he sure as Hell wasn't going back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran towards the back of Wendy's blue shoes, feeling the ever familiar 'squelching' noise underneath him. He had just barely managed to avoid slipping, and by extension, receiving yet another mouthful of sweat, before reaching his destination. His physical abilities had drastically lowered within the time that he was being crushed, but that just meant that he had to make up for it in determination!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, he attempts to climb up the thin wall, and opting to sit on it to take a break once at the top. Seeing as he was in her room, if he wanted to get help from Wendy. The smell of her feet could kill, but she was a kind girl, who even when she only acknowledged him as a bug, still didn't want to hurt him. Despite any insistence from Erza, ranging from 'It's fine' or 'He actually enjoys it'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, the only way to reach her, was  to work against his currently useless body and climb her bed. And he really didn't every want to recognize a pair of feet at any point in his life ever again, but despite the smell, her feet would probably be the best place to get her attention. However, there were risks, no matter the case aside from his own distaste. And the risks in question were, should she see him, she will either see him as Natsu, in which he would need to explain why he was there, both small and on her bed... Or she will see him as a bug, given where he will be, probably the infamous bug that Erza has been speaking of. And to add to it, she might even think that he was actively searching for her feet and 'assist' him, given her helpful personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for another option...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could try and get to his other half, and connect himself entirely again. Since, even if he escaped, so long as half of his body was still an insole, he wouldn't really escape. Of course, succeeding in connecting again would mean that absolutely no smell would be blocked, he would still need to get someone, probably Wendy's help, and that would seal his fate in regards to Erza's awareness. And there was the added risk of, even if he reforms, there was no certainty that he would reform as his current walking half, and he would just become a one foot only insole again. So in a way, it was a high risk high reward situation, or he deals with feeling half of what he had been, and possibly try and get Wendy, should he manage to get her attention, to do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil becoming an unknown slave at the feet of several girls, Natsu hadn't thought much about his actions. Now, he had to think through everything, lest his Hell continue. What shall he do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Normally, something like increased heat would have endangered anyone else in this position, but Natsu on the other hand thrived on it. It wasn't fire, so he couldn't reenergize himself, but at the very least it did keep him pumped up enough to fatten back out into his normal size. Well, normal thickness, in any case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to struggle a bit, as he made his way to the top of the sock, though part way through, he ends up in a battle with Lucy's toes. They had pressed his head back down and in between her toes plenty of times, forcing him to drink sweat and eat the foul goop that was there. It immediately caused his gag reflexes to kick in, but he continued to push through. Somehow, the sweaty surface of the bottom of her foot actually helped, as he used it to slide in between the two troubling beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu could feel the disgusting stuff attach itself to his body, but he didn't have time for that. Whilst he had this constantly diminishing energy, he needed to get out, before this ridiculous smell knocks him out... Or rather, he wished it would knock him out, that way, even if he was under the feet, he didn't have to experience it. Moments like these, he cursed his enhanced Dragon Slayer smelling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of forcing his way through and sliding across the top of her foot, he had found something useful. At the top of it, there was a hole in this old sock. Which meant, one, her neighbors probably still weren't too pleased. And two, he had a better means of escape than forcing his way out through the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to rip it open slightly, but within a few moments, he could exit the foul cloth cage. Once outside, he didn't even have the energy to move properly anymore, be it due to the happiness or something else. He fell to his knees, doing his damnedest to ignore the stench he had soaked up as well as the one behind him, but he was fighting a losing battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crawled his way to the foot of her bed, still gasping for breath. If he hadn't known better, he would say that the foul air in her sock caused his hair to turn green. Brown, if nothing else... After catching his breath, he took a look to his right, and the sight surprised him, until he remembered something that brought back a not-too-long-ago foul memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another him, they had both just escaped, or maybe that version had been waiting a while for him. He had been ripped in half, it had hurt immensely when it had happened, but he didn't have much time to consider it once he was shoved under Lucy's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many things are weird about this shrunken body... He couldn't seem to pass out, he couldn't seem to die, he could be split in half, and the worst of it was that he seemed to be some kind of sponge for soul odors. They both simply looked at each other for a few moments, before walking a little closer to each other... Technically, they should be able to reconnect if they touch each other again, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut was it that simple?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Indeed it was. They reformed into a single Natsu, and he tried to get Lucy's Help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Yes it was. The became one again, and he ran as far away from these feet as he could, attempting to find someone else to help. Maybe one of the one's who were a bit more worried about his position, despite the fact that he was only a bug to them at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. It couldn't have been more difficult. The other Natsu actually enjoyed this foot filled hell, and wanted Erza to continue with this train of Guild Members. He only came out to become the dominant Version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Sorry that this suddenly became weird...)</span></div></div>",

He simply had to put up with the pain the constant taste and smell of swear as he hoped for a lucky break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as though the other plane was looking out for him, he was finally given a break. Erza hadn't put her boot on correctly, and the moment she tried to burst into a run, it fell off of her foot, unleashing the smell to everyone in town and as it had the Guild members, caused a decent number of civilians to walk in the opposite direction, or enter their homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grit her teeth as he face went pink, and one of her fists balled up.

Consumed by the alcohol Cana said, \u201cSo you like being there don\u2019t \u2026 you. Well \u2026 let\u2019s make it more \u2026 fun for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then squeezed her boobs together. Natsu, startled by the movement, started to panic once more. Cana\u2019s soft skin was enclosing on Natsu and crushing him slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana at the moment was intending of killing the speck but of just scaring the living hell out of it. She slightly pressed her breasts together tightly to keep her fun more entertaining. Natsu on the other hand was trying his best not to be smothered by Cana\u2019s mountains of pleasure. Suddenly Natsu was lifted to the air and instantly his motion sickness started to kick in. \u201cJust \u2026 don\u2019t think its \u2026 transport,\u201d Natsu said as he was trying hard not puke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana grabbed the speck with her left index finger and thumb and brought it up to her face.  She stared at the red spot she was holding until she realized that the speck was moving. Surprised by the movement, Cana brought the speck to her left eye to examine it. Then she noticed that the speck was Natsu trying to get free from Cana\u2019s grip. Cana then yelled, \u201cNATSU, HOW THE HELL DID YOU GET SO SMALL?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu covered his ears as he heard Cana\u2019s booming voice.  He then yelled, \u201cCANA NOT SO LOUD YOU NEARLY MADE ME DEAF.

Once she had stopped, Natsu only stayed still for a moment. He had never felt as humiliated as now, he'd fought many tough enemies, but the one that's doing him in is the rear of an unaware giant girl. The frustration only grew until he couldn't take it anymore, and began to struggle even more than before.

Natsu was shocked now he was pressed against Wendy's pussy so he started removing all of his clothes and licked Wendy's pussy and Wendy screamed in pleasure. \"Wow this feeling with Natsu-San in between my legs, it's so amazing! Wendy thought while moving her hand into her pussy pushing Natsu in and out of her pussy. Natsu was held between Wendy's index finger and thumb. Natsu having felt Wendy tightened around his arm signaling that she was close decided to wrap up his body and oral treatment the best way he could. Reaching up he grasped Wendy\u2019s now budding clit squeezing it tightly between his small hands, his hands fit perfectly like they were made to hold it. Wendy screamed as she felt her first orgasm hit her hard. Wendy shook violently as her back arched pushing hard into Natsu who eagerly accepted her flood. Natsu moaned in bliss as he lay in a puddle of Wendy\u2019s release, his own orgasm having hit as soon as he was shoved out by Wendy\u2019s. \u201cS-so\u2026 how did\u2026 jeez\u201d Natsu panted happily. \u201cHow did you like your first orgasm?\u201dNatsu asked happily as he looked up at Wendy. Natsu blinked smiling as he saw Wendy passed out, the pleasure having been too much for her to handle. Natsu then thought of exploring Wendy's body more or just stay in front of her pussy  and touch it while waiting for her to wake up.</span></div></div>",

It was blatantly a surprised squeal, implying that she had definitely felt his burning hand enter her. '<i>Prank successful!</i>' That was his only thought on the matter as the fleshy walls closed on him, covering his body as he sunk into either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresumably, she had instinctively either tightened her rear or placed both of her hands to them, pushing them together in the process in response to the pain. Luckily the force offered no pain both due to his own sturdiness, and her softness. His laughter had become haughty as he pulled back his fist, fighting against the slight resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he had managed to do what he had originally intended, thought the aftermath wasn't part of his plan. After a few moments of recovering, Wendy had released whatever force was keeping both sides of her butt together, therefore allowing the shrunken Natsu a bit more freedom in movement, even if it was slight. However, immediately following that release was a slow grind as she began to walk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had already been made aware of the general tightness when he made his way here in the first place, but since she was still for the most part, he hadn't gotten to experience the full force of her rear. He could feel his body move up and down, tightly squeezed with every step as the giant girl made her way to her destination. Honestly, it still couldn't quite be described as pain, but with his arms and legs forcefully being moved every time she lifted her leg, at the very least, he could definitely call it uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughter he had started was short-lived as he only had varying levels of groaning to offer his flesh prison now. He closed his eyes for a moment as he thought of what to do. Originally, he had forced his way in here, so he should have been capable of doing the same as an escape. But the moment he attempted to raise his arms or body upward towards the exit, they had immediately become trapped and forced back downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this only meant that he would simply need to wait until she stopped moving again. But with his personality, patience wasn't really an option, so despite the futility, he continued his struggle against the force that the young Dragon Slayer's butt had to offer. Even if in truth, it was of very minimal effort on her part, as she didn't even know he was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>And so, through this trip, what had happened?</b></span></div></div>",

Though, no one outside the guild could interact or even see her. But naturally, due to being a member, Natsu could. And despite her petite frame at normal size, from his perspective, she was absolutely huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! It's a giant!\" Despite the fact that he was going out to search for someone, he was still taken aback when the heightened form of someone he knew was actually standing in front of him. But luckily, perhaps to due with how loud he was, or how good her hearing was, she had stopped, just short of him, with her bare feet planted directly in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu stood staring upwards, seeing her gaze looking around the room. He soon realized that he may have heard him, so maybe now would be the best chance to get her to notice him, whilst she is semi-aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with a widening grin on his face, he coated his fist in fire, and struck the tip of the toe in front of him, as hard as he could, not thinking about what consequences it could have. The moment his fist made contact, he heard the giant female make a sound as she winced in pain. His smile widened even more once he confirmed that she felt it, but perhaps that won't last for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight lingering pain in her toe, Mavis casted her gaze downwards, with an upset pout covering her face. Once she focuses on the ground beneath her, she sees the small form of something. However, perhaps due to her annoyance, she didn't see it as anything more than a small bug. She lifted her foot, and positioned it above the tiny creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he sees what's about to happen, his expression changes to one of shock, and starts running in away from the range of her sole. But it would seem that he was too slow, as her foot covers his entire body, pressing him into the ground. He was about to breathe fire on an impulse, but she suddenly increased the pressure on her foot, causing whatever was about to build up, to disperse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresumably satisfied, Mavis gives a slight smile as she continues walking into the Guild Hall, placing herself on one of the bar stools.

Elfman walks in to see Mira working at the bar and Lisanna talking to the gang.  Lisanna sees Elfman and runs up to him happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey big brother, so Natsu and the gang told me that you me and Mira should all go on a job request together!\"  Elfman not knowing what to say looks over at Natsu, Lucy, Gray, and Erza all smiling at him.  Mira hears her name and walks over, she also looks a bit lost for words. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well, what do you say big brother and big sister, lets go do a request.\"  Elfman and Mira bother remember how the last time all of them went on a job they lost Lisanna for two years, but they bother didn't want to disappoint their caring sister so they both accepted.  Lisanna quickly ran over to the request board and grabbed a random request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It says we have to go to a town just east of Fairy Tail and talk to this women who needs help.  Yay this is so exciting.  Get read you two cause we're leaving tomorrow morning. Elfman went home and started preparing for the request.  It wasn't a hard job but for some reason he just couldn't shake this bad feeling he had.  He pushed his feeling aside and went to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The next morning he found himself one inch tall.  Where was he tho?  </span></div></div>",

Her unoccupied hand sat there, resting ever so still atop the wooden surface. It\u2019s nails, a dull green when she had first entered the guildhall, now glistened a bright jade like those of it\u2019s occupied sibling. She lifted it up to better inspect the newly-applied coat, and slightly \u2013 slightly \u2013 her stony expression lifted at the results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAcceptable.\u201d She muttered, and then cast her eyes down once again. With both hands in air, one carefully guarding her half-full glass and the other curled in presentation before her face, there should have been nothing left upon the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet there was something still: a tiny boy, barely the size of Brandish\u2019s longest finger, looking back at her with a mixture of fear and pleading. In his shaky grasp was a brush of green nail polish; a normal-sized person could have easily held it between two fingers, but the boy required both arms to hold the sword-sized brush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes drilled into him as she quietly awaited some kind of response. It was only after a short and uncomfortable silence that the boy\u2019s wobbly lips opened. \u201cPlease, Bran- L-Lady Brandish! I\u2019ve done what you wanted! Please turn me big again! T-This isn\u2019t funny!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandish\u2019s face hardened, causing the minuscule figure to recoil the tiniest bit. \u201cFunny?\u201d Her voice reeked of contained irritation. \u201cThat little prank of yours wasn\u2019t very funny.\u201d She mused and pointed a giant finger towards bar \u2013 specifically, towards a certain stool. Atop that stool, sat a certain, fancy coat with a large and still somewhat smoldering bruise blemishing it\u2019s golden beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the reminder, the boy sunk in remorse, and he recalled, with great regret, what had transpired\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHey, Rom~e~o~\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomeo could easily smell the overwhelming scent of alcohol on Cana\u2019s breath as she whispered into his ear. Far from anything unusual, he thought nothing of it at first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Cana-nee?\u201d He replied, glancing over at the female next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou \u2013\u201d She hicked. Romeo\u2019s eyebrows raised. When was last time Cana had gotten hiccups from drinking? He didn\u2019t get anymore time to process that question however, as his guildmate wrapped an arm around him and pressed his face into her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2013 you can mix t\u2019ose flames of yoursh together, right?\u201d Cana slurred on, shooting him a big, tipsy grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe should really have started asking just how much was in her system to make her this way. Could it have been the new wine they had received from Alvarez? Perhaps Cana-nee\u2019s body wasn\u2019t used to it, like it was with all the alcohol normally served at the guild, and so had no resistance to it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his growing boy mind was thinking about of that. Instead, it had been overtaken by his current closeness to the drunken woman\u2019s exposed and ample bosom. He couldn\u2019t find the strength to pry his gaze away from that inciting abyss, even as his face threatened to explode from the heat building up within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith dry lips, he managed out. \u201cY-yes, C-Cana-nee. I-I can.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest came forward as she leaned in closer, now leaving barely an inch between the tip of his nose and her soft flesh. From above him came another sloshy whisper. \u201cWhy don\u2019t ya\u2026 mix the smelly one with the sticky one\u2026 and shlap it onto Lucy\u2019s stool there, hm?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Romeo found to strength to glance up at her. \u201cB-But, Cana-nee, that\u2019s not-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana\u2019s lips puckered into a disappointed pout. \u201cCome on, Romeo! It\u2019ll be hilarious! Beshides, Nat \u2013\u201d Another hiccup, but this one she powered through. \u201cNatsu pranks her all the time! You wanna be like Natsu, don\u2019t ya?\u201d Her face jutted closer, stopping when her lips dangled just out of reach of his. Her eyes ensnared his, and the fortitude he had found crumbled into dust beneath the pounding of his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHows about it?\u201d He could only just hear her over the thundering in his chest, but there\u2019s was no missing the way her supple, juicy lips curled into a seductive smile. \u201cPretty pleash for Cana-nee?\u201d </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a defeated sigh, Romeo\u2019s eyes trailed away from the ruined article of clothing, and followed the bar till it reached it\u2019s end. On the final stool, Cana, his temptress, sat slumped over the counter in an alcohol-fueled blackout. Seems she had passed out after Romeo had left to use the bathroom, mere moments before Brandish had entered the guildhall and taken the boobytrapped stool for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much for her promise of making sure only Lucy sat there\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the nail brush down, he stood tall towards his giantess captor and called out with all his heart. \u201cI said I was sorry! I meant to\u2026\u201d He fumbled for how exactly to explain, before deciding to do so later, and pressed on. \u201cPlease just turn me back to normal! I-I don\u2019t like being this small!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonchalantly, Brandish took another sip from her drink, sloshed it around on her tongue for a second, and then swallowed. \u201cNo.\u201d Was her cold response, and with it, her free hand descended and clamped around him. \u201cI\u2019m not done repaying the favor yet.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You could only groan as a dull pain racked through your body. Slowly, you managed to raise your head to look at your captor. Instead of seeing the face of Erza, a pale, flawless foot completely block your view of her. The same foot that squashed you into your current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza's booming voice quickly interrupted your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you waiting for?

You ground your teeth together. She couldn't do this! If it wasn't for her, not even the dragons could stand up to you!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza's mocking voice suddenly interrupted you brooding, saying, what's the hold up, my little mage? I think it would be for your best interest to get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it! You didn't care about how big she was! You were going to do everything you to take her down! You raised both hands at at Erza's foot, with palms pointed toward, a small space between your hands. You began chanting everything you've ever learned about magic;sweat began flowing down your brow, but you still began pouring everything you had into the spell. Suddenly, a dark magic circle began forming at your palms, electricity sparking in the circle, and the circle began spinning faster and raster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally. It was ready. You bellow at the top of your lungs, letting the spell loose, a dark bolt of dark electricity sailing towards her foot. Success! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Erza cried out in pain, her foot suddenly moved backwards towards her body. She bent her knee, bringing her foot in the seat, rubbing it with her hands. She looked down at her foot with a hurt expression spread across her face.<br>\r\nYou fell to your hands and knees with a thud. The spell had took everything you hand and then some;you were completely exhausted.\"That's it!\" Erza's voice boomed all around the room. You managed to look up at Erza...In hindsight, that wasn't your greatest idea. Erza's expression was one if barely restrained rage. She planted both feet on the ground, standing up. She slowly walked towards you, completely focused on you and only you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally managed to regain her cool, her face becoming absolutely expressionless. You would have much rather preferred he look of rage. She looked at you a little longer without saying anything. Finally she spoke,\"Little mage, I have been letting you of lightly, considering you've been plotting to conquer and destroy everything, but even my patience has limits. It's clear that I am unable to properly train you alone, so I will make some plans to have some of my fellow guild mates assist me. Until then, I will have to place you in a place where you will have time to think about what you have done.\"</span></div></div>",

Then the pain hits you. Every part of your body was under unbelievable pressure and you almost blacked out. And, just like that, the pressure was relieved. She moved her foot off you and you could clearly see her face. She looked down at you with a amused grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held back a giggle and said,\"you know, it never get old squashing you.

You seemed to be on some sort of desk, feeling hard wood under your back. Hesitantly, you open you eyes slightly. You see what looks to be a bedroom, but it's too blurry to make out the details.

You then notice her large....chest. To say the were large would be quite the understatement. She was wearing a white button-up blouse with bright blue trimmings and a thick blue dash across the middle. A short revealing blue skirt covered part of her legs,but a pair of long black boots reaching a little over her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, she was breathtaking. Being an dark mage who spent most of your days researching spells you couldn't exactly keep up with every up and coming mage,but you have heard of Lucy Heartfilia-even if hadn't seen her visually. Despite being being tortured, literally squashed flat, and humiliated beyond imagination, you couldn't help but blush at the blonde beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doesn't go unnoticed by her, as she leans down toward your tiny body, her beautiful face filling your vision. She takes a moment to carefully, scrutinizing every detail, her epression unreadable. The few seconds of silence as she examined you felt like an eternity. Finally, her face breaks into a smile. \"Well aren't you just the cutest!\" She suddenly-and quickly picked you up,carefully bringing you up to her face. Once again, her flawless features fill your vision<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't believe Erza when she told me she captured a tiny dark mage, but here you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a harsher,stricter voice interrupted the scene.\"Lucy,don't lose focus.

Her name was Cana Alberona, daughter of Class S mage wizards and known to everyone as a heavy drinker who barely gets drunk regardless of  how much she drinks.  She also remembered that Cana had accidentally shrunk her via Card Magic, after that she fell completely asleep on top of Lucy's bed.  The toy-sized mage then tried calling out to the drunken brunette to no luck prevailing.  Her only choice was climbing up the covers in hope of waking Cana up close; several minutes have past where Lucy finally gets on top of the bed.  \"CANA WAKE UP PLEASE!!\"  She calls onto her as aloud as can and then.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's your choice in what happens next pick________________________________________________________</span></div></div>",

PLEASE WAKE UP!!!\" at that moment Cana mumbles \"Just...five more... minutes...\" Cana drifts back to sleep. \"Awwwww! Come on!\" Lucy whines \"WAKE UP CANA!!!\" at that moment Cana's body shuffles a bit as Lucy loses her balance and screams as she falls between Cana's breast.

If I don't she'll tease me about this for the rest of my life!\" Lucy keeps struggling to break free from the massive breast that she's caught between until she starts to hear Cana mumbling again \"That feels... good...\" Lucy's face reddens even more knowing that Cana seems to enjoy Lucy's struggles to escape from her breast.

To Lucy's fortune Cana is still asleep, but Lucy realizes she has to get out of the strong hold Cana's breast have over her and wake Cana up. Lucy then struggles a bit more until she finally breaks free \"Ugh!...At least I'm finally out of that mess.\" Lucy gets up and looks back at the breast that recently contained her \"They're so big... Wait, why am I thinking about that?! I should be waking Cana up!\" embarrassed over those thoughts Lucy then turns around to see the huge face of the sleeping Cana.                                                                                                                          \"Wow!

Please wake up!\" at that moment Cana starts to hear something \"Huh?... L-Lucy?...\" Lucy then smiles as she finally woke Cana up. \"Ow!... My head... It feels like it's spinning...\" Cana starts to feel the pain from her hangover. Lucy's smile fades as Cana then sits up. \"CANA!!!\" Lucy screams as she starts to fall \"Lucy?... Where are you?...Is everything okay?\" Cana can't seem to find Lucy anywhere. At that moment Cana hears muffled screams and feels something wiggling in between her breasts, Cana then looks down and sees a tiny doll sized Lucy stuck between her breast. \"Well, well, what do we have here?\" Cana has a mischievous smile forming on her face.</span></div></div>",

Air could be compressed, and so could most of the things that existed. \"Secret art...Compression of the Sky Dragon\" she mumbled. Then the earth around her began shaking.

Understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Natsu nodded his head in agreement. He had to save his friends.

Natsu didn't want anything to stop him from saving his guild so he shook around a lot and Wendy felt this as she began to blush, it was arousing having her senior within her, eventually she got lost in thought as she slowed down, Natsu was losing grip, whether from sweat, his flailing, or her loss of concentration, Natsu fell down from her sweet little chest and by instinct reached out and grabbed anything he could, he grabbed her panties and below him he saw her stomping footsteps below, he could get crushed if she doesn't notice or if he doesn't hold on, he $$$ to climb up but ends up slipping inside her bright panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It was dark but as a fire dragon slayer he lit up his fist, careful not to burn the only thing holding him up, the panties, he holds it out to see in front of him the young girl's censored.

Chapters don't have to be super long, but try and keep the length somewhat decent.<br>\r\n-Please show some evidence of literacy<br>\r\n-No hard vore/toilet stuff. Anything else is fine.<br>\r\n-Death is only allowed after at least 5 chapters.<br>\r\n-No guy on guy stuff. There are a number of interactives if that's your thing, but I'd prefer to avoid it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun with the story.</td>",
