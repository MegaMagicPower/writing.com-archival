I was a football player not an Olympic runner.\" thought George as he worked to a sweat climbing the steep hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last he reached the peak and wiped the sweat from his face. \"You don't have my bulk to move up the mountain!\" said George still huffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky smiled at her Bow, \"Your getting out of shape sitting in that bank! You need the fresh air and a lot of physical work, or you will get fat and lazy, Georgie' Boy!\" chidded Becky with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill sweating George layed the bike down and found a place to sit on a stump left after some old tree was huen down and made to other things. As he sat and listened to Becky ramble his fingers felt something odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, George spied what seemed to be a silver ring embedded into the outer ring of the tree trunk. As he took out his mini pocket knife from the bank he worked it made the job easy to cut out the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George, what are you doing?\" asked Becky seeing him begin to pick at the stump with his little knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlecks of slivers popped this way and that till out of the trunk came a bright silver ring. George held the ring up to get a good look as Becky reached to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No tis' mine, I found it, I dug it out of the tree trunk, it's mine!\" grumbled George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok dear, OK! The more you work in the banking business the greedier' you become!\" grumbled Becky back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning turned to afternoon as the two lovers biked about the Smokey Mountain's Park. It wasn't till the two reach Lumberman's Gap trader's post that the facts of George's find came to light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe many shops and booths made to capture the money of simple minded hiker's and biker's offered a place to buy junk. As George handed some money to a old Indian woman she saw the silver ring on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsking about the ring the woman told a story about a young girl from Europe coming to the mountains and being given a silver ring. As in most old fables the ring had powers and as the girl walked amoung the forest trees she wished to livea hundred years as part of the green lush forest. As when her wish was made known to the world she was touching one of the great Elm trees in the forest. Her ring glowed and both lover and girl watched as feet turned to roots and arms became bowes. A short scream and she was a Elm sapling to be a part of the forest. The ring was embedded into the bark of her tree and neither her or the ring were seen every again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky looked at George and both smiled at the old Indian for the story had captured their imaginations.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the two walked the boarded sidewalk together Becky needed to check out each shop. As yet the two had not had any lunch and George felt more than weary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Becky entered the Stage Coach office with plans of buying tickets for a tweleve mile ride through the forest and grassy pastures, George stood looking about for a hot dog stand. Even as he stood there the coachdriver took sacks of grain out to feed his four dappled gray steeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach horse was given a bag half full of grain with the bag hung from the top of each big head. George watched as with each exhaled breathe the dust and flacks puffed into the air from out the sacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeding them before a run?\" asked George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea sure, they work like you and I or even a steam engine, got to feed the fire to make the coach move!\" said the Coachdriver with a nice and friendly smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was still asking the history of this coach when George felt the pit of his stomac growl. Stepping down off the boardwalk he stood almost face to face with the friendly stagecoach horses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big aren't they!\" said George turning to look up at the driver now sitting in his seat high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, bigger than what might have been used way back when but just fine for our short trips at a slow pace. Percheron and some other breed mixed they work willingly and have great strength and stamina!\" announced the driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoothing his hand down the broad hairy neck of a monster of a horse, George felt the strength. Moving to almost face the beast he put both hands to each side of the strong neck and looking up at the driver announced, \"I almost died coming up the mountain on a bike! Wish, I wish I had the strength and stamina of this beauty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver leaned forward as the silver ring seemed to glow bright and yellow. Just as suddenly George stood very erect of stance, almost as if hit by lightning. Then he slumped.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, he saw his body move, eyes flash of fear, and then try to scramble away on a fours. This was crazy, a dream, but no he was awake<br>\r\nfeeling, hearing, a pungent taste of metal in his mouth. The cool mountain breeze flushed over him and chills of sensual delights touch him all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky's calls to him beconed him to speak but each time he tried the most horendous sound emitted from his throat. As he stood there looking on these odd sensations seemed to suggest different body movements, shaking his head voilently, stomping a foot hard, flicking his tail whether from itchy flies or just to stroke a sensual part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word had a meaning but as quick as the word was thought of, it seemed as so much else to just fade into some vast dark space. Odd, so very odd the feelings about himself as if he was not clothed. Yet then too as he thought of clothes the meaning of such also drifted off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's my name he kept thinking, but the word Sampson also brought back fond thoughts of care and food. A turn to his right found himself face to face with one of those big horses. Even as he looked the strange hues of red, blue and powder shades whites took the place of vast colors which he'd known before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jingle of chains and rings of steel, plus the restraint of movement by dark colored straps made his movements short but often quick. As he looked into the horses face it opened it's mouth, showing great green teeth and gums. As if to bite him the animal made a lunge for him face.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A quick jolting lunge to dodge the attack made stranger yet notions of touching on his rear. A turn to look behind only made the mixed signals and sights make George afraid of what he saw and felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down George let the Paramedics help you, George, George!\" said Becky as she fussed with him yet he felt not her touch. Nor did he feel the touching of those trying to desperatly hold him down. Indeed he was standing several yards away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the passion play which was going on before all there brought the Coach driver to take a solid hold of the dark straps which bound George's face and head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy Sampson, easy boy, we can't leave until this trouble is over!\" said the Coachman to George as the words strived for meanings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was much less delighted that the odd touching of the Coachman as he kept touching George's face, cheek, and rubbing his hand over lips and nose. Feeling angry George snorted hard and made a grunting whinnie as if being very disturbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy must be gay to keep touching me so!\" thought George in a sudden fit of mental language. A yank of his head back only brought a jerking tug from the Coachman's well gripped hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of himself being loaded onto a gurney and rolled off to be placed aboard an ambulance met with some true wonders in George's thoughts. An uneasy feeling about the happenings brought the flicking of the appendage he knew wasn't his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd began to walk away as the scene was over and all went about there own business. It was then that George felt and heard what part of him said was normal and he thought as something of pure terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrack went the coach drivers whip and a hardy, \"Geedie Up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the horses behind and to his right began to move, making him move as well. Tugging pulling his own he was somehow part of this team, \"but that isn't right!\" or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Horses and animals pull coaches and he was human, a free man!\" the idea's poured through his mind. Yet with each step and more and more the team moved on down the road. Thoughts were rapidly becoming grouped into desires mixed with fear and the passion to run from the whip drove George to run with mindless haste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnuffing and snorting he ran in time with the horses. George amidst the fear of that whip admired his stamina, and the brute strength he felt as muscles works and legs ran over the hard ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs forest opened to grassey plains he had a desire to taste the grass but that damn whip drove him to fearing it's sound and touch. His vision and colors bade him pay attention to the road ahead and pay little thought to what be on either side of where he was going. A square pad blocked his view of the horse beside him and he wanted to look back and beg the driver to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yell of the driver drove him and he was sure the other on. As road and miles went by he again saw the buildings of the town and had a inner feeling about his safety there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA yell from the Coachman, \"Whoe, whoe, whoe there Sampson whoe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the coach came to a halt the huffing breath of tired animals filled George's ears. Even as he felt the sweat on his body chill from the cool mountain air he saw much to his wonder the approach of the Coachman himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best run yet ole' stud! I think you need a reward after today's work, how about you and Mona here making a little whoopie!\" said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge looked to where the man seemed to point and only saw that large angry mare that tried before to take a bite. Crazy as this all was the feeling of the man's words and suggestion was making George get erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" George thought as he felt his penis seemingly fall out into the chilled air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to one side and then the other George saw people point and some laugh at his open erection. \"He'd never had such a happening before! Why becky never said anything since the monster was kept under wraps. Oh, but now his monster was out in the open for all to see! No man would allow himself to be defiled so in public, he was George.....George....he was....he ....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking again forward the Coachman patted George's face again. \"Time for another good run there my Sampson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George, George Sampson that's me!\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Round trip after trip, after trip till sweating and dust covered he was at last led to the stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAching muscles strong as they may be were still used that day leaving George tired and willing to rest. A rubdown and brushing almost bade him to fall asleep standing up. As we know horses don't stand up and sleep but might doze as humans do from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk was coming and George felt very mixed about what or even where he was. The sight of the Coachman coming with a rein made him perk up and take notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok big boy to the corral for tonight, Mona is waiting and looking more than willing.\" he said as if a ignorant stallion might understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet some of the words and idea's came through the murky mind which was the new George. Prancing with some inner delight George followed the man. As they neared the corral a heady scent of mare in heat stunned the stallion's mind. Urges, a rush of sensual lusts and urges to dominate over this mare came as a flood of wild passions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge stood there getting more erect with every second. Little did he care now as he did earlier in the day. Occurance after each hard round of pulling the coach brought a need for relief, and with it his embaressment faded. George was also willing and very ready to enjoy his well endowed loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before the Coachman walked away George was high in the air. Mounted high and deep he stood feeling primal urge to procreate and so he did as nature demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was filled with encounter after encounter with the big mare. George was never a mad lover of women but this was an experiance he'd look back on with definate pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning brought on renewed sights and sounds. A tired and well pleased stallion stood as the Coachman prepared him for another full day of pulling the heavy coach. As if his wild night of passion would not be the final straw in erasing any human memories, another full day as a team leader would also take it's toll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCare for Becky had with his friendly encounter vaporized. George was also not thinking, just reacting as a beast simulated by things around him and the fears which drove his body down the dusty road. Soon enough even the name George would slip from his mental grasp and only the name Sampson would stick as if he'd been a horse all his life.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A quick scoop and he had the bobble, while wishing to learn it's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paid help of a Indian medicine woman, and her knowledge of the ring was the way to make him richer than rich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs weeks and months passed Ron watched his stallion go from a creature of almost human hygiene to one of a basic beastial attitude.

Time after enriching time men and women which the crime bosses wanted killed were offered continued life by Ron and John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one the person was shown horses, cows, or lessor types of fam animals. Then place on their shaky knees before the animal the ring placed on a finger, the offer of a quick death or life as an animal was offered. Once done the animal feeling very disturbed was led away.

As his caller put in an order for dispensing of a 30 year old blonde, a person who while giving and enjoying had heard too much to be trusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want it done with some flare, she is to be melded with a Palamino. I want her to have blone hair which she so treasures, for the rest of her life, understand me John?\" said the crime boss JoJO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was agreed for the sum of twenty thousand dollars she would take up retirement at the local riding academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days later the limo pulled up and to surprise John and Ron out stepped JoJO and a tall, very well endowed, blonde bimbo. JoJO, himself dressed looking like a Coney Island ice cream huckster and his doll with a tight short sweater that bulged from her sylicone chest. A mini skirt so short one could see some underbrush when she leaned over to kiss JoJO's balding head. Then too her knee high black patent leather boots having five inch heals, wow what a B-i-m-b-o !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Johnny boy how's it hang'in?' said JoJO as he walked over to shake the hand of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fine JoJO, is she the one?\" asked John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey darlin' where's this special blonde pony you want me to see?\" asked the l-a-d-y.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked toward Ron and rolled his eyes as if he couldn't believe this one, for sure. \"Please follow me and we shall pay our pet Palamino a visit.\" suggested John as the Lady, JoJO, Ron, and John headed down the path toward the riding stable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn and Ron watched JoJO as he looked very nervous. \"Not feel'in so good there JoJO ole' man?\" asked Ron with a sleezy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Lady and John continued down the path he turned with a tough mean look to Ron. \"I'm paying good money for your service and unless you want to feel my wrath I suggest you cut the qute remarks. I happen to be very fond of Schinelle' we had a fun time together. You see I got partners and they wanted to bump her off, you know a shot to the head! That was not what I want for her, she has known me like few ever did, and I want her to live on even if her human body doesn't, understand?\" questioned JoJO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea sure JoJO, we meld Schinelle into a Palamino mare, then you put a bullet through her pretty human head to satisfy your partners, simple JoJO!\" said Ron still with an attitude problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men argued some more as they walked down to meet John and Schinelle. As the rounded the bend there next to the corral fence stood Schinelle petting a yearling Palamino mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh JoJO, she's so nice and soft, sweet, can she be mine, oh please, oh please, please, please, JoJO, JoJO, please Darlin'\" begged, nagged, and pleaded Schinelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show her fella's and do it quick!\" said JoJO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was right, Darlin' you want me silent, your going to have them kill me and what of the pretty blonde pony, her too! Oh you monster! I give you the best years of my life, go through five operations to make my breast look like jugs! I entertain those mobsets you call partners, they pinch, prod, and finger fuck me day and night! Oh but for the love and touch of my JoJO I'd do anything, so now we must kill the one lady in your life who was more than just another hooker!\" slice, diced, and hammered Schinelle at JoJO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ring my dear!\" said John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ring, JoJO, you want to marry me?\" Oh sweetie I'm so sorry for what your love'in munchkin said! Your going to marry me and we can live happily ever after mister and misses, Schinelle and Mister JoJO, ahh what in your last name darlin?\" wondered Schinelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Donkey might have been more worthy!\" chidded Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets get this over with!' said JoJO as he grabbed Schinelle's left hand, and reached it over to touch the forehead of the Palamino yearling mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JoJO, No man!\" yelled John, but too late as the ring glowed and the trade was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the Palamino mare bolted away from the fence. At the same instant Schinelle dropped to her knees. A JoJO big boss of crime stood shaking from head to foot.

A higher shrill whinny came from the pretty Palomino as that large girthed stallion shaft pressed at as slide between and sank deep inside the horny mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Hey Schinelle, welcome now to living your life here at Sunrise Farms, as we here are all friendly, especially the stallions to our mares!\"</b> John said, as smiled at the golden mare, he seeing Schinelle bearing her teeth from the feeling of the massive draft horse maleness doing to her what JoJo tried so often, but not with such mastery of the manly male essence, as could a stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the JoJo human body began to stir, as groaned, Ron there forgetting what his boss said he wanted to try, as re-do.

Kevin and his adopted half brother Kyle had ruled the gambling and cartel sales for many years.

Kyle did the final choice as where he would hide, a place what surprised his brother. John had handed to Kyle the offers as where he could hide away with relative ease. Making use of the ring, Kyle allowed his mental transference into the brute form of a yearling Black Angus bull. As after the transfer was completed, and Kevin took the sedated body of his half brother back to the city, while parked along a city street some paid gunman walked past the parked car and fired six bullets into the head and chest of what was, just hours previous then Kyle Rooste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin learned to like ruling alone the mob syndicate, as he failed to aid his brother returning to being again human and left him as a bull for five years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn remained true to Kyle, as once each month he would take the bull from the pasture to the barn-stables and house him there, giving Kyle time alone to clear his mind from living life as a wild and sexual beast. John would talk with Kyle, reminding him to use his brain for something better than a battering-ram to fend away other challenging bulls wishing to breed. John would talk and pose questions, he asking Kyle to respond by pawing of the right fore-hooves to signify a yes commented answer, or the use of the left fore hooves as a No answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn began to feel jealous of his bullish friend, as much wishing verbally and openly to his friend as partner Ron, suggesting for someday, John would like to be transferred and be then a bull, permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was not favorable of his partner actively wishing he could someday be transferred into the embodiment of a beef producing bull. He went as far as to allow John to try a transfer, while keeping the beastly inhabited human body kept sedated until a second transfer was completed some two weeks later. As John did trade bodies with a Shorthorn breed bull, he endeavored with herd breeding of cows during that seasonal time of cows in estrus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn returned to being human but continued his delighted practice of leaping pasture fences and staying by night with the cows, avidly mating with then the heifer what were not too tall to dominate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon and John felt a similar concern as what Kevin would do if he knew his adopted brother Kyle were set free from his lifetime adventure being a herd-sire bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLimo driver Chester was tricked into inciting the ring to transfer him, making of the black man a black bull. He too became quickly elated with passionate desires for cow rumps and weathered tough cow vulvas. Indeed the ring was a credit to its owners. Used to hide people, and give then John his fun time learning well what it is like when being a bull caught in a time of rut.</span></div></div>",

Life force transfers the ring and its embedded spellbinding powers grant the personality entering an animal embodiment the ability to recall their previous lifetime memories. As it happened first to George a friend and employee there at the farm he wore the ring and was transferred his life-force into the form of a prize stallion used primarily as a breeding stud. He retained his human memories and the wealth of schooled knowledge for about a year. As he was put to work being at stud, breeding with equine mares, with each session he lost a little of his remembered past, until by the first anniversary of his transitioning, he stood as a proud stallion, though about as ignorant as if he were a common born equine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl Albert, as of his limo driver by the name of Chester, Ron prompted and aided the transferal of a black man to live then inside the black furred bullish body of a mature herd-sire bull. Chester felt a strange delight about having become a bull, as then on his first evening being a bull, he walked in circles inside the stall, gaining knowledge how to best use his brute talents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdeas of relativity aid the ring and its magic to offer to some an acclimation clause, and from such they who become an animal, find the experience a personal joy and a wonderful host of new feelings. Therefore, Chester was not angry at Ron or of Daryl for allowing the transfer to occur. He rather liked being then a bull, suddenly free of all injustice, without a worry as to income, taxes, or what to buy or get rid of, he was as one set wonderfully free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMooing his thoughts, the tone of his moo he tried to adjust, giving consideration as to how, if he were again a human, the heard tone of a moo might suggest what he felt or thought. Moos and mooing aroused interests of the heifers and cows standing in a corral, they just on the other side of the barn wall from the big black bull. Mooing of feeling began a conversing between Chester and the cows. Their moans and groaning lasted the evening and through the night, until come the morning when a the door from the stall to the corral opened and bull plodded out to meet his first lovers of his two foot long bovine maleness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quite as passing wonderment given consideration by Chester, he pondered as why the differences to what is beauty? Beauty to men when looking at a woman is her face and form. That first morning and Chester mingled quickly with the heifers and mature cows. He thought firstly to look them in the face, but so doing they all rather looked alike. His instincts then gave him a swift kick, as suggesting he should seek where the spicy scent he smelled was emanating. So doing, and Chester discovered the wafting scent originated to the rear of the cows, he sniffing them, did with a couple he licked, realizing the scent held a flavor, his bull instincts guided him to know what to do next, as next, until he felt sated, somewhat!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchinelle lasted though the same night, she bothered by the aroused stallions, as found her passions as changing, learning to appreciate the girth and depth what a stallion could offer as a thrill when they mated. All of her concerns and worries as to her transferred life force into the mare form had subsided, the acclimation portion of the spellbinding was working to make, keep a Palomino mare elated with stallions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night and early morning found Kyle rising with the sun peering over the eastern hills. He stirred in bed, wowing the feeling of bedding, of sheets, a blanket, pillow to lay his head, enjoying human trappings again. Kyle was a womanizer and he rising felt his still bullish desire to mount and mate before enjoying some grazed breakfast. He did not know what was the reality of JoJo being then as was his girlfriend Schinelle. Kyle entered the bedroom of Schinelle and slipping under the sheets, he began his molesting a blonde bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoJo awoke and was not pleased by the taunting pleasuring, he began to call for Ron and Daryl to come to her aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first argument of the new day began and finished with Kyle returning laughingly to his own bedroom, as Schinelle the bimbo of a sex model lay awake, grumbling to Ron, suggesting he should make a pig of his friend for acting like a pig wanting sex.</span></div></div>",

JoJo did as what he/she felt was what all women do every morning, he dumb to the true ways of women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoJo discovered the intensity of a female orgasm, and he liked what he felt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning the breakfast table was a scene of warfare reconciled between Schinelle and Kyle. Ron and John sat at the table, each having to listen to the rantings coming from a hot dolly made angry by some man sliding under her bedsheets and tonguing her awake. Kyle spoke of manly domination of the weaker genders, and with Schinelle being the only female at the table, there was no doubt as what Kyle was suggesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen JoJo could stand no more words about what is a woman for a man, she rose to her feet and pointing at Kyle, she said,<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>\"Five years hiding inside a vile bull did little to give you any appreciation for beauty. You have a bestial fetish for tonguing of vulvas and enjoyment of the scent born to being a woman!\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle just sat by the table and laughed. He too would be the fist to agree, if he wanted to speak his mind. He had enjoyed his time being a bull. Brute strength and equally stout was his two-foot long, bullish cock, not to forget his furred black testicles, they the size of large Yams, rich with volumes of semen. That morning when again human, though then being a black man did not bother him, he was a black bull, and colors meant nothing to the cows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchinelle stormed away from the table, she walking outside the house, her inklings taking her to where the real Schinelle was nearby in the pasture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding aside the pasture fence, JoJo - Schinelle called to his hot dolly by name. <span class=\"chotpink\"><i>\"Schinelle..., please dearest come to be by me, I wish we could talk about what happened.\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small herd of horses kept there at Sunrise Farms were for riding by John and Ron or any of there special friends. Each of the stallions as to their mentalities were once those of men transferred into being as and living like do horses. There were three mares, one of which was a Palomino mare, as that embodiment held the memories of what was Schinelle before she transferred. The other two mares were Sandy and Marge, both being fun flings that Ron had promised to marry. He offered each a ring to wear to show his love for them and took them riding, as once the ring touched then animal flesh, the transfer happen in a twinkling of an eye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Palomino mare would not come anywhere close to what was once her real born body, JoJo - Schinelle climbed through the fence planks and began walking through the pasture to meet then with the golden mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMEANWHILE:  Kyle used the phone to give a friendly alerting call to his brother Kevin, letting him know he was still alive and then again being a human. Kevin was less than happy to know his brother was again human. Their phone conversation was overheard by John while Ron was doing his morning duty in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"But brother I am a man again, though far different than the brother form I lost and you let the crime bosses put a contract on and had my body killed. Did you think I would remain an animal permanently? Well, too bad, as I am human again and want back into the game. As I recall there was the matter of my owning a house and my estate. Especially the twenty plus millions of dollars we had salted away in Swiss bank accounts, as I have need of my millions.\" </i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin argued the millions were gone, taken by the crime syndicate as back pay for the siphoning of their funds into the private account belonging to Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked like a man ready to explode, wide eyed and gritting his teeth, he was ready to kill his only brother for stealing his wealth, his prized estate, and all that Kyle held dear. <b><span class=\"cgreen\">\"You are broke,\"</span></b> Kevin yelled across the phone to his brother. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\"If you are wise you would have Ron there at the farm transfer you again, as back into being a bull again. Oh yes, I knew that black bull there was the true you! In fact, I bribed Ron fifty grand to place you inside that yearling bull. As Ron said, he told me that as you grew and matured being in a bullish body, your mind would fade, and fading away to being the dull beast you always were!\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a moment later and Ron walked back into the farmhouse kitchen, he snugging tight his pants belt, as seeing the scowl on the face of what was then Kyle, he had enough sense to turn around and leave the house or get shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn got up and chased after Ron, as caught up with him, he told of what he had overheard said between Kyle and his brother Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>You now need to decide and hide, as Kyle will want to kill you for accepting a bribe that placed him into the form of a yearling bull. He knows about the fifty grand you took as blood money.\"</b> John said to Ron his friend and partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking as if surprised, Ron asked of John, <span class=\"clblue\"><i>\"What fifty thousand dollars, Kevin never paid me anything, I took no bribe. Kyle needed a place to hide and the yearling bull was available, even Kyle liked the big balls and the better angle of the belly sheath with thoughts of him mating cows as his favorite pastime. I, we need to explain to Kyle...\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, and the wham bang echo of a pistol shot rang out, Kyle stood on the house rear porch and was aiming to kill then Ron for what Kevin stated he had done to Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Here, you take the ring, use it if need be to hide among the herds.\"</b> John said to his partner Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon grabbed at the ring and slipped it on a finger for safe-keeping. He then ran, and run around the barn and into the corral to hide, in hope that John could quell Kyle from wishing to commit a murder.</span></div></div>",

How odd it must have been for a life form born to ignorance should find itself suspended in a new body and form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSampson kept hearing and understanding the language spoken about and to him of his condition. Slowly the happenings made sense even though he was questioning everything as it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky emitted such sweet scents that Sampson knowing only primal intents and nothing of Jewish - Christian morals often touched her as he pleased. Even the sight of his new body pleasured him as he was now able to touch what was either out of reach or not ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs night came the wild eyed man thought more and found his human brain able to do more than just one thing at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I consider, I was Sampson, I was a Horse, but now what am I and how did I get to be one of these creatures?\" he said out loud over and over till the answers came from the depths of his new memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, that man touched me and somehow I became him! Oh my, then if I'm him he must be what I was, a horse!\" considered Sampson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the coming of morning Sampson was ready to talk with Becky and ask the dozens of questions stored in this his new brain and mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George, your looking better this morning!\" said Becky as she came in that bright sunny Sunday morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell..o Becky...!\" replied the stallion in human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite the scare you caused yesterday!\" spouted Becky as she pulled up a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beck...y I am Sampson, not your George!\" said George's mouth with a slurred effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not Sampson of the Bible, your George Freeman my best friend and dearest love!\" replied Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have the ring, Becky?\" asked again the stranger in George's form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" replied Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ring is what caused the entire situation, as I think about it!

My name was Sampson, two years ago my mare dropped me and I was born a Percheron colt. Weaned by the mare, I grew fast and soon was part of the team working the trading post run. I remember more of my horse life with each passing hour. Yet I am more than thrilled to remain this human as long as you my dear will be my friend.

In his own way he knew far too much detail of stallion's life and the many strange and new attitudes which only a horse might have known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was released later that week from the Hospital, he and Becky began living together under one roof. It took only a few days more and the young woman found herself so intergued by Sampson's manners that she was first to suggest he try her in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInthatuation soon took Becky's sense of loyality. Sampson won her heart as weeks past. Bottles or rogain, penis enhancer, and jars of muscle builder testerone made the meager body of George to one more in tune to the way Sampson was as a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks became months as Sampson worked and slipped into George's workplace and old lifestyle. Becky too was finding him more of the kind of man she might marry. It was two years to the day when at last the vows of marriage sent two happy people on a Honeymoon trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the deep desires of his lusting mind Sampson had wanted one thing. His fond dream was of Mona, a gorgous and mature Percheron mare. A team member she pulled beside him on the front line of the Trading Post coach. As the ring gave him new joy and a more fulfilled lifestyle he wanted as much for Mona. The ring, if it still exsisted, was his idea of bringing Mona and Becky into that moment of passion. Once completed, Becky could be with her simple minded boyfriend, as he would have lusty Mona to live and love for many years to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it came to be that the two had their second night as wedded lovers in the upstairs room of Trader's Inn. As morning sun crested the eastern slopes Sampson was already in the stables. In a large box stall stirred his previous body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge by the time two years had passed was lost in the sensual and instinct driven life of being a ignorant male horse. Even with the approach of his previous form's coming to visit the seeing of himself again took it's common reaction, a stiff erection!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSampson too felt the feeling of arousal as his enhanced shaft grew to meet the possible delight. Turning from his past form he looked down the number of stalls till two hearty buttocks brought back wonderful memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mona!\" said Sampson as the huge mare turned hearing her name called. As he approached her he saw a yearling mare looking very much like her mother Mona. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lover you have been busy I see, well soon I will have you with me!\" said Sampson aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not likely!\" said a gravely voice from in the darkened end of the stable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSampson stood rigid with fear as the dark figure came closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen into the dim lights of the stable came his past mentor and driver of the coach he'd been part in part thereof. Ron Hanson came closer to Sampson, the bright silver ring showing on his pinky finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt this is what your looking for, right ole' friend and onetime stallion named Sampson!\" chidded Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I'm....!\" Sampson started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup your that man who touched the face of Sampson the horse. Your the man who collapsed in the street that very day too! Your no doubt Sampson the prime stallion and team leader, but now in the body of a once human man that resides inside your animal self over there. So my stud, why have you come back?\" said Ron Hanson looking tough and mean like normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want that ring, it hold's my fondest desire to be married to the true love of my life, Mona!\" said Sampson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So ole' friend, what's this worth to you in human monies, and not in hay and oats?\" Ron begged on Sampson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the two years Sampson's ruthless behavior at work had boosted him into management and way higher in pay. \"I offer you $25,000. dollars and the return of the ring once the transfer in completed, what say you to that Ron?\" asked Sampson.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

George was shocked that Becky was so into this.  She never seemed to be that type of person.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to moan as George went to work.  He had been with other women before Becky, but no one had every responded like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I knew how good that feels.\" George said as he continued.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth George and Becky failed to notice the ring on George's finger glow as the old spell on it came to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge didn't realize the effect his words would have.  George's short, brown hairs slowly lengthened and pushed further out from his head. They continued to grow longer and longer, locks fluttering about his form. The lengthening hair continued and then stopped once those flowing brown hairs reached down to his mid back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge's face changed next.  His cheeks puffed slightly. Eyelashes pressed onwards though they did not grow much farther. Nose slimmed and pulled inwards as his lips filled with a red color and swelled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the hairs that covered his body disappeared into his skin. As each hair was drawn back, his rough skin softened and took on a light tan.  George's strong muscles deflated while his body continued to soften.  Slowly but surely, fat and flesh piled onto his once masculine chest. Underneath his nipples, his skin swelled and pressed outwards. At first, there wasn't much more then simple swellings there. Those swellings grew however and took on a rounded shape as they pushed against his shirt. The circular shape upon them grew more defined and soon, George was now sporting a blossoming set of breasts which appeared to be set in the B-range, the same size as Becky's. Once small nipples, lengthened, the aureoles growing in diameter. Those nubs darkened to a pinkened shade as those nipples shifted to match the newly feminine look on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change then began to dive downwards towards his hips and thighs. Fat began to cause his thighs to grow just a tad, hips spreading apart as George's feminine curves came into being. His rear was also assaulted by the addition of flesh and rounded outwards. His waist slimmed considerably, but the most drastic change was just starting between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis manhood was slowly being drawn backwards towards his body. As each moment passed, that shaft shrunk. Smaller and smaller it had gotten, the head sinking into the rest of it. Soon, that head was nonexistent. His member was now a small shaft, smooth and ending in a round point. The slit where the once head of his length was closed and soon, what had once been his manhood was little more then a small nub upon his skin. It wasn't done shifting though. The round sack underneath that shaft was drawn close to his body. With a pop, both balls slipped back into his insides. Scrotum continued to draw backwards and as his groin nearly smoothed over, an indentation formed in the middle of it. Soon, that indentation split and vertically lengthened. The small nub that was his shaft disappeared into his growing slit where it fell into place as his newly acquired clitoris. His balls were still moving and shifted upwards, reforming into a pair of feminine ovaries. Estrogen was already staring to be produced by them as they assumed their new role. His slit had nearly reached it's full form, when George s insides shifted as a uterus was forming inside. Where his manhood had once been, now was the soft delicate folds of a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment that George noticed that things seemed to feel a bit\u2026 Odd. Not bad, but strange. His entire body felt tingly, but mostly around his groin. The feeling of being inside of Becky had changed somehow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge opened his pleasure blurred eyes and looked down. It took a moment for the sight to register, but he gasped in shock as it did. George was still the one on top, but instead of being the penetrator, he was being penetrated! Somehow George had changed into Becky! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge's eyes met Becky's, and both could see the other's shock. After a split second of confusion, they pulled themselves apart as quickly as possible. George shivered in pleasure at the odd sensations Becky's cock sent through his body as it pulled free of his entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha.. What the hell just happened??\" George squeaked. The sound of his voice, high pitched and feminine, was like a physical blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell should I know??\" Becky said, voice deep and masculine. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn't understand what happened and stopped as his eyesight became blurry. His scalp itched as his short brown hair grew long and wavy. His entire body tingled as his skin became smooth and his body hair fell out. His nose became smaller as his lips plumped. His eyebrows thinned and became sleek as his eyelashes lengthened and curled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge didn't notice his neck become longer and thinner as his adam's apple disappeared. His shoulders became less broad as his muscles shrank to almost nothing. His hands became long and sleek as his fingernails lengthened and covered themselves in red nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest felt heavy as his nipples and the skin around them slowly stretched until they were both C-sized breasts. His legs lengthened and his feet became smaller. His body curved forming an hour-glass shape and finally he felt his ass perk up as his balls and penis disappeared inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change wasn't done as his pants became tight blue jeans which showed off a round ass and lean legs. His shirt became a white tank-top which revealed his belly-button and his now-oversized boxers became tight pink panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge remained unaware of the changes at first as he sat down and turned on the TV to watch the Monday Night Football Game.  For some reason that he didn't know his thoughts kept slipping to Tom Brady and how hot he looked in his football uniform. He was freaked out by these thoughts as he thought he was still a guy and tried to shake them out of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter snacking on some pretzels, George started to feel thirsty.  He entered the bathroom to get a drink and he immediately noticed the female figure staring back at him. He let out a high pitched scream and covered his mouth when he noticed the loss of depth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to think of what could have caused this and remembered what he had said in the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he wanted to know what women thought and now he does.</span></div></div>",

While Tracy barely paid attention to the Simon and began to make shots of her surroundings and the people, Gwen was attentive to Simon, even asking him a few detailed questions. Becky, George and Tracy together rolled their eyes as they couldn't believe someone was really listening to all of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they were finally done at the fountain Simon took them on a stroll throughout town. Becky first walked with George next to her, but soon Becky was walking next to Tracy and Gwen while George talked with Simon. Seemed they both supported for the same basketball team and they couldn't stop talking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did ya notice?\" Tracy asked Becky. \"I believe we just passed a statute of the founder of this town and Simon didn't tell us a thing. We're so lucky with your friend Becky.\" Tracy said relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too bad. I would like to know more about the foundation of the town.\" Gwen said mumbling. Tracy gave Becky a look that said she didn't agree with that viewpoint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued the tour of the town and Becky found out more about Tracy and Gwen. Tracy was indeed a professional photographer. She liked photographing weddings the most, probably because she wanted to get married herself one day. Gwen was a professional secretary to a bigwig executive, though she didn't act like it was important. Becky wondered why these two women were friends. Talking a bit more revealed their joined thread, they were both single. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tour was finished the group came back to the fountain. Both Simon and George went into a nearby caf\u00e9 to get some drinks for them all.

Becky pulled off a couple of faces ranging from the look of interest she saw Gwen using to looking very seductive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of seductive Becky looked down at the summer dress. Apart from her face her body felt different as well. Becky felt her wider hips, her thicker thighs rubbing against each other, her feet encased in the flats. And then there were her breasts. Becky looked down to see a pale cleavage appearing from it, a grin appeared on her face. She always wondered what it would feel like having bigger breasts and now she had them.

But with Gwen's body that might be a completely different thing. \"I think I need to inspect myself further.\" Becky said in Gwen's lower voice. She got inside a stall and sat down on the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky removed the straps of the dress and lowered them as the dress revealed more of her figure. When she could see her bra, Becky stopped. Becky was amazed by what she saw. It was a very sexy bra, a black frilly one containing the biggest cleavage she ever saw. She never imagined Gwen the type for wearing a thing like this. And why would she wear one like this? Was she expecting something after it? Becky didn't know what it meant but one thing she knew she had to pull the bra off. Becky's hand automatically went behind her back and undid the bra. She expected it would be harder, since it wasn't her own body but it happened automatically. She felt her breasts sag a little but not that much. Becky grinned at the sight below her, she never expected to find a sight like this down below in her life. And the size of her areolas the size of teacups, and her nipples thick and juicy ones. Becky couldn't hold herself and slowly touched one. Becky couldn't contain herself as she grabbed her breasts and heaved them, she grinned madly at the fact that she could this now with her own breasts, well Gwen's breasts but who cared? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky slowly felt her vagina wanting some of the action as well, but the others were waiting for her?

Becky grabbed underneath the dress and pull her underwear down. A little black thong. Gwen was full of mysterious, first the bra and now her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was something for later, Becky needed something else now.

Becky could not believe the sensation of doing that, her body was waiting for this to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my.\" She moaned not believing how sexy that sounded to her. She really needed this, her body was so in need of this. With one hand still pleasuring her vagina, she still had one other hand free.

Perhaps staying like this wouldn't be so bad after all? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was about to finally have an orgasm, something happened as an image formed inside her mind of a..</span></div></div>",

But as she tried to think of George; she found her body not accepting George's body. She somehow felt even less aroused than before. Becky didn't want that, she tried to jerk off as she felt her body wanting a release. She tried to think of someone else, her mind wandered to the tourguide but he wasn't cutting it either. She then thought of Tracy. At the thought of Tracy though Becky felt her body reacting. She felt her vagina moisturizing at the thought of her. Becky never felt that way about women but somehow her body only accepted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind she continued thinking up images of Tracy in various poses. She felt the orgasm rapidly approaching. She then imagined Tracy on her knees licking her snatch. That thought seemed to do it for Becky as her body began shaking as it orgasmed. Becky felt amazing while pulling her thick nipples. She never found herself this good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky's hands were already traveling down again for another killer orgasm when she decided this was enough for now. This was her body now for a while and she didn't only want to use it for masturbation, although it seems it was very good at it. Becky dressed herself up as she pulled up her thong, fastened the bra and pulled up the straps of her dress. Leaving the stall Becky saw Gwen's reflection in the bathroom mirror. The same as when she entered it, although she did feel more comfortable in Gwen's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reminded her of something as Becky washed her hands under the sink. She could only orgasm properly when she thought of Tracy. Would that mean Gwen was a lesbian, or was she now a lesbian. And were Gwen and Tracy together? She had to find out. Looking one last time into the mirror to see if she looked okay, she left the bathroom and hurried back to the fountain where Tracy was still sitting. There was no sight of George and Gwen, were they already off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you.\" Tracy said looking up from her phone as Becky came closer to her. She stood up and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She was wearing a lavender maternity dress that showed off her baby bump with some brown sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you .

Becky guessed she must be half black or hispanic. Becky wished that George would get around to proposing to her.

Becky had been dropping hints to George the last few weeks about getting married, but it seems he hadn't taken the hint. The tour started in the center of the town begining with the fountain. While Mark barely paid attention to to Madison and began to look at other women in his surroundings when Lauren wasn't looking at him. Lauren was attentive to Madison, even asking her a few detailed questions about the town. Becky and George couldn't believe someone like Mark would be staring at other women while his wife was right beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they were finally done at the fountain Simon took them on a stroll throughout town. Becky first walked with George next to her, but soon Becky was walking next to Lauren while George talked with Mark. It seemed that they both supported for the same football team and they couldn't stop talking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just notice that?\" Lauren asked Becky. \"I believe that was a statue of the founder of this town and Madison didn't even mention it.\". \"I'm lucky you're here to fill me in.\" Becky said relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame. I wanted to know more about how this town started.\" Lauren said mumbling. Becky gave Lauren a look that said she agreed with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued the tour of the town, Becky found out more about Lauren and her husband Mark. Lauren was a stay at home wife after dropping out of college to marry Mark. She liked horses and the Wild West. She dragged Mark out here because she felt they grew apart in the last few months and thought that this would help them reconnect. Becky thought it was a sweet idea; probably because she wanted to get married herself one day. Mark was a successful junior business executive to a multinational shipping company, though Lauren didn't like that his work seemed more important than her. Becky wondered why this couple even got married if their marriage fell apart within a year. Talking a bit more, Lauren was planning to file for divorce if Mark didn't show any improvement to her by the end of their vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tour was finished the group came back to the fountain. Both Mark and George went into a nearby cafe to get some drinks for them all. Becky and Lauren sat down on the edge of the fountain for some womanly talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so lucky Lauren. I wish I was married and expecting my first baby.\" Becky said wishfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I envy your life too Becky. I wanted more with my life than being a housewife to an ungrateful husband.\" Lauren said. \"You actually get to be with a man that loves you and not just your body when he happens to be around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lauren, check out what I found before the tour started.\" Becky said as she grabbed the ring from her pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful.

The ring used its magic to draw in their souls before switching the two souls around, placing Becky's soul inside of Lauren's body and vice versa. It all happened in a fraction of a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Becky woke up she felt something was different about herself, but didn't know what exactly. She felt weird too like she had eaten too much and felt bloated and sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's an espresso.\" George said holding out a cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks babe. I really need one of these.\" Becky said as she puckered up her lips expecting a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling okay Lauren? I'm flattered but I'm already taken.\" George said as he handed the espresso to Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren? What is he talking about? Is this some kind of joke that he and Mark thought of inside the cafe? Becky wondered. Becky then noticed that the ring was no longer inside the palm of her hand anymore. Speaking of her hand, her hand looked different. It was much darker than hers and had a wedding band on. Becky then Looked to her right and got the biggest shock in her life. Next to her George was a very familiar looking girl. It was Becky herself! But how could she be there and here at the same time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren looked just as confused while holding the cup of espresso that George handed to her. Becky lightly touched the other Becky's shoulder. When the other Becky looked at her, an expression of shock was revealed on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ladies alright? You look a bit out of it?\" Mark asked he he came up and saw the two women staring at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we need to freshen up.\" The other Becky said grabbing hold of Becky's darker hand and dragged her off to the nearby restrooms. The restroom were empty when they got inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let me assume that you're Becky right?\" The other Becky asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but who are you?\" Becky asked but then caught sight of her reflection. Standing at her spot in the mirror was the reflection of Lauren wearing the lavender dress with a giant baby bump underneath. How was this possible? Becky thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit. Please tell me you're Lauren right?\" Becky asked while Lauren nodded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be impossible. I mean how could we have switched bodies?\" Becky asked Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be that ring. It happened when we touched it at the same time.\" Lauren said as she held out her pale hand and revealed the ring still in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me touch it. We might be able to switch back if we touch it at the same time again.\" Becky said as she reached for the ring. But before she could touch it, Lauren closed her hand and pulled it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast Becky, why not try each other's lives out for a bit?\" Lauren said smiling for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Becky asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean we are in each other's bodies right now. This is a once in a lifetime experience. No one would ever suspect we swapped bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you trying to go with this?\" Becky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, why don't you try out my life for a while? I could use a break from Mark and carrying around all that weight. Didn't you say that you wished you were expecting your first child? Spend a night in my shoes and fulfill your wish.\" Lauren suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. What would I do as you?\" Becky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Try out sex with Mark. The pregnancy makes sex feel way better with all the hormones.\" Lauren said with a devilish grin. Part of Becky thought having sex with another woman's body would be too weird, but another part of her was turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would we be able to trade back soon? George and I leave in two days.\" Becky asked Lauren to reassure herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why it should still work.\" Lauren said to Becky. \"Now come on, we better get back to our men before they think something is suspicious.\" Lauren said as she held out her other hand that didn't have the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky took her former hand when she felt kicking inside her</span></div></div>",

It was so weird seeing another face in the mirror. Her long brown hair was gone replaced with courser black hair that was tied in a bun. Becky never wore her hair in a bun often as she usually had to at work. And then her face; her face looked completely different from what she normally had. Her blue eyes replaced with brown eyes, her cute button nose was replaced with a wider nose which along with her thicker lips accentuated Lauren's African heritage while her cheeks and eyebrows showed off her caucasian half of her heredity. Becky quickly pulled off a couple of faces ranging from the look of interest she saw Lauren using to trying to look seductive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being able to wait any longer, Becky sat down on the toilet in one of the two stalls and pulled up the lavender dress. In addition to her face, her body felt completely different too. Becky felt her wider hips, bigger butt and saw her thicker thighs over her belly as she sat on the toilet. Her feet were encased in some brown sandals that looked cute. As she began peeing, Becky looked down to see a dark cleavage underneath her dress. A grin appeared on her borrowed face. She always wondered what it would feel like having bigger breasts and now she had them. Becky began feeling them up. They were pretty heavy and felt sensitive. Becky debated if she should take an even better look after she was done peeing.</span></div></div>",

Becky decided that she couldn't wait and had to relieve some tension. She cursed the new hormones she had as she walked back over to the mirror by the sink and pulled off her new dress. Her new figure however, made it somewhat of a chore. After the dress was off, Becky looked at the large breasts encased in a bra on her chest. George always said he didn't mind her having smaller breasts, but she felt agitated sometimes when she would catch him ogling other women's cleavage. But with Lauren's body that might be a completely different thing. \"I wonder if I should check myself out further.\" Becky said in Lauren's voice. She locked the bathroom door and looked at Lauren's reflection in the mirror wearing only her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky admired her bra. It was a very sexy bra, a black frilly one containing the biggest cleavage she ever saw. She never imagined Lauren as the type for wearing a thing like this while pregnant. And why would she wear one like this? Was she planning something after the tour? Becky didn't know why but one thing she knew she had to take the bra off. Becky's hand automatically went behind her back and undid the bra. She expected it would be harder, since it wasn't her own body but it happened automatically. She felt her breasts sag down as her swollen nipples began leaking milk. Becky grinned at the sight below her, she never expected to see another woman's breasts from this perspective in her life. Her dark areolas were the size of teacups, and her nipples were swollen and leaking milk. Becky couldn't contain her new hormones and slowly touched one. She grabbed her breasts and heaved them. Despite her breasts hurting a bit, she grinned madly at the fact that she could this now with Lauren's breasts, well hers for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky felt Lauren's vagina demanding attention. It wasn't like anything she had ever experienced before; she sometimes had the occasional need for some self help but nothing like this before. Becky bit her lip and thought about what she was about to do. She never in a million years would have thought to do something like in a public place but Lauren's body demanded it. She was a slave to Lauren's hormones. Becky leaned on the sink to allow her to take off her panties. Becky grabbed and pulled her panties down and kicked them off her feet. Becky saw on the floor that they were matching lacy panties. Lauren was full of mysteries, first the bra and now her panties. She must have planned something for her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could deal with Mark later. Becky needed something now. Using her fingers she parted her wet vagina open and slowly slid her fingers inside of it. Becky could not believe the sensation she felt. It was as if one movement inside her felt as if it was 20. Her body demanded a release for all this built up sexual tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh.\" She moaned not believing how sexy it sounded with Lauren's voice. She had to do this, her new hormones commanded her. With one hand still pleasuring her vagina, she still had one other hand free. Becky's other made it's way to her breasts playing with them and occasionally pinching her nipples. Becky couldn't believe how good it felt to be inside a pregnant body. Perhaps hers would feel similar when she got pregnant? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began thinking of an image of George having his way with her when she reached her climax. Her legs buckled and she fell to her knees as she drowned in a pleasure she never felt before. As Becky regained her senses, she noticed that she was on her knees and elbows. Even after the most amazing orgasm she ever had, she still felt horny. Deciding that she spent enough time in the bathroom, Becky began to get dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Becky had Lauren's clothes on, she looked herself over in the mirror and decided to take her hair out of the bun. Once satisfied that her new hair was presentable, Becky made her way outside to meet back up with Lauren and the guys. As the door closed behind her, a pair of lacy black panties and a wet puddle remained on the floor...</span></div></div>",

Her face was the girl next door cute but her body was not what she wanted. Becky had small tits (which later she found out to only be a 34B), but her belly had a decent sized pooch coupled with wide hips and no ass or legs to be proud of. She clearly didn't workout regularly as Lauren felt somewhat flabby and untoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lauren didn't really care about Becky's body at the moment. She just had sex with Becky's boyfriend George. He had an average sized penis and was okay in bed. Definitely nothing to write home about. Lauren was getting ready to take a bath and clean herself off before going to bed. She needed to get up early for her plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since meeting Mark in college, she had fallen in love with him. He used to be so sweet and romantic when they first started dating. She was dumb enough to think he was the one, so when he proposed to her, she eventually dropped out of college to raise a family. But after a couple months, she noticed how much Mark changed. He became a chauvinistic asshole that Lauren knew but couldn't prove was cheating on her. Thinking about divorcing him and going back to school, she found out that she had already become pregnant. She felt trapped. At least until Becky showed her that ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren had thought about who she could become while George fucked her. She could become young, beautiful or even rich if she wanted. But Lauren had a better idea. She was going to meet up where she knew Mark would be in the morning while Becky would still be asleep in her old body. She was going to show the ring to Mark and switch with him while convienently losing the ring. She knew that she could be better businessman than he ever was and she would still get to be a parent to her child. Mark deserved to be an out of shape 30 year old woman with small tits. He deserved to get fucked by George and his beer gut. Lauren knew George's type anyways. He was too scared to commit and would likely not marry Becky for a long time. Probably a couple more years. Becky deserved better than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut until then, she would enjoy what she had. After the water in the bath tub warmed up, Lauren lowered herself in and began playing with one of her borrowed nipples. As she felt her body begin to get aroused, she lowered her other hand to her temporary vagina and started rubbing her clit. Lauren had no clue how Becky could settle for just one orgasm a night for sex. She couldn't wait to have the penis in the relationship. Hopefully Becky would settle as the good mother and wife Lauren was expected to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren spent the hour masterbating in the tub to the thought of having her own penis while George laid asleep snoring.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    Becky grunted and neighed at George and Sally the mare as Sally in her body turned and said \"Okay \" as she took Georges hand , allowing him to lead her out of the stables. Becky tried to move and follow her human body out of the stable and attempt to swap back , but was just now noticing that she was basically immobilized by the tied off bridle and the bar behind her back legs. Becky realized that she could basically only stand in one , trapped in a horses body while Sally made an escape in her body. She began to stomp and buck trying to free herself when all of a sudden she was stopped short by a new and intoxicating smell. Becky couldn't place the musky scent , but it was doing odd things to her new form as well as making her slightly agitated. Hearing a noise behind her she turned her head to see the ranch foreman leading a large black stallion into her stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \" Its okay Sally ,\" the foreman said as he tied the stallion lead to a post at her side.  \"I know what you want and Thunder is going to give it to you. He is a big fella and has sired twenty five colts. I know it was mean to make you wait girl, but Thunder is sure to make you a mama again.\" the foreman stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Before Beckys higher brain functions shut down , what the rancher said registered. She craned her neck as far as she could and thought, \" Oh No! I swapped bodies with a horse and am about to be bred. I am going to be fucked by a horse!\" Becky tried to move away from the stallion but was unable because of the restraints. She saw his cock begin to emerge from his sheath and as it grew Becky became more fearful. \" He must be three foot long and as large as a bat!\" Becky thought a she tried to avoid being mounted. She was genuinely scared of the imposing stallion behind her as she heard the rancher say \" Now don't be scared Sally. Thunder is gonna make you feel real good little lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Neigh! Neigh!\" was all that came out as Becky tried to say ' No! You don't understand! I am not a horse. I am not Sally! We...we ... swapped bodies!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Soon enough Becky caught a new scent , different from the first one as Sallys body began to betray her mind. She felt her vagina getting wetter and her tail move to the side ad Thunder moved behind her and mount her. ' No! Thunder! Stop. Stop! I am a human. I am a human not Sally the roan mare ! ' After a few fruitless thrust by Thunder, missing the mark, he finally found his target. He shoved his whole three foot dick into Becky in one solid move causing Becky to let out a load \" Neigh!!!\" as she felt her new body taking the whole thing. This is what caused Becky to revert to the baser instincts ingrained in Sallys horse body to breed, and cause Becky to momentarily forget she was human. Somewhere in her brain Becky was saying ' Stop! I am a human! I can't have sex with horses!'   Thoughts that were overridden as Thunder viciously pounded his monster cock in her and responded with \" No Becky...You are Sally the roan mare now...and you like it. You are horse. Horses breed with other horses.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Soon enough Becky gave in as Thunder began gripping her with his forelegs, and began to cry out \" Yes! Yes! I am Sally now. Sally the roan mare. I Sally the roan mare exist to breed with other horses!\" of course all of that coming out as more neighs to the rancher. Thunder was thrusting as hard and as fast as only animals can and began began to bite Sallys mane. Then his fast ,short ,beastly strokes ceased as he buried himself to the hilt and began pumping quarts of his life giving horse seed into Sallys hungry , fertile, horse womb. As Becky felt her vagina orgasm and hungrily milk Thunders long , meaty , rod she thought to herself... ' I can get used to this. ' Thunder was still buried deep into her, and would stay there until he had pushed every last drop of sperm deep into her womb. As Thunder did eventually soften and dismount her, Becky thought, \" I thing I like this. Forget that human I used to be. I am Sally. I am Sally the roan mare for good now! She can have my old life!\" While the rancher was leading Thunder away, the new Sally was happily thinking about her new life as a breeding mare.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her bushy, black brush gone, replaced by smooth black skin, and short coarse fur. When she became aroused enough, Becky could watch as her clit pulsed in and out of her lips, eager for a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh, my god!!\u201d Becky groaned and bent over, presenting herself to the stallion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast drank in her scent and Becky shivered as she felt his hot breath blow across her nether regions. The stallion cared little about the transformations taking place to what he thought was a mare, about the tiny tail swishing between her buttocks, or broadening hips, or her feet growing inside her running shoes. He simply had one thing in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBecky quivered as the powerful animal straddled her, feeling his warmth, the brisling of his fur against her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah!\u201d She called out as his stiff member began its entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tight, but with surprising care, the stallion pushed into the mare-girl. As her cunt expanded, he began thrusting, making the teen scream as he plunged into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH\u2026\t OH\u2026 OH\u2026 No, oh gees\u2026 OH!\u201d Becky screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBeing too distracted be the happenings in her pussy,Becky didn\u2019t notice as her  running shoes split, revealing her strained socks, containing her new hooves. The stallion whinnied loudly, as Becky's muscles gained strength, allowing her to sensually manipulate his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe stallion\u2019s load exploded into as Becky climaxed once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh god\u2026\u201d She murmured as the beast pulled his softening member from her, their combined juices sliding down Becky\u2019s now furry legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBecky fell to the ground, exhausted. The stallion sniffed her dripping pussy and left, hoping to find fresh grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh, god\u2026 what have I done!\u201d Becky moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down to her groin, wishing to wipe away the sticky slime, only to find that her body had been drastically changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell happened to me?!\u201d Becky said as she sat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jaw dropped as she looked at her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis\u2026 this can\u2019t be real!!!

To top it all off Becky found a pair of leathery mare\u2019s teats, situated low on her abdomen, nearly between her legs. \u201cDear god\u2026 what do I do? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
