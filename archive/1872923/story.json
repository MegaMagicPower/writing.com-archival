However, you realize that today some of them may disappear from your life forever. It had been 0400 hours when you and your team had been awoken from your sleep for some special op code-named: Knifepoint. All of you had been rushed into your gear and got aboard the Lance of Daybreak, a new UNSC stealth ship made from Covenant technology. You now sit in the infantry bay, twiddling with your helmet while you wait for instruction. Your Captain comes in to give your team the mission instructions.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright Spartans, this is a mission of the utmost importance. Your mission is to board the nearby Covenant Capital Ship, make your way to the control room, and capture the ship. Once you make it to the control room you will deactivate the airlocks, eliminating all remaining Covenant forces on board. If any of your suits are breached or if the Covenant become aware of your plan before you deactivate the airlock you must resort to plan B and destroy the ship. Plant just a few of your charges in the ship's engine room and steal one of the Phantoms docked in the ship's hangars. If it comes to this, you will signal for evac as soon as the ship is destroyed.\" Your commanding officer says, \"If you can succeed on this mission, we shall be even closer to understanding Covenant technology. If we can begin replicating their scientific advances we will stand more of a chance in this war. Understood?\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sir, yes sir!\"</span></div></div>",

The Spartan 1 program used normal humans in suits of mechanical armor, this program was a failure on account of the regular marine's fragile bodies couldn't take the fast movements of the suits. Then, researcher Dr. Halsey came up with the Spartan 2 program. In this program children were kidnapped and replaced with clones. The children were then trained as soldiers from the time they were six years old. They were also put under heavy augmentations to make them stronger and faster. 65-75% of Spartans were killed in training. The Spartan 3s were kept secret from Dr. Halsey and were much cheaper than Spartan 2s. Spartan 3s were typically used as reconnaissance squads for dangerous operations. The Spartan 4 program never \"officially\" existed. There was another program made however. One that was kept so secret that few even know that it exists. They were the Spartan 5s and you are a member of this group. You were trained from the time you were six to be a stone cold killer and so you now shall go out and put the Covenant in their graves. <br>\r\nRule: No foul language</td>",
