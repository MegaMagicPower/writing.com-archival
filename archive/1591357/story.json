People were walking around as if the sky had always been purple.  Of course, to them it had.  None of them would have suspected that it was my doing.  I had simply willed it this way.  I liked the way it went with the blue leaves on the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before long I found that to be a bit boring, and decided to restore the world to its \"default\" setting.  Of course, when you have powers like mine, there is no real \"default\".  You see, I am an Entity.  At least, that's what I'll call myself for now.  I've been around since the beginning, with the universe as my sandbox.  I've been all over, but there are few inhabitants in this universe that are quite like humans.  They've developed quite an interesting society, with everyone having a unique role, or so they think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, playing with the sky and the trees is fun, but I decided to have a little fun with the people here.  Even though I exist in the ether, I decided it might be interesting if I took on one of their forms, for some direct interaction.  So, I started to form myself a body.  But what kind of person should I become?</span></div></div>",

I looked down with new eyes and saw a black t-shirt, loose fitting blue jeans, and a pair of sneakers.

I decided to add an element of chaos, a bit of random chance.  Things would be far more interesting if I let these mortals do my work for me.  So, with little more than a wink, a magical item of my own creation appeared on the sidewalk a few feet away.  It looked like a rather ordinary and somewhat cheap bracelet, but held immense power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever wore the bracelet would have an amazing power, but they might not realize it until it is too late.  While wearing the bracelet, any physical contact with another person will cause those two people to swap lives.  Only the person wearing the bracelet will notice the change, however.  The other person will act as though they have always been that person, wearing the other's clothes and filling their role completely.  Once swapped, the bracelet will have no effect for 24 hours, unless someone else wears it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just in case there were any good samaritans around who might just take the bracelet to a lost and found, I made it so that the bracelet would compel anybody who finds it to put it on.

She had just left the office, which sat on one end of the park, and was walking to her car which was parked at the other end.  It was not a long walk, but she cursed the fact that she couldn't find a closer spot.  Now she had to walk all the way through the park in her new heels which, though fashionable, were not the most comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice was what some might consider vain.  She cared greatly about her appearance, making sure her outfits were always coordinated and fashionable.  Today she was wearing a black pencil skirt with a yellow sleeveless blouse and a black blazer.  She looked professional, but still a bit sexy, and at 40 she had made it a priority to take care of herself.  Her makeup and shoulder length auburn hair were always impeccable, and she was in great shape.  She usually went to the gym after work, but today her plans had changed.  Her 18 year old son would be home from college today, staying for the weekend.  He was uncertain about his future, it seemed his grades had been slipping.  Janice worried that she hadn't instilled the same drive in her son that she herself possessed.  He was a bit of a slob, didn't care too much for his appearance.  She wondered for a moment if she had been too self involved to instill those values in Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought was suddenly broken when she nearly tripped over something.  Quickly regaining her balance and composure wasn't much of a challenge even in four inch heels, as she'd worn similar shoes most days of her professional career.  Quickly inspecting her Jimmy Choo's for scuff marks, she looked around for what she had tripped over.  There, in the middle of the sidewalk was a bracelet, plastic and rather cheap looking.  Janice bent down and picked it up.  It didn't look valuable, so she slipped it onto her wrist.  \"Odd,\" she thought, \"Not something I'd normally wear.  Doesn't look too bad though.\"  She paused a moment before she walked on.  She felt as though somebody was watching her.  She looked over to the park bench, but it was empty.  Shrugging off the feeling, Janice continued to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later Janice pulled into her driveway.  Her husband was a lawyer, and she made decent money at the insurance firm she worked at, so they were able to get a nice house in a nice neighborhood.  She opened the front door and nearly tripped again.  Right in the middle of the foyer was a large laundry bag, with a few socks and boxer shorts bulging from the opening.  Her son was home.  \"Well, I guess this weekend would be a good time to teach him some responsibilities,\" she said to herself.  There was no way she'd be caught doing his laundry again.  She walked into the living room, where she saw...</span></div></div>",

He heard the click of heels on the hardwood floor and sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom!\" he said as he sprang up from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan!\" Janice said.  She was excited to see her son, but she couldn't help but notice his disheveled appearance.  Grubby jeans, a ratty old t-shirt, and his hair was a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice hugged her son, and gave him a quick peck on the cheek.  But as soon as her lips touched his cheek, something odd happened.  Janice felt the world go dark for a moment, and not just her sight.  All of her senses seemed to shut off, for a fraction of a second, and then she was back.  \"That was odd,\" she thought.  Even odder, though, was the feeling of lips on her cheek.  Shouldn't it be the other way around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan broke the embrace and started talking,  \"It's good to have you home again.\"  What?  Home?  Again?  There was something odd about his face, that Janice hadn't noticed before.  Was that lipstick he was wearing?  Not to mention eyeshadow, mascara, and blush.  His face was made up.  Impeccably.  And his hair wasn't messy any more.  In fact, it was styled in a very feminine manner for such short hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter honey?\" Ryan said.  Honey?  That's not something sons usually call their mothers.  It's the other way around.  Then she noticed something else.  Ryan was wearing a yellow blouse.  HER yellow blouse.  And skirt, and blazer, and heels.  And they all seemed tailored to fit HIS body.  What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Ryan?\" Ryan said, \"You look sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm okay,\" Janice said.  Wait.. Ryan?  Why had her son called her by his own name?  She looked down and got yet another shock.  She was wearing his outfit: jeans, t-shirt, sneakers.  She felt her decent sized breasts hanging freely.  No bra.  Was he...?  Her thoughts were interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Ryan said, \"Because if you think I'm going to spend the whole weekend doing your laundry, you've got another thing coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... okay,\" Janice said.  This was really weird.  Her son was acting like her.  And treating her like him.  It was all so confusing.  \"This must be a dream,\" she thought.  Just then, her husband Robert entered the room.  Boy was she glad to see him, he'd help her make sense of this whole mess.  Words were forming on the tip of her tongue, to say the greeting she always gave her hubby when she got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, sweetie bear,\" she heard her son say in a sing-song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe,\" Robert said, not to Janice, but to Ryan.  Father and son locked lips for a moment, then the two turned to Janice, who looked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GOD!\" Janice said.  This was not right.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweetie, lighten up,\" Ryan said.  \"It's not like you've never seen us kiss before.\"  In fact, she hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, son,\" Robert said, \"What's wrong with a man showing his woman a little lovin'?\"  Robert put an arm around Ryan's waist and pulled him close, while Ryan patted his father's chest with a newly manicured hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was happening?  She had switched places with her son somehow, but she was the only one who noticed.  Her mind was racing.  Then she saw the bracelet, still on her own wrist.  That was the only thing that stayed with her.  The bracelet had done this?  Then there must be a way to fix it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how about we all go out to dinner tonight,\" Robert said.  \"I've got reservations for the three of us at Fanucci's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds lovely,\" Ryan said.  \"I can wear my new black dress.\"  He turned to Janice, \"That means you'd better get yourself cleaned up, too.  Fanucci's is no place for those grubby jeans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I...\"  Janice wanted to try to explain what was going on.  Maybe knock some sense into her mixed up family.  But they were totally clueless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts, young man.  By the time I'm ready to go, I'd better see you in some nice slacks and a buttoned shirt, and maybe even a tie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you should have all night son,\" Robert said, \"You know how long it takes your mother to get ready.\"  Ryan giggled.  It sounded just like Janice's laugh, but with a young man's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan turned and walked up the stairs, and Janice noticed how elegantly he moved in the heels, just as she had.  She also noticed that his legs were smooth and totally hairless.  How much stranger could things get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert gave Janice a hearty slap to the back.  \"Well son,\" he said, \"How's the college life?  Score with any hotties yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At fourteen, life was kind of rough for your anyway, as it is for any guy of that age--you know, being stuck between boyhood and manhood and all that good stuff.  School was especially tough for you.  You were never too popular, and those who were popular made fun of you for your awkward and reserved temperment...and being berated all the time by the popular kids just made you want to withdraw into yourself all the more.  You were also a bit of a chubby kid--not too bad, about 25 lbs overweight, but of course the popular kids jumped on that too as a way to make you feel like crap.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour home life was not a whole ton better.  Your mother Linda worked a lot, and she cared a lot about you, so she was always all over you to get your grades up, be active in school, and get some self-confidence and some direction.  The problem was the she just didn't understand how much ridicule you went through while you were in school and why that made it so hard for you to branch out.  Your father was a very distant man...you got along ok with him; he just wasn't one to show emotion or be easily impressed.  Trying to talk to him about school was like trying to talk to a brick wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hoping to forget about your problems for the weekend, as you and your Grandpa Joe were going to go fishing.  He was really the only person who would listen to you.  Your mom's father, he tried to explain your situation to her, and she just didn't get it.  Some time of relative solitude--just you, grandpa, and the fish--would do you some good.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the park just a few minutes from home, you look over among a pile of leaves and sticks to see something that glimmers a bit in the brown, shriveled-up autumn grass.  Walking over to get a better look, you see that it is a small, pretty plain, bracelet.  Normally, you'd have no interest whatsoever in wearing any kind of jewlery, but for some reason you felt compelled to bend down and pick it up.  You put it on as you walk the rest of the short distance to your house.  You enter the front door, glad to be out of the brisk fall air, at least until grandpa showed up to take you fishing.  \"Hello?\" you call out, interested to see who beat you home.  Who do you see first? </span></div></div>",

The air warped around me, and I found myself standing in the corridor of the local shopping mall.  People were all around, darting in and out of various stores, eating at the food court, or just loitering, like I was.  I soon spotted my first targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple in their twenties was walking in front of a storefront.  They were both attractive, the young man wearing jeans and a nice polo shirt, with fairly new looking sneakers.  The young woman was a knockout, and dressed very fashionably.  A black tank top displayed her generous breasts, and her pleated miniskirt showed off long, tanned legs perched atop 6-inch open toed pumps.  Her fingernails and toenails were adorned with glossy red polish, and her makeup and long blonde hair were perfect.  It looked as though she was having the time of her life, though her boyfriend wasn't as happy.  He seemed to tolerate being dragged around by such a knockout, but only to an extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you bought enough, Tiffany?\" he said to her as he adjusted the shopping bags he'd been coerced into carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding, Jake?\" she chirped, \"I haven't even, like, begun to look at shoes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned at their exchange.  Then I snapped my fingers, which caused another exchange.  The young man was now wearing his girlfriends clothes, while she was wearing his jeans and t-shirt.  The man had impeccable makeup, a flawless tan, and a perfect manicure and pedicure just as his girlfriend had less than a second before.  The girl on the other hand looked quite plain, although her D-cup breasts stretched the male polo shirt to its limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmigod!\" Jake squealed.  He minced over to the shoe store, not missing a step even though he was now towering at 6'5\" in high heels.  He looked at the designer sandals on display and gushed.  \"I have just <i>got</i> to have those!\"  Tiffany rolled her eyes as Jake handed off the shopping bags to her and took what was now his purse from her.  He slung it over his shoulder without a second thought and swayed his hips as he entered the store, Tiffany slowly trudging behind.  I watched for a moment as Jake frantically searched the aisles for shoes that would fit his big male feet, then pondered my next move.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps I should make things a bit more interesting for someone else.  I spotted a group of three males walking down the corridor.  They were from the local college, and it looked like they were prowling for cute girls.  They were acting kind of ridiculous, shoving each other and making loud noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChet Richards looked to be the leader of the pack.  He was the president of their fraternity.  He had short brown hair and a muscular physique, which he used to his advantage at many frat parties.  At his side were Derek and Rick Matthews, twin brothers who had pledged together and now were Chet's right hand men.  They were thinner, and had short blond hair.  Chet was giving leering glances at the attractive girls that walked by, as if he was somehow entitled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the corridor I spotted a family of four.  They were the Johnsons.  Father Ed was in his late thirties, and still had a full head of light brown hair.  His wife Vanessa, also in her late thirties, was as beautiful as she'd been ten years earlier, with wavy blond hair to her shoulders.  Her blue strapless sundress showed off her stunning body.  Their twin 18 year old daughters were behind them.  Chrissy's blond hair was styled much like her mothers, and she wore a green and white striped tube top with tight jeans and silver pumps.  Her sister Missy was just as stylish, with straight blond hair down to the middle of her back, with a short denim skirt and lacy yellow camisole top with yellow flip flops.  They looked intently at the shop windows, searching for fashions to wear as they began college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at these two very different yet similar groups, and with the blink of an eye, things were swapped.  Ed Johnson was unchanged, but now instead of his wife holding his hand, it was Chet Richards, who was now wearing Vanessa's sundress and wedge heels, which made him tower over the man he now thought of as \"her\" husband.  Derek and Rick were now more interested in what the girls walking by were wearing rather than what was underneath.  Derek adjusted his tube top and turned to Rick, \"Did you, like, see the jeans on that woman, Missy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, totally, Chrissy.  That look is <i>so</i> last season.  I can't believe she'd go out in public looking like that.\"  As the two brothers chatted like sisters, I looked over at the trio of women who now were giving catcalls and shouting obscenities.  If I had a sense of humor, I probably would have laughed.  Instead, I just considered what I would do next.</span></div></div>",

Near one of the cashier is an old man, probably in his early 70s, fighting with the poor sales clerk about who- knew-what. The cashier was a fidgety little thing, maybe 5 feet tall at best; she looked scared and probably had no clue about what to do next.<br>\r\nSitting in what appeared to be some kind of waiting area sat Henry, Clark, Geoff and Tim, all different, yet with one glaring thing in common, they were all waiting on a woman, either their wife or daughter. Having found my first targets from this store I switch them around, blinking as the transformations flash around.<br>\r\nOver by the door, Mr. Klink looks far from menacing as his muscles and height are now those of the minute sales clerk.  Looking over at the clerk you see that she is the one screaming at the old man since she not only has Klink\u2019s muscles and height, but the old man\u2019s terrible temper as well. She looks rather strange as her store uniform strains to contain her new dimension, which are more a kin to a professional body builder than anything else.<br>\r\nIn the small waiting area now sit Henry, Clark, Geoff and Tim, but, unlike before, they are now in the bodies of the teenage girls. Conversely, the girls have very manly bodies now, but as a token from me, they all have their original genitalia.<br>\r\nNow where should I go?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What caught my attention was how opposite the two of them were, apart from being Caucasian females in relatively good physical health they shared little else. One was looking through the more conservative items, while the other searched through the less covering items. I decided to make a small case study out of one of them and in order to better understand these creatures I decided to read their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe woman looking through the conservative lingerie was Agatha Parksley, age 41, recently divorced and monetarily well-of. She considered herself a proper lady and lived by a very strict set of rules of conduct. She always wore elegant and conservative clothes, never showing much skin bellow the neck.  That day she had picked a pink knee length dress, tan stocking, low-heel pink pumps and a white jacket. She was a tall woman, almost 6 feet tall without heels, with well-cared blonde hair, classical facial features and pert B-cup breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOn the opposite end of the spectrum was Katherine Clark, age 24, never married but very sexually active and between jobs at the moment. She thought of herself as sexually liberated and relished every opportunity to put her body on display. She was a bit of a goth/punk, wearing at the moment a tight leader bustier, knee length pvc pencil skirt, 4 \u00bd inch black pumps, fishnet stockings and fishnet gloves. She was about 5\u201d6\u2019 tall, with auburn wavy hair, a girl-next-door kind of face and soft C-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter looking through their minds I decided to start my study by switching their clothes. Now Agatha and Katherine were dressed in clothes that opposed their personal views, but they noticed nothing amiss.  Looking them over I wondered what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Following her in my corporeal form would be somewhat taxing so I changed into my incorporeal form. She continued to browse the store, completely unaware of the radical change to her attire. Mean while I read her thoughts, most were rather inconsequential, things about monetary gain and political contrivances, nothing that really interested me. However, I noticed that she had very specific thought about the people she saw around, mostly judgments on their appearance, mannerisms and things of the sort.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tThat caught my attention, as far as I could tell almost all humans were based on the same archetype, two eyes, two ear, two legs, two arms, one head, one nose, etc. I saw minor differences in skin pigmentations and physical proportions, but she saw much more than that.  Although I had gleaned a lot from my recent subjects, I was still far from noticing the nuances Agatha saw. She judged people \u2013more often than not, people she didn\u2019t know- based on minute differences and I wanted to learn about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile in the shoe section \u2013an area of the store she seemed to specially drawn to for some reason- she saw another woman and I could feel her jealousy and disdain from the moment she saw her. The other woman didn\u2019t appear especially different from Agatha to me, but Agatha was somehow offended by the remarkable contrast between the woman\u2019s exceptionally large breasts and her own average pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a harlot, those things cannot be real! What kind of woman would implant such monstrosities into her body?\u201d Agatha though, unaware that I heard her every thought. With less than a moment\u2019s thought I transferred those implants onto Agatha\u2019s breasts. Now it was Agatha who possessed the large saline-solution implants within her, giving her a set of EE-cup breasts. When she looked at the *donor* now she thought \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she continued to walk around I notices a very slight change to her walk \u2013very few humans would notice such a change \u2013 but each step accentuated her secondary sexual attributes more than they did before the latest alteration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was soon drawn toward an area that displayed many items made of finely shaped metal and crystalline structures \u2013what she called \u2018the jewelry department. While she was trying on some of the items on display a young woman in her early 20s approached the display Agatha was inspecting. The teenage girl \u2013named Clare - was dressed in punk clothing, with several metallic piercings attached to her and pictorial designs inked on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Her parents must have been a disgrace to allow that girl to tarnish her body with those horrid piercing and God-awful tattoos,\u2019 thought Agatha with disdain as she inspected Clare\u2019s body from the corner of her eye. Curious once more about Agatha\u2019s thought processes I passed all of Clare\u2019s piercings and tattoos onto Agatha. <br>\r\nLess than a moment later is was Agatha who sported several tattoos on her face, neck, bosom and legs and many piercing hanging from her ears, through her eyebrows, lips, tongue, nose and belly button. Agatha now thought of tattoos and piercings as a source of pride; a way of letting people know who she is by just looking at her. Little by little I was changing her mental aspects by altering her physical characteristics. That is very interesting to me since \u2013as an Entity \u2013 I change my physical characteristics through my mind; humans, on the other hand, seem to be much more attached to the corporeal world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving lost her interest in the jewelry she had been inspecting, Agatha started to walk away, but before she could walk very far _______ tapped her on the shoulder.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Agatha and Clare arrived at their destination without incident and Agatha guided Clare in as though she had frequented the store many times before, but only I knew this to be untrue. Agatha then spoke with the man who ran the store and told him that she wanted to get some work done on her and on her companion as well. The man told them that they had to wait some time until the next chair was open, so they started to browse the designs posted on the wall while they waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the stores small waiting area was a woman whose thoughts caught my attention. The original Agatha would have called her *truly perverted* and the woman \u2013named Amber \u2013 thought of herself as a sexual fetishist. She not only attracted to both males and females, but humans who where transitioning between the two genders as well. She had a special attraction to clothing made out of materials such as PVC, latex and leather. She enjoyed being something she called a dominatrix and a submissive, apparently switching between the two depending on whom she was with and her mood. She derived much pleasure from her plethora of tattoos and piercings \u2013which covered most of her body \u2013 and had a vast sexual appetite and expertise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to swap all of those characteristics over to Agatha -this being the first solely mental change \u2013 I found this to be a most interesting venue of investigation. The changes to Agatha became apparent in an instant, each movement she made was overtly sexually charged, and lacking all the primness she had carried before. She walked over to the man she had spoken to before and told him that she wanted a tattoo of a couple performing a \u201csixty-nine\u201d inked across her midriff, large gold hoops pierced through the tips of her areolas and a set of rings through her labia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having changed her so much the way she spoke seemed to be out of step with her reality so I decide to change her speech patterns with those of the man who had been getting tattooed when we arrived, making her sound much less educated and refined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, an give wot eva ma friend \u2018ere wonts, I\u2019ll pay fer her shit too,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Madam, \u201csaid the man, now sounding as refined as Agatha had only moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go firs\u2019 Cler, so you can see there ain\u2019t nuttin ta worry \u2018bout ,\u201d Agatha told Clare as she walked towards the back of the store with the girl in tow. Without an ounce of shame Agatha undressed in front of the man who would be working on her and Clare. Being more than a little disinclined to wait for the long tattooing process to take its course I temporarily gave the man the ability to do his work much faster than humanly possible \u2013while making sure no one noticed anything amiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he worked Agatha seemed to go into heat, her genitalia started to release copious amounts of a lubricating substance and she started to moan loudly. Agatha\u2019s excitement was not lost on the man as his pants were soon stretched by a growing phallus. Clare was also affected by the sight, her nether regions becoming damn as well very quickly. When the rings were finally been put into place Agatha screamed like a feral animal, her body glistening with sweat and her mind seemed to be caught between pain an pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched intently as the additions to Agatha\u2019s body were finished and she slowly got back on her feet. In a fluid motion \u2013and still undresses \u2013 she sat on the man\u2019s lap and kissed him forcefully on the mouth. A minute later Clare tapped her on the shoulder to get her attention, \u201cSorry but\u2026\u201d she said to Agatha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry, a got carried away fer a secon\u2019,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, but now I REALLY want my stuff done,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare then asked for a tattoo on the small of her back and a couple of piercings on her belly button and nose. After they were done Agatha offered to take Clare shopping and Clare happily agreed to the offer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon after I transferred the tattoos and piercings from her new companion Clare onto her. The two struck up a quick association, in stark contrast to what Agatha would have originally done. The pair went to Agatha\u2019s favorite location to get ink and piercings on her body \u2013 a location that was originally Clare\u2019s favorite and of no interest to Agatha. At the tattoo place I gave Agatha the sexual tendencies, desires and fetishes of a self-proclaimed dominatrix. Lastly I gave a very low-brow accent from one of the people at the tattoo place to better align with her current appearance and contrast her original attributes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, at a new shopping center the possibilities had expanded once again.

I teleported myself to the campus of the nearby state university, chose a direction in which to walk, and entered the lobby of the first dorm I came to, a boxy brick structure that was quite obviously a government-designed building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female student sitting at the front desk, apparently there to check in visitors to the dorm, didn't respond to my presence as I walked by; she was too busy flipping through a magazine.  Even though I can easily change reality to account for being in a certain place -- in this case, I could have merely conjured up a student ID for myself -- I like it when I don't get disturbed in my \"missions.\"  I turned around and rewarded her by eliminating her acne and giving her 20/20 vision, watching as the glasses and the makeup-covered splotches disappeared from her face.  I'm not completely altruistic, though, so I increased the size of her chest, giving her an attention-getting pair of breasts the size of volleyballs, also altering her wardrobe so that she'd always be showing them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left her wearing a black corset-style top that was definitely going to cause every guy who entered the lobby -- and many of the girls -- to stare while going by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited for the elevator to go upstairs.  When it arrived, a girl with a full laundry basket was already inside; I figured out there were laundry facilities in the basement.  As we rode up, I took the opportunity to make another wardrobe change, eliminating this girl's pants and long skirts -- from now on, she'd only wear shorts or skirts no longer than mid-thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got off the elevator behind her on the 3rd floor and did a bit of reconnaissance.  The dorm was divided into suites consisting of several rooms around a lounge area, a bathroom, and a small kitchen.  Each floor was co-ed, but each individual suite was same-sex.  I decided to start by picking one suite and making changes to its residents.</span></div></div>",

He now cared nothing for baseball, or any other sports for that matter.  This was now one of his favorite shows, along with most of the other shows on MTV, E, or the Style Network.  Of course, I had to change his tastes elsewhere.  I scratched my nose, and Mike was now wearing black leggings and a pink tank top.  His closet was now filled with stylish dresses, skirts, blouses, and other feminine attire, his dresser expanded slightly to hold the multitude of bras, panties, tight jeans, and many of the other things I had seen the attractive girls wearing around this campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his head, Mike was just like one of those girls, wearing trendy clothes and teasing the guys on campus.  He loved to party, but also took the time to study.  Though, instead of majoring in Sports Medicine, he was now studying Public Relations.  His face was lightly adorned with makeup, some mascara, and a bit of lip gloss.  After a second, he got up and went to his room (now tastefully decorated in bright, feminine colors) and returned with a bottle of bright pink nail polish.  He sat on the couch, this time tucking his feet up under himself, and began applying the glossy polish to his fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmiring my handiwork, I began to ponder what to do next.</span></div></div>",

You're not coming out, are you?  'Cause if you are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing like that,\" I interrupted.  Humans could be so dense sometimes.  \"I have a... unique ability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can alter reality in any way I want, just with a thought.  I can change anything about the universe, from the tiniest detail to the very laws of physics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked at me for a moment, then started laughing.  \"Wow, that's pretty good.  I've known you since high school and you still get me with that weird stuff sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you think,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind.  I'll demonstrate for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if on cue, Brian (another of Mike's roommates) entered the room.  Mike was still chuckling a bit, and he looked up at Brian.  \"Hey Brian, John here seems to think he's a god or something.  Says he can 'change the fabric of reality' or some shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a thought, and in less time than it took for Mike's words to hit Brian's ears, the change was already over.  Brian had been completely transformed from head to toe into a sexy lingerie model, wearing nothing but a bra, panties, stockings, and stiletto heels.  The new Brian giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so silly.  You boys come up with, like, the strangest ideas sometimes.\"  She turned and strutted into Brian's bedroom, walking as though she were a model on a catwalk, as though she were born in high heels, and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, dude!\" Mike said once he regained his composure.  \"What the hell did you do to Brian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to him and the rest of the world, I didn't do anything.  For anyone but us, Brian has always looked like that, and always goes around wearing skimpy lingerie.  You should see what she wears to parties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but...\"  Mike was clearly confused.  I tempered his confusion a bit, sometimes drastic changes can test a persons sanity.  Luckily I had total control over that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Mike, I can change him back if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike thought for a moment. </span></div></div>",

Across the room, the new Brian suddenly turned back to normal. \"Hey guys\" Brian said as he crossed the room to the kitchen. He showed no sign of knowing what just happened. He grabbed a soda from the fridge, and headed for his room. \"I'll talk to you guys later, I have some homework to catch up on.\" With that, he disappeared into his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how?\" Mike tried to say. He was completely astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, \"Like I said, I have the power to control reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...I believe you. But why show your power to me now? We've known each other for awhile, why now?\" Mike looked more calm now. I was surprised. He seemed to be accepting my power pretty easily. That might make what I am about to do all the more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually, we have only just met. I altered reality just a few minutes ago to give everyone who lived here memories of me. And about telling you, well...I am...I guess you would call it lonely and board. I have all this power, but I have no one else to enjoy it with. Sure I could revile my power to the world, and rule it. In fact I have done that on a few occasions, but what I really want is someone who would enjoy the messing of reality as much as me. You Mike, are the lucky person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Out of everyone in the world you picked me...\" Brian gave me a hard stare. He seemed to be waiting for me to yell Surprise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, You are the perfect person to be my equal. Over the past 100 years or so, I have been looking for someone like you.\" I smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Equal? What do you mean?\" Mike rose an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I will be giving half of my powers to you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really...\" Mike asked, and I nodded. \"Wow...I am going to have powers like you...wow. But wait, before you do that, I have a question. I thought that you were like...all powerful. Why can't you just duplicate your powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed, \"I am not all powerful. Even I have limits, and this is one of them. I can only give up my powers, or a portion of them. So, enough small talk...Are you ready to join me as an elite being?\" Mike nodded excitedly. \"Great! I can already tell that you are going to make these so much more fun.\" I then snapped my fingers.</span></div></div>",
