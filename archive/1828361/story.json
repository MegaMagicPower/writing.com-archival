Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, even Snack Time; All of Francine's eating habits revolved around the new Chinese restaurant and while her family was too busy with their own schemes or problems she was free to indulge herself as she pleased. Like the rest of her family, Francine was unaware to her newfound girth that seemed to expand day after day. It wasn't until one evening when Francine becomes wedged in the doorway of her bathroom that she realized what affects Ling's food had on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled by her sudden realization, Francine looks down at her body, grabbing a huge chunk of belly fat with both hands. Her once tight and slim body had turned into a walking pile of pillowy fat. After strapping most of her clothes off leaving her underwear on, Francine looks into a full body mirror and discovers the extent of the damage. Her C-cups turned Es rested on her wide flabby stomach that leaded down to her extremely meaty thighs and ass. A little hesitant, Francine heads towards the bathroom scale, noticing the wobble in her walk. Stepping off, Francine looks down at the scale and reads '<b>387 pounds</b>' on the small screen. Francine in a panic, wondering what she should do until the growling of her stomach overtakes her with hungry, making her forget about her weight problems and go to Sumo Ling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknown to herself, this was not the first time Francine had notice her weight gain, it was the third. The first time was when her enlarged breast snapped her bra in two, the second time happen her barreled thighs ripped the side of her dress open; and now just like before, Francine would forget about these disturbances when she became hungry and continue stuffing herself at Sumo Ling. Her current weight was too obvious for her to go unnoticed for long, she would soon learn that she isn't the only one growing. Francine heads to Sumo Ling for her third after lunch snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine steps onto the Sumo Ling parking lot after struggling to remove herself from the car. As Francine wobbles towards the restaurant two women much larger than her exit the building. Francine stares as two women, they seemed familiar to her. Curiosity and hungry were fighting over Francine's next actions, should she go into the restaurant or encounter the two behemoth women?       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                  </span></div></div>",

A blonde, attractive housewife wandered the fair, looking for something, <i>anything</i>, to kill time.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad I was able to find the time to come here. When you\u2019re not losing a pie-making contest every year, this is actually pretty fun.\u201d Francine said.<br>\r\nHer search came to a long awaited end when she saw a rather interesting sight: a huge stand with a huge banner hanging from the top saying hotdog eating competition.<br>\r\n\u201cThis looks interesting to watch.\u201d<br>\r\nAs she entered the crowd, though, her chipper mood soon soured upon glancing at another woman. This woman immediately turned around and when she glanced back at Francine, she too developed a very sour look upon her face.<br>\r\n\u201cFrancine Smith.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n\u201cHiko Yoshida. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re here to watch the contest.\u201d Francine said back.<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I\u2019m entering the contest. Surely you aren\u2019t entering. Then again, you could afford to lose a few pounds.\u201d<br>\r\nFrancine was beyond pissed at this remark. It would somewhat ruin her figure, but she had only one option.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m entering this contest and I\u2019m going to kick your ass!\u201d Francine shot back as she signed her name on the sign-up board.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find out who kicks whose ass in five minutes.\u201d Hiko said.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy five minutes?\u201d Francine asked.<br>\r\n\u201cThe contest starts in five minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Francine said.<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAttention contestants, the Langley Falls Annual Hotdog Eating contest well begin soon. Please report to the stand.\u201d</i> The Announcer said.<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, shall we go?\u201d Hiko said with faux politeness.<br>\r\n\u201cAfter you.\u201d Francine replied with a similar tone.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of preparation, the hotdogs were dressed with ketchup, mustard, relish, &amp; sauerkraut and pushed onto the stand. There were 164 hotdogs on each plate. Each one looked as if they were full-length bratwursts. A grave sense of intimidation quickly filled Francine.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, God. Look at these.\u201d She said shocked.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Franny? Are you afraid of a few little hotdogs?\u201d Hiko taunted.<br>\r\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t a few little hotdogs. They look like they\u2019re on steroids and there are enough here to feed my family for a month!\u201d Francine said.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I hope your poor stomach can take it.\u201d<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAttention, contestants. The Langley Falls Annual Hotdog Eating Contest begins in 5\u2026 4\u2026 3\u2026 2\u2026 1\u2026 start!\u201d</i> The Announcer said.<br>\r\nAnd with that, the contestants began to gorge themselves on the numerous, enormous frankfurters. However, none were going at it as fast as Francine and Hiko. These two women, determined to defeat the other, were putting it down at speeds that would put some competitive eaters to shame. However, like a cheetah chasing after its prey, one of them would soon begin to lose steam and it just so happens to be\u2026</span></div></div>",

They would say something like \u2018Second Place is just first place for losers\u2019.\u201d Francine dumped the trophy into the trash and sulked on the nearby bench.

She quickly turned her attention to the mutton stand where the line had just emptied, \u201cGive me two oversized turkey legs!\u201d She hollered to the stand clerk with a little too much enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like that with or without the deadly amount of MSG.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So I need to to eat there everyday. I would be willing to cover your meals, and we could spend some time together while it happens.

The free food would also be a decent incentive for her to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine didn't even think about it for a moment and said yes right away. She was always looking for reasons to spend time with Haley. She loved her daughter and missed when she was younger and they spent more time together.

Still used to walking into the fast food chain the short trek back to her car was becoming more and more strenuous on the house wife. Breakfast lunch and dinner for the entire month had been nothing but greasy fast food and the effects where starting to show. Francine's already large breast had taken a large brunt of the weight. Previously at around a D cup had increased to an F cup giving her miles of cleavage in her too tight dress. Her ass also too a good amount of damage. Already giving birth to 2 children her already mother barring hips raked on loads of cellulite, Her hips going outward and her ass pushing out back. Her Franny Fanny was slowly turning into a Fatty Fanny. Her stomach didn't take too much of the gain. You could see it press up again her dress it was slowly going down towards her panties. As she walked to the car she could feel the breeze barely touch the bottom of her ass. She groaned as this meant it was time for her to accept her weight and go shopping for new clothes. Her dress not enough to contain her new weight, she could feel her panties digging more and more into her butt giving her constant wedgies. And having to go braless everywhere was starting to get rather troublesome when a lot of stores had the AC on full blast. She got into the car and closed the door her hips getting hit slightly. She passed some of the bags to her backseat passenger. Haley. Another month of Constant eating and Haley had not stopped packing on the weight. Multiple meals a day and her mother being a delivery service for her meant she had less work to do. this left her at a massive 400 pounds of pure lard and laziness. Her ass took up most of the weight. Leaving her to have to sit in the back seat, her legs spread out all the way to give her room for her second biggest feature, her stomach. 2 rolls of fat made up Haley's stomach. No shirt was able to contain it. The few times she did go out she would wear a shirt that would basically be her bra so she could could look somewhat decent in public. She grabbed and the food and began to just eat everything without saying a word. With her mom now helping her she had grown more lazy and slobbish. Having her mom do most things for her. She even had to ask her mother to help her reach certain areas when she did decide to clean herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haley maybe you should slow down a bit. You have gotten a lot larger in a short amount of time\" Francine said while eating her own food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...Much.....Need.....Much.....To.....Show.......Chew......That......M uch.....The.....Much.....Food......Huff......Is......Unhealthy...Shallow:\" Haley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine sighed and started the drive home eating her food. She was worried about her daughter and her changes. Her laziness meant she barely left her room expect to use the restroom. When she did she would walk around the house naked. Her stomach covering her more personal areas but her breasts now just blobs of fat that rested on her stomach just where let free to breathe. This made Steve run of the room screaming in fear each time it occurred. Washing and getting her up was becoming harder, not just because of her increasing size but because of her own. With Stan on a mission for a year he wouldn't be able to help and she knew Steve would be too afraid. She sighed. Well at least the food is good, she thought too herself. </span></div></div>",

She demolished burger after burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished the first 50 with ease and started on the second lot but at a slower pace. About half way through the second she stopped to undo her trousers to let her huge gut roll out. \" ahhhhh. That's better.\" hayley said rubbing her belly. Hayley's pants and trouser were now feeling really tight and her t-shirt was splitting at the seams. After resting for a couple of minutes rest she went straight back to were she left off. After finishing the rest of the second plate she started she shoveled the rest of the burgers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 15 minutes the last few burgers sat on the plate in front of hayley. Just then the cashier who served hayley came up. \"excuse me miss smith.\" she said.\"my manager said that if you eat another 50 burger he will give free burgers for life and pay for servants to stuff you and make the burgers you eat extremely fattening guaranteed to add five pounds to every burger you eat.\" <br>\r\nHayley was in utter shock. She couldn't believe what she was hearing. \"YES! YES! A THOUSAND TIMES YES.\" hayley shouted. The cashier reported to the manager with the good news and brought hayley the new type of burger she would now be served. But instead of bring 50 the cashier brought 100. \"that'll add 500 pounds to my body. It'll put me near the 1000 pound mark.\" hayley said dreamily. \"the managers also said that he will make a room for you attached on to the back of the restaurant if you agree to live there.\" the cashier told her. \"who would say no to that.\" hayley replied before digging into the fattening burgers.the cashier then again went to tell the manager the good news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley was about a third through her burgers the restaurant began to empty. She had gained 50 pounds from the first 150 burgers and had gained 166 pounds from the new burgers and it started to show.she now had a third chin and huge belly. Her ass covered half the seat that was built to hold three to four people. Her boobs were now a size EE. She now weighed 566 pounds. As she continued to devour the burgers her body continued to expand. He belly and boobs burst out of her t-shirt ripping it to shreds. Her ass and thighs soon followed her upper body as they went ripping through her trousers . As she finished the burgers her belly was being divided in two by the table. Hayley was now red in the face, wheezing and stuffed to her limit as she swallowed the last burger. \"That's it.\" hayley moaned. \"I can't eat anymore.\" As she tried to move her body out she realized two major issues. One she was stuck and two she might not be able to walk with her new weight. \"buuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrp\" hayley went. Just the cashier came back. \"ahhhhh miss smith looks like you enjoyed that meal. Would you like us to unscrew the table so you get out so we can escourt you to a taxi waiting to take you home.\" the cashier said. Hayley was taken back about how far ahead the restaurant planned. Like they almost wanted this to happen. \"y..y..yes please.\" hayley stuttered. As soon as she said that a tall muscular guy walked in with a drill to unscrew the table. The vibration caused hayley's belly to wobble like crazy although she did have to admit it felt nice. As the table was removed her belly flopped scrapping the floor. \"ready to go.\" said the cashier rubbing hayley's belly. \"yep.\" said hayley \"let's go and may I ask where is everyone?\" \"we closed the restaurant to give you some privacy.\" the cashier said as hayley was helped up and walked to the door. \"oh and your room will be ready in one month so keep fattening up as that will help a lot.\" \"sure will.\" said hayley giving her belly a smack causing it ti ripple. As hayley was helped into the taxi/van she waved the cashier goodbye and was driven home. There was a scale built in the van just for hayley to see how much see weighed. \"1010 pounds.\" hayley said excitedly. \"I really am a 'fat' girl now. I must be the fattest person alive. I wonder how much fatter I'll get when I move into Mcburgertown.\" hayley questioned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stan had got several large tubs a special weight gain formula from the C.I.A for her and (against his will) supported her weight gain (and to also get her out the house). Hayley ordered at least 20 pizzas everyday to stuff her gut with. Mcburgertown had agreed to pay for all the food she ordered so she could get even fatter. She drink about 10 gallons of the weight gain drink and about ate about 50 pounds worth of food every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day of her new room completion had arrived and hayley was gorging her self more than ever. An hour before she had to go francine walked in to clean hayley up. Francine had been piling on the pound as she now weighed close to 450 pounds. \"you know the house is gonna so empty when your gone.\" said francine huffing and puffing whilst she was waddling around hayley. \"there'll be more space too.\" hayley replied. \"then I'll just have to fill it up.\" francine said patting her big belly. Hayley laughed. After she finished laughing francine threw herself into hayley's huge belly and said \"oh hayley. I remember a couple months ago I could hug you all the way around but now you just a big pile of beautiful fat.\" \"thanks mom.\" hayley said \"but why are you walking around in just your bra?\" \"well my belly hangs low enough, which means I only have to cover my boobs and none of my clothes fit me anymore and beside. Being fat with no clothes on is better.\" francine said picking up her belly and dropping it making smack against get thighs. Francine then picked up a big jug and filled it to the brim with the shake and started to chug it down. \"whoah you weren't kidding when you said you were gonna take up the space.\" \"no...I...wasn't.\" francine said struggling for breath. She said down on the chair near hayley but the chair broke under her weight. They both laughed causing both there bodies to jiggle then francine continued to down the shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door and francine struggled to her feet and answered the door. \"hello you must be here for hayley.\" francine said  \"yes I'm Mrs Smith.\" the man replied. \"hayley your going.\" francine yelled. It took a good 3 hours to get hayley down to Mcburgertown. When she arrived the cashier greeted her and took her round back where she first weight hayley and she weighed 3317 pounds. That's means she gained 757 pounds form the shakes and 1550 pounds from the food due ate. Hayley had tears of joy in her eyes \"oh wow.\" was all that could escape her fat lips. Her enjoyment was shirt lived as she saw a room with to big double doors that were no more than 6 feet by 6 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley said....</span></div></div>",

It barely a foot long on only six feet wide.\" hayley snapped. \" just come this way.\" the cashier said waving her wand signaling the man who picked hayley up pushed her closer to the door. Francine had tagged along so she followed along with them. \"NO YOU'LL SQUISH ME.\" hayley screamed but this did nothing. The man continued to push hayley in. She closed her eyes hoping the pain wouldn't last long. After a couple of minutes the cashier said \" Miss smith you can open your eyes now.\" <br>\r\nHayley opened her eyes and saw an what seem endless where room. \"where am I?\" hayley questioned \"in your room.\" the cashier answered \"but how is it so small on the outside and bigger and the inside.\" hayley asked \"secret C.I.A technology miss smith. The inside of this room is the size of Europe, North and south America and Africa combined so you can get as fat as you want.\" the cashier explained. Hayley couldn't wait to get started. \"great let's get started.\" hayley said with excitement. \"but first could I invite other people to get fattened with me?\" \"well not really but I guess we could allow one more person.\" the cashier said. Hayley looked over at francine and asked \" well mom would you like to stay her and get fattened like me?\" \"hayley I would love to get fattened here.\" francine said whilst hugging hayley's belly. Hayley was taken of the flatbed that she was being pushed around in and placed on the soft floor in front of an humongus 1000 inch TV and francine was placed about 50 meters away from hayley, still in front of the huge tv. \"we're gonna get huge.\" francine said patting her stomach. A special head band was put on both of there heads as it controlled every thing that happened to them (controlling there food intake, changing the channel, etc) and a microphone was attached to it so they could still talk to each other. Francine's bra was also removed so there was no restrictions allowing her huge GGG boobs hang down by her sides.\"you can start any time now.\" the cashier said whilst leaving. Francine made a hose come down into her mouth and started to drink the weight gain shake that came through it. Hayley ordered for the TV to be turned on to watch modern family and two robot arms to stuff her full of the fattening burgers. Both girls were in heaven.</span></div></div>",

It was very noticeable that she had gained weight. She had lost her mobility. Her belly stuck out about 5 feeling front of her and her ass stuck out by about 3 feet behind her. She was ready to be moved on to the scales but no one could even push her now. Luckily the room had a built in crane installed that could lift them. Francine was lifted up by a about a meter off the ground and then placed on the scales. \"let it be a big number please.\" francine begged to her self. She remembered weighing around the 450 mark a month ago but she had been gorging non stop this month so she had of gone up a couple of hundred pounds.The number read '5938' \" that can't be true.\" said francine shocked. \"oh it's true Mrs Smith those burgers you ate add 5 pounds for every one you eat. And the shake you drink is very high in calories.\" \"that mean then I gained 5488 pounds. Imagine how fat I would be at the end of this year.\" \"go ahead Mrs Smith turns out I was told wrong. Thus model of room is infinite so you can be the size of the universe and still have to to grow.\" the cashier said encouragingly. It was hayley's turn now and she too was noticeably fatter but most of it had gone to her ass as it stuck out by 5 feet. The same as her belly. She ws lifted on to the scales and it flashed '6174'. \"That's it?\" hayley said disappointed.\"but I've been eating way more than her.\" \"That's not true miss smith as Mrs Smith had eaten two time more burgers than you and you've only drank 44 gallons of the shake whilst Mrs Smith has drank 75 gallons.\" \"ha beat that hayley.\" francine said whilst ordering the room to lower the hose down to her mouth \"wait.\" the cashier shouted as hayley was put back where she was. \"you both need to takes this pill. It stops the aging process and eliminates all health risk of being obese and it also make you immortal. It will be like your 120 pounds again but with no mobility. As well as that it makes your skin super elastic so no matter how tight you skin is it will keep exanding\" both girls ordered the room to pick up a pill each and they swallowed it as the cashier left. The pill took instant effect as the girls were no longer breathing heavily. Francine took full efect of the pill and moved the hose into her mouth and made the shake could me 10 times faster that it normally did \"mmmmmmm.\" francine was the only sound francine could make as the felt the pleasure that was running through her.after a couple minutes francine was full but she wanted to see how big she could expand so she kept going. After a minute francine could feel her self expanding. Francine was still moaning loudly and this caught hayley's attention. Stop eating the burgers and watched francine expanding bigger by the second. She had gotten a meter wider within 30 seconds but francine wasn't gonna stop there. She wansnt gonna stop until she was bigger than hayley. She then made the shake come 100 times faster and she was expanding at an even faster rate. Within 30 seconds she was a foot wider in directions and getting bigger.\"mum slow down. Your gonna hurt you self.\" hayley said but francine took no notice. After an hour her her belly had grown 60 feet whilst her ass had done the same. Francine's ne took the hose out and let out a huge burp. \" buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrp. Ahhhhh that's better.\" francine said patting what she assumed what was her belly. She could only move her wrist up and down so it wasn't a big pat. She could feel how tight and taunt her skin was, it want soft and jiggle like it was before \"wow mom your huge.\" hayley finally said. Just then the cashier walked in and said \"well done Mrs Smith you've emptied the entire 1000 gallon tank in an hour and look at your 12 times bigger than hayley.\" \"wait. How do you know that?\" francine questioned \"we have cameras all over this room incase anything happened to you  two and they have special lasers installed and they measured how big you are and it said you belly is 60 foot long and 20 feet wide and your ass is 60 feet long and 25 feet wide.\" the cashier explained. \"and now we are going to see how much you weigh now Mrs Smith.\" \"oh please call me franny.\" francine said as she was lifted on to the scales \"ok franny you previously weighed 5938 pounds and you now weigh.\" the cashier said. Scales flashed up 35938. \"35938!.\" the cashier announced. Hayley's mouth just dropped as she heard how much her mom weighed. Francine had tears of joy in her eyes as she was moved back where she was. \"I can't believe it.\" she said \"I'm a huge blob of blubbery beautiful fat.\" she said ordering the room to lift her belly up and drop it, causing a slight earthquake making hers and hayley's belly to wobble for several seconds. Francine's wobbled for nearly a whole minute. She then ordered th room to fill her mouth with two burgers at a time and at a fast pace causing her cheeks to bulge to there lists but with more elastic skin she could fit more in her mouth and swallow more at a time. Hayley looked at francine in shock. She'd never thought of her a mother would be the type of women who would want to get fat to immobility. She looked onwards as the room continued to stuff francine full to the brim making her to expand even more. Francine was now swallowing 15 burgers at a time with grease running down her chins and massive burps escaping her. Hayley was still gobsmacked. Her mother had can from a toned 120 pound woman to ha big 450 pounder then to 35930 blob and finally to 35938 human food vacuum that would suck in any food placed in front of her. Hayley then looked at her huge belly.she thought to her self that see had gone from a 125 pound flat chest to a 350 pound protester to a 1010 pound Mcburgertown fan to a 6174 pound blob. \"this isn't enough.\" hayley said to her self whilst grabbing part of her belly and shaking it. She ordered the room to stuff with the burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, I'm not going to stand for it! A statement needs to be made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do pray tell, what is that statement?\" Roger responded, playing along with Hayley for a lark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's obvious; women shouldn't have to starve themselves to the bone to reflect an unattainable image that society says is \"beauty\", they should know that it's <i>who</i> we are as humans that makes us beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze...you done singing, Billy Joel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er- I said how do you plan on pulling this shenanigan off?\" Roger hastily said, who attempted to regain his composure after nearly incurring Hayley's Liberal-induced Wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By defying society's standards on looks like this.\" Hayley pressed the magazine towards Roger, pointing at an image of one particularly thin model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're gonna advocate fat people?\" Roger said with a condescending tone in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, I knew I could count on you to think the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not that, it's just that maybe you're being a <i>little</i> too drastic, when you could just do the usual strongly-worded letter and picket-sign-in front-of-building schtick?\" Roger pleaded, as much as he liked to see her make an idiot of herself, Roger felt that maybe he accidentally pushed Hayley's motives a little too hard this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an idea!\" Hayley exclaimed as a light bulb went off in her head. \"I can write a letter to the publishing headquarters of <u><b>CQ</b></u>, threatening a protest, spread the word around, and finally, when <i>my</i> movement builds in momentum, we go to the headquarters, protesting the magazine until they show what real women look like! Roger, I'm proud to see you show a concern for the welfare of women presented in the media.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger had a defeated expression on his face; his joke backfired. That wasn't the response he was hoping for, he simply was trying to piss her off, not bounce off ideas for her next stupid 'movement' (she had done this many times in the past, with varying results).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you plan on kick-starting this?\" Roger asked, unable to come up with a snide comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy...\" Hayley said with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have to study my cause...\"</span></div></div>",

Haley sat gingerly, feeling a little like she was intruding by being there in Debbie's stead.

Call me, Hayley. You'll be seeing a lot more of me soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolks. You heard the right. Hayley Smith. Professional hippie, marijuana enthusiast, guilt giver, freeloader and disappointment to the Smith family name is eating MEAT! You may be sitting there wondering, how did that happen? Did she just start eating meat because reasons? Well, yes actually. You see the other month inside the Smith home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, there's nothing on TV right now.\" Hayley tosses the remote on to the side and wonders into her room. She checks around for her secret stash under the bed. Hayley snags the stash bag to find it depressingly empty, \"God, there's nothing to smoke now.\" Throwing the bag down to the floor she looks elsewhere. Up in the attic she peaks her head about. No sign of Roger or his wacky shenanigans, \"God, there's nothing to be annoyed-outraged about now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley walks back down to the main floor and into the kitchen. \"Surely, there something to do here. Ah! Maybe I'll toss the knives around and..nah...or I could turn up the stove real high and burn myself! That's fuuuuuu-cked up.\" Hayley sulked disappointed in her ability to keep herself entertained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked toward the fridge, if anything she could always kill a half hour just look for something edible in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Let's see. No. No. No. There's literally nothing...except.\" She reaches in and pulls out a bag from Tofu Dog. A new hot dog stand in town that has a menu consisting of nintey-five percent tofu. The other five 'D' grade meat. \"I wonder who got this? Did I get that? Eh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe microwave heated up the frigid weiner returning it to it's warm, soft state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley, not bothering to check whether it was tofu or not, took a bite. Her eyes dilated. Her mind to a trip to where before her she saw the mysteries of the unknown surrounding her. It was glorious. It was the literal vision of the taste the grateful gliding along her tongue. Hayley was entranced, she was drawn in, she was in love! She needed more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, she scarfed down the rest of the meaty wrapped in a bun and slouched in satisfaction, \"That-was-good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley! What the hell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damnit! Steve! Can I go one day without hearing you shriek?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve Smith balled his fists, \"You might have gone TODAY if you didn't eat my hotdog! If was looking forward to that all day! ALL DAY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Hotdog?\", Hayley gasped, \"As in...meat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. That's right! You ate meat! You just went against everything you believed in because of your greed. Hope you enjoy the guilt.,\" Steve slinks away, \"Bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley clutched her stomach, she held her head as her heart beat faster, \"Oh my god. I can't believe I-I- have-to-g-get more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so here we are now a few months later. Hayley has completely given into her natural carnviroristic nature to eat as much meal as possible for every meal. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Although this narration is over the story has just began. We join back with Hayley. Months later and seventy pounds heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley topples the fries onto her burger and mashes the top bun onto the combination. The sauces, meat, and cheese oozes out like the arm fat next to her bra. She takes a humungous bite and lips her full lips in utter satisfaction, \"Ugh, I'm in heaven.\" Hayley wipes the sweat and grease below her floral headband and continues to eat. She leans forward causing her gut to round out and put further strain on her pants button. She doesn't notice however, as time went on she became use to the area becoming tight. \"Crud, should look into new pants soon.\" She murmured between nibbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her increased love of meat and fast food, Hayley for a minute had noticed her increasing waistline, yet chose to ignore it for scarfing down more meat. She tried to balance her new diet and the gym, but when she was exercising she wasn't eating. So that flew out the window. Everything from her shirts to her pants had shot up in numbers as Hayley's body ballooned and became quite chunky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bra's stopped fitting and started pinching. Her jeans became more snug that they ought to be, and her midriff baring shirts now bared a rotund belly and succulent love handles that swayed amongst her big hips barely contained in her jeans. Oh, and the belt just had to go. Way too many issues to count. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Hayley feels the bite not making it's way down her throat as smoothly as it should be, \"Need-gulp-drink\". She reaches forward for her Jumbo Jet sized milkshake and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The seas had turned to blood, the land was overrun by stinging locusts, and the bitter star Wormwood shone down from the sky onto clashing armies of angels and demons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, for Michelle, it was just another Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'I think I left my Heaven-Bazooka in one of the personal heavens, Michelle.'  'Would you mind checking through every last one of the personal heavens for my Heaven-Bazooka, Michelle?'  Cripes!\" the red-headed angel muttered to herself as she stomped down the endless hall of doors.  \"Does he have any idea how long it's going to take to check seven billion of these stupid things?  I'm gonna be here until after six-thirty again, I just know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened one of the doors and looked in on an endless forest of pine trees.   \"Uh, hey, anybody in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lumberjack ran up to her.  \"They've ... they've got chainsaws!  <i>They've got chainsaws</i>  I never should have disrespected Mother Earth!  What a fool I was!  Run!  Save yourself!\"   He shoved past her into the hall.  A moment later, a gang of trees charged past in pursuit, Stihls roaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.  Now I'll probably get blamed for letting those out, too,\" Michelle grumbled.  \"Hey, uh, you, uh, Hayley, right?  Have you seen a huge golden bazooka in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley took the extra-large joint out of her mouth.  \"Whaa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, never mind.\"  Michelle ducked out and shut the door.  \"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next three heavens weren't any luckier.  Michelle was getting irritated, and her high-heels were killing her -- if only this stupid hallway had enough room for her to spread her wings!   Finally, she came to a door that was a little ... unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was made out of light green, semi-translucent material she'd never seen before, and was slightly tapered at the top.  She could just make out strange shapes moving around inside the heaven, but she couldn't tell what they were.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, okay, this is weird.  I thought we standardized these things.\"  After a little bit of fiddling with the keypad -- the keypad? -- she managed to get the door to slide open, revealing a sun-dappled forest, the trees shifting slightly in the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"  Michelle stuck her head into the heaven.  \"Anyone here?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped inside and looked around.  No lumberjacks or killer trees here.   Nobody at all, in fact.  Obviously this was an empty heaven, set up and waiting for someone who was still alive.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there was no Heaven-Bazooka here, either, so she shrugged and turned to leave -- only for the door to whoosh shut in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Michelle, you did <i>not</i> just lock yourself in another heaven.   Arrgh!\"  It had been bad enough last time, when she'd accidentally locked herself in Steve's heaven and had had to spend a chilly afternoon fighting frost trolls in a skimpy plate-metal bra, but this one wasn't even in use -- it could be practically forever before someone checked up on it!  She slapped herself in the forehead.  How could she be so <i>dumb?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, nothing for it but to find a good spot to wait.  She walked along the forest path, noting that the trees were heavy with fruit.  At least, she wouldn't be hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait -- that wasn't fruit.  She picked one and bit into it.  Were these...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Pecan Sandies?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were good, though, she had to admit that.  Better than an earthly Pecan Sandy could be.   The next tree bore a rich crop of Chocodiles, and the one after that, Ho-Hos.  She walked along for a while, munching freely on the sugary \"fruit\".   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was starting to get really thirsty, she came across the waterfall.  It burbled frothily down an alabaster cliffside and fell in a sweet-smelling curtain of mist.  Kicking off her high heels, she waded into the pool and caught a mouthful of the liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost choked at first.  It wasn't water, it was wine!   It was, however, very good wine -- sweet and tangy, and with more of a kick to it that she expected.  She ended up gulping down a little more than she'd meant to, and by the time her thirst was quenched, she was feeling tipsy.  She splashed back to the edge of the pool and sat down with a thud, shrugging off her pink-stained jacket and blouse and tossing them away.  The weather was wonderful, and it felt so nice to just sit here in her undershirt, cooling her toes in the chilled wine and snacking on Twinkies from a nearby bush.   She found they were even better if you dipped them into the pool first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she flopped over on her back, pleasantly stuffed and more than a little drunk.  <i>Oh, baby,</i> she thought,<i> I don't know whose heaven this is, but right now, it's mine!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm Biff Brumstroke, tennis instructor and deadbeat dad.  Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, I'm Becky,\" the blonde girl said, a little nervously.  \"I'm here to see Steve Smith?  Do I have, um, the right house?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve is watching <i>A Very Wipe Out Christmas</i> with the family, but I'll pass on the message.  'Stop looking in the window while I'm showering, you perv', right?  Oh, and I'll need your last name, cause I, ha ha, I can just about guarantee there's more than one Becky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, uh, it's not that.\" Becky blushed.  \"Steve was on a cruise with me a while ago and I ... I kinda like him, you know?  So I thought I'd look him up.  I hope that's not too weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.  <i>You</i> like Steve.\"  Roger laughed.  \"So is this a cruel prank, or are you just really, really drunk?  'Cause I want to know which of you I'm gonna be laughing at tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Biff -- can I just see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be my guest.\" Roger flung open the door.  \"You two kids get acquainted while I go make the popcorn.  Hey, Steve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Smith family turned their heads to see Becky in the doorway.  For a moment they looked confused.  Then Stan shouted.  Francine shrieked.  Hayley and Steve turned pale.  And all four of them ran screaming out of the room.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" Klaus said.  \"Look, I'm on the far side of mein bowl, all the way ova heah!  I am part of the family too!  Why ah we running?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, that's probably me.\"  Becky grinned sheepishly.  \"See, the last time they saw me, we were all trapped in a cave.  They had to eat me to survive.  It's actually a really funny story how I'm still here--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't care about your backstory, honey,\" Roger said, waving one floppy hand dismissively.   \"Do you want to hear Biff Brumstroke's backstory?  He was born into a wealthy family of Ohio salad farmers--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I wanted to do was surprise Steve!\"  Becky wailed.  \"Now he probably thinks I'm a freak.  A dead freak!  This <i>sucks!</i>  This <i>always</i> happens to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always die in front of guys you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  It's weird.  One time, I was on this bus--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhetorical question, stupid.  Look, Steve is, and I say this with love, a horny little bastard.  If he wasn't hiding under the bed peeing himself right now, he'd be all over you like orange on Snooki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I blew my chance, huh?\" Becky sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Becky</i> blew her chance,\" Roger corrected.  \"What you need is a <i>persona</i>.

Fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Fat?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.  He likes 'em fat and gothy.

She lost her grip on one of the bags, and suddenly jellybeans and chocoballs from the candy store were rolling all over the floor.   \"Oh no, oh no, oh dammit, dammit...\" she muttered to herself, trying to gather up the bags and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you again!\" Steve said, approaching her.  \"You're ... you're haunting me, aren't you!  Your spirit is trying to take vengeance on me!  Oh, god!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's not like that at all, Steve, I'm just--\"  Becky stammered.   Everyone was staring at them -- except for the people who were slipping on chocoballs.  As far as not making a scene went, she was failing pretty hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're angry with me because of your untimely death -- and you're jealous!  That's why you've cursed me to strike out with girls!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, what, like I just happened to stumble across the eight girls in this mall who hate Klingon pick-up lines?   I thought it was pretty fishy.  It's so obvious now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve, calm down!  I'm alive, see?\"  She grabbed his hand and put it to her chest -- probably not such a good idea.  He was stricken with the overwhelming power of Touching a Boob, and fainted.   Becky picked up all her bags and tried to make her escape, mortified; everything was going wrong!   But before she could --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky?\"  Steve was picking himself up and looking around.  The floor was still covered with people lying down and moaning, victims of the little round candies.   \"Becky, all these people... hey, what do you have there?  All that junk food... wait, that's it!  Your spirit can't rest because you were eaten, so now it wanders the earth, a hungry ghost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky sighed.  \"Fine, you win.   I'm a ghost.  And I <i>am</i> pretty hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve ripped open one of her candy bars.  \"Well, maybe that's how we calm your vengeful heart.  Eat this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit into the thick, sweet lump of chocolate and nuts.  He was just such a <i>kid</i> -- but he was pretty cute.  And hey, at least here was a way she could spend time with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you feel less vengeful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a lot less vengeful.   Feed me another one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went through four candy bars, two bags of chips, a whole carton of ice cream, and an entire bag of rapidly congealing grease-covered food from the food court before Becky was too stuffed to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Steve asked.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.  Well what?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.  You're not floating into Heaven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky groaned.  \"I'm not floating <i>anywhere</i> anytime soon.\"  She felt like she'd eaten a couch.  If they hadn't been in public, she would have unzipped her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we're not doing it right.  Maybe I need to take you out to a fancy restaurant or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky's heart leapt.  He'd just asked her out!... sort of!

What you're about to read is an interactive writing thingy on the internet about the women in MY television show gaining weight for your reading pleasure.\" Stan freshens his tobacco pipe, \"Now before you go running off and adding your own stories, the creator of this interactive has a few rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan spins his recliner to a presentation board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number one! Chapters must be of good size and contain more than 2 paragraphs. If that is too much work for you then maybe you shouldn't be writing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan clears his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number 2. No male weight gain of any kind. There is another 'American Dad' interactive that allows you to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3. No females under the age of 18 allowed. Hayley is 18, but anything younger than her will be deleted. So sorry if you somehow have any attraction towards Debbie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N\u00famero 4. Only light sex such as kissing and groping is allowed to stay. You can hunt further action, but not in detail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And last, but not least 5. This show is pretty unrealistic. There are CIA experiments, my son was pregnant for an episode, and so on. Weight gain can be caused for any reason, but it's up to you whether it's more realistic or unrealistic. Although, the creator would prefer unrealistic, quick weight gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, that is all. I hope you enjoy! And be sure to tune into to Animation Domination on Sundays!\"<br>\r\n</td>",
