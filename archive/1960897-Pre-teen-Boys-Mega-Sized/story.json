This concours to this as a 10 year old boy named Luke with blonde hair near to his shoulder and blue eyes, was walking through the country fields on his own for the first time.  Normally he would be walking either his mother or auntie but his age becoming independent make them two wondering if he could managed to walk through and enter the town which is not far from where he lives and Luke was delighted but nervous.  His mother told him not to worry about it, if he doesn't have to, then you could start walking on his own when he's ready.  But Luke was ready to do this and his mother just have to accept his decision,  I matter what happens to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo one day, Luke left his house and walked into the pathway through the fields on a bright sunny day and he loved the sounds and sights every minute of it.  He played with his iPod so that nerves would calm him down without any trouble at all since their isn't any roads until about ten minutes from his place, then you know he'll be fine enough to use those.  He looked around those various places he's been walking through from the past time like houses, farmyards, sports leisure centres and many more.  But the one thing he caught his eye on during his past time was this building that looked like a special for somebody either driving or walking through the fields and Luke gets his chance to take a look and maybe going inside and see what it is.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he walked straight forward to the building appeared to him and it took his five minutes to walk from there to the building.  Then he finally made it to the building and he looked at the sign to see what it was the whole time, he was over the moon for that moment and licking his lips in hunger as this place was actually a... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wow!  This is sweet!\"  Luke licked his lips with mouth watery in delight as he read the sign that is said 'Candy House' and you know why when you look around the place itself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a house decorated in candy with the likes of candy canes, ginger breads, lollipops and to name the view.  The walls and the doors have been painted into chocolates and the roof was made with ice-cream and it is a unmissable place and you see this place, you're stomach would be growling in hunger, not matter if you tried to take your eyes of it.  But what did Luke think he would do?  Keep walking or take his chance and check and see what it looks like inside?  That answer that he can refused and Luke decides to go the doorstep and rings the doorbell before he waits to see if anyone would come and answer to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a door has opened and Luke was nervous to see who this person was until he saw someone coming of the house and it actually a cute young girl who answered the door.  She looks like in her early twenties, blonde hair, hazel eyes and she wore colourful fashion dress made out of candy.  She looked down at Luke who was shaking in nerves before she spoke as a greeting in her cutest voice Luke has ever heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello there, little one. What makes you make a journey to this sweetest place in the area?\"  She asked in her cute voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey..umm... I was just looking to see what's in this house an...and...\"  Luke couldn't help but hesitate as he was so nervous he couldn't think of the word he was trying to say.  But a young girl giggled and understands him very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you of anything and I know you must be hungry.  Why don't you come inside and I can hand you something to eat.\"  A girl smiled and calms him down in nerves and shows his way into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, thanks!\" Luke acknowledged as he managed to calm himself down now before he make his way inside a house and more decorations are made inside, the same you see from outside earlier on.  The furnitures however are made from candy so anytime someone eats it, they can make another one time and time again.  Luke thought to himself that it looked like Christmas to him, knowingly it is six months early but this place just looks like it and licked his lips again like he's getting hungry and a young girl already knows and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be hungry.  What is your name sweetie?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jake and yeah, I'm getting hungry already.\"  He said when he place his hands on his empty stomach, knowing how much he would get if he eats too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jake, I love your name.  Well my names's Jessie and I made this house myself.\"  Jessie introduced before she takes him to his seat where he'll be eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Luke sits himself down and feels it like normal despite the chair was made in candy, but it was too good to be real for him.   Before he was giving his feasts, Jessie tells him what'll happens as she explains giving him whatever it is she's got with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Luke,  here's what I have here.  What'll I do and don't be afraid of doing this but I would like to give you __________ so that you'll enjoy what you're eating anything you feel like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Please note that if you choose the second or a bottom choice, you cannot choose choose back to the first choice as he will be fat already.  Thanks!)</span></div></div>",

What'll I do and don't be afraid of doing this but I would like to give you a strap against a chair so that you'll enjoy what you're eating anything you feel like it.\"  Jessie asked as she brought the straps so that she can strap around Luke while eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, why do I need a strap for?\"  Like asked nervously before Jessie explains the reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just to make you comfortable while you're eating that's all.  So try not to get worried to yourself in fact, it doesn't hurt you or anything.\"  She confesses him that everything alright and Luke did calmed down and nodded his with a smile when he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, since if this doesn't do anything to me, then okay!  Let's go for it.\"  Luke has turned into confident as Jessie smiles and straps his wrists and legs attach against a chair before she asks him if he was ready to this feast if hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Luke, are you ready to get yourself feed?\"  She asked as she gets the first of its candies randy to stuff him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am Jessie!\"  Luke smiled and licked his lips once more and he just sits there and watch when Jessie starts bringing out a first bag of candies and place it on the floor beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she tells him that she's ready to feed him, she takes out the first candy and Luke opened his mouth and she feeds him into his mouth before he swallowed down to his throat which actually I his point of view, it taste very good indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This taste's so great\" Said Luke after he swallowed the first candy to his throat and Jessie smiled to hear from his comments he gave greatly before she stuffs another candy Into his mouth once more and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke eats and eats non stop as each piece he felt into his mouth from her as if he thought he was in heaven.  Nobody from anywhere can make great pastry making than her new friend Jessie made.  Remember she is only around in her early twenties and no wonder why she's been making great flavour of candies at her young age and Luke was more than impressed.  Dreams still filled into his thoughts until moments later when he held on his shoulders by Jessie to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke, are you okay?\"  She asked and Luke's have opened a little and gave her a nod as she knows he's okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good!  Listen, I'm gonna get more bags because that's it empty.  So if you can wait here for a moment and I'lll be back with more bags and continue feeding you again\"  Jessie said happily as she take an empty bag and goes out of the room to get more, leaving Luke sitting here strapped behind and replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll still be here when you come back.\"  Luke smiled back and waited until she returns to get more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for himself in times, Like had never ate that amount than he used to and look at the difference it made him go.  His double chin was starting to show a little bit and he notice that he has a small pot belly pushing out of his shirt a little bit.  He was kinda embarrass by it but would just giggle and enjoy having it.  Although he was still tied against a chair, he would want to know how it feels like so he can enjoy playing with it.  It did take long to wait when Jessie came back with two more bags filled with the same kind the first bag was brought from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got you more bags Luke, are you ready to have another one again?\" Jessie asked  and Luke nodded and opened his mouth so she can stuff him into his (in her opinion) cute mouth once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half have passed and Luke kept eats up the last of the candies in the bag before he gives it a loud burp which made Jessie blushed and pat his belly for him since he was still strapped. His belly was pushing out from him further but still has a pot belly at the moment which is only the start to what he might end up eating further more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like that, Luke?\"  Jessie asked with a smile to see him progressing his eating habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this is so great.  I can't wait to stay here for a while.\"  Luke was delighted despite he was kinda full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good!  Say, how about if I can feed you with...</span></div></div>",

I could eat it all day!\"<br>\r\n \" I'm sure you could.\" laughed Jessie, patting Luke's stomach. \"Don't worry, you'll get all you can hold.\"<br>\r\n  She left Luke alone for a few moments. Then she came back pushing something big. It was a large plastic barrel, filled to the rim with chocolate syrup. Luke's eyes widened when he saw it. <br>\r\n  \"Wanna taste?\" Luke nodded. She dipped a spoon in and fed it to him. Words did not describe it. It was a chocolate explosion in his mouth.<br>\r\n  \"Tell you what. Let's make it easy, Luke. Instead of me feeding you by the spoon, I could put a tube in your mouth. Then a pump could keep the syrup coming to you. All you'd have to do is sit back and relax. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n \"Cool! Let's do it!\"<br>\r\n  Soon Jessie did just that. There was a tube in his mouth, that was taped in place. On the edge of the barrel was a pump, with the other end of the hose in the syrup.<br>\r\n \"Ready?\" Luke nodded.<br>\r\n  She started the pump and the chocolate syrup entered Luke's mouth. It was Heaven! Luke's eyes were half closed in delight .He  had never tasted anything   like it in his life. It seemed he didn't even have to swallow. The chocolate just poured right down into him<br>\r\n  A ripping sound woke him out of his trance. He looked down at himself in shock. His stomach was huge, and getting bigger. HIs legs were ripping out of his pants. Boy bosoms were pushing his shirt out, and his arms were filling out. He was getting fat! Too fat! He could explode!<br>\r\n  \"JSHeshie.\" he said through the mouthful of chocolate and tube. \"Shtop, shtob, lhease.\"<br>\r\n  Jessie looked at him with a smile  on her face. Does she.</span></div></div>",

The tube was back in his mouth, and taped in. Jessie turned the pump on, and Luke felt the chocolate surge into him. It seemed harder and faster this time. After about 30 seconds, the chocolate bliss of before overwhelmed him. <br>\r\n  He felt like he was floating, far above, in a chocolate cloud. Happiness, pure happiness. Something he could experience for the rest of his life. <br>\r\n When he awoke from his bliss he was.... </span></div></div>",

It was some kind of large mattress or pad. <br>\r\n \"Jesse?\" he called out. No response,<br>\r\n  His eyes adjusted to the light. That's when he saw the mirror above him. It showed what he looked like. He was covered in some kind of tight fitting body suit. He was huge! His stomach stuck up like a huge mound, then went down to his sides. He had 2 huge boys bosoms. His thighs were now meeting. His cheeks were round.<br>\r\n  He tried to get up, but could only move his arms and legs. He was so heavy, his weight was keeping  him down. Now what?

Luke was still in a worrying state, and was unsure how anyone reacts to his size when he has a bottom heavy look, with all the fat wobbling so heavily each time he moves so swiftly.  He would sure he\u2019ll get the good start of these and see what happens in the future, when it took longer than his usual walk to make it back home and coming in, squeezing himself in with difficulty with his widened waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, he wouldn\u2019t want his mother to see him like this, but just as he was waddling towards his bedroom, a sweet voice can be heard and Luke was so frightened that there was no turning back.

She placed her hands on his belly once more and leaned into his ear and said \"Don't fight it Luke, you know you want to be cuter\". She smiled and let Luke be.

Grinning Luke said to himself, \"Plenty of people with nowhere to run.\" Placing his hands behind his head Luke took one giant stride out of the rubble of his school and into the neighborhood surrounding it. His semi-truck sized foot landed on a house crushing a couple in their living room. Feeling them crush like ripe grapes made Luke giggle and he moved his other foot to take another step, dragging it low over the ground in order to destroy the house next door the one he had just crushed. His toes ripped through the house as if it were made of paper and the force of his toes impacting the people inside it turned them into little more than a red mist, with the remnants of the house scattering throughout the suburb like shrapnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Being the mischievous young boy he was, Luke turned even the journey to the beach into a crushing spree. Any people walking the side walks suddenly found a preteen's foot hurtling towards them followed by a great splat! Any cars driving the streets soon found themselves crushed flatter than tinfoil, or hurtling hundreds of feet through the neighborhood thanks to the powerful kick of a giant 10 year old. Feeling particularly mischievous at one point, Luke crouched down by a couple walking along the sidewalk and flicked them! The force of his fingers alone ripped the couple in half spraying blood and gore across the houses and flinging their remains out of sight. Even Luke stood in shock for a moment as he realized just how powerful he was. By the time Luke arrived at the beach, a great path of destruction had been carved through the neighborhood marked by semi-truck sized footprints and smoldering ruins. While he hadn't grown as much crushing people as he had earlier, Luke's little stroll through the neighborhood had grown him to nearly 400 feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Having heard the destruction in the neighborhood, the spring break vacationers on the beech were beginning to leave, but very slowly. Leaving the suburb and beginning to walk through the oceanfront businesses, Luke began to stomp his feet creating tremors that could be felt all the way at the beach. Feeling the tremors, the beach goers began to panic and Luke grinned as he heard the chorus of screams rising from the beach. With his cute and childlike voice Luke greeted the beach goers with a playful \"Hi everyone!\" further inciting panic. With the beach goers now in a full state of panic and trying to escape, Luke ran along the edge of the beach as fast as he could, ripping up store fronts, sending cars cartwheeling through the sky, and crushing any escapees under his giant feet. Seeing the destruction they were running into the beach goers immediately halted and began to back away slowly from the titanic 10 year old and the paths off the beach. Now close to 500 feet tall and putting on a big grin, Luke raised his giant foot and showed off the blood stains to his new prey. \"This is what happens if you try to leave everyone! And don't think your not all dead meat, because your all next!\" Upon uttering the word \"next\" Luke slammed his foot back onto the ground crushing a dozen or so people, marking the start of his great crushing fest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unable to outrun his 250 foot long legs, or his 50 foot long tread the people on the beach were doomed. Over the next couple hours Luke's form moved up and down the beach with his hammer like footfalls sending tremors through the city. Blood oozed up from between his toes as group after group of people were crushed under his growing tread. By the time Luke had finished, the bottoms of his feet were caked in a mixture of sand and blood with the remains of many unfortunate victims stuck to the bottom of his tread. The entire beach looked like a war zone, covered in 10 foot deep footprints with people in the bottom of them crushed flatter than pancakes. Breathing heavily from chasing down his prey, Luke examined himself against a 80 story building along the beach standing with his back against the mirror like surface and using his finger to carve a line into it where the top of his head was. Looking at the line, Luke saw that it was just 10 floors or so from the top of the building, making him 700 feet tall! \"The taller I get, the more people I'll need to crush!\", Luke exclaimed. Looking triumphantly out across the beach, Luke spotted a small glimmer shining way out at sea. \"It must be the Navy trying to stop me!\", Luke realized and he turned back around to the city. \"Hmmm, I might be big enough to not even have to worry about the Navy, but swimming out to crush them sure would be a lot of fun!\" With night falling, Luke decided to...</span></div></div>",

Don't know how Joey managed to made those from but he knew that this would do a trick and hopefully nobody notice as he does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Joey tip-toed quietly towards the table where Tyler will be sitting down and made a sneaky move by swapping bottles placing the weight gain sauce on the table and Joey moved away quickly before Tyler comes anytime when he feels hungry.  Ten minutes later, Tyler was starting to get hungry and goes over to the table and takes his seat before the food was brought out and place it on the table while Tyler looks on.

His belly can he seem fully, as his lifted up so much, and so as his moobs that are started to show, hidden underneath as it happens.  Not only that, but his butt and thighs are getting wider too, beginning to look like the biggest feature in size, causing Joey to burst into laughter a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed started to creak heavily underneath Tyler, but luckily the swelling seems to be stopped, once he reaches up to _______, and Joey couldn\u2019t believe what he\u2019s seeing from his point of view!</span></div></div>",

He squeezed the massive ball of white flesh, gave it one last poke and took pictures. Without warning the stuffing began, little did the tubby pre teen know that the food had growth hormones. He was going to get huge. Everyone crowded around the bed and was stuffing Tyler's face. He placed his hands on his growing belly, it was a warm cushion, but he could feel it getting fatter, pushing his hands up a curve of what had to be quite an impressive gut by now. He could feels his thighs starting to touch and when he looked down he couldn't see his feet anymore, just a soft orb of fat, which was starting to turn into rolls. But, the servers weren't finished yet, another group of servers came in and stuffed the kids face. When they were done he was huge! The servers got a large mirror so the big bellied kid dould see himself, and boy was he in for a shock. His shirt had finally ripped of, Tylers whole face was a lot more rounded, double chin and all (he was very close to a third chin). His moobs had increased in size. But, his main feature was the absolutely huge belly. In fact, calling it a belly was an understatement. Tyler had gotten a gut that came down to his fatty thighs and covered his boxers. There were two rolls of fat on his sides over his hips. A large pair of \"love handles\". Tyler's navel was a large indentation in the huge sack of fat that made up his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler at first was horrified, he poked his belly and realized that it was indeed him. He took the fat in one hands and shook it. His entire belly jiggled as he did so. It was soft and warm, and it even felt kinda good, but he didn't think it was possible to get any bigger, or could he?    </span></div></div>",

Tyler waddled to the chair and sat down. He placed his hands on his rotund belly, Joey too put his hands on Tylers belly. He rubbed it, while Tyler slowly moaned.

It was so fattening that it was already having an affect on Tyler's tubby belly. It fattened and grew rounder with all the shake flowing inside it, rounding out and becoming softer with every swallow. Tyler's tummy jiggled and bulged out, becoming squishier with all this new fat on his belly. Joey flipped of the switch to give Tyler a break. Tyler felt a blorp as his stomach fattened even more, Joey ran up and massaged the huge squishy belly that lay in front of him. No matter what Tyler's belly wouldn't stop jiggling while he was pinned down by his on flesh. <br>\r\n\"See Tyler?\" asked Joey.\"Isn't have a huge tummy so much better\" he said while giving it a pinch.

Now, Joey realised that his dream is now a reality and would have to get used to seeing Tyler in this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe likes it, but does Tyler react the same as his little brother has?

That\u2019s when he had spotted from what looks like a giant birthday cake from the other side of the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a group party that had a wedding-sized cake on the table.  Lot\u2019s of cream and sugar in there, and it made Tyler licked his lips in hunger once more.

No manners at all, except he would pat his chubby belly, and closed his eyes in reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!  This is the life!\u201d  He says in a calm expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe may be calm, but what happens next is something he might regret!

His uncle was a professional wrestler through his lifetime and won major championships to his belt and one day, Deston would be like him whatever there is to come.  But it didn't take long to notice when yesterday, he received a phone call from a promoter asking for his invitation to be part of the roster and by that means, he was over the moon in delight and he couldn't wait to join the tough boys in action, despite they were all older than him in the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, Deston was at the entrance of the arena when he entered through two doors to take a look at the atmosphere of the place.  There were seats all around the room with a wrestling ring where he saw two wrestlers in athletic build practicing  for their next show.  He was excited but nervous just as he walked towards the ring where a promoter was also here to train and he spotted him which he knew who he was with a delight smile of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're Deston Sandison, right?\"  He asked and Deston nodded with an answer year in his reply.  A promoter than climbed out of the ring and shook his hands to make a introduction to himself.  \"Hi, I'm John Smith, and I'm the promoter of this wrestling business.  But you can call me Jock if you want to?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to see you, Jock!\"  Deston replied before he asks.  \"So is there anything I could do to become a wrestler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJock then smiled and replied.  \"Sure, it's just I need to ask you something if you would like to come over to my office and we can talk about it there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\"  Deston nodded as now, follows Jock to his office which was quite a big room with big tables further down.  He leads a youngster to take a seat before he explains everything about what his character will be and how would this be sorted till then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so this is where it all starts and we hope you'll have a nice time being as a new roster for our show.  The reason we invited you is because we thought of a plan to make a wrestler who's never been huge than any persons around as far as size is concerned.  So we were wondering that we want to make you the fattest wrestler of all time and I want to see you dominating every single roster out there and make the fans shock by the look of that monster we're about to make you.  Will you be okay with that?\"  Jock explains and asked about the offer which Deston looked a bit shocked by it and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, me being huge?  That's seems impossible since it takes years to make me look obese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don''the worry about that, Deston!\"  He replied with a smile.  \"We already have a equipment that could make you fatter in instant proportions and we'll sort everything else along the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeston had a long to think, he never expected to believe he was going to be a wrestler, but huge which is ridiculous.  But he didn't mind having a go, so he took his breath in nerves before he gets a nod for his answer.  \"Alright then, I'll take that offer!\"  He smiled and both have exchanged their handshakes in agreement to make it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" He smiled in delight before he explains everything what's gonna happen from now till his debut. \"Now meet me here tomorrow morning while we get everything in prefect shape in time for the show.  But in the meantime, enjoy yourself and eat up while you can, buddy!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I will!  See you later!\"  Deston said in his farewell to his promoter as he made his way out of the arena to head back home to tell his family about this and he feels happy for his role he's taking. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That is until an 11 year old boy named Deston showed up one night to determine what was inside the place and why it was sealed for the whole time it was locked for nearly fifty years.  With nobody around that time, Deston quickly sneaked into the pathway towards the mansion and goes up the steps to approach the door which is locked and sealed.  He tries to open the door just in case, but still locked as predicted but already had an idea to unlock it by bringing out a crowbar of his bag and fix that door to open.

Almost identical you see every doors like a 5-star hotel by the looks of things and Deston almost feels like he was having a long stay in this place.

I\u2019ve always curious to see how it feels like when I put on a suit, like I\u2019m looking like fat in all.\u201d  Ralph says in response and could only imagine wearing it and act like a fat kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFat suit?  Who says we needed a fat suit?\u201d  Rob had asked and dropped a bombshell, realising it wasn\u2019t going to be just simple as Ralph thought in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW...What do you mean by that?\u201d  Ralph asked in a slight confused look to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I mean is we\u2019ll actually gonna fatten you up and you\u2019re really gonna be the fattest kid in the world... for real!\u201d  Rob has explained and knowing he wanted to make this a reality, rather than a fake look people would normally think it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Ralph shocked in surprised fashion.  He never thought Rob was actually gonna make a young kid fat, like intentionally, and this can be a life changer if he was to accept this role for a particular movie.  Though if he was to say no, then he\u2019ll be feared that his acting career could be on the line, and he wouldn\u2019t want to witness something like by any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut come to think of it, he\u2019ll be hoping the crew may have something for him, if he was to have his body being restored, once the film finishes and get back to being just himself in a normal state.  But then again, he\u2019ll might feel otherwise and looked a bit curious to wonder how much he could get used to being so obese, depending on how much weight he had to gain for this project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... This seems interesting!  I\u2019m feeling nervous about this, but I wanna give it a shot and see how it feels to be so big and fat for real.\u201d  Ralph has came up a decision and is confident with a smile and see what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be just fine while we get this project done.\u201d  Rob smiled as the director would then ask with these options for Ralph to start off the scene.  \u201cSo, would you like to start the scene like this and eating junk food, or would you want to grow fatter immediately and get grown by a ray gun we made?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gives Ralph a lot to think about, should he want everyone to see him gain weight by feeding, or start off the film looking so gigantically fat and settles life with it?  He knows he wanted to make the director proud and needed to make it perfect for a story to go in.  So he took a while to think, until he had come and what did a youngster wanted to do for a film to start?</span></div></div>",

Some would like to do this as early as late afternoon before sunset, but most people would prefer dark evening, when the true Halloween spirit comes to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of these kids is a 10 year old boy named Ralph!  He\u2019s a skinny kid with brown hair, and blue eyes, and he comes out his Godzilla onsie, which is a pyjamas he would normally wear.  That\u2019s because he couldn\u2019t find any decent costume to either wear or find the price he needed to spend.  So having to wear a onsie which he loved Godzilla so much, seems like a good fit to go out for some candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was doing this on his own, and like everyone else around s the area, he would go to these houses to receive candy by grown-ups alike.  He enjoyed it to far, and it may be so when he approached this particular house as his next stop.  He was starting to get the hang of it all by himself, when he knocked on the door and await for someone to come and give him some treat.  The door eventually opened, and the person came with as soon as Ralph have to say these words before receiving a candy in such a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrick or Treat!\u201d  Ralph called out with that smile in his Godzilla pyjama onise, and looked up to a person who dressed up as what type of costume?</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll be you a bottle, and I\u2019ll film you getting fatter with a camera, so it can be shared with you and your family.\u201d  Mrs Smith says and gives Tony a bottle of potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gets the camera out and is able to start recording with a nine year old boy as a focal point.  She would film him at the front and then move around his body, including his back until she was facing back to front again.  That gives Tony a wide smile and greeted with a wave, before he was to look at the bottle and opened the cap of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, here goes nothing!\u201d  Tony takes a deep breath and is ready to take a drink of a potion, but how much does he take for starters?</span></div></div>",

What kinda older brother is that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Tony was home alone, watching tv and having the time of his life. Little did he know, a local secret government plan was going to backfire, and make his day way more exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, close to the suburbs was a government science facility was testing the effects of a growth machine all day and night on plants and living organisms. Usually small ones. Things were working out well, for the most part, until after the lab closed for the night. During the night, the machine malfunctioned, and let out a gas cloud as it traveled outside a window, and conveniently to Tony's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony liked to leave his window open at night, to give some fresh air, and he was ready to sleep, being all snugly in his little pajamas. The boy laid down, and started to drift asleep. Then, through the window, the gas cloud from the growth machine came in, and he sniffed it up, as he was beginning to sleep. \"Eww..\" He said, suddenly waking up.. \"What was that..?\"</span></div></div>",

I hope if I done this differently I had planned for?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis Wright is a very interesting boy you can say. He might have a normal appearance like a normal human, but there is several things that set him apart from many other humans across the world. He is actually a obese giant monster at the same time. Now you might be wondering, how did Lewis became a obese giant monster? Well the answer is a very mysterious one. You see, a alien like meteor hit the in the North of Tokyo, Japan. At the time of the impact, a pregnant woman who's husband was serving in the army but deployed there, was driving by when they noticed it. They went and investigated the meteor, and then suddenly when the wife touched it, a strange surge went through her body and she collapsed. The husband then took her to the hospital, and she recovered soon after. Months later, she gave birth to a healthy boy name Lewis Wright. At first, he seemed to be very normal, but then, big changes soon came to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the age of 2, he started to grow really fast, eventually he was like 5 ft tall, and he just kept growing from there as he aged, but the results were even more drastic than ever as he grew. At the age of 4, he was roughly 50ft tall, taller than the humans and at least big as a house and some buildings. Also, that is where he began to gain some huge amount of weight when his chubbiness was started to form. While the people and the government of Japan was researching him prior, soon this became apparent that he wasn't normal at all, not even close. He was growing, and almost causes a youngster mass destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe government and military intervene and the entire world came together to help out the boy. A number of technical advances was made during that time that would support the boy through his life. During that time, his size spiked at the age of 6 all the way to a huge 130ft tall and much fatter furthermore. He was starting to be seen by some as a obese giant monster, and of course he would be feared a bit, but as soon as they got to know a boy like him, their fears were then gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would begin to help out Japan with building demolishing, did some modeling for the camera in various swimsuits, that was made as his clothes, even though his fat belly and moobs can be seen but didn't mind showing it off to anyone, and is overall just a friendly person to be around with, and also likes to have fun with his new size. At the current time, he is 9 years old, and stands at 175ft tall and grown into obesity which at normal weight, he would've been 500lbs. He currently lives on an island off the cost of Japan known as Lewis Island, the island that houses Lewis. They outfitted his island with stuff to do, and even gave him something really awesome, like a virtual city, where he can rampage as a obese giant monster all day long. He is home-schooled on the island by various teachers as his size makes it impossible to go to any sort of school at all that would normally house human sized children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is extremely popular in the world, but really popular in Japan, despite his parents were foreigners to begin with but was soon granted citizenship following their son's growth, and he even likes the nickname Lewiszilla!  He loves that name so much, he roars like a giant monster whenever someone says that to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, we see Lewiszilla wearing a navy colored speedos  that fits him well. What does he plan to do today?</span></div></div>",

He was rather confused as he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, except he was told by his teacher, that the principal has got some surprise for the youngster.  Of course he had no idea why he has been called in, but he took deep breath and headed over there straight away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office was just a couple of rooms from his classroom, so it was a short walk over when he reached towards the office door, and goes straight in.  There, he saw the female receptionist at her own desk, to which Nick had to go over and inform her of his appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi umm... I\u2019m here to see principal Shaw.  I was told he\u2019s got a surprise for me, so I\u2019ve been asked to come over to see him.\u201d  Nick says to let the receptionist know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist nodded in response and gives the principal a call on the phone.  Nick waits nervously, since it was the first time he\u2019s ever come to the office like this.  He was left feeling a bit shaken as this point, but he remained calm as the receptionist hangs up the phone and informs Nick at this point of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincipal Shaw would like to see you now!\u201d  The female receptionist says in the most calmest way possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d  Nick responded with acknowledgement, and goes into the principal\u2019s office for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he\u2019s inside the room, it was a rather big office that had the look of a glamour texture to it,  with principal Shaw being the head of the entire school.  And speaking of which, that\u2019s when Nick was greeted in by the school principal, who looks to be in his mid 40s, and has got some smile on his face.  This was something Nick had never thought of anything, but he remained calm as he was about to receive his welcome, when closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Nick!  It\u2019s nice to see you here!\u201d  Principal Shaw greeted with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly nice to meet you too!  Is there something you want to see me, sir?\u201d  Nick asked with a smile, as he felt nervous from the inside, when asked about his reasons being sent to the office in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m glad you asked that question!\u201d  Principal Shaw responded with a cheerful tone.  \u201cNow as you know, you\u2019ve been the best student of the whole school by a mile.  So much so, that I wanna give you a role as a school hallway patrol, which you\u2019ll start immediately!  So when you see trouble, just take action and do whatever you want to stop this from happening again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick\u2019s eyes were widened when he heard about this role he never expects to get one.  He may see some hallway patrols when he was a so young, he could only ever dreamed of being one of them when old enough to do it.  Thankfully his behaviour have made Principal Shaw the easiest decision he\u2019s ever made, and now he gets to be like one when receiving a sash to know he\u2019s on duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!  Thanks, Principal Shaw!  I never thought I could be in this position when I was a kindergarten.\u201d  Nick smiled heavily and puts it on to make himself feeling pride by any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Nick!  But before you go, there\u2019s just one thing I need you to try this.  It\u2019s a surprise I wanna see if that works on you?\u201d  Principal Shaw wondered and shows Nick of what kind?</span></div></div>",

His parents made him dead straight in being a giant monster movie star, and they made him watch hundreds of giant monster films, like Godzilla, Gamera, and so many others. They even give him some tokusatsu movie sets for him to play with, and he likes always being the monster that he is. Tearing up cities, stomping on plastic cars, bridges, and anything you can imagine, all in his underwear as he is a model as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis big movie series was Toshio: The Giant Monster Child, where he plays an ancient child kaiju who awakens from a temple and destroys Tokyo, and in that movie he even has laser eyes. He did that movie when he was 5, and he does a lot more giant monster productions as a monster ever since, and his movies are huge successes.

Luckily, his \u2018Incredibles\u2019 costume was still intact, but the growth isn\u2019t done yet.

He now has a pear shaped body, which meant his butt and thighs are much bigger than the rest of his fat belly, which his belly is also noticeable, though again his costume surprisingly remained in him without even a tear at least.  But Dash was awestruck and now has to look around and see from his point of view that he\u2019s now a giant fat superhero kid, thanks to an item he now wears around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhoa!

It runs all throughout the summer, so Rocco knew he may have a chance to make it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet!

I hope you would enjoy your stay as we want to end the summer with so many fat people like yourself.  I\u2019ll show you where your cabin is for your stay.\u201d  The counsellor responded, before wasting no time but to lead Rocco to the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, it was a short walk from the entrance, as the youngster was taken to the first cabin, which is pretty much small, but has a lot of luxury stuff to do, whilst getting fattened up at the same time.

He would open up the cap, takes a look for a moment and says with a huge sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, here goes nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so after a few moments, Rocco tries it out and takes a drink of the bottle.

He would literally take a whole litre of the bottle, and was able to put it back down to give his own thoughts to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!  I never thought it would taste so good.  It\u2019s like soda when you the the taste of it, and this is so nice!\u201d  Rocco says, before letting out a loud belch for good measure.  He would pat his belly and trying to calm it down for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut calming things down would make it even worse all the sudden, when Rocco was started to feel some weird sensation in him, like he was getting warmer so quickly, and even when he felt like he was about to get heavier too.  This had puzzled Rocco so much, he looks concerned as if what\u2019s happening to him instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooohh!\u201d  I\u2019m feeling so weird!  It feels like I\u2019m about to get blacked out or something?\u201d  That\u2019s what Rocco was feeling for the time being, and even more so, it wouldn\u2019t be long until he would lie on the ground and began to sleep soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all it is until a couple of hours later, when Rocco was starting to get some conscious back.  He had his eyes opened and slowly letting himself yawned by sitting up.  But some reason reason, Rocco was still feeling heavy like he was before, but it was even more this time around.  He also looked around, looking like something\u2019s way off!  This was strange for Rocco, and as much as he was still dreaming, he\u2019s about to get the biggest shocker of his life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, where am I?  And why am I feeling a lot bigger so sudden?\u201d  Rocco wondered in confusion.  So much so that his voice echoed a lot than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe may need some answers by any means, and he\u2019ll get one by the time he stood up slowly, and looking around to find out why?  What he first saw is that the house around him has gotten a lot smaller like a model village, even the streets and vehicles are looking miniaturised than normal.  Not only that, but he can see his belly was sticking out fully, and so he looked around, looking like he had gotten obese so rapidly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a surprise for Rocco, since he had been slim in his entire life.  But now he\u2019s gotten so thicker with every part of his body shown some blubber all over.  He now had a bottom heavy shaped body, making his butt and thighs massively fatter, though his belly in question still remains noticeable, hanging over his undies, now that his clothes had ripped apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as his height goes as well as his weight, he may looked at about 200 feet tall in stature, and he may be weigh up to 500lbs, if his height was normal to be exact measure.  Rocco was so stunned, he couldn\u2019t believe as much as it was impossible to be this massive, but it did.  This is when he would give the reaction as much as he\u2019s that size for real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!  I\u2019m so freaking huge!  I just think it feels so ____ to be this big!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Even was rather skeptical at first, but had shrugged and use this as his review for the upcoming video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the camera has been recorded, and Evan greeted his viewers before he\u2019s able to show it with a ray gun, and explain as much as he\u2019s still fascinated by this weird looking item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so this thing may look like a toy gun, but it\u2019s actually a size ray gun.  You can trigger this by aiming at anything to make it either bigger or smaller.  I\u2019ll be happy to demonstrate this for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan says with his enthusiastic smile, whilst carrying on with the video being recorded.  He was going to find some toy to demonstrate and hopefully if it works.  But something triggers him, and he wasn\u2019t sure why?  For some reason, Evan had this imagination about things that can go, but could also think that it could make people grow for that matter.  Maybe get a little taller or getting massive like Godzilla for that matter.  It took a long had thought, and then that smirk says it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... maybe it wouldn\u2019t be that bad if I can try it myself and get big for a while?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s what Evan had his suggestions and gives this a go.  He would stand up and adjusts the size rate on how big he he wants to go.  He then takes aim and shoots at with the beam hitting him in the process.

Even more so when he saw the note and got to read what it says in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear User, Thank you for ordering our brand new weight gain shakes.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll want to big, but here\u2019s the instructions you should follow this along.  First, place little more than one tablespoon of powder into the glass, then mix it with water to make the drink like a shake.  Once you\u2019ve done, it\u2019s bottoms up and ready to drink.  Enjoy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the note being said, to which Haiden had read it out.  Now that he knows what to do, he would start to make things straight away and headed to the kitchen to get it done.  He grabbed a glass from the top shelf, and is able to pour it some water from the sink.  Once after that, he would open the container of weight gain shakes, and would use the tablespoon to dig it in and poured onto the glass of water, so that he would then give it a mix to make a good milkshake it looks like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more like strawberry milkshake as it came out, and Haiden was excited to give this drink a try, but that\u2019s when he had some curious thoughts about it, and he wondered by looking in between the glass and the container itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... does one tablespoon is enough to make me grow fatter I wonder?\u201d  Haiden asked in a curious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gave him some great thoughts, but also wondered if this could also be dangerous if taking too much powder would make him ever larger and unsteady by the end of it?  Of course Haiden wouldn\u2019t have time to read it back, so he would just assumed this should be okay, when he shrugged otherwise to give his call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, maybe I should ___________ and see what happens to me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But of course he\u2019ll be thinking that this necklace did exactly what was said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!  I can\u2019t believe this necklace is making me bigger.\u201d  That wise surprised smile on Haiden\u2019s face, when he would place his hands on his growing belly, getting fatter in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wouldn\u2019t be that long until he feels now that his entire body was beginning to swell, and adding more pounds to his weight.  In particular, his butt and thighs was getting larger much more, and he even had to give it a feel, just to see how soft and jiggly it started to feel and to swell heavily continuously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the real kicker is Haiden looking around to see the room was getting smaller from his point of view.  But this became evident when his head got bumped onto the ceiling, whilst beginning to feel like he\u2019s getting taller too.  He wouldn\u2019t be cramping the room for much longer though, when his head and tubby, upper body began to burst through the ceiling, before able to burst out of the house within sometime later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was something new to the 13 year old kid, as the more he gets bigger, the more he would become a monster by the time it took moments later to finally had his growth come to a complete halt.  Looking down at his own self, the first thing Haiden would see is he\u2019s now looking a lot obese than any other.  He looked like he weighed at about 500lbs or more, if his height was normal from its calculation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a look of a pear-shaped body, now looking to see his butt and thighs looking so much bigger.  His belly was also gotten fatter, that it had spilled over his undies, now that his clothes have ripped apart as a result.  The rest of his body was so thick in general, even he had big moobs, which he felt embarrassed by it at first.  He had double chins with the third looking to appear in some way, and Haiden looked like the fattest kid in the world by any means!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but he is way taller than any human being on the planet!  He looked so gigantic, Haiden couldn\u2019t help but feeling so excited in a surprisingly way.  He looked around the scenery, and it looked a lot smaller from his point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!  I never thought I could get this big.  It feels like I\u2019m like...</span></div></div>",

Going in different places for that movie is so tiring, but I\u2019m glad to be home once again.\u201d  Jacob says in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to turn to his side to have some sleep, when there\u2019s this small item been sitting on his bedside cabinet.  It looked like a small box that would get some jewellery in some kind.  Jacob looked confused as to where it came from, and why it\u2019s been sitting there while he was away.  Whatever the case, he was getting curious and decides to check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up on his bed and picked it up to have a closer look, before he would open to see what it was.  It was a ring it seems, but there was a note inside of it.  So he would unfold the small paper and read what it says in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Jacob, I would like to first of all congratulate on your very successful movie recently.  I\u2019m a big fan of yours, so I wanna give you this gift that is very extraordinary.  With this ring, you\u2019ll be able to grant as many wishes as you can, and I hope you\u2019ll enjoy the gift since you\u2019ve deserve it a lot.\u201d  Jacob read the letter from a fan about the ring itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting!  Let\u2019s hope if that\u2019s the real one I wanna try it out.\u201d  Jacob was getting curious even more, when he would take the ring and slip it into his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt fits so well, and that\u2019s the first part he would satisfy with that.  The second part is trying to make a wish, which he may have tons of stuff to wish.  Of course he can only wonder if it really works from what it actually says.  So Jacob shrugged and decides to make a wish to try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I was... </span></div></div>",

It\u2019s well worth it to spend some time outside when it is a very sunny day for all.  Everything seems to be normal by any means, but that all changed so unexpectedly, when they hear that thundering noise and the quakes that are coming within its distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople were left stunned and confused as it\u2019s never happened to this place before.  Many reacted earthquake, others fear for the worst, but that\u2019s when they spotted a obese gigantic child celebrity that is Jacob Tremblay, people were left screaming and started to run away from a very confident looking kid.  Some stay and stare in awe, as his fattening frame jiggled in each step and stood on the sand to take a look at the scene itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!  Nothing more than a nice view looking towards the ocean.  Marlon\u2019s right though, being bigger is certainly much better!\u201d  Jacob makes a sign in satisfaction, and placed his hands on his wider hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has everything to himself, and can do things whatever he wants at the beach.  Even more so when he heard the helicopter being flying around his bottom-heavy body for quite a while now.  So he would turn his head to the chopper, and smiled over to see a couple of people inside, looking a lot nervous and concerned, unlike Jacob when he greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there!  Do you like what you\u2019re seeing right now?\u201d  Jacob wondered, knowing he saw them admiring the look of his obese body, despite being gigantic as well.  \u201cHow about if I can make a pose for you just now, if you want me to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he didn\u2019t make them a choice, as Jacob would do it straight away, by taking a seat on the sandy beach.  He should\u2019ve looked before he sat down, cause he didn\u2019t realised that there\u2019s some number of people still their its spot, when they got sat on by that fat gigantic rump of a child actor indeed.  The sand had sprayed everywhere when his ass made a hard landing to say the least, making a sandstorm from everyone\u2019s point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then behind to lie down, and facing towards the tiny chopper by giving some poses from its position, smiling so proudly as if being massive is so much fun than being normal sized to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like what I\u2019m posing you right now?\u201d  Jacob wondered with that smirk look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe can see the chopper flying around, and even getting closer to him, and that\u2019s when he see\u2019s two cameras taking a shot at him, which made Jacob had an idea to make things interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you want, you can watch me jiggle my fat _____ for everybody to see!\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was something he always wanted to do, so with no school on a weekend, it may be good to go out and take it all in.  He would do this every weekend, just so he doesn\u2019t want to get bored by any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Today is gonna be so much different than he thinks, as he was walking through the streets and realised there\u2019s a magic shop that just opened recently.  He heard that it was a good place to go to, and even he heard that the magic is all too real!  That\u2019s when he was getting a bit curious for a moment, and so he would shrugged it off, and decides to head inside and see what\u2019s all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are so many props when Tobias went in to take a look.  Lots of books, potions, and other magical items the shop has in there.  You were so amazed by this, you were completely unaware about the shopkeeper, who is actually standing behind the counter when he spoke out in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, young man!  How can I help you?\u201d  The shopkeeper asked with a greeting, which made Tobias jumped from all the sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hi there!  Sorry, I didn\u2019t see you there!  I\u2019m just pretty curious about some stuff you\u2019ve got in there.\u201d  Tobias blushed with an apology, and came over to meet the shopkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it!  People are like that y\u2019know, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re be in shock when they realised my magic is real indeed.\u201d  The shopkeeper chuckled, letting the youngster know about all the items he\u2019s willing to sell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...\u201d  Tobias begins his thoughts for a bit, and if the shopkeeper says it was true, he\u2019ll be hoping this can be true by witnessing it himself.  He let\u2019s out with a smile and asked the shopkeeper on what he wants.  \u201cSay, can I get myself...</span></div></div>",

They were going to the Laboratory to have a guided tour of all the rooms and machines these scientist made and testing out some experiments.  They\u2019re all seem to be delighted, expect just one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one is a 12 year old boy named Tobias!  He\u2019s the oldest in the class, and he wouldn\u2019t want to be hanging around with students much younger than him.  In fact, his best friends are a higher grade up than him, due to the age the school only clarifies in such a way.  The fact that he had been forced to go on the trip like this, he would find this boring, and uninterested to see all this stuff, whilst he has the whole day to get around the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it came to the day, and everybody is off the bus and headed inside the Laboratory.  They were all greeted by a scientist, who also acts as a guide tour, so he wanted to make every student safe and get as close as they can for health and safety reasons.  Thankfully, it went smoothly as they able to get through the premises and other machines the workers are doing, much to Tobias\u2019 bored expression says it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours in, and it was only halfway through the tour.  Everybody was in the dining room for some lunch, but Tobias\u2019 expression hasn\u2019t been changed since he got here, and he simply wanted to get away from those \u2018little\u2019 group as quickly as possible.  Luckily, nobody was watching him, so he sneaks away from the table and tip toes out of the dining room very quietly, until he was perfectly safe and on his own in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew!  I\u2019m glad nobody saw getting the dodge out of this mess.  I need to find a way out and fast!  Tobias says as he had to look around and tries to find the way out of the Laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building is so huge, it could take a while before he ever finds a way out.  So he tried to look around the rooms without being seen, and that is until he spotted something that came to his view.  For some reason, he seems to be curious about this, and walked up towards...</span></div></div>",
