The vacation was now a little over half way through, Jake had been living well. A long break from basket ball, no working out and eating whatever, whenever he had pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was having the summer of his life, and it was beginning to show, he had put on a \"little\" weight. He had no idea how much, but he definitely noticed it was there, his previously flat stomach was soft and rounded out, hanging over his waistbands and jiggling slightly when he walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake grunted as he rolled onto his side to shut off his alarm clock. \"Fuck\" he thought as he raised his arms up over his head, \"this is way too early.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared up at the ceiling and put his hand on his belly, he rubbed it and gave it a slight jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I guess I'mma have to get up if I want to do something about this\" he groaned to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled onto his side again and out of the bed, he hit the ground with a louder thud than a few months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wearing nothing but a pair of loose, light blue boxer shorts. His stomach hung over the waistband and wobbled slightly with each step he took, his arms and legs were still relatively toned in comparison.</span></div></div>",

Dad?\" Jake yelled, \"Rosa?\" (Rosa was the housekeeper).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet, I have the place to myself.\" said Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went into the kitchen, and opened the fridge doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 Eggs, 8 strips of bacon, 5 sausages, and a big stack of pancakes with butter and syrup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sat down at a stool by the bench, as he sat down his stomach folded over and sat out on his lap slightly, he poured a large glass of chocolate milk and dug into his breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin ten minutes it was  all gone, he sat back in his stool and gave his full belly a pat, he sat for another 10 minutes to let it all digest before sliding his butt off the stool, still with his hand on his belly before slowly walking up the stairs to his bedroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He parked his truck and walked inside the house, still feeling incredibly bloated from his omlette and pancake feast at the IHOP. He let out a small burp as he closed the front door behind him and climbed the stairs, absent mindedly rubbing his overstuffed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...I am stuffed,\" Jake groaned as he walked into his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the time and saw it was still early. He knew he should probably make his way to the gym and start a new workout routine, but right now he just wanted to have a rest and let some of this food digest. He crossed the room and looked at his reflection in the mirror, surprised by how much his belly was sticking out. Curiously, he pulled his top off over his head and tossed it aside, revealing his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoaaaaaa!\" Jake laughed as he set eyes upon his bloated belly. \"I think I might have overdone it a little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake poked a finger into his belly and found it was tight as a drum, stuffed full of food. He gave it a gentle rub while he admired his handiwork, a little shocked by just how bloated he looked. When he turned to the side, he looked pregnant! But Jake just laughed and gave his belly a satisfied pat. He would have to do something about this at the gym before he started putting on weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a loud yawn and stretched his arms above his head. That meal had really taken it out of him, and he suddenly felt like lying down. He walked to his bed and collapsed onto his back, massaging the sides of his expanded belly as he began to drift off to sleep. He smirked as he looked down at his bulging stomach, which blocked the view of his feet. \"Gotta cut down, looks like I've swallowed a balloon...heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Jake's food exhaustion had sent him to sleep once again. He lay on his back, his hands resting on his bloated stomach, his belly rising and falling as he slept. </span></div></div>",

This was his day to get back in shape. When he arrived at the gym he was relieved that there weren't many people there. Jake hated the days when the gym was crowded. It made him feel self-conscious around all those other guys who could bench press him with a pinky, and today would be worse with his new belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climbed on a treadmill and started jogging to warm up. He noticed that his belly jiggled every time his feet hit the ground and smirked. \"That's why I'm here, after all\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of his eye Jake saw one of the few guys there. He was about Jake's hight and age if he had to guess, had blond hair and looked pretty toned. He was lifting some weights, accentuating his sculpted biceps.

You're gonna make me feel bad.\" Jake said, laughing and trying not to stare at Howard's bicep too much. It was a pretty nice arm... both of his arms were nice, and now that they were walking together Jake could tell Howard had a fantastic butt too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, you don't have to feel bad. Like I said, a little extra looks good on you...\" As Howard says this the two walk through the doors of the pizzeria. \"Speaking of, you grab us a seat and I'll get the grub.\" Jake complied, grabbing a booth in the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sat down, poking at his belly. Did it really look good on him? He'd never really thought that anything fat could be good. I mean, that IS what he was told growing up. Muscle looks good, right? It looks good on Howard. Jake looked over at Howard and imagined him with a belly on top of all that muscle. \"Oh god...\" Jake mumbled. The thought of it was actually... kind of hot! Jake shook his head as Howard came over carrying two large pizzas, setting them down on the table. \"Hold on,\" Jake said. \"You got us that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I can pack away a good amount.\" Howard said, patting his flat stomach. \"And I'll admit I'm curious to see how much you can put away.\" And with that the two boys started eating the first pizza. Over conversation Jake learned that the two boys had a lot in common. Howard was in the same grade as him and they didn't live too far from each other. They liked watching the same types of tv shows and sports and movies and stuff like that. Howard told Jake that he had recently gone through a breakup. When Jake asked why Howard just said they had \"conflicting interests.\" Jake noted that Howard never said \"he\" or \"she\" when referring to his ex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward leaned back and let out a belch. \"Damn, I love stuffing myself after a good workout. Don't you?\" Jake looked down and noticed almost all the pizza was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, time flies. I thought we still had a whole pizza left!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I had 8 slices and you had 10. You think you can finish the other 6?\" Jake pondered the question. He could probably finish a few more... but Howard looked so good with his stomach all bloated up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I'll try.\" He said. Jake finished another slice and started another. Unfortunately, his pants were feeling tight. Each bite was starting to take it's tole. By the time that slice was down Jake's pants felt way too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? Can't you do it?\" Howard said, a disappointing look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, dude, my pants are too tight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So just unbutton them. I don't care.\" Jake was a little surprised and he felt his cheeks heat up. \"Come oooooon! You can do it!\" Howard encouraged. Jake mindlessly fumbled with his pants, unbuttoning them and freeing his belly. With Howard cheering him on, Jake felt obligated and inspired to devour the remaining four slices. He leaned back and sighed, rubbing his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... today was supposed to be my fitness day...\" He lamented. Howard scooted next to him and put a hand on Jake's belly, rubbing it in small circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's that big of a deal...\" He said soothingly. \"I mean, if you're happy then you're happy, and you look pretty happy with 15 slices of pizza in your gut...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake relaxed under Howard's touch. \"Yeah... it's pretty good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your gut looks pretty happy too, haha!\" He chuckled softly, patting Jake's belly. Jake burped, causing them both to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is pretty happy... My belly likes food way too much...\" Jake sighed, suddenly embarrassed to have made a pig of himself in front of this cute guy, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Howard continued, \"We should hang out some time... If that's cool with you. Maybe we could head back to my place or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake responded...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He the hurried off and returned with an ice pack that he put on Jake's head. Jake laid down, one hand clutching the ice pack and the other on his belly. He moaned uncomfortably. Howard pulled a chair up next to him. He watched over Jake as he came to. \"Hey, how're you doing?\" Howard said softly. \"Sorry about that, I guess I got carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake grunted as he turned his head towards Howard. \"I don't feel so... good...\" He then felt something coming up and made a face.

Howard pulled Jake closer and as their eyes fluttered shut they kissed again, tenderly yet without doubt. A rosy hue rose to their cheeks. The hands they the boys held became intertwined by the fingers. And there they stayed, face to face, lips to lips, as if time had come to a stop. It could have been years until their lips parted. Jake's smile was ear to ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" He said, not knowing the words for how he felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... yeah... I told you I think you're cute,\" Howard grinned.

Everything...\" Howard took his hand released it from Jake's, running it along the boy's chest down to the belly. If time were moving at all it was slow enough for Howard to spend lifetimes petting the rounded stomach. Howard rested his hand on Jake's side and felt the pressure of Jake's pudge pressing into him with every deep breath. Jake sighed at the feeling of Howard's hand on his still swollen gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... I guess I'll be even cuter once I get rid of that, huh?\" He laughed, referring to his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said everything.\" Howard responded with a soft smile.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Honestly Jake had never felt more pitiful. He was stuffed to the brim, already too fat to play on the basketball team he was the star of last year, and now he was hopping from restaurant to restaurant binging on fast food. Fortunately the road he was on had several fast food places lined up in a row. He stopped at Burger King and got 2 whoppers and a soda, went to his car where nobody could see and downed those and half an hour later drove to Wendy's and got a few things there. After that was Arby's and then a Friendly's. As Jake binged hot tears rolled down his face. He was such a fat ass, he deserved for his gut to feel like it was going to burst. If his belly stopped hurting he would pound down another burger, a fitting punishment in his mind for letting himself become so disgusting. Once it was late at night Jake drove home and staggered to the bathroom, clutching his gut and groaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhimpering, Jake looked into the mirror. He was definitely a fat ass now, the kind he used to make fun of with his friends when they weren't looking. He had a full double chin, a plush poofy chest and a belly that stuck out and hung over his waistband. His fat poured over the sides of his shorts into juicy love handles. His ass had grown too, jiggling when he jogged. Jake choked back his tears. He smacked his gut angrily and it jiggled a little, although it would have jiggled more if he weren't grossly full. The movement in his gut stirred his insides, letting out a belch. Despite his sadness Jake couldn't help but laugh at his burp. He then let out an even larger, louder belch. Thank goodness his parents weren't home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jake decided to think of the positives. Sure, he wasn't on the basketball team anymore, but the team always took up so much time! Now he could spend more time with his friends who weren't on the team. And yeah he might get made fun of for turning into a fatty but he was always told that anyone who makes fun of him isn't worth his time. And hey, no more worrying about keeping up his image! If he wanted to gorge in public, it's practically the civic duty of the fat kid to do that. Jake was always invited to that burger place his heftier friends go to but turned them down because he had to keep himself slim. He was always the class clown too and fat kids are always funnier. Jake sniffled a little and calmed down. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day at school, as the last class of the day wrapped up, Jake squeezed his plump butt out of his seat and bounded down the hall as fast as his larger frame would allow towards the vending machines where his friends tended to meet. About half way he found himself well out of breath. He leaned against a set of lockers and grabbed his sides. A group of jocks walked by on their way out, and Jake was pretty sure they were laughing at him. He shrugged it off and gave his belly a pat of appreciation. \"It's not that bad...\" Jake thought to himself. \"Maybe if they tried being fat they wouldn't mind it either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll day Jake had been finding new ways to appreciate his fat. For one, the extra padding gave him something to play with when he was bored. Sometimes during boring lectures he found himself playing with a roll of fat between his fingers, pinching and prodding at the softness. Also, he had a lot more room in his gut during lunch, which was awesome since today was pizza day! He was able to down twice as much as he could have before, and the more pizza the better in his opinion! The feeling of a stuffed belly was nice too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute Jake regained his breath and walked, more slowly this time, to his destination where his friends were chatting. \"Hey guys!\" He called out as they looked over to him with quizzical faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends there were Mitch, a tall, lanky blonde boy with angular features, Keith, a chubby (although now slightly smaller than Jake) black boy a few inches shorter than Jake, and Peter, a boy average in height and build with glasses and black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Jake, shouldn't you be at basketball practice?\" Peter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't make the team this year...\" Jake scratched the back of his head, still embarrassed to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say. No more calling me porker, huh?\" Keith poked at Jake's belly, which his shirt only barely covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, when are you gonna his the gym, man? You've really put on a few...\" Mitch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, who cares?\" Jake rolled his eyes. \"Staying in shape was too much work anyways. And it's not like I can't throw a punch anymore!\" He said, punching Keith's shoulder for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does NOT sound like the Jake we know. What made you change your mind?\" Keith said, rubbing his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, maybe I felt sorry for you, tubbs?\" Jake joked. \"But really, I just stopped caring I guess. Call it confidence!\" He put his hands on his sides and puffed out his chest, causing the bottom of his belly to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well... that's good?\" Peter said. \"Well we were about to head over to Big Boy's. You wanna join us now that you have the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now that you have the figure to match.\" Keith added in.  Big Boy's was the local burger joint the guys normally hung out at. Jake had never been there himself, but he heard the food was good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I'm totally hungry anyways!\" Jake grinned. Mitch mumbled something under his breath to Peter, who smirked.</span></div></div>",
