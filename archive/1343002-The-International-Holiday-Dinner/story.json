Her eyes are drawn to the huge buffet table, laden with piles of fruit, several large turkeys and hams, and in the center an entire prize pig, roasted to bubbly perfection.  Not sure she can handle that monstrosity, and a little intimidated at being the first to break into its skin, she gravitates toward the finger food.  She plops a couple of grapes directly into her mouth, and then loads up a small plate with cubed cheese, apple slices with caramel sauce, and her absolute favorite: a deviled egg.  She heads to the punch bowl and pours herself a glass.  Carrying both the plate and glass back to the little stage in the corner, she settles herself in for the party.  The host has graciously provided a small table next to her stool, upon which is already set a pitcher of ice water and a glass.  Meda lays her plate and punch on the table, and picks up the lyre.  With the lyre in her lap, she reaches to the plate and plucks the deviled egg from it, and takes a slow bite, savoring the creamy texture.  She finishes off the egg, and realizing she has forgotten to pick up a napkin, wipes her fingers on her pants.  She looks up to see the first of the guests arriving.  She flexes her fingers and begins to play.</span></div></div>",

Various groups easily make friends with each other, talking, smiling, laughing, gesturing. Seeing the ease with which their children break the ice, the adults, too, start to talk. Soon, the hall is filled with happy sounds, talking, laughing, music - and singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children are singing. Somehow, all of them know the same lyrics and the same tune. None of the adults have heard the song before. They don't know where their children learnt it. But the children sing, completely absorbed in the song, and in dancing to the tune they create. As they sing, they throw coloured hoops to each other. Poet had placed the hoops in one corner of the room, hoping they'd be useful in a game. Instead, they are used to compose the most spectacular dance anyone in the room has ever witnessed - the dance of the children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the children sing and dance in harmony, their colourful clothes flashing and their hands moving in rhythm to keep the hoops swirling in the air, everyone in the room feels a sense of peace, a sense of pure joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Embracing her music, she had presumed the guest would greet the table and partake of the bounty there laid, not her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, Lord Pan, I thank you for your generous praise of my humble attempt at coaxing music from this box of strings.\u201d  Andromeda replied, her discomfiture over the great Pan\u2019s approach superseded by her ire at not noting his arrival.  Her hosts must be important to command a visit from this great an artist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is not the hosts who would command me,\u201d the King of the Faeries answered her unspoken thought.  \u201cIt was the sound of sibilant stars dancing upon this stage.  Your fingers upon the lyre coaxed me here, to hear from close quarters the sweet melody.  But first, I must bring my gift to the table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda watched him walk, no, nearly float, as if on air, to the table heaped with food.  He reached in the pocket of his voluminous overcoat and removed a silver flask, upending its contents into the punchbowl.  He then retrieved a box from his other pocket and untied the ribbon holding it closed to reveal at least a dozen cakes, which he laid at the table, right next to the deviled eggs.  Then, he turned and, with fathomless eyes fixed on hers, returned to stand before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind if I join you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf, of course, not, I would be honored,\u201d Andromeda managed to sound out somehow from her tight throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, let\u2019s welcome the mortals in proper faerie tradition.\u201d  Pan removed his cape and stood at her left, nodding with a smile that belied the mischief resonating from his eyes, perhaps at the effects of the contents of the flask and the cakes.  He produced a flute from the belt holding up his breeches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda begged her shaking fingers to be nimble, or at least not stumble, as she started again the gentle refrain.  Pan smiled and took up the chorus with his flute.  The young dryad the king of the faeries thus greeted the mortals now pushing their way through the door.  They were eager for the bounty of the table, enticed by the music to partake of the feast and wash it down with generous servings of the spiked punch.  It promised to be a gathering to remember for generations to come; not merely international, but inter-stellar!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
