            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Area 11, formerly known as Japan, one of Brittania's many conquered areas used to exemplify its extreme power. Like all of the Areas Area 11 suffered extreme discrimination to its natural citizens. The former Japanese suffered endless abuse from the Brittanians, and many laws bordered on abuse for them and their culture. Of course, due to this rebellion flared, one group in particular stands out among the others; The Black Knights. This one group stood out for many reasons, it didn't settle for mere terrorism it wanted Brittania crushed even if it meant war. Their leader Zero practically defined charisma; he did things that seemed impossible, almost supernatural even, but he did them nonetheless. Perhaps most interesting of all though, was that Zero was in truth the former Brittanian Prince Lelouch Vi Brittania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently the ex-prince was at Ashford Academy, a school he attended under a false name. Despite being a teenager, he used his mind and his Geass to form the greatest threat to Brittania ever. Geass was the secret behind Zero, the power to make people do anything regardless of the situation. Of course such a power has its drawbacks, it grows more powerful and as a result unpredictable at times. The possibility was always there, that this power would develop into something else too, although Lelouch wasn't certain it would even occur. The power might even one day develop into something that turns on Lelouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who blessed Lelouch with such power was his accomplice C.C.. She was a mysterious girl to be sure, often wearing a straightjacket-like outfit and appearing aloof to the world and all its cruelties. C.C. had bright green hair (Natural too no less), that went all the way down to her midback. Rather voluptous curves, (Which Lelouch paid no mind), and obvious wisdom beyond belief. She blessed Lelouch with Geass and is unable to die, making her his greatest ally in his war against Brittania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now Lelouch and C.C. were inside his room at Ashford Academy, Lelouch eagerly working away at Black Knight affairs on his computer and C.C. impatiently awaiting a pizza to come. Lelouch eyed her impatient form with a grimace, \"When it does come you better make sure to eat it in the dining room. I'm tired of having to clean pizza crumbs off of my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turned her head from the door to Lelouch, \"What if someone sees me? You're always yelling at me for being in public sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you always ignore me anyway.\" Lelouch sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. smirked, \"So you <i> are </i> learning after all. Fine, I'll eat in the dining room to make you happy but you owe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give you a place to live, all the pizza you can eat, and even hide you from the police....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. threw her favorite plush toy, the Pizza Hut mascot Cheese-Kun at him; it bounced off with a short squeek, \"I gave you Geass. You owe me.\" Lelouch didn't comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed, wordless for both Lelouch and C.C. a loud doorbell seemed to echo. The two stared at eachother for a moment, before C.C. clicked her tongue. \"Fine..... I'll answer it.\" The girl got up and walked out of the room, her boots clacking on the floor was the only sound Lelouch heard as she went down the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Finally some peace and q-urg!\" Lelouch cringed in agony as his eye seemed to throb in immense pain. It felt like someone had shot Lelouch in his eye it hurt so bad, but...it wasn't a new pain. <i> My...my Geass! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages cycled before Lelouch's mind, images of the world over the many years, images of circumstances experienced by someone else, and most notably, an image of a blonde boy with hair that reached all the way to his feet. Just looking at him Lelouch had the feeling he was staring at someone just like C.C.. He found himself in a pure white void, only him and the boy present within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy smirked, \"So you are the seed of Charles who has strayed from his path. Do you really think yourself worthy of even commanding a single soldier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing his father's name Lelouch instinctively gritted his teeth, \"What do you know about that man!? Who are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone who knows much Little Lelouch.\" The boy cryptically replied, he turned around and seemed to sneer, \"Including the fate of your late Mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch would've jumped at the boy and attacked if he could, but his body seemed locked in place. \"What do you know about my Mother's death?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything. And I will tell you...for a price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch calmed slightly, but still appeared tense, \"What price?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked back with a calm smirk, \"Nothing big, just a sort of...test. A test to see if you are really worthy of the power you possess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch couldn't help but wonder if the boy meant his Geass, the Black Knights, or some other ability, but he replied with a regal calmness. \"And if I undergo this test you will tell me the truth behind my mother's murder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything is possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery possible meaning of that one sentence played in Lelouch's mind and again he found himself swelling with rage, \"You wouldn't tell me even if I underwent this test would you!?\" He was now screaming at this boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet the boy maintained a steady calm, \"No, I said anything is possible. I may tell you, I may not, it depends on how this test plays out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch's mind racked the possibilities, this was his greatest clue to the murder of his mother....but to trust a complete stranger? Every logical part of Lelouch screamed to refuse, but his heart told him to try and find the truth regarding his mother. He looked at the boy with a stern expression, \"I'll do it. Tell me the details of this test of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy appeared slightly surprised, but also amused. \"You'll figure it out in time, but I will tell you one thing. Depending on how things play out, you may very well end up in this test for the rest of your life. It may never end. You may live your life trapped in what may be considered a game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch didn't even falter slightly, \"How am I to ascertain the details of this test then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was answered with a shrug, \"You're smart, you should figure it out. And if you don't then you really don't deserve the knowledge anyway. Even knowing this do you still agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I accept the terms of your pathetic test. And watch me pass it with ease!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy chuckled, \"We shall see....hehe Lelouch we shall see....\" The white void of a world the two were in seemed to blurr, the boy slowly vanishing as Lelouch's pysche left the world. Only to return to the world Lelouch's actual body was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting slightly he opened his eyes, he was on the floor, apparently falling unconcious at some point. But other than that nothing seemed too different, the room seemed off a tad but Lelouch was probably disoriented. He rose to his feet, disappointed nothing happened. \"I swear to god if that was just some hallucination from lack of sleep I-\" He cut himself short as his eyes came to face with something amazing. C.C.'s Cheese-Kun which she had thrown at him before was like a mountain before Lelouch, its form seemed absolutely godly in size, even larger than some buildings. It was then that Lelouch realized why his room seemed off, everything was far too big. The swivel chair Lelouch sat in before rose miles into the sky. The bed seemed to be several thousand feet up, Lelouch had shrunken!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fell to his knees in awe as the reality gripped him, he was a centimeter...no...closer to half a centimeter tall, in a world of people who's stray hairs could crush him. It was so...jaw dropping, just Lelouch somehow managed to regain some form of composure after a few seconds. <i> I need....to think....this is obviously my test...but what I am supposed to do? Trying to survive is too simple, that boy wants me to do something while I'm like this.....but what? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch's thoughts were interrupted by a sound that made his heart stop, his bedroom door was opening. He turned to look at who had entered, hopefully they could help him. It was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(IMPORTANT. Please, for all readers and writers to know keep this in mind. This is taking place during R1!!!)</span></div></div>",

Her ears twitch slightly to every noise in the house as her hair shifted in the wind of the open window. One last glance convinced her that he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green haired girl raised her eyebrows with a grin as her majestic, white, high-heeled boots stormed into the room with a calm tapping noise as her thin nimble fingers put down a open can of coke on the floor by Lelouch\u2019s bed side. C.C let her dripping wet tongue slip out from her tender lips to catch an escaping bead of coke as she wandered around the bed, not noticing a drop of saliva tracing around her chin to meet Lelouch on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Lelouch screamed as C.C stepped over him with a tiny drop of saliva falling over him. \u201cGack\u2026 C.C! Get out of my room! Damn it! Where\u2019s the kid that shrank me?! I\u2019m so going to kick his arse!\u201d Lelouch fumed, rubbing his temple to try and calm himself. \u201cOk\u2026 think Lelouch\u2026 what do I need to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh\u201d C.C said as she opened her moist lips as far as they could stretch to catch a drooping piece of cheese from her pizza slice. Her yellow eyes rolled over towards the window briefly to guide her hand into closing and locking it firmly shut before tossing the pizza box and her slice upon the bed with a dud thud. She let the piece she had in her mouth slide down her throat with a blissful gulp before she reached down and slid off her long boots with a blissful look in her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s better\u2026 \u201c She mumbled once the boots were kicked to one side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh damn\u2026\u201d Lelouch murmured as he waved his arms towards C.C as she quickly rubbed and wiggled her toes, \u201cPlease don\u2019t walk this way\u2026 Please don\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C stood up tall, gazing around the room one last time before wandering forward. She cleared her throat and swiped back her luscious hair as she traced the tip of her fingers over the corner of the bed. She stepped over her little pizza hut plushie straight onto Lelouch\u2019s tiny body before moving the pizza onto the floor next to her drink. She hopped onto the bed, her ears pricked to the sound of the bed springs giving way to her weight.<br>\r\n\u201cLelouch wouldn\u2019t mind me crashing here\u201d C.C spoke with a smirk as her toes playfully peeled off her white socks. Her hand meanwhile drifted blindly down for her slice of pizza as she gazed aimlessly towards the ceiling. Her fingers prodded the wooden floor first, before delicately probing towards a floor mat Lelouch had put down. Her hand\u2019s brushed over Lelouch briefly before snatching up a pizza slice to dangle over her head as she sat up with her feet crossed yet her knees bent. Her hand slowly grinded into the poor pillow as the springs of the mattress creaked to her adjusting weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch\u2026\u201d Lelouch murmured as he pried himself from the fading imprint C.C left on his floor mat. His head swam in the dark for a second before shaking himself out of it. \u201cOk\u2026 ok\u2026 I really need a plan\u2026 there\u2019s no way that I can go about this so-called \u2018test\u2019 headfirst all the time\u2026 C.2 almost killed me even though it was an accident\u2026\u201d Lelouch looked around, trying to come up with inspiration as C.C\u2019s socks finally fell from her feet to wind up on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 Minutes slowly tick by as Lelouch thinks up a plan.<br>\r\n\u201cIt might not be great\u2026\u201d Lelouch murmured \u201cBut it\u2019s the best I have\u2026 I can either attempt to climb onto my bed and try to get C.C\u2019s attention\u2026 \u201c Lelouch groaned as he gazed upwards towards the edge of the creaking bed. \u201cOr I can get a lift on a pizza slice\u2026 I\u2019ll just jump off at the top\u2026 or it might end up like bungie jumping with all the string cheese\u2026 and C.C loves to catch the stringy bits on her tongue\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://neoshinka.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/code-geass_-pizza_-cc_400.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://neoshinka.files.wordpress.com/200...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m sure she would notice me then though\u2026 who wouldn\u2019t?\u201d Lelouch tilted his head towards the worn socks on the floor. \u201cNo doubt she\u2019ll wear them again after she\u2019s brushed the crumbs onto my bed\u2026 she would defiantly feel me under her sole if nothing else. Plus she has to look in the socks direction\u2026 right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://daigard123.deviantart.com/art/CC-153074552\" target=\"_blank\">http://daigard123.deviantart.com/art/CC-...</a><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as it pained Lelouch to admit it, he had only one real option he'll wait on C.C.'s socks and pray to god the woman sees her. It was a bit....humiliating but realistically speaking it was the best plan. Lelouch, being physically challenged, did not in any possible way have the physical ability to successfully climb his bed; especially with C.C. moving about on top of it. Trying to work his was onto a slice of pizza could happen but it was too likely Lelouch would get stuck, and then get a one way trip to C.C.'s mouth; plus the grease would really agitate him. While his pride seemed to despise the idea Lelouch began walking towards C.C's discarded socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting there was little problem, C.C. always took extra time to fully enjoy her pizza so Lelouch easily had half an hour; so even at his size of..perhaps half a centimeter tall he had the luxury of walking to his destination and still arriving with time to spare. Give or take a minute Lelouch had ten minutes to think things through, so he sat himself on the heap of cloth known as C.C.'s sock and began to think. To the side Lelouch could see C.C. lift up the last slice of her pizza, meaning not much waiting left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch really prayed his plan worked, not only because it would mean he would still be in direct danger but also C.C.'s sock smelled, and her feet did, and her boots probably did, and Lelouch did not want to have to keep tolerating it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> God that woman is stubborn/ </i> Lelouch thought with a grimace, before this ordeal he once had the...\"pleasure\" of experiencing this odor, and immediately he began making preparations to buy C.C. several pairs of shoes and socks. But the girl was too stubborn to wear them. She wore only the boots and socks Lelouch found her with, always claiming they were broken in perfectly. They were comfortable Lelouch was sure but...the odor...he really prayed never to experience it again. As such this made his current predicament even worse. At his size the odor around Lelouch had intensified to the point he could practically see it, and the spongy sweat soaked cloth he sat on did little to help. But with discipline Lelouch managed to block it out and refocus on his situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat mysterious boy...he said this was a test, but a test of what? Survival would be obvious, in fact <i> too obvious </i> , Lelouch's test had to be something aside from that...but what? He had to figure out soon, lest he spend the rest of his life the size of a speck of dirt. Lelouch shuddered at the idea and thought everything over. What was he supposed to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. thoroughly enjoyed nippling away at her pizza; god it tasted so good...sometimes she wished she was the size of an ant in a box of the stuff....she would happily live her life on a slice. Sadly, all good things had to come to an end and with a final bite the enjoyment from the pizza ended. C.C. didn't bother moving for a moment, just relishing the faint taste lingering in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed supporting her was comfortable, and with the pizza crumbs on it, it was even moreso. But when Lelouch returns he would yell about it all...why couldn't he just love pizza? A sudden chill in the air made goosebumps break out along C.C.'s delicate skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's another thing, why does he have to have the air conditioning set so low I can see my breath? If that damn thermostat didn't need a password I'd be much happier...maybe I'll bring it up when Lelouch gets back. </i> C.C. eyed herself with bored eyes, \"Guess I better put something on my feet before I catch a cold.\" Not even looking to the side of the bed C.C. groped for her socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen C.C. said that sentence Lelouch braced himself. Faint booms came from C.C.'s fingers as they ran along the floor, soon grasping her sock. With no delay she lifted it and Lelouch up, it was a miracle he managed to hold on; but somehow he did. His hands held the opening of C.C.'s sock as his voice tried to scream to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C.C.! You witch look at me! I'm right here! C.C.!!\" As expected C.C. didn't hear him, nor was she expected to but Lelouch had to try. He tightened his hands further as the giantess gave her sock one firm shake to straighten it out. Her eyes still barely gave her sock a glance as her left foot rose into the air. Lelouch turned slightly green at the sight, C.C.'s foot was soft and delicate and all but it was also decorated in an assortment of pizza crumbs and dirt; the troublesome girl found bathing more than once a week a \"Pain\" and as a result...build up on her foot occured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God she better see me....\" Lelouch did not want to join the toejam he saw anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly C.C. began to edge her toes into her sock, and Lelouch gave one last bellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C.C.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. paused, her face bearing an odd expression.... </span></div></div>",

She shook her head gentally before giving a quick examination of her grimy sock. Her foot fell gracefully to the ground as she rose the sock to her nose, scrunching it in her hand like a stress ball, tieing lelouch up in the fibers of her sock. She gave a quick sniff,<br>\r\n\"Gack! I realy need to throw this in the wash sometime...\" Her nose wrinkles as she moved the sock away violently. Her mind ticked over lazyness, \"Well.. I can't smell it if its down there..\" Her shoulders raised and fell as she looked at the sock, then her boot with uncaring eyes. With a simple toss of her head, she flicked her hair to one side before wiggling her toes into the sock opening, steamroling over lelouches miniscule form as her freezing cold toes subconciously wrapped around lelouches warm body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTormented, humiliated and gasping for air, even before C.C had put on her sock, Lelouch knew he wouldn't survive the day in this new, foul prison.<br>\r\n\"C.C!

Her hands whisked it away as she slid her other foot under the bed. Without much care, she slid her foot into the sock while wondering what else she could do.<br>\r\n\"Another pizza would be nice...\" She spoke heavenly, standing up atop of Lelouch as she shut her eyes and stretched her arms high in the air. She let out a releaved sigh as she wandered forward, rubbing her eyes as she knocked the phone out of the reciever and started to place an order. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of all the people to enter Lelouch's room in his situation...it had to be <i>her;</i> Milly Ashford. the blonde, sexy school girl that practically ran Ashford Academy. It wasn't that Milly was a bad person or anything, it was just...Milly wasn't exactly a safe person to be around either. Most people prioritized school, friends, those sort of things, Milly made fun her Number One priority. It didn't matter how grave the situation, how serious things were, Milly always had an attitude that was far too carefree. In fact, the only time this ever changed was if someone she cared about was in life threatening trouble, which was not the current case technically speaking. Put simply, she was the worst possible person to arrive at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch felt the horror show itself on his face as the giantess strode in with a sexy stride, her black socks gently patting the floor with an almost...alluring rhythm. Wearing the typical Ashford girl uniform Milly laid a hand on her hip, \"Now where is that man? I wanted to have some fun.\" Milly impatiently tapped her toes before Lelouch, casting a shadow over him with each toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in the grave situation where Milly's toes could crush him, Lelouch couldn't stop his eyes from trailing along Milly's gigantic, and overall stunning, body. The tightly fitting ankle socks that led up to her well toned calves...then her amazing thighs, and of course the miniskirt Lelouch could see up, and the girl's face was obscured by her large breasts. Even though the situation was as bad as humanly possible, Lelouch couldn't help but feel a tad aroused. Milly was beautiful after all, and in her current size...Lelouch's teenage hormones were working against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Milly's toes nearly crushed the fallen prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a special movement or anything that caused it; Milly just slid the ball of her foot forward a couple inches, and with Lelouch distracted, he didn't notice it. Then she began tapping her toes again, one grazing Lelouch, the other nearly landing right on him. If Milly's second toe hadn't alerted the youth, he would've likely ended up beneath Milly's big toe at that moment, possibly even dying from it. But Lelouch did realize it, and managed to leap away in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Focus! This is no time to be a normal teenager! Milly is giant, and I need to get her attention. Even if she acts like...Milly it's better than risking my life down here!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, easier said than done...<i>much</i> easier. Lelouch was smaller than a toe, Milly was not. For Lelouch to get her attention it would be like an ant attempting to get her attention. No easy feat, especially considering Lelouch had ZERO physical skills. He tried with an obvious approach, screaming for Milly's attention. But like an ant's noises, Lelouch's weren't even close to being heard. What to do what to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lelouch tried planning something out Milly sat herself right on his bed, stretching her legs out. \"Aww...I guess I'll have to play with someone else...but who? Shirley and Nina are in class. Rivalz is out gambling and Nunnally is no fun...Wah! Where is Lelouch when you need him?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch stared bewildered as Milly's feet rose through the air to the floor back and forth in the simplest of motions. Nothing could really describe it, the fluidness of the motions...even Knightmare's could achieve such a thing at their size, and Milly was doing it at over a dozen times that! The wiggling of her toes, the movements of her legs...with Milly's gigantic size it seemed almost...fascinating. Scientists always tried to achieve that type of movement with Knightmares, and yet they could never achieve it, and here Lelouch was witnessing a mile-high school girl perform what scientists failed to do for years. At his size every motion stood out, and Lelouch was amazed by the complexity of it all. He was smart and everything but he never truly grasped the complexity of the human body, even with Milly's simple motions it seemed amazing. He took mental notes to try and talk to Rakshata about later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Milly planted her feet on the ground, gently rubbing the socks against the wooden floors. She was silent in thought, as was Lelouch, and seeing Milly's feet on the floor gave him an idea...a very...very...nausiating idea. How did bugs get a persons attention? Biting them. So if Lelouch were really the size of a bug...then the same principal would apply right? Lelouch nervously approached Milly's shifting foot. His plan was great in theory but the socks could pose a problem...what if his teeth didn't sink in deep enough? Lelouch basically would have bitten a sock for nothing; and the taste of feet was not something he wanted to experience without need. Lelouch took a deep breath, and waited for his chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that exact moment Milly stopped her foot's movement for a moment, and Lelouch took his chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith comically slow running, Lelouch approached Milly's left foot. Before anything could go wrong or he overthought it, Lelouch leaped up and sank his teeth deep into Milly's sock. For a second it seemed as if his plan would work, Lelouch's teeth went deeper in than expected, and soon they even broke through to the other side. The taste would be one that would haunt the young prince for all his life, the saltiness of sweat, a dirt taste from walking around, and the bad taste of cloth in his mouth, all together it...was horrifying to say the least. And it almost seemed worth it when Lelouch was on the verge of breaking through and achieving his motive, but just as his teeth neared Milly's foot, Lelouch couldn't push any further. To be frank, it was amazing his teeth went through all of Milly's sock; but it didn't matter. Because it didn't work. The prince yanked his mouth out with disappointment and looked at what he managed to do, make a small hole in Milly's sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then something unexpected happened, Milly began tapping her toes again. That much was no big deal, but the subtle motions of her foot in doing so...they were making the hole Lelouch made bigger! Soon it became big enough to even fit him! Another idea quickly formed, albeit far more reckless. Lelouch could jump in and bite Milly's foot point blank, but this risked him ending up <i>in</i> that sock, or worse...Milly thinking he liked her feet...ugh.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nNothing left to lose...</i>Lelouch sighed and plunged in headfirst. His body went in about...halfway before there was no room to go any further, leaving Lelouch's legs humorously dangling from outside Milly's sock with the rest of him inside, face rubbed against Milly's sole. Right away a stale air worked its way into Lelouch's nostril, not really bad...just...stale, with a hint of foot in it. As to be expected in the closed space of a sock, didn't make it any better though. Before Lelouch cowarded out from the smell he bit Milly's foot again, this time drawing a trickle of blood (which oddly, tasted sorta good.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away Milly responded, \"...Ow!\" And the blonde giantess investigated her foot for whatever bit her. \"Where is that bug...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch prayed he would be found.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the midst of a old fashioned Japanese style dojo sat one boy. He looked no more than seventeen or eighteen with curly brown hair and eyes filled with discipline and sadness. He simply sat in the middle of the wooden floor with a sword spread on his lap. He eyed it with what appeared to be a mixture of hatred and nostalgia. This boy...was Suzaku Kururugi, and the blade....was what he had used to murder his father many years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was this day...\" Suzaku muttered sadly, this was the anniversary of the day his father died; and the time when Suzaku never felt more self loathing. Sure, Suzaku was a high ranking Japanese man, a historical figure even in the discrimatory Brittanian society. The Knight of Seven in Brittania's Knights of the Round, Knight to Euphiemia Li Brittania aka the \"Blood Princess\", pilot of the Lancelot, and greatest enemy of Zero. Even so, Suzaku's life was one filled with tragedy. The day he murdered his father. His lover and friend Euphie went down in history as the catalyst of a masscre, and perhaps most harmful of all...his best friend was Zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his grief over Euphie Suzaku hunted down Lelouch who was Zero and captured him, giving him the title Knight of Seven. But even so...Suzaku has on multiple occasions shown remorse for such a deed. Lelouch cursed him with a command...to live...and against his will Suzaku had to obey. It was the power of Geass, the same power Lelouch used to become Zero...the same power he used to make Euphie cause a massacre. Suzaku cursed his fate, his cursed life, but because of Lelouch he couldn't end the misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzaku stopped dwelling on it all though and went to place the blade in a shrine to the side attributed to his father. He placed the blade before a picture of the stern faced man and rose to his feet. With a bow Suzaku turned and left. Right at the door, the Knight of Six, Anya, with her apathetic expression, was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suzaku...is everything okay?\" She asked in what seemed to be concern but with Anya there was no tone or expression to make such seem the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzaku's eyes lit up with false happiness, \"Of course Anya! What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya boredly handed Suzaku what appeared to be a vial, \"You're a horrible liar. And I came at the request of Earl Asplund to give you this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lloyd?!\" Suzaku asked in shock, ever since becoming a Knight he hadn't seen much of Lloyd. \"What is this supposed to be for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya shrugged, \" Earl Asplund just said it would improve your capabilities within Lancelot. He also mentioned a slight probability of side effects in a nonchalant tone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...sounds like him....\" Suzaku eyed the vial of liquid nervously, \"I sure hope it doesn't turn me green or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya pulled a PDA from her pocket and clicked a button, \"Saved, if you do turn green call me so I can record it as well...\" With no farewell or anything Anya turned and left. Suzaku eyed the vial with disdain, half tempted to get rid of it but he gulped it all down as soon as possible. Almost immediately later Suzaku fell unconcious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that Suzaku remembered after that was getting up, Lloyd's little concoction had knocked him out. But soon after rising Suzaku gasped, for two reasons. One; Suzaku was completely naked. And Two; his clothes were right before him...about a thousand sizes too big. Somehow, Lloyd's drug had caused him to shrink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to kill that man...\" Was all he muttered before a guest came in....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even miles away from the door Suzaku could clearly hear the booms of something massive approaching. Judging from the rhythm it was...a person...walking...no running towards....the training area Suzaku was in right now? He used his sense of hearing to clarify and he was correct; someone was coming. Suzaku's mind reeled at the possibilities of who it could be, a Knight of the Round...maybe a member of the royal family...possibly even a terrorist; none of these possibilities seemed particularly good. Suzaku got along with his fellow Knights but...they weren't the kind of people he would want to be around in his current state; Royalty was more or less the same way. A bunch of high level people used to being waded on hand and foot by servants, throwing a shrunken Suzaku into the mix was not a good idea, not at all. As for terrorists....well it kind of spoke for itself. Thankfully when the approaching person actually entered Suzaku was relieved to say the least. It wasn't a Knight, Royalty or a terrorist, it was Cecile Croomy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a regular army uniform as she entered, her eyes scanning the entire room for something; probably Suzaku. Her eyes quickly locked onto his clothing on the ground, and she ran to it. About a foot away from it Cecile stopped and knelt on her knee; eyes scanning furiously at the ground. \"Am I too late?\" Her worried voice boomed. The humongous blue eyes frantically moved about until they found their target; Suzaku waving his arms around for help. Suzaku's perspective on this was obviously quite different. When Cecile entered he was just...awestruck. She was always beautiful, Suzaku knew this but at the current size it had transcended beyond belief; the only woman who had done that for Suzaku himself was Euphie, and she was dead. Awe wasn't all he felt though, he was happy; Cecile was probably the most pure of heart person who could've found him and now that she was here he knew he had to get her attention. So hid did the only thing his size would've allowed to even remotely worked, he jumped around and screamed for the giantess' attention. When she came forward her army boots stopped just before him, and Suzaku was awestruck yet again by the mere size, he had to be smaller than one of the giantess' toes! If she just moved her foot a little bit...he would be a goner. Thankfully she found him in about a minute and death was no longer an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile spoke with a soft whisper, much better than the deafening boom of her regular voice. \"Suzaku...is that you? Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn contrast to Cecile lowering her voice Suzaku had to raise his to the limits. \"Yeah Miss Cecile! I took that drug Lloyd sent me and...this happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile bit her lip and gasped, \"I was afraid of that. Lloyd...well he got a few items sent out at the same time. And...they got mixed up. You got a vial of experimental shrinking serum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe malice arising from Suzaku was almost visible, \"That man will die.....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile nervously laughed, \"I'm sure he deserves it but...you know him. Just leave it to me Suzaku. I'll make sure he learns his lesson later.\" The boy seemed to calm down, at least slightly. \"Okay, but what about my situation? I can't exactly handle the Lancelot like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess didn't look even slightly worried. \"Me and Lloyd will fix you don't worry. If anything Lloyd won't let you get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he doesn't wanna lose his guinea pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said he had pure motives. \" Cecile laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzaku laughed a bit too, \"So, is there a cure Miss Cecile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this question that made the giantess tense herself, a nervous bite of her lip brought fear and paranoia to Suzaku as well. Cecile didn't worry for nothing, she always had good reasons and if she appeared worried...it must've been bad. \"Well....there <i> might </i> be. As I said it was an experimental serum that shrunk you. An antidote or a reversal process has yet to be created but if me and Lloyd put our minds to it we can find the cure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" <i> IF </i> there is one.\" The little Knight finished for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile nodded, \"Yes....but Suzaku I swear on my life that if this is irreversable Lloyd will pay....\" The kind girl grew a scary expression, almost resembling a monster; but she looked at Suzaku again in her kind motherly face. \"Sorry you saw that. I sometimes let my darker side come out when it comes to Lloyd.\" Suzaku was speechless in fear. Cecile nervously giggled, \"Well worst case scenario I do like to play with dolls.\" Suzaku somehow found a way to be even silenter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment he could speak though, \"So...um. Miss Cecile? What should we do now? I sort of wanted to finish my training before doing anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess looked surprised, \"Training? Even though you've shrunken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzaku shrugged, \"Might as well. Nothing can be done now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile was silent for a moment, \"Well Suzaku....</span></div></div>",

You can\u2019t do anything too dangerous when a single step could kill you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzaku scratched the back of his head, \u201cWell I kind of need something dangerous to really train. It helps motivate me. And anything that isn\u2019t heavy for weights won\u2019t do any help either. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s something out there super heavy but soft as a pillow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile tilted her head for a moment to think. \u201cActually\u2026there might be.\u201d She stood back up and walked towards the shrine Suzaku had of his father. Briefly Cecile gazed at it with a clear sad expression but she shook her head and began to undo some of the buttons of her military shirt. Until it clicked Suzaku just watched with a confused look, then it hit him- Cecile was taking off her shirt! Immediately the little guy got flustered and flailed his arms until his eyes were properly covered. On the other side of the room Cecile turned to look at him and laughed, \u201cWhy are you so nervous Suzaku?\u201d Suzaku fumbled his lips around struggling to find words when finally his fingers parted and he dared to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile stood at the other side of the room with her hands at her hips. She was still wearing a shirt but instead of the standard Brittanian uniform it was a revealing white, spaghetti-strap top. At some point she also removed her boots too, leaving her feet bare but the brown army skirt still remained. The giantess shuffled her feet before beginning to walk towards Suzaku, each step sending out tremors. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think I was getting naked did you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steps stopped just short of Suzaku and once more he found himself struggling to form words. The current situation put him into an entirely different mindset and all he could think about was how beautiful his gigantic friend was. He noticed the dark blue bra straps that were longer than the straps to her shirt. He saw how her chest jutted out to a size that rivaled even Kallen\u2019s. He was able to see right up her skirt to the matching dark blue panties. And on either side of him were two admittedly cute feet that lead up to towering legs that were well-built and silky smooth even to his shrunken eyes. \u201cW-Well I mean\u2026It did look like you were taking your shirt off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile\u2019s eyes narrowed playfully, \u201cIf anyone else was in this situation I\u2019d probably step on them for being a pervert.\u201d As if to demonstrate the giantess raised her left foot and flexed her toes in Suzaku\u2019s face. It left him with the odd realization her toes were painted to match her hair. \u201c\u2026But I know you\u2019re not like that.\u201d She giggled and knelt back so her chest before Suzaku. To the poor Japanese soldier all he could notice was how close Cecile\u2019s cleavage was to coming out of her shirt. \u201cI just wanted to get a bit more comfortable to help with your training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh yeah\u2026\u201d Suzaku felt his face beginning to cool off at last. \u201cI still need weights if I want to do what I usually do. But if not I can figure something else out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that Suzaku. I already figured out what you can use as a weight. Something perfectly safe- like you said, heavy but soft as a pillow.\u201d<br>\r\nIt instantly fit into place. \u201cOh duh, a pillow! At my size that might be perfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile smiled, \u201cNot quite. I thought that for a second too but finding a pillow might take a little while so I came up with something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess averted her gaze with a slight blush, \u201cLet\u2019s just say you\u2019ve been looking at them the whole time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redness of the shrunken man\u2019s face returned full storm as he stared directly at Cecile\u2019s breasts. Nothing more needed to be said. The perverted thoughts took over anyway; all Suzaku could think about was how\u2026<i>big</i> they were. In comparison to his size a nipple would be as big as him. So compared to the entire breast it was somewhere around fifty to a hundred times his size. True to what Cecile said though it would be as soft as can be. But\u2026\u201dI-I can\u2019t do that Miss Cecile! That would be just-just-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust fine.\u201d The woman finished. \u201cI can\u2019t use any other body part because there\u2019s a chance I might sneeze or something and it could be dangerous. This way no matter what it\u2019d be soft enough to ensure your safety. Besides, it\u2019s my idea so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to get mad or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut still! It\u2019d be too\u2026awkward!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile shifted herself to all fours and loomed her chest above Suzaku, her face a deep red the entire time. \u201cJust think of it\u2026like a new type of training.\u201d There was a small laugh and before Suzaku could comment Cecile brought her chest down to the Brittanian. Out of instinct Suzaku fell to his back and braced himself to catch the mountain he had no hope of escaping. In a split second he went from standing in embarrassment to holding up one of Cecile\u2019s breasts in embarrassment. Surprisingly the weight in relation to his size was pretty ideal, Suzaku struggled to keep it up but it wasn\u2019t an impossible task. Just holding his arms as they were was a good exercise in itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to suppress any perverted thoughts that entered his mind but\u2026he just couldn\u2019t. Each and every little detail of Cecile\u2019s body began to invade his senses. There was a faint smell of perfume applied hours ago. Out of the corner of his eyes Suzaku spotted a few strands of Cecile\u2019s hair near the floor. Also in the corner of his vision was his friend\u2019s nipple just close enough to tease him. The supple flesh of the endowed giantess seemed to give way to his hands, almost seeming to invite him into its mounds. His fingers could fit into the threads and beyond. Through his palms Suzaku could feel the echoing tremors of Cecile\u2019s heart. Little details no one else would ever notice unless they were as close as he was invaded his mind. No matter how much he tried, Suzaku could not help but acknowledge the beauty of his friend right now. All he could do was hold up her bosom until he felt his workout was satisfactory, he couldn\u2019t exactly bench something this soft and he was in no position to move or make demands either. He was pretty much helpless to Cecile\u2019s whims; thankfully she was about as nice as can be but something about that thought really haunted the increasingly perverted mindset he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove a faint giggle could be heard. Cecile\u2019s face was bright red but she found herself enjoying the ran idea she went with. Years of spending time with Lloyd gave her an odd mentality so unusual ideas were usually her first ones. Somehow playing with the shrunken Suzaku had this bizarre, empowering appeal to it; he was struggling to keep one of her breasts from hitting the ground. Someone who was usually so powerful and active was essentially helpless. She had to admit, Cecile found the idea oddly appealing. She had barely moved a muscle since entering this position but with each passing second the idea of spending more time with her shrunken friend seemed more pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, after about ten minutes of this strangely intimate state, Suzaku felt his arms begin to weaken and Cecile noticed it too. Without confirmation from him Cecile raised herself and knelt back down to her previous position. \u201cWow\u2026that was actually kind of nice.\u201d She spouted off without a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzaku began gasping for air to try and calm his young mind down. But he had to agree, \u201cIt was kind of um\u2026awkward but you\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t like it.\u2019\u2019 Cecile gave an uncharacteristic playful wink. \u201cYou lasted ten whole minutes, that\u2019s something to be proud of. You deserve a reward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReward?\u201d Suzaku\u2019s mind fired back into the perverted mindset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her fingers wrapped around Suzaku before anything else could be said. Her own mind was racing after everything, almost without a thought her body acted of its own accord. Suzaku was brought near her lips and then\u2026she gently kissed the young man who fit between two fingers. She pulled him away with a soft smile, but her expression quickly changed to a dismayed look. \u201cOh! I\u2019m sorry! I wasn\u2019t thinking, I just got carried away and-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough Suzaku was acting the same way, apparently he kissed back without realizing it. The two stared at eachother\u2019s frantic actions and seemed to calm down. Everything entered into a eerie silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTraining can get intense.\u201d Suzaku finally muttered after a minute of being dangled in the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah.\u201d Cecile nodded with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say we call it early today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next couple minutes were oddly quiet as Cecile put Suzaku down and put her jacket and boots back on. Gently she plucked Suzaku back up and placed him in her pocket. Considering the recent situation both people blushed but Cecile mumbled, \"I just need to put you somewhere until we find Lloyd.\" Suzaku nodded, convinced, but that sentence sounded almost as if Cecile was trying to convince herself too. Once he was in place Cecile exited and began her search.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For a certain with, all she hungered for was a release to the pointless existence she had found herself living, that and pizza; lots of warm, gooey pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmm, next time no anchovies,\u201d muttered the centuries old C.C. as she took a bite out of her pizza. C.C. was someone that stood out in a crowd with her long, lime green hair, strange tattoo in the middle of her head and cold attitude, but right now as she sat in Lulouch\u2019s room enjoying a pizza, she looked like any normal bored young girl. She was waiting for Lelouch to come back from a mission with his Black Knights. He had taken them to steal some advanced Britannian technology that was being shipped over to Area 11 to help fight off the rebellion. Knowing that they could use whatever their enemies had created, he\u2019d gone to get it first. Honestly though, C.C. hadn\u2019t been listening very closely. As long as she got what she wanted in the end, she didn\u2019t care what her Lulu got up to. All that mattered was him following his end of the deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder if there is anything on,\u201d C.C. yawned as she flipped on the television. A shot of a large aircraft hanger filled the screen and C.C. started paying attention. She hadn\u2019t been listening to Lulouch talk about the mission, but she clearly remembered seeing a picture of the aircraft hanger during his debrief. Curious about what Lulu had gotten up to now, she turned up the volume and listened as a reporter spoke about the incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \u201c\u2026While the Britannian military refuses to comment, it is clear that whatever weapon they were carrying was used against them. I must warn our audience, what you will be seeing might shock you.\u201d </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C severely doubted anything the reporter was going to show her was going to shock her in any way. After living longer then anyone alive, there was nothing C.C. could imagine that could shock her. When the reporter lifted up her hand and showed the camera what she was carrying, C.C. thought the reporter was showing a model of a Knightmare Frame. Then C.C. noticed something tiny crawling out of the model and she nearly dropped her pizza in surprise. It wasn\u2019t a model the reporter was holding, but a real shrunken Knightmare Frame with a real shrunken person. C.C. felt the sudden urge to laugh as she found herself wrong for the first time in a long while. She had been shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \u201cNothing has been confirmed, but it is known that an entire fleet of Knightmare Frames are missing. It is believed that the Area 11 rebellion led by the terrorist outlaw Zero is to be blamed. If anyone has any information about Zero please contact\u2026\u201d </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. shut off the television, no longer needing to hear anything more. If Lelouch was responsible for shrinking that Knightmare Frame and it\u2019s pilot and was also responsible for an entire fleet disappearing then things were about to get very interesting. If Lelouch and his rebellion gained control of something that could shrink objects and people, Britannia was doomed. That kind of power was unheard of, even for the power of the kings couldn\u2019t shrink armies. Lelouch had his rebellion in the bag if he had control of whatever let him shrink things. Soon it seemed, his mission would be over and he could complete his contract to her, giving her the eternal rest she had desired for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoon,\u201d C.C. said as she laid back on Lelouch\u2019s bed and closed her eyes. She was resting before Lelouch returned because she had a strange feeling that things were going to move very quickly once he returned. She\u2019d have to remain cool, no need for him to know how excited she was. She had an image to maintain as a cold, heartless witch, couldn\u2019t let that slip away just because she was excited. She had just gotten down her bored, emotionless expression when she heard the door opening. She turned her head to the side, not bothering to sit up or hide the empty pizza boxes littered around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re home early,\u201d she wearily spoke and opened her eyes. Instead of seeing the annoyed, grumpy face of her personal knight, she saw the barrel of a silver gun pointed at her face. More surprised then frightened, she closed her eyes again and waited to get shot in the face. She really hated getting shot in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no bang from a gun, but rather a swooshing sound like the one a camera makes. C.C. felt funny for a second, it wasn\u2019t the pain of dying she felt, but a tingling that ran right down her body. Opening her eyes again, she sat up suddenly and three things became very obvious. One, she wasn\u2019t hurt, two, she was naked and three, why did everything feel so much better. She stared in front of her, mouth hanging open as she saw her clothes spread out  in front of her on the bed now bigger then a football field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up on unsteady feet, C.C. looked wildly around her, unable to fully comprehend what she saw. The small bedroom she had been in was no more, but a room big enough to fill a whole city surrounded her. Her eyes turned to what were once furniture, but were now enormous structures. C.C. breathed hard as she looked cat the world through the eyes of a bug, her brain unable to make sense of anything. She looked at the pizza she had once been eating and nearly fainted. A slice of pepperoni was now big enough for her to wrap herself in. You\u2019d think seeing her favorite food jumbo sized would make the pizza gobbling girl happy, but it only made her feel sick. She had been shrunken and was now rendered helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at how the mighty have fallen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unforgiving voice boomed above C.C.\u2019s head and she pushed her head far back to see who it was. She trembled as she looked seemingly hundreds of feet up, looking up into the face of the person responsible for her sudden decrease in stature. It was when she recognized the colossal that she truly became afraid. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was impossible for C.C. not to tremble in fear as she looked up at the enormous face of Zero\u2019s right hand woman Kallen Stadtfeld. The half Britannian, half Eleven looked back at C.C. coldly, licking her lips as her eyes went over the tiny green haired girl. C.C. felt very uncomfortable under the giant girl\u2019s gaze and tried to cover her chest and crotch, but she still felt her steely gaze focused on her. Questions raced through C.C.\u2019s mind beyond how she had shrunken. Kallen knew her as an associate of Zero, and as far as C.C. knew Kallen had no idea that Zero and Lelouch were the same person. So why did she look not surprised at all to find her in Lelouch\u2019s room and why was she here in the first place? So many questions raced through C.C.\u2019s mind, but she found herself unable to speak any of them. The towering figure in front of her robbed her of her voice or ability to move. All C.C. could do was stare in awe and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No comeback! No scathing look? No screaming to be turned back to normal? I\u2019m actually disappointed,\u201d Kallen pouted and crossed her arms over her large chest. C.C. broke out of her stupor with a snap, taking a deep breath of air as she regained her composure. She was an ancient being, practically a goddess, she needed to act her part. Narrowing her eyes up at the giantess, C.C. became the dignified, coolheaded witch that she always saw herself as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will return me to normal right away, I demand it!\u201d She forcefully commanded, the power of the kings glowing in her eyes. Kallen snorted disdainfully. While C.C. could be intimidating, right now she just looked like an annoying insect with a squeaky voice. It was honestly funny hearing her try to sound like she had authority, but Kallen wasn\u2019t laughing. This prideful bug was disrespecting her and she couldn\u2019t have her thinking she had any power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s more like it. I thought you were going to start crying for a second,\u201d Kallen coldly chuckled and C.C. tried to remain defiant. Kallen turned her eyes away from the shrunken victim, knowing there was nowhere the bug could go. Moving slowly to the side, she sat her well-rounded bottom down right beside the helpless witch.  C.C. watched Kallen, trying not to become frightened when she saw her bottom come down beside her. The bed shook when she sat down, knocking C.C. off her feet and onto the soft bed. She quickly tried to get back to her feet, trying desperately not to look weak and failing miserably. Eventually getting to her feet, C.C. scrambled towards Kallen a furious look on her normally passive face. Hate and violence she could deal with, but the completely aloof attitude she was getting from Kallen, like she didn\u2019t even exist, was frustrating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think you are doing? Do you know who I am? Return me to normal or else!\u201d C.C. screamed as she slammed her fist into Kallen\u2019s thigh. The giantess barely felt the blow, she did clearly hear the condescending attitude however and that got a reaction from her. Kallen had planned to let the newly shrunken witch get used to her new size before laying down the new ground rules, but the stupid bug didn\u2019t seem to understand her position. Sighing, she reached down for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. nearly screamed when she saw fingers as thick as telephone polls coming towards her. She ducked, which did absolutely nothing, and the giants fingers scooped her up. Hanging on tightly. C.C. was lifted upwards until she was face to face with Kallen. She could see her reflection in Kallen\u2019s bright blue eyes and what she saw made her feel ill. She saw herself as some tiny creature hanging helplessly from someone\u2019s fingers like a piece of rubbish that had gotten stuck. It made her feel disgusting and she looked away, instead turning her eyes to the cold, evil smile of her giant holder. Seeing gleaming teeth bigger then her was no less disturbing to C.C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though she wasn\u2019t freaked out enough, Kallen reached with her free hand for C.C. and pinched one of her legs between her fingers. A cry escaped C.C. when she felt her leg being squeeze tightly between the massive digits. Kallen was being gentle, but to C.C. it felt like her leg was going to be ripped off. Having no patience or sympathy, Kallen lifted C.C. up into the air by her leg, dangling her upside down only a few inches from her face. Screams came from C.C. as she squirmed like a wounded animal in Kallen\u2019s grip. Tiring herself out quickly, she was left panting and her arms hanging out. When Kallen spoke next, C.C. listened to her for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are sad and pathetic. You act so high and mighty when your standing with Zero, but alone and helpless you whine like a bitch. You know what you remind me of, an arrogant Britannian aristocrat, and there\u2019s only one way to deal with your kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen\u2019s negative feelings towards the arrogant Britannians was not news to C.C. Lulouch talked about her distain for the condescending Britannians and C.C. had seen the open hate towards them on Kallen\u2019s face in person. Feeling her fear growing, C.C. calmly asked, \u201cHow do you deal with arrogant Britannian aristocrats?\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen smiled, a cruel, heartless smile that did not make C.C. like her chances of Kallen\u2019s solution being anything good.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stared at the insect sized girl, pondering what methods she should use to get rid of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. was rendered speechless after getting a death sentence from the giant girl. Kallen seemed to know more then she was supposed to, but she seemed unaware that C.C. was immortal. There was nothing on this planet that could kill the centuries old girl, no firearm, blade or bomb could keep her down for good, which stunk because she wanted death. Sick of the world and the people living in it, she wanted the embrace of death, but if this girl thought she could deliver it then she had another thing coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an idea struck C.C., Kallen had shrunk her and maybe that had ridded her of her pesky immortality. Her Geass kept her alive, but maybe now that she was smaller then a baby\u2019s thumb she no longer had her abilities. It was possible, actually, it was very likely. Instead of getting upset at that thought, C.C. felt really good. She wanted to die, the plan had been to give Lelouch her Geass after he finished the whole \u2018liberating the people, discovering his mother's murder and blah, blah, blah\u2019 thing that he had going, but if C.C. could hurry it up by getting this silly girl to kill her, all the better. Sorry Lelouch, you\u2019re on your own now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even going to beg,\u201d Kallen asked curiously. She had expected some kind of reaction, but the completely unbothered look that had appeared on C.C.\u2019s face after being told she was going to de was actually slightly creepy. Kallen wasn\u2019t a cruel, or at least not as cruel as some people, but she had wanted to hear at least a little pleading from the shrunken girl. Bringing the tiny upside down girl closer to her face, Kallen waited for a response, and she got one a moment later; C.C. gave her a pleased smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI very much doubt that you can kill me. Your pathetic,\u201d C.C. taunted. If the girl couldn\u2019t kill her, she was just telling her the truth, but if she could kill her, the insult she had spouted would hurry up the process. C.C. didn\u2019t like her new size, didn\u2019t like how helpless she felt. The sooner she got her wish and died the better. Living as an insect was not something she wanted to go on doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen looked dumbfounded for a few seconds. Hearing the powerless bug insult her and ignore her threat was something that Kallen couldn\u2019t believe she was hearing. Slowly it sank in and she grit her teeth at the bug. \u201cYou cocky bitch,\u201d she spat, actually sending spittle flying at C.C. A look of disgust formed on C.C.\u2019s face as she was sprayed with saliva. Thick drops the size of her head burst against her naked body, dripping down her dangling form until she was soaked. Wiping the thick spit out of her eyes, she glared at Kallen, now pissed off. When was the stupid girl going to get it over and kill her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for, kill me! Or are you scared?\u201d C.C. coolly taunted, hoping to get the giantess to finish what C.C. had started with Lelouch. She wanted Kallen angry enough to kill her quickly. Slow, painful deaths were always bad and if this was going to be the last time C.C. got mortally wounded, she\u2019d prefer it to come without any fuss. It wasn\u2019t as if killing her would be that hard for Kallen, all she needed to do was drop her onto the floor and the fall would probably do it. Staring frostily into Kallen\u2019s eyes, C.C. dared her to make a move. \u201cSo what are you, too pathetic or scared to do the deed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kallen said, gritting her teeth and grabbing C.C. as she dangled from her fingers. Turning the girl right side up, Kallen made sure that C.C. was able to see her properly and not miss anything she was going to say. \u201cThe reason your still alive is because I haven\u2019t exactly decided how to get rid of you. I was thinking I\u2019d flush you down the toilet and let you drown or maybe I should sit down on you and feel your tiny lips kiss my ass before crushing you or maybe I should just treat you like the bug you are and put you in a jar, screw on the top and let you suffocate. How do you want to go, drowning, crushing or suffocation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose fates should have horrified C.C. but after suffering through the various means of execution that the Spanish Inquisition had to offer, there was no death that could frighten her. Still, the thought of being so helpless and pathetic in her last moments of life did send a chill up her spine. It seemed that her death was going to be as messy as possible. Still, she wanted everything to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeechless,\u201d Kallen snidely commented, taking C.C.\u2019s deliberation as fear. Sighing, C.C. closed her eyes, hoping that if she did nothing Kallen would get bored and kill her. Kallen waited for a response, shaking her fist slightly to see if she could get the bug to talk. After getting the silent treatment for several minutes, Kallen huffed in annoyance. The game was over and it was time to end things, she had much better things to do then play with the soon to be forgotten green haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAir rushed past C.C. as moved her hand down. Keeping her eyes closed, the shrunken immortal didn\u2019t open them until she felt the fingers around her loosen and roll her onto a hard surface. When she opened her eyes and saw where she was, a feeling of relief hit C.C. like a ton of brinks. She covered her mouth to keep Kallen from seeing her smile. She was finally going to die, not in a pleasant way, but that didn\u2019t matter. She was happy to be executed, no matter what the method was.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>C.C. lied on her side; staring blankly at a giant, bare foot a few yards from her. Kallen\u2019s foot almost looked like a wall of flesh to the tiny girl. C.C.\u2019s eyes wandered up and down it, looking at her stumpy pinkie toe, which was like a giant boulder to her to her curved heel. It was a fifty times her size and could crush her instantly, which was just what C.C. wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I decided that I wanted your lips as far away from my butt as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling to her back, C.C. jadedly looked up at the giant face of Kallen looming high above her. There was a small smile on her face, not the sadistic smirk she had before, but a much more peaceful and understanding smile. It was like Kallen felt nothing about what she was about to do, no satisfaction or guilt. Somehow, C.C. found that almost insulting. The girl had been positively giddy about destroying her and now she looked like she didn\u2019t care. What was the deal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re going to step on me,\u201d C.C. didn\u2019t ask, but clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much. I really just want to get this over with and get back to something important,\u201d Kallen explained and this time C.C. absolutely felt disrespected. What was so important the Kallen wanted to get to? Did she have some other people she wanted to shrink or was C.C. just a small distraction for her. The idea of Kallen shrinking more people played through C.C.\u2019s mind. With a weapon that could rob people of their size, Kallen might have become the most powerful person in the world. Anyone or anything she wanted could be made small and powerless, it was a power that was nearly godlike. Whatever Kallen had planned must be big, but in the end it mattered little to C.C. because this was the end for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought the best place for you would be under my feet,\u201d Kallen sniffed, lightly moving her feet and nudging the tiny naked girl. \u201cYou know, I really thought this would be more fun. I\u2019ve hated you since the first time I saw you with Zero. You acted so high and mighty, and the way you looked at Zero, it was like you thought you owned him. It disgusted me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C.\u2019s eyes widened as she pieced together the reason for the hostility she was getting from Kallen. She thought the little brat was just on a power trip because she shrunk her, but that wasn\u2019t it at all. This was because of the most common reason that little girls fight, a silly, childish reason that C.C. always found ridiculous. C.C. had almost respected Kallen as a strong woman, but now she only saw her as a schoolgirl with a crush. She started laughing unable to control herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a crush on Zero,\u201d she said between laughter. \u201cThe reason you shrunk me was because you were jealous. You really are pathetic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen became flush as the tiny laughter from the bug\u2019s mouth reached her and then she got angry. Scowling, Kallen lifted up her foot. \u201cThe feelings I have towards Zero aren\u2019t the only reason I have to kill you, but they are the reason doing this feels so good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. stopped laughed as she lied under the giant shadow of Kallen\u2019s foot. The first thing she noticed was how many wrinkles their were on the bottom of her foot, she never really thought about it. The second was how bad Kallen\u2019s feet stank. C.C. had never known a person to have feet that smelled like roses, but the thick aroma coming off of Kallen\u2019s feet made her retch. Breathing through her mouth, C.C. waited for Kallen to stomp her foot down, but instead the giantess slowly lowered her giant foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile you were sitting here, eating pizza, I have been running around all day, helping Zero liberate my home, so I hope you don\u2019t mind if my feet are a little sweaty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. did mind, but she bared through the smell, trying to think of something worse she had smelt during her long years. It was hard to think of anything fouler as Kallen\u2019s foot came closer down on her and the smell got worse. Maybe shrinking made her sense of smell better? C.C. wasn\u2019t sure, but she kept waiting, watching the sole of Kallen\u2019s foot lowering slowly towards her like a pendulum blade. Her sole glistened with sweat and a big drop landed on C.C.\u2019s body. Now covered in sweat and saliva, C.C. felt like she was ready to die now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally,\u201d C.C. grumbled as Kallen\u2019s sole hung inches from her face. She closed her eyes and waited for death, but like life it didn\u2019t come as she expected. Kallen\u2019s sole pushed against her body, covering C.C. in her thick, terrible foot sweat. The smell became suffocating as it became all she could smell. Kallen started applying pressure, but much to C.C.\u2019s horror, she went slow, allowing C.C. to sink slightly into the soft flesh of her sole and hold her there. There was a huge pressure all over C.C.\u2019s body, keeping her from breathing or moving. She thought death wouldn\u2019t come from being crushed, but rather suffocating, but then Kallen relaxed and pushed her foot down. It was barely a twitch, but it crushed every bone in C.C.\u2019s body instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath came suddenly and mercifully to the centuries old witch. No more of the smell of feet, no more pain, just blissful darkness. Her last thought was hope that Lelouch got what he wanted and Kallen, the girl that had given her what she wanted and humiliated her in the process, was shot in the head, twice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To experience death is in itself an unknown feeling. Not one person in known existence can truthfully say they know what it feels like, whether it is painless or pain-filled, long or short, or even if anything happens at all. C.C. was no exception to this rule; she had come so close to death an immeasurable amount of times but just as it came she always revived; such was the nature of her curse, the curse of immortality. What she experienced with each death was actually what many commonly see. The long tunnel with a light at the end, and the light coming in fast. Most people are too terrified or worried to really notice much about it but through continous encounters C.C. had memorized all about it. It started out in the shape of a doorway but as it came closer it also grew, soon becoming nothing but a blinding white light that covered all the darkness. Contrary to belief of some it gave C.C. a sense of warmth and comfort; in fact it was her theory that this meant the feeling was her about to go to heaven...and then her curse kicked in. That wonderful near euphoric feeling would vanish in a heartbeat as pain filled its void. C.C. would awaken to her mortal wounds in complete agony, but unable to die. As her body rapidly heals in seconds she calmly arises and acts as if nothing happened at all, and with the constant deaths even when the wounds are there she rarely actually shrieked in pain. This entire process was not the case here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kallen's massive sole began to lower C.C., for the first time in her cursed life, saw her life flash before her eyes; the life equivalent to ten lives. It had been so long....C.C. couldn't even remember the years she were born in. It was before the colonies....around the medieval era....but she couldn't place a date. Most of the faces she always remembered as blurrs were now crystal clear. Her friends, her proposers, the witch who cursed her in order to escape it herself...it all played out. C.C. was never one for nostalgia (Or many other emotions for that matter) but seeing all this again....it brought the feeling back in full force. She was the witch who endured time, yet no one had touched her quite like Lelouch did. Ah...Lelouch...just thinking of his name brought visions of him. She never would've admitted it to most but Lelouch....he revived the old witch's heart and brought humanity back into her soul. She probably even loved him but with her old being she couldn't tell. But it didn't matter anyway, the two were far too different. C.C. was a witch who craved death and he was a power hungry boy bent on revenge...C.C. gave him the means to fight, nothing more. Now the battle was all his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot made contact with C.C....and she felt her happiness swell up amidst the pain. This pain was greater than any before, whether it was just more powerful than anything priorly experienced was insignificant; C.C. was sure now, this would be her death, beneath Kallen's foot like a cockroach. It was sort of ironic, C.C. spent the better part of a millenia acting better than everyone, no different than a school bully beating up a wimp to make themselves stop from crying at night; and now she was going to die like a bug. Had to love the irony there. C.C. didn't care if Kallen spat on her or anything, this was the death she had long awaited; hell if she could move she might actually hug the sweaty flesh surrounding, The intensified taste, scent...not a single wisp of it bothered her, any second C.C.'s wish would come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles above Kallen burst into power crazed laughter, \"How do you feel C.C.? Dying like a bug beneath my foot? I hope you like that sweat, I worked it up especially for you! Lick or something and I may let you live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. had no intention of doing so, for two reasons. One was pride, dying, happy, sad, whatever C.C. did not let go of her pride. The second was her wish; Kallen offered an escape route, no doubt to make C.C. into a sort of toy for her or humiliate her, little did she know the girl at her feet actually <i> wanted </i> to die. She welcomed the angered Kallen's increase of pressure to kill her....which she did do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you little...I'm not one for bluffing so get ready!\" Kallen lifted her foot off of C.C., raising it high into the air. C.C. smirked as she saw her blood decorate the foot in a mixture of sweat that made it seem like a weapon of mass destruction. Kallen's face was one of pure disdain, she found no quarrel with what she intended to do and probably enjoyed it in fact. Both girls exchanged a last glance with one another. To Kallen all she saw was the green haired girl as a bug, it gave a primal thrill to see the high and mighty C.C. almost a pool of blood beneath her foot....it was nice. To C.C. Kallen looked like...well a benevolent goddess. Her body rose so high that, combined with the blood loss, C.C. could not make out the details past Kallen's waist; it was naught but a blur. All she could make out was her grin, or at least the basis of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen laughed one last time, \"Hey C.C. before I finish you off I have a lil gift\" With the loud sound of phlegm Kallen spat on C.C.'s small battered body. If she's down, might as well make it worse, she figured. But...enough stalling....time for the big finish. Kallen kept it simple; applying all her strength to her leg Kallen gave the greatest stomp of her life, a stomp which no doubt eradicated C.C.'s very existance instantaneously. To C.C. it seemed to last an eternity, but when it finally did in fact come she could never have been happier. It was the death she would have preferred, painless; although the medium was one she didn't like it did the job. Kallen wiped C.C. out of existance in a mere instant, unknowingly making C.C. the happiest woman alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs always C.C. came to the tunnel, and as always the light came. However this time once its soft embrace grasped ahold of the girl, it did not let go. She was finally at peace and fulfilled her wish. Yet...her mind was not on how she died, how her wish was fulfilled or even what was to come; it was on Lelouch. More memories surfaced of the boy, and C.C. finally realized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lelouch....I love you....and I pray you defeat Brittania.\" Those words were the last ties that binded the witch to this world and with them finally cut C.C. floated into the light, more than happy to finally be at peace with her cursed life...</span></div></div>",

One second you feel nothing and then your wide awake. C.C. had gone through this hundreds of times and it never got easier. One second she was dead and the next she was breathing again. Her eyes shot open and she at up, holding her hand to her breast as images of what had happened flashed through her head. It takes a few seconds for brain activity to return to normal, and once the brain is fully functioning, C.C. has all of her full physical abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck,\u201d C.C. said, using her ability to speak to utter a rare swear. She was alive, how unlucky could she be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m never going to die,\u201d she soberly said, pulling her knee up and hugging them as she feel into a deep depression. She had really thought her wishes were going to be answered and she\u2019 get the death she sought, but she had been disappointed again. She was still immortal, even though she had shrunken, it was almost enough to almost make the cyclical girl cry. But no tears came as she steadied herself. She\u2019d find some way to end her misery one way or another. Being shrunken didn\u2019t do it, but something would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still shrunken; that fact had been momentarily put aside as she focused on her other source of misery. She was a helpless, tiny girl still in the clutches of a lovesick, terrorist who had a few moments prior delivered a humiliating, painful death to her. Fear raced through her as she wondered what the twisted girl was thinking right now. Looking around wildly, C.C. tried to find the giant tormentor, but couldn\u2019t find her. After crushing her, Kallen must have left, not giving the tiny crushed corpse a second thought. She probably thought the maid would clean up the mess thinking she was just some squashed insect. Thank goodness that the psycho brat didn\u2019t decide to dispose of her body. The last thing C.C. needed was to have woken from death to find herself floating in the toilet about to be flushed like a child\u2019s dead goldfish. She was safe, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you I was taking care of something important. I\u2019ll be back in less then an hour, you can hold down things until then. Yes, I am aware that he\u2019s asking for me and tell him I\u2019ll be back soon. I left you in charge because I thought you could handle a simple thing like looking after our leader. Don\u2019t give me that tone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen\u2019s booming voice made C.C. running further away from the bed to get a better look at her surroundings. Her heartbeat sped up as she saw Kallen stomping around on the other side of the bed while talking on a phone. Her giant form moved quickly around as she tried to have a conversation, her steps shaking the wood floor under C.C.\u2019s feet. The giantess was still in the room, leaving C.C. in a lot of danger. She wanted to die, but if Kallen found her, what she\u2019d get instead was pain and suffering. The memory of being crushed under her smelly feet was fresh in her mind and C.C. never wanted to experience anything like that again. Now truly afraid, she looked for somewhere to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you stop complaining. I told you already, I have that shrinking gun we stole from the Britannian\u2019s and its safe. Unless the problem is you don\u2019t trust me?\u201d Kallen accused, toying with the silver gun that she had used to shrink  C.C. The shrunken girl watched the giantess, her eyes never traveling downwards to the floor. She ran fast towards the bed, hoping to find sanctuary under the colossal bed. If she could keep the cruel giantess from finding her, maybe she could get someone to help her. Like, maybe Lelouch\u2019s maid Sayoko. Being found by her had to be a hundred times better then being captured by Kallen. Making a dash for the bed, C.C managed to get out of sight just as Kallen would have clearly seen her. The young girl was still on the phone, having an argument with unseen people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many times do I have to say it, keep the hostages safe and secure. I don\u2019t care how small they are, if one of them goes missing or I find them stuck to the bottom of anyone\u2019s shoe, you\u2019ll answer to me. Got it, good! I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d Kallen closed her cell and sighed, wondering how Lelouch made giving orders to the Black Knights look so easy. She sat down on the bed, making the bedsprings squeal and a very scared, naked wet girl cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen\u2019s naked feet hung just in front of C.C. Deadly weapons that could kill or smoother her easily. The retched smell was back and C.C. covered her nose to try and avoid it. She started backing away, trying to get as far from Kallen as possible, but was stopped as she felt something soft and warm push up against her back. Turning around, she stared at the building sized white cotton blob that was before her. The smell of feet hadn\u2019t been coming from Kallen\u2019s dangling footies, but rather this misshapen giant cloth.  \u201cNow where did I leave my socks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith growing dread, C.C. realized that she had stumbled onto Kallen\u2019s discarded socks, which at this moment she was looking for. Wondering which god she had angered to be so cursed, C.C. tried to get away, but it was too late, Kallen was reaching for her socks. Bending over, Kallen reached under the bed, her giant fingers moving past the tiny girl and grabbing onto the socks. For a moment, C.C. thought she was safe, then Kallen started dragging them out and C.C. was pulled out with them. It was like a wave of cotton pulled her along. She fell face first into the cottony fabric; her already soaked body rubbing into more foot sweat. C.C. tried to entangle herself, but it looked like she was too late. Kallen had caught her without even knowing that she was still alive.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kallen stared blankly at the dirty, naked girl on the floor in front of her. At first, her brain denied what she was seeing was real. She had killed C.C. a few minutes ago. She had looked at her crushed corpse and even gloated, saying that it was a fitting end for such a pest. But there she was, looking like a mess with her hair in shambles and dirt and sweat covering her body, but she was alive. The confusion from seeing her alive slowly dwindled and was replaced by a cold growing anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it all,\u201d C.C. cursed under her breath as she kept her head down in fear of what she\u2019d see above her. She had tried to pull herself off the socks, and she might have succeeded, if they hadn\u2019t been wet from all of Kallen\u2019s sticky sweat. Now she was free of them and out in the open for Kallen to see. She didn\u2019t even bother standing back up, preferring to remain on her back as the evil girl did her worse. C.C. tried to reason with her, quickly because she knew time was essential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, listen to me. Whatever you think is wrong, I\u2019m not interested in Zero, I\u2019m not interested in anything you do. Turn me back to normal and I swear you will never see me again, I promise,\u201d C.C. pleaded. She waited for a response, a snide remark, anything. Kallen remained silent. Hazarding a look, C.C. lifted her head and paled at a familiar sight hovering above her head. Kallen\u2019s foot was once more poised to crush her and above her massive naked foot, Kallen looked down with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDie!\u201d She hissed and brought her foot down. This was no slow, descending doom but rather a stomp. One second C.C was staring at the sweaty, filthy sole of the giantess and then darkness. The sensation of the hot, smooth bottom of her slippery sole crushing her was the last sensation C.C. felt; for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, C.C. felt the uncomfortable sensation of coming back to life. Her eyes sprang open and she sat up, right to the sight of an enraged Kallen looming above her. The giantess had stuck around to make sure she was really dead and seeing that she had failed again, Kallen reached a whole new level of anger. Snarling she brought down her foot again on the puny girl, only not with the same strength or velocity as she had previously. C.C. raised her hands up feebly to stop the giant sole from crushing her again, which only succeeded in breaking both her arms instead of her neck. She was pinned again under her sole, being smothered in the sticky, flesh and unable to move. C.C. was surprised to feel herself still alive, although she was still in a great amount of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crushing weight of Kallen\u2019s sole weighed down on her, pulverizing bones and suffocating her. The pain was so much that C.C. had to scream, opening her mouth and getting a mouthful of Kallen\u2019s grimy sole. She could taste sweat, grime and dirt, it was the most rancid thing she had ever tasted. She coughed up blood as her stomach clenched, her body reacting badly to the horrible taste combined with the pain. Right now, C.C. wanted to die more then ever, not because she thought she would die for the last time, but just to escape the pain and revulsion.<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t get death, but Kallen did lift her foot up. The look of disgust on Kallen\u2019s face when she saw what she\u2019d done spoke volumes about how messed up C.C.\u2019s body was. C.C. thought the giantess would leave her alone, instead she grumbled, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you die,\u201d and brought her foot down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot, smelly crushing weight was on C.C. again, lighter then ever before. Kallen was no longer trying to crush her, but just pulverize her body. Whether she was doing it to hurt C.C. bad enough so she would stay dead or just for fun, C.C. didn\u2019t know, but she guessed that it was both. C.\u2019C could feel herself start to slip away as the pressure continued. She stared into the pink, wrinkles on the bottom of Kallen\u2019s sole, wondering if she\u2019d wake up seeing them. She was nearly dead again when Kallen started twisting her sole into the puny creature. Arching her toes, she ground her sole into C.C. over and over again, not stopping until there was nothing left but a smear. Even then she stomped it again, just to make sure. With nothing left but a bloody stain, Kallen walked to the bathroom to clean up the bottom of her foot. She had bug juices all over her footsie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took C.C. twice as long to pull herself together. Bones were regrown, muscles formed and a whole body sprung up where only a smear had been. C.C. knew that all injuries were healed when she came back to life, but she felt sore when she opened her eye. It was a phantom pain from a brutal and vicious death she\u2019d received. She could still clearly remember her bones cracking and her body flattening under the foul sole of the angry schoolgirl. Holding her sides, C.C. trembled, wondering what was next in store for her. It was hard to act cool and collect when you clearly remember parts of you liquefying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I going to do with you?\u201d C.C. shakily looked up to Kallen who was debating what she had been thinking on the bed. The schoolgirl swung her feet from the bed directly over C.C. There was no sign she was going to step on her again, but seeing those instruments of death again made her shudder. C.C. would never let herself be broken, but she had learned to fear Kallen\u2019s feet n a quick amount of time. Although soon, C.C. would learn to fear more of Kallen\u2019s body parts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kallen was trying to decide if C.C.\u2019s shrunken immortality was a good thing or a bad thing. She really wanted to get rid of the annoying green haired pest, but she couldn\u2019t argue that punishing the minuscule girl wasn\u2019t enjoyable. Feeling bones crack under her feet and that satisfying wetness that cam when C.C. bleed was intoxicating. There were so many more humiliating things she could have C.C. do for her. After all the running around she\u2019d done today, she could use a good foot massage or even better se could just soap C.C. up and use her to scrub her feet. C.C. would make a fine foot toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustering up her courage, C.C. got to her feet and tried to look as defiantly as she could up at the giantess. She was humiliated and traumatized, but her pride refused to let her back down for long. She spoke with all the courage she had, trying to use the one advantage she had. \u201cYou had better change me back or Zero will punish you.\u201d The threat was weak, but it was all C.C. had. Kallen respected Zero\u2019s authority and would listen. The little fan girl would never want to disappoint her idol.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig words from someone who was choking on feet a few minutes ago,\u201d Kallen teased and chuckled as C.C. continued to try and act like she had any say in anything. She was like a little kid trying to tell their parent to go to bed; it was completely impractical. Still, Kallen had to rub some salt in the wounds. \u201cThere are two things you need to know. One, the shrink ray we took from the Britannians only shrinks, it doesn\u2019t grow. Even if I wanted to help you, which is as likely as me kissing the Britannian Emperor, I couldn\u2019t. You\u2019re stuck this size, forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. suddenly felt very lightheaded and it had nothing to do with the feet right above her head. She was going to be this size, for as long as she lived, which was technically forever. Her legs gave out under her and she collapsed to her knees, feverously wishing she\u2019d wake up from this dream she was trapped in. This was the worst thing to happen to her since she gained her immortality. Actually, this was probably worse. At least she had her freedom when she became immortal, now she was the slave to this giant schoolgirl. C.C. hadn\u2019t cried in nearly five decades, but right now she felt the tears welling up in her eyes. Her immortal life had just gone from insufferable to hellish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry, you haven\u2019t heard the second part,\u201d Kallen said in her most mocking tone of voice. Wanting to twist the knife further, Kallen smugly told C.C., \u201cI don\u2019t think your going to be rescued by Zero or should I say Lelouch. You\u2019re on your own bug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C.\u2019s head dropped in despair. So Kallen did know Zero\u2019s secret identity like she thought, yet why was she so certain that Lelouch wouldn\u2019t help her? Sure, they weren\u2019t friends, but Lelouch had his twisted sense of honor, he\u2019d never let someone that saved his life spend eternity as a foot slave. He owed her big time for giving him his Geass, it was time to call the favor in and save her, but Kallen looked pretty confident that Lelouch was no longer in the picture. That got C.C. thinking, whom else might she have shrunken with the stolen shrink ray?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to Lelouch?\u201d C.C. crossly asked. She didn\u2019t really care about the boy, but he was useful to her. This girl had no right to mess with her chosen knight, especially if she claimed to have a crush on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of your business, insect. You should be more concerned about yourself. I\u2019ve spent too long testing your ability to return to life, I have better things to do. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to see you go, bitch,\u201d C.C. muttered under her breath so Kallen wouldn\u2019t hear. However, she did hear, but didn\u2019t get angry. She just smirked at the naked, shrunken girl, enjoying every second of the game she was playing with her. Kallen never thought of herself as a sadist, but she always hated this brat and seeing her so small was bringing things out in her that she didn\u2019t even imagine having. She wanted to hurt the bug, break her and prove to herself that she was better then she ever was. Images of how Zero always took her into his confidence raced through her head, renewing her desire to punish and torment C.C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving, but your coming with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d C.C. stuttered, her hope washing away with Kallen\u2019s words. She had thought she was done with her, that her fears of being her slave had been forgotten, but she was wrong. Kallen wasn\u2019t going to simply forget about her, she was far too amusing. Kallen didn\u2019t say anything, she just got her socks on silently and then reached for her shoes. Putting one she on, she paused and looked at C.C., who understood right away. \u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off running, C.C. tried to escape, but at her size a snail moved at the speed of a car. She couldn\u2019t escape Kallen, who casually reached down and pinched the tiny girl between her fingers. Trapped between her coarse fingers, C.C. was lifted off the floor and brought over to a Kallen\u2019s shoe. She stared down into the dark, foul smelling inside of Kallen\u2019s shoe before being dropped in. She fell what felt like several dozen stores, landing on the soft, sweaty interior of her shoe. C.C. crawled around blinding until she saw Kallen\u2019s toes pushing into the opening. She screamed a final time before the giant toes slammed into her, killing her instantly and pushing her right to the length of the shoe. Kallen had put C.C. in her place and that place was her shoe.   </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Darkness pain and the thick, musky smell of feet was all C.C. could sense. She had been dragged under one of Kallen\u2019s toes, smothered under a two ton toe and the soft, smelly bottom of her shoe. C.C. didn\u2019t move, just laid there and kept from crying. Bones broke only to be mended seconds later and the smell suffocated her. Then Kallen wiggled her toes, grinding C.C. into a tiny wet blot on her socks. By simply wiggling her toes, Kallen smeared the bloody remains until they were almost gone. Only a gooey stain remained of C.C. However, in a couple minutes C.C. would be healed again, once more ready to be smothered and crushed under Kallen\u2019s mighty toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot to go. I told everyone I\u2019d only be gone for an hour,\u201d Kallen said to herself. She had no idea that she had utterly mashed C.C. down and if she had known all she would have done was laugh. Walking out of Lelouch\u2019s room, she headed off to meet the resistance. While she walked, she played with her new immortal foot toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhimpering in pain as she returned to life again, C.C curled up in a tiny wrinkle in Kallen\u2019s sock and tried to protect herself. Kallen had been rolling her around under her toe as she traveled, sliding the green haired girl around under her smelly toe until she eventually broke. Most of the time Kallen crushed her within the first few seconds, but when she was careful she made the painful process of dragging her around last much longer. Time lost all meaning to C.C. as her pain continued. The brief blackouts during her death were her only relief from the pain and humiliation. Things got even worse as the inside of Kallen\u2019s foot got warmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. had been to the furthest jungles, but none of them had ever been as humid as the inside of Kallen\u2019s shoe. Every foul breath she breathed burned her lungs and made her cough. She was sweating all over, but so was Kallen\u2019s foot. The cottony toe grinding her down became moist, making things stickier for the tiny girl. The worst part of it was how thirsty she became, not because of the discomfort but because of what she did after it became too much to bear. Her tongue was so dry she felt like it had turned to sand and death did nothing to rehydrate her. Almost delirious she was forced to start licking and sucking on Kallen\u2019s damp sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping her lips around the white cotton sock, C.C. sucked out some of the moisture. Her eyes watered at the horrible salty taste that made every taste bud on her tongue scream out in pain. She swallowed the hot sweat, finding it only helped a little. Pressing her face against the sweaty sock again she started drinking it all down, crying again, but this time at the lose of her pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sucked out sweat and then ran her tongue to collect more. C.C.\u2019s belly filled with the horrible liquid until she felt like she was going to throw up. Pulling her wet, gasping face from the sock, she braced herself as again, Kallen started playing with her and she was crushed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything became a blur for C.C. after that. She might have been in Kallen\u2019s show for an hour or several years for all she knew. All C.C. could say for sure was when Kallen\u2019s toe pulled away and light shone into the shoe, C.C. was happier then she had ever been before. Then Kallen turned her shoe upside down and C.C. came falling out, landing with a wet splat in the giantess\u2019s palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy your first class trip on Kallen Airs?\u201d C.C. had nothing to say as she laid panting in Kallen\u2019s palm trying not to pass out. She was lifted closer to Kallen\u2019s face before the giantess pulled her hand back suddenly. \u201cYuck! You really stink insect. You really should try to be more hygienic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. only coughed, her mind replaying her experience under Kallen\u2019s toe. The pain should could deal with, but the fact that she had willingly drunk Kallen\u2019s foot sweat made her shudder in revulsion. She never thought she would be that desperate to do something like that, but as she was treated as a bug by this girl her pride was no longer as strong as it once was. She was losing herself to Kallen\u2019s torture, losing the regal, strong part of herself. C.C. had sworn that nothing would break her, but Kallen had caused some cracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. had to escape Kallen, find her loyal Lelouch. The boy would help her return to normal, after all he was her knight. Looking around as she regained some strength, C.C. recognized she was in one of the rooms inside the rebellion\u2019s headquarters. Lelouch had to be around here. How could she possible escape from Kallen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen bug, I need to take care of something. If I leave you here, will you behave?\u201d C.C.\u2019s mouth dropped open as Kalle abruptly spoke to her. C.C. could hardly believe her ears. Either Kallen thought she was completely broken or the girl was really stupid. If she left her here of course she\u2019ll try to mistake. Trying to look as pathetic as possible, C.C. used her mastery of deceit to convince Kallen that she was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you say mistress. I\u2019m just a bug, I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSure you\u2019ll do what I say,\u201d Kallen said snidely. Unceremoniously, Kallen tossed C.C. onto a large steel table. It was like a forty story fall for C.C. and upon impact both of her legs snapped. Whimpering at the pain, C.C. still managed to feel victorious. The stupid girl was leaving her alone. The second Kallen was gone she was going to make a break for it. Getting around at her size was not going to be easy, but it was better then sticking around for Kallen to get back to renew breaking her. C.C. was feeling pretty smug about everything, but what Kallen said next took away any self-satisfaction C.C. felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut just incase you decide to scurry away, I think I\u2019ll leave you two friends you know very well,\u201d Kallen said as she sat down and lifted her right leg up. C.C. didn\u2019t know what two \u2018friends\u2019 Kallen was talking about until the giantess pulled her sweaty sock off. C.C. didn\u2019t have to wait for the second sock to come off to get the picture. Kallen held her wet, stinky socks up, giving them a wave. \u201cMan these reek, I\u2019m sure glad I don\u2019t have to sniff these.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, no, NO!\u201d C.C. screamed in panic before trying to get away. She thought that if she made it to the edge of the table she could jump down and escape. It would kill her, but if she resurrected quick enough it could work. However, C.C. was just too slow. Kallen gave her a few seconds, watching her move at speeds a turtle would say was slow. Given a few minutes, C.C. could have made it off the table, but Kallen didn\u2019t give her another second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch these for me,\u201d Kallen cruelly laughed and then dropped her socks right on top of C.C. Suddenly everything went dark for C.C. as the dirty socks landed squarely on her. It was like two circus tents were falling on top of her, two very heavy circus tents. The socks had soaked up all of Kallen\u2019s foot sweat, making them a hundred times heavier. C.C., was forced on her stomach, the stinking, wet socks pressing her down onto the hard table. C.C. was trapped, once more being crushed against Kallen\u2019s socks. Closing her eyes, C.C. closed her eyes and shivered in disgust as the sweat started leaking onto her. She\u2019d be drowning in it soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you later bug,\u201d Kallen merrily said as she left the room, knowing that no one would check there. Her evil delight diminished slightly as she remembered the reason she was at the rebellion\u2019s headquarters and not enjoying her revenge on the witch bitch. Things had not gone well at all during their attack. They had been victorious, but not without a price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Britannians hadn\u2019t wanted to give up there new toy so instead in a fit of absolute fit of utter stupidity they fired their untested shrink ray at everything they saw, enemies and allies alike. Kallen would have found it funny that the majority of the people shrunken were Britannians if so many of her allies hadn\u2019t been shrunken as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back. I hope that quick break was worth it because we still have no idea what we\u2019re going to do with the prisoners.\u201d Kallen turned to find Rakshata walking towards her with an annoyed look on her face. Kallen had left suddenly after the disaster, leaving the Indian scientist to look over the victims of the attack. Rakshata took a long puff from her tobacco pipe and groaned. \u201cI\u2019m a scientist, not a babysitter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this was really important,\u201d Kallen earnestly told Rakshata while withholding the reason she was gone. She had taken the shrink ray without telling anyone and if anyone knew that she had used it on C.C. there would be a lot of explaining to do. Smiling at the frustrated scientist, she followed her into the command centre of the resistance where the victims were being kept. On one table were her friends and comrades, all shrunken because some jackass Britannian wouldn\u2019t hand over the new toy. There were about thirty shrunken resistance members there, but that was small potatoes compared to the enemy casualties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn several separate boxes, they kept their prisoners. They hadn\u2019t bothered to count them, but there had to be over a hundred Britannian officers scurrying around in their makeshift prison. They had grabbed the shrunken enemies at the fight, feeling that taking some prisoners might be merited for the current situation they were in. They had brought nearly all the shrunken soldiers to their headquarters. No one had said they wanted to hurt them, but no one had made any promises to keep them safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen stared at the tiny naked men and women of the oppressive government with no sympathy. While their people had been given scrapes of paper and cloth to use as clothes, the same treatment wasn\u2019t offered to the enemy. The rebellion had bigger things to worry about like fixing their own people. Still, staring at her enemy so tiny and helpless the urge to just reach in and crush dozens of them in her hand was very tempting. Kallen didn\u2019t think they would heal like the green headed bug, which made the thought of squishing them seem even better. Kallen licked her lips, wondering how many she could crush under one foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKallen, we need to talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of hiss voice broke Kallen out of her daydreams of mass murder. Closing her eyes to collect herself, she turned to her leader and the man she had developed strong feeling for, Zero. Walking towards him, she saw that he was looking as confident as ever even given the situation. That was amazing considering how the shrinking disaster was affecting him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The peace that Lelouch managed to bring about with his 'death' lasted 10 years but now it was broken. Lelouchs sister, the 100th empress of Britannia had been assassinated. Cornelia had become the new empress and had once again set about on the conquest for sycurodite.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fool! Empress is not enough, A Goddess, that is what I desire and shall be. A true Goddess. I will be so powerful that cities shall turn to dust beneath my toes, humanity will worship me, the very earth will crack and submit\" Cornelia exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Empress, what are you saying, we have finally attained peace and you are the ruler of Britannia and..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence! There was a time I would have agreed with you, but now I have been enlightened by the ring. I now know that I have been chosen to become divine. Now gilord behold my apotheosis!!\" Cornelia exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring started to glow and Cornelia felt a rush of power and started to grow. Her breasts expanded, her shirt resisted for 2 seconds before being torn apart. In 3 more second her clothes were no more. Still she continued, she acceded to the palace ceiling. The palace built by the very best Britannia had to offer could no longer contain the rising Goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe exploded out of the palace and still continued her accession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in a bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC was lying next to Lelouch. Lelouch had taken the immortal mark from his father. The moment Charles died, the mark was transfered to Lelouch but because of the way Charles died, the mark only activated on the brink of Lelouchs death. Now both CC and Lelouch were immortal and no longer had to spend eternity in solitude. They were already in love, so they agreed that they would love each other for all eternity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lelouch, I love you and that is why I must tell you this, your sister was killed\". CC solemnly said. Immediatly after saying this, CC embraced Lelouch and pulled him in so his face was touching her bare breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Nunally, CC\" Lelouch could barely speak, his mind was on the verge of exploding, his entire reason for sacrifcing all that he had, his reason to live had died. Lelouch then realised what he was feeling. Lelouch hugged CC back in a tight embrace. Lelouch calmed down as he knew that his reason to live was right beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CC I love you\" said Lelouch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch, Cornelia was the one who did this, she did it to become empress and has plunged this world into war all for her greed. I will eradicate her from exsistance but I need your help to do so\" CC said in pure rage and at the same time holding back tears over the depression Lelouch was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch im going to awaken an new power within you, since we both have marks, we can combine our powers and power up your former geass. The power of the king shall become the power of the goddess. You will get 1 use only but you will be able to command a person to do anything even if its impossible. Use this geass on me to give me enough power to kill Cornelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC broke Lelouch from her embrace only to pull him back and kiss him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouchs once again had Geass in both eyes but this time it glowed a radiant gold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Lelouch vi Britannia request that you become a, no THE Goddess, become the most powerful Goddess and being you can be.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gold glow from his geass spread to his entire body and CC glowed an equally radient pink, then the gold light transferred to CC. A divine light enveloped the room. Goddess CC emerged from the light. CC was beauty and power personified. CCs eyes glowed a luminous gold with a hint of pink. She had become even more voluptuous, her skin was pure white, her breasts had grown, they were now a third of the size of her head, she was perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch was speechless and stood in awe at the Goddess before, he going to get on his knees when CC interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch, thank you, you have given me more power than I could ever imagine. I love you, even more so now, in fact I think thats the only thing that could rival my power, well that and my beauty that is. Anyway Lelouch, you do not have to worship me however if you do than worship me out of love not fear. I will always protect you my beloved Lelouch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this CC embraced Lelouch into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch was in a state of pure ecstasy. But CC used her powers so Lelouch could still listen to her angelic voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I will avenge your sister. CC said calmly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC began to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the palace<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gilford this is but a small taste of my power.\" Cornelia bellowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilford was horrified and barely sane as he took in the sight before him.

She had a perfect hourglass figure and looked no older than 25. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGILFORD, do you now realize your foolishness? Immediately after saying this, Cornelia began to descend. The capital of Britannia was in a state of utter chaos as they ran in fear and vain. Some realized this and accepted their fate as the ginormous knee landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA earthquake 4 on the Richter scale spread across the capital as a large section of it was annihilated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was merely a taste of my power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3000 people had died, the land  was permanently scarred all so Cornelia could kneel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilford was terrified but at the same time he still wanted to protect her as a fateful knight plus her beauty was unparalleled. However all this was overshadowed by pure rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOUR NOT CORNELIA! YOUR A DEMON, YOU KILLED THE VERY PEOPLE YOU SWORE TO PROTECT!\"  Gilford exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW DARE YOU?! INSOLENT WRETCH. I WAS GOING TO SPARE YOU AND ALLOW YOU TO SERVE YOUR GODDESS BUT NOW I WILL SHOW YOU MY TRUE POWER, I WILL SHOW YOU THE POWER OF A GODDESS\" Cornelia bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornelia grew, 100 feet per second, Gilford saw 2 white masses come towards him. A shiver ran down his spine as he realised these things that were big enough to crush 3000 knightmare frames all lined up were 2 of Cornelias fingers. No matter how much Gilford struggled he could not escape the divine grip of Cornelia. Suddenly Gilford was raised 1.2 miles into the air. Gilford felt dizzy but instantly snapped out of it after he heard Cornelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sparing you for a few moments so you can suffer as I show you my power\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornelia began walking. The people of the capital saw 2 collosal white masses in the air and begged and pleaded not to be crushed. But Corenlia paid them no heed. Boom. 4000 people had died. Boom. Buildings and houses, the pinnacles of Britianinan civilization were turned to mush before Cornelia. After 4 steps Cornelia felt a surge of power. She realized that her source of power was the darkness and that killing people especially if they begged her not die would increase her power exponentially. Cornelia without knowing it had grown to 1.4 miles tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic worms of Britannia, I am your Goddess, Goddess Cornelia, if you do not want to die then worship me, beg me not to crush you like the insignificant bugs you are.\" Cornelia proclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornelia could hear the cries of worship and pleas for mercy. Cornelia raised one foot into the air. The pleas and cries intensified. People were hysterical as Cornelia began to slowly lower her foot. The people could see the wrinkles in her foot, each big enough to fit a person in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worms, this level of worship is pathetic, if you want the slightest of a chance of living then LICK MY FOOT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone complied without a moment of hesitation, there pride was only but extinguished by the demon above them. They tasted dirt but kept licking. They increased their rate after they realized the foot was still descending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOOLS! You worms are not worthy of being in my presence. BE GONE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair, that what everyone in the capital felt a second before their end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUGH YES\" Cornelia moaned as she felt power enter her being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornelia shoved the crying Gilford into her vagina. Once again Cornelia began to grow. Her feet bulldozed the remains of the capital. Anything in her way crumbled into dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAHHHH\" Cornelia let out a scream of immense pleasure that was heard throughout all of Britiania. Gilford fell faster the more Cornelia grew. He had now reached her clitoris, which absorbed him. His struggles only added to Cornelias pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornelia collapsed face down on the ground due to being overwhelmed by her immense pleasure. BOOM! In 1 second half the royal families island had been eliminated. Still Cornelia continued to grow. Her breasts decimated entire cites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her expansion had stopped. The entire island had been destroyed. Cornelia had regained her senses and stood up. In her mind she somehow knew that she was 10 miles tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA HA IM A GODDESS, THIS WORLD IS MINE.\" Cornelia proclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornelia could see Japan in the distance and knew which land was next to face her divine judgement. Cornelia ran towards Japan. Her legs were so powerful that with each stride she caused a tsunami, it took her 5 strides to get to her as she was now a lot faster than the speed of sound. Five 1 mile high tsunamis instantly drowned Area 48 (which was known as Finland).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JAPAN, THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU TO DIE\" Cornelia boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornelia raised her city sized foot above Japan and slammed it down. The citizens of Japan felt pure terror, just her proclamation had caused many people to go death and skyscrapers to fall. So when she raised her foot, it was pure pandemonium, they finally were free and now after a short 10 years they were going to all die. The city was not going to accept this and used all their weapons,bombs,guns and tanks even knightmare frames but Cornelia could not even feel it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornelia raised her other foot and slammed it down. With 2 steps she had destroyed 4 cities. As each of her steps had caused a earthquake that would be 8 on the richter scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truly pathetic, you germs are not worth a second more of my time SO I WILL KILL YOU ALL RIGHT NOW, BEHOLD THE POWER OF A GODDESS!\" Cornelia bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornelia jumped 20 miles into the air and turned herself so she would end up landing face down. Her shadow covered 12 cities, all those people could see were a huge mass of white, apart from 2 cities who saw pink (her nipples). They were terrified beyond belief and were in a state of total despair as there freedom and very lives were right from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornelia landed. Complete and utter destruction, the cities turn to dust beneath her. She caused an earthquake that would be 9 on the Richter scale. 10 other cities broke apart, there were no survivors. Cornelia felt a rush of power, the ending of so many lives, the senseless destruction, the complete disregard of mercy gave her great power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAHHHHH\" Cornelia moaned in pleasure. Cornelia started to grow once more. Her entire body bulldozed through cities, they offered no resistance at all to the growing Cornelia. Japan were desperate and so unleashed their entire nuclear arsernal and sycorudite reserves on Cornelia. Luck would have it the moment Japan unleashed these weapons, Cornelia rose the weapons went into her vagina and exploded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH YES OH YES AHHHH\" Cornelia screamed with pleasure. \"I MUST HAVE MORE!\". Cornelia grew until she was 50 miles tall but she was not satisfied. Taken over by lust and pleasure she wrapped her arms around the remnants of Japan and tried to fuck it. Each thrust did apocalyptic damage to Japan. The lucky ones died on impact with her body but some managed to survive and were thrown into her vagina. Japan had lost all hope. Finally Cornelia cummed. Her cum drowned anyone in her vagina and flooded into the remaining cities. Cornelia was still humping and cracks could be heard throughout Japan. The cum flood was only quickening the process. Japanese were dying by the scores. Eventually Japan cracked and broke apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEFORE YOU ALL DIE THERE IS ONE THING I SHOULD DO\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornelia grabbed Mount Fuji, pulled it out with no resistance, it was about the size of her toe. She then chucked into her vagina where it was compressed and turned to magma. The sycurodite in the mountain exploded all at once which gave her immense pleasure. All the Japanese had died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW TO GET RID OF WHATEVER IS LEFT OF THIS UNSIGHTLY LAND\" Cornelia bellowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKABOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornelia couldn't believe what she was seeing. It was mass of pure white. It was a toe that was twice as big as her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CORNELIA!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC had arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at a divine height of 5000 miles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your crimes are unforgivable, you are truly evil and must be eradicated\" Bellowed CC. Her voice could be heard all over the world but thanks to CCs Goddess powers no one was deafened and nothing was seriously damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW CAN YOU BE SO BIG, IM A GODDESS, YOU ARE JUST A MORTAL\" Screamed Cornelia<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SILENCE SCUM, PREPARE TO FACE DIVINE JUDGEMENT\" Bellowed CC<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC raised her country sized foot. Cornelia was terrified all she could see was a mass of pure white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC slammed her divine foot right on Cornelia. Cornelia was wiped out from existence but the split second before her death CC used her divine powers to make her feel pain like no other. Cornelia was silenced before she could even let out a scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have avenged everyone Lelouch now I will <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When Lelouch looked up to the white sky that was a part of CCs body, he couldn't tell which. When CC spoke, his entire world vibrated, even though CC used her powers to keep him safe, he could still feel her immense power. Lelouch knew that to CC he was a microscopic spec that she could eliminate with a thought yet she loved him as an equal and would do anything for him. This fact made Lelouch love CC even more, right now Lelouch was hugging and kissing the holy ground he stood on. Lelouch did this out of love however CCs breast was so soft and divine that he felt he was not worthy to be even near her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC due to her powers knew exactly what Lelouch was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lelouch, I love you, I will never get tired of saying that but you must know that I consider you my equal, I have not given you any powers apart from my divine protection because I am selfish, here you are, the one who made me a Goddess worshiping me and even wondering if you are worthy enough to do even that. Lelouch YOU ARE, I LOVE YOU and I want you worshiping me, being a mere mortal when compared to me, needing my divine protection to be in my presence is intoxicating to me. I love that feeling however I love you more, if you want me to give you powers then I will so what will it be Lelouch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No CC, I do not want powers, I love you and I love to worship you as my Goddess, you are all I could ever want\" Lelouch said with all his heart, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Lelouch, I did not think that this was possible but I love you even more, I LOVE YOU, whatever desires you have I will make them a reality in an instant, I am yours and you are mine however i am the Goddess while you are mortal but you are still my beloved, Lelouch\"  CC said with pure love in her heavenly voice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow CC spoke to Earth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans, I am Goddess CC, I have killed the evil pretender Cornelia with a mere step however if I wanted to I could have eradicated her with a thought.

Mankind could not accept a new Goddess so easily so all the countries in the world decided to use all their weapons against her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!, the sum of the strength of mankind was an explosion a quarter of the size of CCs toe.

Goddess CC raised her divine foot. Small particles of dirt fell of her foot, to normal people they were giant boulders and were all that remained of Japan. CCs foot shadow enveloped all of Area 67(former country). CC lowered her foot, To the people below it seemed an eternity as they saw a mass of infinite white descend towards them. The very force generated by her decent was more than enough to reduce the giant boulders to dust. People prayed to Goddess CC for forgiveness while some people ran in vain. Most were paralyzed in awe of the power of Goddess CC<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKABOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CCs foot had landed on Area 67. Not even dust remained. The entire area was disintegrated. Goddess CC raised her other foot. Area 12 was enveloped in the divine foots shadow. They felt the demise of area 67 as her step released an earthquake that was 11 on the Richter scale, area 67 should have broken apart when that happened but due to Goddess CCs powers no damage was done to the area. The people of area 67 wondered why Goddess CC wanted them to suffer through the fear of impeding death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am teaching you a lesson\" Goddess CC bellowed, she could read minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of area 67 were not deafened but they did feel her voice vibrate through to their very core before being eradicated by Goddess CCs divine foot. In their last thoughts they realized that Goddess CC was a true Goddess and that it was their duty to do whatever she wanted even if they were to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britannia you are the source of most of the evil in this world so I am going to teach you a special lesson.\" Goddess CC bellowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Goddess CC raised her divine foot far above the clouds. This time area 56 was enveloped (this area was connected by land to the rest of Britannia) but this time the people did not suffer in fear for eternity instead they were quickly snuffed out as Goddess CC slammed her divine foot down with apocalyptic force. Area 56 was wiped out from existence, not even a atom remained. Goddess CCs slam was more than powerful enough to destroy the entire planet however Goddess CC used her powers to transfer that power into an earthquake that was well beyond any scale and only Britannia would feel it. But they would not be harmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single person in Britannia were going insane with awe as they realized how much power Goddess CC possessed and that this power was not even a fraction of her true power. They were consumed by a type of pressure, they did not feel any physical pain but they knew that the will of Goddess CC was absolute, they accepted this fact in their hearts. This was done of their own free will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC in one stride had reached the Chinese Federation. Her divine foot landed in the sea. Goddess CC made sure that she caused no floods or tsunamis. Goddess CC loomed over half of the Chinese Federation. The people were petrified in awe and fear, they were waiting for Goddess CCs divine judgement as they knew it was futile to run. However the leaders of the federation began rounding up and sacrificing their own people to appease Goddess CC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SCUM!\" Goddess CC boomed. Her voice created winds that could have tore apart the Earth and flooded it. Once again Goddess CC used her powers to save Earth from dying due to her simplest actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW DARE YOU, THE LEADERS OF YOUR PEOPLE BETRAY AND SACRIFICE THEM, THIS IS UNFORGIVABLE, PREPARE TO FACE DIVINE RETRIBUTION\" CC bellowed with pure rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the rest of China, I am truly sorry you had to see me like that, I ask you to trust in your Goddess and accept my judgement and power\" Goddess CC said with a gentle voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of China were filled with a new sense of hope and rage as they attacked the leaders and tried to kill them. Burning, stabbing etc were mutilating their bodies and they could feel pain but the leaders were not dying. The people realized that Goddess CC was keeping them alive so they could face her divine judgement. Everyone in the Chinese Federation were singing praises and worshiping Goddess CC as they awaited her divine judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Goddess CC bellowed in a gentle voice that had a hint of love in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC leaned forward and let gravity do the rest as she started to descend to the ground, face down. The people could see a mass of infinite white approach them. Some saw her legs. Other saw knees. Some increased the rate of their worship even further after they realized they were seeing her divine breasts. Some saw a mass of infinite pink which was her nipples. Goddess CC had moved Lelouch into her nipple for safety. It was protected by a barrier so nothing else could go in and Lelouch was still able to switch between  the perspective of Goddess CC and the people as Goddess CC shared her vision with him. A few countries within the federation saw her eyes, they were transfixed by the sheer beauty of the radiant gold/pink nebula that were her eyes. No star, galaxy, universe or anything could even compare with the beauty of Goddess CCs eyes, well maybe Goddess CCs breasts could. The Chinese were grateful to come in contact with any part of Goddess CCs body as all of her was divine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKAAABOOOM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarth had never felt such force, half of the Federation had been turned to sub atomic particles. Wasting not even a second. Goddess CC rolled over. The other half of the Chinese Federation cheered as they realized they would be the first people to receive the honor of coming to contact with Goddess CCs divine and glorious ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other half of the Chinese Federation had been eradicated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mankind, watch my ascension\" Goddess CC boomed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unbelievable and impossible was happening Goddess CC was growing. She was growing at a tremendous rate. In one second she had doubled her height. She loomed over all of the EU. If she has stayed there a millisecond later, the EU would have been destroyed but she didn't. Goddess CC flew up thousands of miles high. To her it seemed that she barely hovered above the EU. Still Goddess CC ascended. 30000 her feet loomed over all of the EU. 50000 her shadow enveloped Britannia and the EU. Finally she stopped at the divine and tremendous height of 100000 miles. Each of her breasts were half the size of Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of mankind, could only see a sky of pure white,.Every person bowed down to Goddess CCs power and knew that she was THE true Goddess, they all started worshiping and awaited her divine judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC grabbed the Earth with both hands. She made to only come in contact with already destroyed parts of Earth. Each of her finger taps could destroy a country. Goddess CC pulled the planet closet towards her. Mankind saw the sky become a darker and deeper shade of white. Goddess CC pulled it even closer. At this point mankind saw that the infinite white mass became solid. Goddess CC pulled the planet into her breasts. Eu and Britannia were reduced to nothing. Earth had died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CC, Goddess CC is this what you wanted, how is this a better world?\" Lelouch inquired <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch was still inside Goddess CCs nipple but he still saw everything due to his enhanced vision. Goddess CC moved Lelouch to her breasts. Lelouch was overwhelmed by how powerful and big Goddess CC was. Lelouch than saw an enormous pillar come towards him. To him it just looked like an infinite white mass but Lelouch knew this was Goddess CCs finger. Lelouch flew on to the finger and was lifted up at an astronomical speed. Lelouch then saw a sight more beautiful than the stars themselves. Goddess CCs eye. Goddess CCs entire body was divine so even being on her finger gave him great pleasure, in fact the only things softer than her fingers were Goddess CCs other parts like her breasts but the beauty of her eye made up for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch was reminded once again that was Goddess CC was a True Goddess as he stared in to a pool of infinite beauty and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lelouch, my beloved, thank you for trusting me, now I will show the new world you dreamed of. I LOVE YOU LELOUCH.\" CC spoke with pure love in a voice that was far beyond angelic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddess CC I LOVE YOU\" Lelouch exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEHOLD MY POWER\" CC bellowed at Lelouch </span></div></div>",

So, without further ado, here's my add! Oh, and feel free to add to the other chapter choices I leave; I'd really love to see how other people would take this story, so PLEASE ADD!!!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the year 2018, the Brittanian Empire, in its quest for world domination, invaded the island nation of Japan. The Japanese army was no match for the Brittanian Knightmares and their superior technology. Within weeks, Brittania had taken over Japan, renaming it simply as Area 11. For a while, there was no trouble between the Brittanian government and the Japanese, now referred to as Elevens. But now, a resistance group known as the Black Knights, led by its mysterious leader Zero, has risen up to fight against Brittania and regain independence for Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the Tokyo settlement, a battle between the Black Knights and the Brittanians ensues. The Black Knights have cornered a key Brittanian figurehead and are attempting to kill him in order to bring down the empire. The battle is swaying in favor of the Black Knights, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enemy combatant approaching!\" a Black Knight soldier reported over their radio frequency. \"It doesn't look like the rest of the units.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the Lancelot,\" Lelouch said. \"Kallen, use the Guren Mk II to take it out once and for all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Kallen responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen began to head towards the Lancelot, ready to permanently take it out of commission. \"You're going down this time, Brittanian scum!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, it's that red Knightmare again,\" Suzaku said to himself as he encountered the Guren Mk II. \"Luckily for me, this time I've got the upper hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen grabbed the Lancelot's right arm and began to use the Guren's Fukusha Hadou Kikou radiation wave special ability on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now burn for me, you Brittanian!\" Kallen shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so!\" Suzaku said calmly. The warrant officer pressed a newly added orange button on the Lancelot's control panel, recently installed by Lloyd Asplund and the other members of the Camelot staff, and waited to see what it did. Suddenly, the Lancelot's arm began to glow bright purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Kallen wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lancelot suddenly reversed the Guren's radiation wave and turned it on Kallen's Knightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this can't be! How did you...? Damn you, filthy Brittanian!\" Kallen shouted as she was ejected from her frame. She could only watch as the Guren Mk II was destroyed before her very eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the dueling Knightmares from a safe distance, Lelouch saw this defeat happen and decided it was time to cut their losses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've lost the Guren Mk II! All forces retreat!\" he demanded. \"We have no chance of winning now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Black Knights quickly left the battlefield and headed back to their base. As Kallen was flying back to Black Knight headquarters, she became filled with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I let that happen?\" she asked herself aloud. \"The Lancelot...I swear, I'll have my revenge on it, no matter what happens! And after I finish the Lancelot off, I'll destroy the entire Brittanian empire!\" \"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back at the Black Knights' headquarters, Kallen was sitting alone in her room, still seething with anger over the loss of her Knightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't believe that happened! she thought. How did I manage to lose the Guren Mk II? It was that stupid Lancelot frame that did this. I'll get my revenge on that mech and its pilot... somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kallen continued her internal struggle, she heard footsteps approaching her room. A few seconds later, CC walked inside to check on Kallen's status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Kallen. How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, CC,\" Kallen responded. \"I just can't believe that I can no longer fight alongside the rest of the Black Knights anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Kallen, I was actually sent down here for another reason. Zero wants to see you immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zero...wants to see...me?\" Kallen asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he does,\" CC replied. \"You are to meet him in the hanger in 5 minutes. Don't be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't!\" Kallen affirmed as CC exited the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen wondered why Zero would want to meet with her now of all times. She came to the conclusion that he would probably talk to her about a new Knightmare for her to pilot, one much better than the Guren. Kallen got up from her bed, left her room, and headed towards the hanger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Kallen, you've arrived at last,\" said Zero. He was waiting with Rakshata, next to what seemed to be a ray gun of some type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here, Zero!\" Kallen shouted. \"What do you want to talk to me about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Rakshata has come up with a new device that allows ordinary people to become the size of Knightmares. Since you have recently lost your Knightmare in combat, I thought you would be the perfect candidate to try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it work?\" Kallen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Rakshata began, \"this ray alters the genetic makeup of the human body so that it can enlarge to the size of a standard Knightmare frame. All physical attributes remain the same and according to our tests, there are no known side effects of the beam...at least that we know of. Basically, you'll become a Knightmare but you'll have much greater control since you're using your own body to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will I be stuck at that size forever?\" Kallen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The standard size of a Knightmare is 30 ft tall. When you're first subjected to the ray, you may be that size for about 10 minutes at the most before you'll be able to return to normal. You will gain the ability to regulate your size anywhere between your natural height and your maximum height possible. Why do I say maximum height possible, you ask? The answer is simple: subsequent exposure to the beam will increase the maximum range of size of the subject. So, theoretically, if you were exposed to the ray again, your maximum height may be 45 ft instead of only 30 ft. And if you were hit yet again, your maximum height may reach 70 ft or so. But...since we don't want you becoming too big, you will only be exposed to the ray's effects once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I be just a bit bigger? Wouldn't I be much more helpful then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Kallen, to be honest, we've never actually tested the ray's compounded effect on an actual person before,\" Rakshata answered. \"We don't know what would actually happen if there was continued exposure, or if there are any side effects for humans.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Kallen said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Kallen, are you up for it?\" Zero asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Kallen exclaimed. \"Of course I am! But wait a second, won't I outgrow my clothes when I grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but Rakshata has created a special suit for you to wear for when you're in your enlarged state,\" answered Zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left it over there in the changing room for you, Kallen,\" said Rakshata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen headed over to the changing room to check out her new outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! You've got to be kidding me! I'm not wearing this!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now, about the suit, it will stretch indefinitely to fit your growing body. Notice that it has already started to conform to your body type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?\" Kallen looked down at her outfit and saw that it had fit her perfectly. It wasn't fitting like that a few minutes ago, she thought. Kallen was amazed that she had finally found an outfit that fit her curvy body and supported her large D-cup breasts, even if it was a bit revealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ingenious isn't it?\" Rakshata bragged. \"Now, I only have one more thing to ask you before we begin.\" Rakshata held up a pair of black high heel shoes. \"Do you want the matching heels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Kallen shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, calm down!\" Rakshata replied. \"I only wanted to know if you wanted to complete your outfit. You can walk around in your stockings then. Enough dawdling, let's begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRakshata placed Kallen in front of the machine and turned it on with a special remote-control device. She pressed a button on the remote and the ray gun began to charge up to full power. Rakshata then pressed a second button on the remote, and the gun fired at Kallen. Kallen's body was covered in the pink glow of the machine's beam. After about 5 seconds of exposure, Rakshata turned off the machine and proceeded to check on Kallen's condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kallen,\" she asked, \"how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel...POWERFUL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen's body began to slowly expand in every direction, her suit growing along with her. Zero and Rakshata could only watch as Kallen grew taller and taller with each passing second. After a minute of solid growth, Kallen stopped increasing at the exact height of 30 ft tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I can do anything now!\" Kallen shouted at her new height. \"Although, I do feel a bit heavier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, Kallen,\" said Rakshata, \"you might wanna look down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? Oh, come on!\" Kallen looked down at her chest and realized that her breasts had grown from D-cups to DD-cups in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess this is an unknown side effect! Sorry Kallen!\" said Rakshata. \"Now Kallen, see if you can return to normal. Focus on becoming your natural height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\" Kallen began to relax and slowly shrank down until she reached her original height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The project is a success!\" Zero exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen ran over and gave Rakshata a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much Rakshata! I can't possibly thank you enough!\" Kallen said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my pleasure, Kallen. And thank you for being such a great test subject!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kallen,\" Zero began, \"your new ability will come in handy during our future battles. Now, everyone, get some rest. It's been a long day and tomorrow we shall continue our fight to liberate Japan from the Brittanians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Goodnight everyone!\" Kallen said happily.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she gave Rakshata a hug, she also stole the device that operated the machine. \"Now I'll determine when I'm big enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen headed back down to the hanger and started up the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" said Kallen, \"I'm gonna be here until morning under the effects of this beam.

Now, enough thinking, let's start my ascension!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen pressed the second button on the remote and the ray gun fired at her. She was instantly engulfed in the warmth of the pink glow of the beam. Kallen stood there motionless throughout the night, feeling her size range increasing exponentially. Since 5 seconds of exposure allowed her to become 6 times her size, Kallen could only imagine how large she could become with over 8 hours of exposure. As morning approached, Kallen turned off the device and decided to get rid of it forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the only person who can have this power!\" Kallen said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe concentrated on growing until her head reached the top of the hanger, which was about 50 ft tall. Instantly, her body began to rise up until she reached her desired height. Kallen then lifted up her right foot and stomped on the machine several times to make it permanently unusuable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now nobody can ever challenge me if I get too big!\" Kallen laughed.

They were about to be attacked by an enormous...bunny girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at a proud 1000 feet tall, Kallen made her way into the settlement. With every step she took, small tremors occurred in the area around her.

Kallen then decided it was time to tell everyone her purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, people of the Tokyo settlement!\" she began. \"I am Kallen, goddess of victory of the Black Knights.

If they do not reveal themselves in fifteen minutes,\" Kallen said as she began to walk towards smaller buildings, \"then I'll get very angry!\" With that, Kallen quickly sat down, crushing 4 small buildings under her massive rear. \"And you don't want to have an angry goddess on your hands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen began to laugh as she crushed 2 small cars beneath her feet just for fun.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There, he found a crying Rakshata next to the remains of her machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zero,\" Rakshata said inbetween sobs, \"someone destroyed my Knightmare ray! And worst of all, they smashed it into pieces so I could never rebuild it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just create another one?\" Lelouch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would, but it's impossible. Some of the parts I used in the machine are rare on this planet and were very hard to come across. It's impractical to even think of building another one since the main components can only be found once in a blue moon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who could have done this?\" he wondered. \"And how were they able to sneak in here undetected?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zero,\" said CC, \"I think I know the answer to that question. Come see what's on the news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch and Rakshata walked over to the TV in the hanger and were shocked at what they saw: A 1000 ft Kallen destroying the Tokyo settlement. The news reporter began to describe the situation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've just gotten word that a giant bunny girl, somehow linked to the terrorist group the Black Knights, has appeared in the city and is causing rampant destruction. She is demanding to see head officials of the Brittanian military or she will cause even more chaos in the city. We'll keep you posted on the current situation as futher events unfold. All residents of the settlement are advised to evacuate the area at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kallen did this?!\" Rakshata exclaimed. \"Well, at least now I know that multiple exposures to the ray really worked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet Rakshata!\" Lelouch quickly scolded. \"This is no time for fooling around! Now, how do we stop Kallen and bring her back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zero,\" CC began, \"if you don't mind, I think I have an idea. Rakshata, do you have another suit like the one you gave Kallen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she began, \"I was in the process of making another one, but I've only created the basic design of the outfit. It's basically just a bikini made out of the same material.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CC, what are you planning?\" Lelouch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" she answered. \"Rakshata, get me the suit you have so far. Zero, I'll meet you outside in a few minutes after I've changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch walked a good distance away from headquarters, far enough so that no one would be able to hear their conversation. CC emerged about two minutes later and went to meet up with him, wearing a tight navy blue bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, that outfit is quite revealing isn't it?\" Lelouch joked. \"So, just what exactly do you have in mind to stop Kallen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Lelouch, I want you to use your Geass on me and order me to grow to match Kallen's height so I can bring her back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he responded. \"When we made our contract, you told me that Geass couldn't be used on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" she began. \"You cannot use your Geass on me...unless I desire that a Geass may be used on me. So, in this case, you will be able to use your Geass on me since I want to be under its control. Now, the same rules apply; you only have one chance to use it, so make it count! It's our only chance to stop her! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then,\" said Lelouch. He then activated his Geass power in his left eye; an image of a crimson bird began to form in his pupil. \"I, Lelouch di Brittania, command you to enlarge yourself up to 5000 miles, if necessary, in order to stop Kallen Kozuki from causing havoc in her current state and to bring her back down to her original size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC's eyes began to glow red as her body's systems began to rewire themselves. \"Understood,\" she replied. Instantly, CC began to increase in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, not right here!\" Lelouch shouted. \"Wait for me to get out of the way first!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Where are they? she thought to herself. Huh? What's that? As soon as Kallen had crushed the building beneath her foot, a squad of about 100 Brittanian Knightmares emerged from various areas of the settlement. They spread out in front of Kallen, weapons ready to fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention gigantic woman!\" the leader of the brigade said to Kallen over his Knightmare's speaker system. \"You are in violation of Brittanian law. Please leave the city quietly to be taken into custody and to be studied by Brittanian scientists. If you do not comply, you will be eradicated immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I can have some fun while I'm waiting!\" Kallen said as she stood up to her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen jumped high into the air towards the Brittanian soldiers and landed on her rear, crushing about half of the enemy units with little effort. The other half somehow managed to escape in time, but they would soon suffer the same fate. Kallen then lifted up her right foot, ready to crush more beneath her massive sole. The surviving Knightmares quickly began to open fire upon her, but to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! That tickles!\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen dropped her foot straight down, destroying about 20 more units in an instant. She then swept her left leg in a semicircle in front of her, destroying what remained of the Brittanian opposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was fun!\" Kallen said in excitement. \"I knew this was the right size to take on Brittania! Huh? Is that...? Yes, it is! My plan worked perfectly. It's time to take my revenge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen saw a tiny white figure moving towards her. She knew exactly what it was: The Lancelot. Suzaku continued to move closer to the giant red-headed bunny girl, making sure to take extra caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention rampaging girl!\" Suzaku said through the Lancelot's loudspeaker. \"Stop this meaningless destruction immediately or be destroyed by the Brittanian Knightmare protype unit, Lancelot! I must warn you, the Lancelot is much stronger than all other Brittanian Knightmare frames.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Lancelot! How good to see you again!\" Kallen said slyly. \"I was waiting for you to show up. Before we begin, though, let me get a bit more comfortable for you.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Within a few seconds, she had reached the 1500 ft mark and showed no signs of slowing down. At about 2000 ft tall, Kallen felt heavier in her chest area. She looked down at herself and realized that her breasts had grown from DD cups to E cups in size. She didn't care, though; she actually wanted her breasts to get bigger for what she had planned. After all, her outfit would accomodate her bust no matter how big it became. Buildings in the area fought hard to remain erect against the pressure of Kallen's expanding feet. However, the force of her expansion was just too much for the buildings to bear, as they gave way and crumbled to give the red-headed giantess more room to grow. Kallen continued to rise higher and higher into the air...2500 ft, 3000 ft, 4000 ft, and still growing. After what seemed like an eternity of growth and destruction, Kallen ceased her latest spurt at an astounding 1 mile in height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, this is MUCH better!\" the now bigger Kallen shouted in joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzaku still could not believe what he had just witnessed: The already large girl causing havoc in the settlement became even more colossal. This was impossible for him to comprehend since it should not be possible for a human to become gigantic in the first place. How was he supposed to even stand a chance of defeating her after this unexpected growth spurt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mile-high bunny girl looked down at the now tinier Lancelot. \"Now that I'm feeling more comfortable,\" she began, \"let's get down to business, shall we?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suzaku began to fire rapidly at the massive palm descending before him, but Kallen did not even notice that the Lancelot was fighting back. She then picked up the Lancelot and placed it between her massive breasts so that the front of the Lancelot was facing Kallen's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, revenge shall be mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen quickly slammed the front of her body into the ground and pressed as hard as possible. The Lancelot was being crushed by the force of her body weight and the force of the ground pushing against Kallen's breasts. Kallen then placed her hands on the opposite sides of her breasts and began to push them together as hard as she possibly could. Now the Lancelot was being crushed from every side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Brittanian trash, you will die in the comfort of my bust as retribution for destroying the Guren! Struggle all you want, but you will soon be crushed into oblivion! My breasts are so soft and huge that there is no way for you to escape your punishment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzaku's programmed Geass activated and the urge to live overwhelmed him. He tried to fight his way out of Kallen's bust, but her breasts were too big and soft to fight against. The Lancelot's systems were now starting to fail rapidly; it would now only be a matter of time before it was completely crushed under the enormous girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a bit longer,\" Kallen said as she pressed her body harder into the ground. \"Nothing will stop me from getting my revenge!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A large tan object appeared in front of Kallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Kallen wondered. \"Is that what I think it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen looked at the object closer and realized exactly what it was: A big toe. She looked up and saw that the toe belonged to a 5 mile tall, bikini-clad CC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kallen,\" CC said, \"you are to return to your normal size at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen lifted up her body from the ground to get a better look at CC; after all, CC did not have DD cup breasts before. Suzaku was able to feel the pressure stopping and saw his chance to escape. He activated the eject sequence on his control panel and fled from the colossal girl's bust. Kallen immediately noticed this escape plan and became incredibly angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!!!!!!!\" yelled Kallen as she took the Lancelot from her bust and threw it as hard as possible into the distance.

The resulting impact of Kallen's body caused a huge tidal wave to head straight for the mainland. Kallen quickly stood up and began to grow once again. As CC made her way towards her fellow Black Knight, Kallen had already grown a full mile and a half.

Neither of them would surrender without a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kallen,\" CC began, \"I don't want to hurt you, so I'll ask you this one last time: Please return to your regular size at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear me just now?\" Kallen replied. \"I told you, I'm never going back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" CC said sadly. \"I guess I have no choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, CC lunged at Kallen, sending the bunny girl stumbling in the opposite direction. Massive amounts of water were sent flying everywhere. Kallen quickly regained her balance and became very angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cheap shot, huh? Well, let's see how you like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen focused and began to grow, adding 2 miles to her height. She then charged at CC and kicked her as hard as possible with her right foot. CC tried to avoid Kallen's foot but was unable to dodge in time. CC fell to her knees and gasped for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that for fair, CC?\" Kallen asked as she laughed at the smaller CC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC somehow managed to get up from the attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna play dirty, Kallen? OK, let's play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC relaxed and started to grow until she reached 10 miles tall. She then bent down and punched the now tiny Kallen directly in her solar-plexus, causing the red-headed girl to go crashing into some nearby islands. Nothing remained of the islands once Kallen's body made impact with them. It took Kallen a few seconds to recover from the attack, but she eventually got back up on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll regret that!\" Kallen yelled as she grew to an enormous 15 miles tall. She took a running start and jumped up into the air, trying to crush CC beneath her rear once and for all. CC knew what Kallen was planning and got out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact of Kallen's rear against the planet caused massive earthquakes to occur within a 500 mile radius of the giant bunny girl. While Kallen was still dazed from the impact, CC took this opportunity to increase her size yet again to 30 miles tall. CC let her body go limp and fell towards the Earth in an attempt to pin Kallen down so that she could put a quick end to this fruitless fight. As Kallen began to regain her composure, she noticed a large shadow engulfing the light around her. She looked up and realized that CC was going to crash down on top of her. Kallen quickly got up and ran away as fast as her legs would carry her, only barely avoiding the green-haired titaness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKABOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC's body came crashing down with a tremendous thud, producing larger earthquakes than those caused by Kallen's failed attempt to defeat CC. At this point, Kallen became frustrated that their little brawl had gone on for this long, so Kallen decided to gain the upper hand in this fight by finding out what the limits of CC's power were. Kallen focused her mind and grew until she was a whopping 100 miles tall. She then bent down, picked up the miniscule CC, and slowly brought her up to eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, CC,\" she began, \"I could keep this up all day if I wanted to. So, let's just cut to the chase, shall we? Show me how big you can become!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kallen finished her sentence, she threw CC as far as she could in front of her. CC landed near the edge of the Chinese Federation's area of control, causing untold amounts of destruction from her impact. CC slowly rose up from the ground; she seemed different to Kallen now, almost possessed. The iris of CC's eyes began to glow bright crimson as she repeated the Geass programmed in her by Lelouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up to 5000 miles.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, CC's body surged upward at an incredible rate, growing at a speed that caught Kallen's attention. Within a few seconds, CC had doubled in size, then tripled. She passed 250 miles with ease, which quickly became only a milestone to her. Kallen stood in awe of CC's sudden expansion, making sure to keep a good distance away from her. CC's expanding feet were crushing everything around them so that the bikini-clad girl had enough room to complete her latest growth spurt. Hundreds of towns and cities were erased from existence in an instant by CC's growing feet. Still, CC continued to grow...500 miles tall, 1000 miles, 1500 miles, and growing. At around the 2000 mile mark, CC noticed that her chest area felt heavier. Sure enough, CC's breasts unconsciously grew from DD cups to E cups, now matching Kallen's bust size. At this point, Kallen began to wonder if it really was a smart idea to force CC to grow as she watched the green-haired giantess pass the 3500 mile mark. Then, as suddenly as it began, CC's growth came to a screeching halt at an exact height of 5000 miles tall. CC's feet were now hanging out into the ocean, a small distance away from where Kallen was standing. Kallen could no longer make out CC's face as she had become so large that Kallen could not see past her enormous breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC regained control of her body and looked around for any signs of Kallen. She saw a small black dot in the middle of the ocean and knew immediately what it was. CC lifted up her left foot and slammed it down on top of the dot, pinning Kallen beneath her colossal sole. Kallen was being crushed under the weight of CC's foot, unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kallen,\" CC said with authority, \"shrink down to size at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never!\" Kallen shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC responded to Kallen's resilience by increasing the pressure on Kallen's body. At this point, Kallen screamed out in pain. If she stayed under the green-haired giant's foot for much longer, she would not survive under CC's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK! You win!\" Kallen yelled in defeat. \"I'll return to normal. Just get your foot off of me first or I can't shrink down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I be sure you're telling the truth?\" CC inquired as she eased up on the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you feel this?\" Kallen said as she reduced her height by 5 miles. \"Now get off me so I can fully shrink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter feeling it for herself, CC took her foot off of Kallen. Kallen quickly stood up from the ground and calmed herself; she focused on the size she wanted to become. In a surprise move to CC, Kallen began to grow again, this time while running away from CC. CC quickly began to see the tiny dot known as Kallen begin to become larger, and she knew that Kallen had been lying all along. She had to put a stop to her before they were on equal terms once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen, now 150 miles tall and growing, ran away from CC as fast as she could. All I have to do is hold out long enough so that I'm larger than her again, Kallen told herself. C'mon body, grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC ran after Kallen, causing catastrophic earthquakes and massive tidal waves with every step she took. She quickly caught up to Kallen and sat down on the 250 mile, and still growing, bunny girl. CC put her full effort into stopping Kallen at all costs, yet she could still feel Kallen increasing beneath her. As Kallen passed the 500 mile mark, CC decided to try a different approach. She flipped her body around and was now trying to crush Kallen using her entire body. Try as she might, CC could not stop Kallen from expanding, as she was now 1/5 of CC's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis looks bad, CC thought to herself. I can't seem to put a stop to her growth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC tried as hard as she could but was losing her battle rapidly. As Kallen passed 1600 miles tall, she brought her legs to her chest and pushed against CC's enormous body with an force strong enough to push the bikini-clad girl off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from me!\" Kallen yelled as she pushed CC away from her with amazing strength. \"Can't you see that I'm growing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC was not sent very far from Kallen, but the shock from realizing that Kallen possessed such strength temporarily stunned her. Kallen quickly stood up and began to solely focus on becoming ever larger, just passing the 3000 mile mark. After CC recovered from her shock, she got back on her feet and decided to attack Kallen one final time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is it, she told herself. This is my last chance to stop her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC ran towards Kallen with her right arm extended, attempting to punch her directly in the face. However, as CC came with a few feet (to her) of Kallen, her arm was blocked by a familiar hand. CC looked up and could not believe what she was seeing: Kallen had stopped expanding and was now eye-to-eye with CC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there,\" Kallen said cooly. \"Miss me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC quickly withdrew her arm and took several steps away from Kallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon CC! Show me how big you can REALLY get!\" provoked the 5000 mile Kallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It pains me to say this Kallen, but I am currently at my maximum size. I cannot become any larger than I am now,\" CC responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a shame,\" Kallen replied, \"because I can still get even bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen relaxed her body and grew once again. CC could only watch helplessly as her former comrade became larger and larger before her very eyes.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hahaha! But don't worry, I'm gonna let you live. You're gonna have a front row seat to witness the arrival of the world's first goddess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kallen's body exploded with growth, becoming at least 300 miles taller with every passing second. However, this was only a warm-up for her true show of growth. She continued to expand faster and faster, taking up more and more space on the Earth. Since there was little else she could do, CC began to run to the other side of the planet, trying to stay as far away as possible from her former comrade. The 5000 mile girl watched Kallen continue to expand as her feet began to cover the planet. As Kallen hit the 8000 mile mark, her feet had expanded into mainland China. Kallen's feet continued to grow, crushing what remained of the Chinese Federation into dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! Bigger!\" Kallen shouted in joy. \"Do you see now, CC? You never had any chance of defeating me! You are restrained to your current size while I am free to become as large as I wish. Now, watch as I continue my divine ascension!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen's growth continued to push even further as she now passed 15000 miles in height. Kallen's feet were now covering a significant portion of the western Pacific Ocean and had crushed a large amount of the Chinese Federation and lower Asia into oblivion. As her body continued its expansion, Kallen made sure not to come in contact with Brittania (the modern-day United States); she had other plans in store for the tyrannical nation. At 20000 miles tall, Kallen once again felt heavier in her chest area; looking down at her bust, Kallen smiled as she noticed that her breasts had now swelled to large F cups in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Kallen said to herself. \"This is exactly what I needed. Now, all I need is to be just a bit bigger before I can leave this planet. Then, and only then, can I finally accomplish my goal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen continued to become larger and larger...22000 miles, 25000 miles, 28000 miles and still growing. People from all over the globe stepped outside and watched in horror as the colossal bunny girl kept expanding; Kallen was now so huge that she could be seen from all areas of the globe. In the mid-Atlantic ocean, a 5000 mile CC could only watch as Kallen continued to set new size records with each passing second; CC began to wonder if her fellow Black Knight's expansion would ever cease. Finally, after a full 2 minutes since her growth began, Kallen stopped enlarging at the enormous height of 35000 miles tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this should be big enough for now,\" Kallen said slyly. \"I don't want to crush the entire planet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen bent downwards and stood on the balls of her feet, suspending her toes over hundreds of cities below. The tiny inhabitants of the cities stared upwards at the flesh colored sky checkered with black before them, crying in fear as the massive toes loomed overhead, twitching imperceptibly to Kallen, but like huge harbingers of the apocalypse to the miniscule populace below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only some of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that chilling statement, Kallen pushed her body off the ground and floated off of the planet. Kallen's shadow cast darkness over a majority of planet; her entire body could now be seen from anywhere on Earth, not just the lower quarter of her frame. Looking out at the planet she had just left, Kallen smiled at something she saw down below: In the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, she was able to make out a tiny bright green speck known as CC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, CC, look at how weak you are!\" Kallen mocked. \"You had your chance to stop me, but you blew it. Since we are both members of the Black Knights and because you did, in fact, not end my life when you had the upper hand, I shall spare your own life as a token of my gratitude. And now, as a special gift from yours truly, you shall now witness a once-in-a-lifetime event, something that you, and the entire planet, will never forget. However, this size won't do at all...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kallen relaxed her body and closed her eyes as a grin slowly spread across her face. A few brief moments later, the entire planet gasped in amazement as the planet slowly became enveloped in a heavier wave of absolute darkness; Kallen was growing once again. The colossal bunny girl quickly began to explode outwards, her relentless growth far surpassing anything she had displayed before when she was confined to the planet; now that Kallen had an infinite amount of room to use her ability, she could let her body grow without restraint. Kallen soon began to dwarf the planet as her body continued to erupt in size, passing 60,000 miles only 7 seconds after her latest spurt had began. The people of Earth could not believe how big Kallen was becoming, believing that this latest expansion was the gift she had just mentioned; a growing majority of people began to believe that Kallen would never stop expanding. Soon the sky itself all around the world consisted of nothing but Kallen's increasing form; the stars above them were replaced with Kallen's smooth skin and she was rapidly enveloping the world in darkness as her body began to slowly block out the Sun. The redheaded girl's spurt persisted...70,000 miles, 85,000 miles, 100,000 miles tall and growing. As the planet became the size of a basketball compared to the titanic woman, Kallen's growth came to a halt as she opened her eyes to gaze out at her new view of the universe; at the end of her latest spurt, Kallen had reached an impressive 120,000 miles tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is more like it!\" shouted Kallen, her booming voice damaging the ears of every soul on Earth. \"I'm now more than big enough to give this planet my gift as a goddess. Now, watch and be amazed as I shall perform a vanishing act the likes of which this planet will never see again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen smiled as she proceeded to float around the planet until the upper half of her body was directly over North America. Gripping the celestial body in her right hand, Kallen began to draw the planet closer to her, keeping it only a few inches (to her, at least) away from her body; at the same time, her fingers drilled into the crust of the Earth, wiping out entire countries in the blink of an eye. As Kallen had finished making the necessary preparations, the smile suddenly vanished from her face, now replaced with a stern facial expression that emphasized her seriousness of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Citizens of Earth, I, Kallen Kozuki, shall now deliver my present unto all of you. In my effort to bring peace to this world and to strive for equality in the region most of you call Area 11, there must no longer be opposition to the presence of harmony between the people of the planet. Peace cannot exist while others are being treated terribly by others, while people are oppressed by the harsh government that rules over them and strips them of their free will, and while there is not equality between all social classes of Japan. Therefore, today is the day that peace and tranquility shall come to Earth forever! My fellow Black Knights, rejoice in this momentous occasion! This is the end of Brittania!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kallen slammed the planet into her chest, crushing all of North America and part of Western Europe beneath her left breast, completely annihilating the Brittanian Empire and part of the EU (European Union) in an instant. CC looked on in shock at Kallen's enormous breast pressing into a good portion of the planet; had CC been only another step closer to where Kallen's body had made impact with the land, she would have been crushed under the massive bunny girl's endowment as well. After maintaining bodily contact with the Earth for about 20 seconds, Kallen removed her large bust from the planet, revealing an enormous crater that was permanently etched into the planet's surface, covering almost all of the Northern Hemisphere with another smaller, but much deeper, crater in the middle taking up most of what was formerly Brittania. As she dusted off the debris from her F cup breasts, Kallen smiled down at the planet, proud of the work she had done; peace would soon finally come to Earth now that Brittania was out of the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now life on this planet shall be much more tranquil for years to come. With Brittania no longer causing conflicts in almost every part of the world, things shall return to the way they once were, before Brittania began its campaign for worldwide dominance. Japan is now free from the evil Brittanian stranglehold it once had forced upon it, and the people of Japan are now able to proudly call themselves Japanese once again.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that her work was complete, Kallen floated in space in front of the planet, contemplating her next move. As she continued to drift in the endless void of space, Kallen could feel something within her, welling up and wanting to be released. Kallen knew exactly what this strange feeling was: The remaining growth potential stored inside of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now,\" said Kallen as a smirk began to form on her face once again, \"I think I know how to occupy the remainder of my time. I think I'll just become larger and larger until I exhaust whatever growth is left in my system. My only other option, at this point, is to shrink back down to normal and live in the new world I've created. Since I'm guessing that a majority of the world wants me dead for nearly destroying the planet, both by growing and with my breasts, that option is instantly eliminated. So...that now leaves me with only my first option, growing as big as my body will allow. Well, since I'm already a goddess now, I guess I should just see how big of a goddess I can become!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen began to giggle as she prepared to grow one final time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This spurt shall be my last...and my biggest. I've decided that my body will not halt its expansion until every ounce of growth stored within me has been spent and I attain my maximum possible size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen then tilted her head towards the Earth and continued talking, now addressing the people of the world in her monologue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Citizens of this humble planet, today has been a historic day for all of you. Today, your goddess, Kallen, ascended from a mere mortal to an all-powerful deity. Once my ascension was complete, I brought everlasting peace to the world by ridding it of a tyrannical empire and its quest for sheer conquest of the planet. This day shall forever be remembered in the annals of history as 'The Birth of Kallen, Savior of Earth and Goddess of the Universe'. Now, my children, I must leave you all for the time being in order to make myself stronger so that if, and when, the Earth is troubled by the forces of evil and destruction once again, I shall come to your aid with almost limitless power to quickly restore balance to the cosmos. May good fortune forever shine upon this peaceful world and always remember, no matter what you may hear or believe, I am always watching over you. Farewell, people of Earth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving to the planet with her right hand, Kallen released the remaining growth stored inside of her body, causing her to explode in size in every direction. Unlike all of her previous growths, this time, the colossal redhead did not place any restraints on her height; her body was now free to expand to its heart's content. Kallen watched as the Earth quickly dwindled in size, soon disappearing from her vision altogether once she had reached 1 million miles tall only 30 seconds after her ultimate spurt had began. The giant bunny girl continued to enlarge relentlessly, her body's rate of growth accelerating exponentially with each passing second. In another 25 seconds, Kallen had expanded to over 350 million miles tall and continued to increase her stature even further. The fabric of space around Kallen began to slightly bend to signify her presence as a new entity within the cosmic sphere known as the universe. As the former Black Knight's body now extended into the outer region of the solar system, her growth began to pick up even faster. Due to the rapid amount of space she was now taking up within the solar system, the Sun had made impact with Kallen's expanding right thigh and was instantly crushed into pieces as it made contact with the growing girl; Kallen was completely unaware of this massive collision and did not even notice any of the searing heat from the impact of Sol against her leg as the star met its end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>CC was awe struck. The sky was dark white. That was all CC and the people of Earth could see of Kallen. She was so colossal that not even CC who could be considered a Godess in her own right, with feet that could envelop entire countries could even comprehend the vastness and power of Goddess Kallen. But that was the least of mankind's problems. Goddess Kallen had destroyed the sun. The only reason people could see was because Goddess Kallen emitted a faint divine glow. But mankind would steal freeze to death. CC knew she had to act fast to save the world so she knew despite the consequences this actions this had on existance, CC began to establish a contract with Goddess Kallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddess Kallen\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who, How, Why?\" Goddess Kallen exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Kallen was 1 billion miles tall and still growing.Her voice alone should have destroyed the galaxy let alone her gravitational pull but for some reason it did not. However her voice still reached Earth and caused the deafening of millions of people and continents to crack apart. For the first time since her ascension, Goddess Kallen was surprised. She realized in a second that it was CCs voice which she thought meant that CC was growing and may even catch up to Goddess Kallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry Goddess Kallen, I have not grown, my power does not compare with yours which is why I am asking for your help. I am using my powers to communicate with you telepathically. The Earth is dying. While you were growing your right thigh instantly on contact annihilated the sun. Also your voice from that single sentence has caused the deafening of millions and for continents to crack. Truly you are a Goddess but I can give you even more power as I gave Lelouch his geass long ago. I am  now much stronger and you are a Goddess so the power we shall receive shall be immeasurable. You will get to pick our contract so you can make sure that I do not eclipse you in power. With this power I shall be able to save Earth and rule over the world you created while you can do whatever you want, you may even have Earth or destroy, I would not be able to stop you.\" CC said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a Goddess, to think I could destroy the sun without knowing it but that is the fate of anything that stands in the way of my ascension, So of course people who help it will be rewarded tremendously so I propose this contract. We shall both become all powerful Goddesses however I will always without exception be a lot more powerful than you. In fact your power will not even compare to mine. Also unlike my mine, your power will be finite so you will be able to gain powers in various ways but you will never even come close to me.\" Goddess Kallen said with the cosmic voice only a Goddess could produce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept this contract\" the 5000 mile CC said. CC then raised her foot and gently put it down on a country. All she could see was grey dust, pathetically weak dust that disappeared when it came in contact with her foot. She knew that this dust was an entire country, she had killed millions, possibly billions and this excited her for a moment. But then she stood in awe as she realized to Goddess Kallen, the sun was what the country was to CC. And now they were both about to become so powerful that they could eradicate how they are now with a mere thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCCs forehead glowed an incredibly strong crimson that illuminated 5 countries.Her hair was raised so her forehead was uncovered, the winds produced by this blew away 2 cities. A divine beam of crimson light shot from CCs head many times faster than the speed of light. The light had reached Goddess Kallen. The light CCs forehead produced was mere candle light compared to the divine light Goddess Kallen was enveloped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Kallen radiated a divine crimson with a hint of gold. This light enveloped the entire universe. The sun did not even compare. Everyone on Earth apart from CC was blinded by her Godly light. CC now glowed a Godly green that enveloped an entire galaxy but it was no where as strong as Goddess Kallens. Finally both lights combined, all of space was illuminated by a divine light that was crimson with a strong hint of green and gold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC emerged from the light. Her skin had become pure and perfect, it emitted a divine glow. Her breasts grown to be a third of the size of her head each. Her figure was even more voluptuous. Goddess CCs power and beauty were far beyond any mortal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC wanted to show the planet who their new Goddess was so she grew. Her divine feet bulldozed through countries. She acceneded higher and higher. Far beyond the atmosphere. She could see the curve of the Earth. At 50000 miles the Earth was threatening to split apart under her weight but she stayed on. Soon her body covered the entire Northern hemisphere. It was at this point Goddess CC flew off the planet. Goddess CC tremendously eclipsed Earth as she gazed at Earth deciding judgement as a Million mile Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth was the size of one of Goddess CCs divine toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMankind had given up all hope as they realized that their were 2 Goddesses ready to end their insignificant lives. The sky was pure white but a lighter shade as it was Goddess CCs skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC was filled with lust. So she used her powers to move the Earth into her vagina. The sky had now turned pink, the air was humid. Goddess CC grabbed the other planets of the solar system and had increased the gravity of the solar system so all the planets went down her vagina. Mankind knew their end was near as they saw planets on collision course with them. But before the end could come, Earth had reached Goddess CCs clitoris. Upon contact the earth was protected as the other planets fell into different sides of her clitoris. Dark pink was all mankind could see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MERE PLANETS ARE NOT ENOUGH FOR A GODDESS\" CC SCREAMED WITH LUST<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMankind were terrified and were in a state of despair as they realized that they were being using as a sex toy. Goddess CC than started to attract stars to her vagina. they were shooting at speeds faster than the speed of light right into her vagina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES,YES. OH\" Goddess CCs screams rang throughout the entire galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Goddess CC wrapped her arms around the galaxy and thrusted. Trillions of lifeforms died for Goddess CCs pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEEEESSSSSSSSS\" CC screamed with pure pleasure as she reached her orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe galaxy was barely intact. Planets and stars were reduced to dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to create a new world I can rule over\"  Goddess CC said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC focused her powers and rocks from all over the universe began to collide at the spot where Earth was. Soon these rocks formed a sphere. Then Goddess CC spat at the newly formed sphere. Goddess CCs saliva was divine so it was filled with life energy which made lush green forests grow. Finally Goddess CC placed a toe on the new planet. Goddess CC had to use her powers so the planet would survive this. This planet was much bigger than Earth so she was just able to fit her full toe on the northern hemisphere. She then formed many continents inside this imprint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At last my new planet is formed, I will reign over it as a Goddess so I shall call it C-World\". Goddess CC proclaimed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CC\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver ran down Goddess CCs spine. She knew who it was but she still could not believe it. Goddess CC could see a nipple that was twice the size of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupreme Goddess Kallen was beyond human measurements, she was bigger than the universe.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However you are Goddess and you wanted to fuck the galaxy so reality and logic obeyed your will. Yet I am still more powerful than you a Goddess so I am beyond a Goddess. Meaning that I am now Supreme Goddess Kallen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC was petrified with shock and awe at both her own power and more so at Supreme Goddess Kallen. She now knew that she could so nearly anything, this would have normally overjoyed her but she realized that she had given made Kallen a Supreme Goddess and now she could make her twisted desire to outgrow and destroy everything a reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry so much CC. It is true that I will outgrow everything and eventually surpass even infinity but like me you have the power of creation. So lets purify existence together. Right now I want to see how you rule as a Goddess so show me\" Supreme Goddess Kallen said in a gentle voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC snapped out her petrified state and realized that she was still a Goddess. So she used her powers and populated her new world with 1 trillion humans. She could do this because he made C-world much bigger than Earth however these humans were still the same size so it all meant was that she had more worshipers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of C-world awoke. Some of them were former inhabitants of Earth. They looked around and saw lush green forests, pure water that shimmered and a pure white sky that radiated a divine glow that illuminated the world. They thought they were in paradise until they realized what the white sky actually was. The newly created humans were on a different part of the world it was on the imprint that (at the time) Goddess Kallen left on the Earth. They were all young men and women and knew basic skills like language and walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mankind. I am Goddess CC. Some may remember me from your days on Earth. I destroyed that pitiful planet to make room for my new world, the world on which you stand on C-world. With my divine powers I created this paradise and revived all humans who deserved to be revived that I killed. However I made this planet much bigger than Earth so I created some new people. They are exactly the same as the original humans. Right now I have separated you both so you can adapt to my new world. Each civilization has one city quite developed by me. Most notably it has a library where you can educate your selves. The final change you may have noticed is that there are no children or elderly in this world. That is simply because I do not need those kind of people so I reincarnated them as one of the newer humans. You have 10 years to adapt to my world. during these 10 years I will be watching over and protecting you.\" Goddess CC proclaimed <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC using her divine powers sped up time by 10 years. To her only 4 seconds had passed but in those 4 seconds she was able to see and comprehend everything that happened in C-world in 10 years. All of mankind had heard Goddess CCs voice resonate throughout their very being and had realized that the sky was Goddess CCs skin. They knew that Goddess CC was so vast and powerful that they could not even comprehend one of her body parts. Even the humans who were killed by her accepted her as their Goddess. Mankind began to develop their cities. Technology was set back a bit but the libraries that Goddess CC provided had information on nearly everything. Each of the cities had 100s of millions or even billions of humans so things were developed and built extremely fast. Overpopulation was not a problem as the cities were the size of continents back on Earth. Moreover there were crops everywhere full of fruit and veg that tasted better than anything on Earth. But that did not hold a candle to the water. It was divine (as it was Goddess CCs saliva)  just one drop could make a human die happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have given you long enough to adapt, you have done well but now, I am sure you realized by now that this world is better than Earth ever was. In return for this, I Goddess CC want to be worshiped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC lowered her toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMankind could see that the sky was falling. Just by the the decent of her toe, hurricanes and tornadoes formed everywhere. Mankind could hear the planet tearing itself apart as the land beneath them cracked. Everyone started praying to Goddess CC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKAAABOOOM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toe landed on the planet. Goddess CC used her divine powers to undo all the damage done to the planet and her toe covered the imprint she left behind when she created the planet. However people could still feel the divine presence of Goddess CC on their planet, her planet.<br>\r\nMankind bowed to Goddess CCs tremendous might and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a good start. But are you even worthy of being in my presence, of even having the privilege of worshiping me. If you think you are then come to my toe, the more you want to please me the faster you will arrive there.\" CC boomed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMankind could feel Goddess CCs voice resonate throughout the entire planet. Everyone rushed to her toe and begged to have the honor of worshiping her. The ones who begged found themselves in front of an infinite white mass. Goddess CCs toe. Up close they could truly admire their Goddess and how grand even one toe was. The worshipers realized they were seeing merely the bottom part of her toe. And even then they could only comprehend a small part of her toe (to Goddess CC it would be a microscopic spec she could make out using her powers). Mankind began to wonder if they worthy after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive, you making it here so fast shows me how devoted you are.\" Goddess CC proclaimed<br>\r\n\"You microscopic specs are not worthy of even being in my presence, however I gave you life and something I created must be worth something so WORSHIP ME AND SHOW ME WHAT YOUR LIVES ARE WORTH\" Goddess CC boomed with enough force to destroy 40 solar systems. Again Goddess CC protected Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMankind began to worship fervently. Overzealous was not a word they comprehended. Everyone began to climb her toe. Some massaged it while sing prays to Goddess CC. Some even licked it and were awarded with a sensation of taste that their mortal senses could not fully comprehend. All they knew was that it was the best thing they had ever tasted. They began to lick with even more ferocity. Even the ones who were massaging started to lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORTALS! Did I say you could touch my divine skin\" Goddess CC Boomed, again her voice was more than enough to reduce the planet to dust but Goddess CC saved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC raised her toe and used gripped the planet. Her fingers would have destroyed most of C-world but once again Goddess CC used her powers. She brought the Earth towards her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMankind felt the anger in Goddess CCs voice. They were genuinely heartbroken that they had made the Goddess they loved feel like this. They realized that they deserved death, and that death by a Goddess was too good for them. The earthquakes her fingers sent throughout the planet reminded them of the power of the Goddess they angered. The sky had turned a dark pink, they welcomed their end and started to praise Goddess CC. Goddess CC opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all love me. I am going to kill you yet you love me. Even though I created you for the sole purpose of worship, even knowing this you still love me. Well I did make you all a paradise. So it seems I do have a tiny bit of love for you all. Meaning that this time I will spare you and as a bonus you have the privilege of worshiping me and touching my divine skin.\" Goddess CC said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC then began to radiate a stronger divine light<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMankind were ecstatic beyond belief. Their Goddess loved them. Knowing this, all of mankind proclaimed their love to their Goddess and once again transported to her toe. Which now loomed above Earth. They began to lick and kiss out of genuine affection. Mankind loved her so much that they would give her anything even their own lives if that was her desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC could feel every lick, her feet were hypersensitive since she was a Goddess. Goddess CC could feel herself getting wet. She also felt all of Mankind's love. This gave her immense pleasure. Quickly she gave C-world her divine protection so nothing could hurt it. Goddess CC could not hold back anymore. However all of mankind were still on her toe. Using her powers she moved them back on C-world and placed it on her right breast.

With no hesitation they charged towards her breasts and began to worship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess CC no longer payed any attention to C-World as she acceded. Soon her breasts were as big as systems systems. But that was not enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WANT MORE\" CC BOOMED<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality obeyed her demands. As stars from throughout the galaxy began to collide with Goddess CC at a speed faster then light. Goddess CC pushed her body against the fabric of space itself. Soon she realized she was looking at galaxies. Goddess CC grabbed one and pulled it towards her breast. That galaxy was turned to dust. Still Goddess CC grew. She then grabbed 10 galaxies and shoved them in her ass. They turned to dust on impact. The pleasure was too much for Goddess CC. She let out a a scream that distorted all of space as she reached her orgasm. Her cum shot out of her and took over entire worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Goddess CC finished her expansion. She was now beyond human measurements, she was the size of the universe. Galaxies were now microscopic specs to her. C-world ended up inside her divine nipple. Her breasts could crush billions of galaxies at once. She was truly a Goddess no more than that Goddess CC knew that she was the Suprem....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry CC but not even close\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Not yet, anyway. Brittania, however, must pay for all the pain and suffering they caused! I'm only after Brittania.\" Kallen stopped at 20000 miles high. CC was a mere doll compared to her. \"What to do with you for now...\" Kallen thought of an idea. \"Of course.\" She turned CC right side-up and placed her in between her newly F-size breasts. \"Enjoy, 'cause you have the softest seat in the universe, my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I have a choice?\" CC said, although it wasn't that bad as she slightly blushed. Kallen began to grow again for a full two minute until she reached 40000 miles and her bust grew to G. She was so huge, all areas of the globe could see her now.

Kallen bend down as she hovered her hand over the headquarters. \"Not so high and might now! Are you, Brittania!? All of the foreigners that have suffered by your tyranny has come to an end!\" She raised a fist up in the skies as she was ready to slam it down. \"This is the End of Brittania!\" As her fist hit the ground.

Hearing the results of his failure to stop the gigantic Kallen, as well as the now giant C.C., Suzaku returned to his Brittanian base, defeated and somber. Lancelot was destroyed, his emergency eject sequence left him several miles away from the base, he had to walk there. The entire time he could see and hear Kallen and C.C. battling it out, outgrowing one another with each exchanged blow. It was ridiculous, the two women didn't even realize the very world was crumbling beneath their feet. Hell, Suzaku halfway expected the world to collapse from their sheer weight, but the Earth held itself, and the damage was...minimal considering their sizes. But if nothing was done soon the entire planet would, without a doubt, be crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo worsen matters, as he headed back to base citizens noticed Suzaku, and they dejected him for his failure. Saying things like, \"What do you expect? He's an Eleven.\" Or \"A Brittanian would have stopped this before it even began!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Suzaku finally arrived back at base he expected all the soldiers to start saying the same things, he sighed as the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello there Suzaku! <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/music1.png\" alt=\"*Music1*\" title=\"Music1\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzaku failed to understand his boss' happiness in the situation, \"Hey Lloyd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gleeful scientist smirked at the soldier, \"Now now, why so depressed? Today is a joyous day!\" Beside him was his lab assistant and for all intents and purposes, babysitter Cecile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzaku nearly hurt him, \"Joyous? The entire world is getting crushed by two women in a pointless fight!!\" He angrily gripped Lloyd's cuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd grinned, \"But they're <i>beautiful</i> girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile sighed, \"What I think Lloyd is <i>trying</i> to say is, we've found a way to fight back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzaku released Lloyd, mouth open is disbelief. \"R-Really?! How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male scientist raised a finger knowledgably, \"Simple, while you were out getting my beloved Lancelot destroyed. Me and Cecile here were analyzing the giant bunny-girl, and each time she grew she gave off an odd energy signature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile happily clapped her hands, \"In theory...we can replicate it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Japanese soldier never looked so happy, \"Really?! When can we get it done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd laughed, \"Don't underestimate me Suzaku, me and Cecile have already completed it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Suzaku took back everything he every said and thought about Lloyd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to find someone to grow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me.\" Suzaku stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd flapped his wrist, \"Because no one wants a giant <i>guy</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzaku regained all the negative thoughts he took back. In fact, he was too angry to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd didn't seem to pick up on any of that, \"Oh! I have the perfect woman in mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzaku and Cecile shared a worried look, growth...plus Lloyd's odd tastes...this was probably not going to go well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the battle of the century, the fight between C.C. and Kallen had escalated to a breaking point. Both were nearing 4,000 miles in height with no end in sight, and neither were showing signs of tiring from the fight either. Kallen was fighting with better physical ability as well as a reliance on growth, whereas C.C. relied more on strategy for her combat style. Neither showed any care for the world beneath their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna end it!\" Kallen roared, raising her foot for a kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. didn't bat an eye, she simply ducked and blocked, holding off Kallen's leg with a single hand. \"You're strong Kallen, but you possess no strategy behind your moves. You're little more than a wild beast.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C spoke too soon, right as the words escaped her mouth Kallen's leg seemed to gain weight, she was growing! In rebuttle C.C. attempted to focus her own growth as well, but with Kallen's increasingly heavy and strong kick she was failing to focus. And it wouldn't take much longer before the woman would get big enough for her kick to break through. C.C. couldn't waste any time, she threw Kallen's leg off as best she could and proceeded to tackle the girl. Even though Kallen was the bigger, C.C. had enough weight to knock her down, and with her body on top she proceeded to grow some more herself. Kallen wasn't one to take that, and she too began to grow as she fought against C.C.'s grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of me you tool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you stop this nonsense.\" C.C. batted an eye to her and Kallen's expanding breasts, even in the midst of conflict she imagined it must've seemed like a male's paradise if one was there. Between the breasts of two gigantic beauties as they're soaking wet, she made a mental note to tease Lelouch with something like that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls broke the 4,500 mile barrier, still growing. C.C. bit her lip, her limit was coming close, and Kallen was beginning to work her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead smirked at C.C., \"You're reaching your limit aren't you C.C.? You're growth has slowed down a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I still have plenty to spare!\" Kallen laughed as her growth suddenly sped up, quickly surpassing C.C.'s 5,000 mile limit. She grinned as the green-haired beauty who threatened her grew smaller and smaller between her ever-expanding cleavage. The battle was Kallen's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom out of nowhere a massive form came upon Kallen, nearly killing poor C.C. with its pressure. Kallen fought against the figure, <i>W-What?! What could possibly be bigger th-</i> She couldn't finish her thought, as she saw the \"Massive figure\" was in fact, a mere toe of the true being. A woman who redefined big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new giantess tilted her head back and laughed, \"You two and your petty squabbles. It's about time someone put you in your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait...I know that voice...</i> Kallen couldn't see past this woman's toe, but after a few motions she managed to glimpse from between her toes. The woman was truly massive, being so far away to Kallen that above her navel things actually began to blurr. But it was a person she recognized instantly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After creating massive amounts of destruction upon the planet in her battle with CC, Kallen, the victor of said battle, was now pinned down under the toe of a much larger woman, one whose toe alone was large enough to decimate the entire eastern hemisphere and one-fifth of the western hemisphere with ease. The immense pressure Kallen felt applied to her back made her scream out in utter pain, her harsh cries of agony reverberating throughout the planet, instantly deafening all those who were still alive on Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my,\u201d the larger woman spoke, \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel good when you\u2019re the defeated one, now does it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrrrgh!\u201d Kallen grunted as she tried to push the monstrous toe off of her body. \u201cGet off of me this instant...Euphemia li Brittania!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating in the infinite void of outer space, calmly relaxing several million miles away from the Earth was the titanic 9.75 million mile body of Euphemia li Brittania. The princess of the Brittanian Empire had enlarged to such a magnificent height by nominating herself to undergo the experimental treatment back in the main laboratory of the Brittanian Special Forces Division. As with Kallen and CC before her, Lloyd, in an effort to prove to Rakshata that he possessed the superior technology, outfitted Euphemia with a pink catgirl outfit consisting of nothing but pink cat ears and a matching set of a fuchsia bra and panties; a furry faux tail was attached to the back of Euphemia\u2019s underwear to give the appearance that she possessed a cat\u2019s tail as well. Throughout the entire process, Suzaku was adamantly against the decision to enlarge Euphie, stressing the fact that as her royal knight, he would be failing in his duties to protect the princess at all costs if he allowed her to go through with this plan. Before Euphemia continued with the experimental treatment, she stood next to her knight, smiled, and assured Suzaku that she would be perfectly fine. Waving to the former warrant officer, Euphemia smiled once more as Lloyd fired a beam of green energy directly at the pink-haired woman. Since the amount of power in the Brittanians\u2019 device was much greater than the original ray gun used to enlarge Kallen, Euphie\u2019s new starting height would not be 30 ft tall, but rather 30 miles tall. Within the span of only a few seconds, Euphie could no longer hold back her newly acquired power and immediately began to grow, her head shooting through the roof of the Brittanian military base only a few moments later. The scientists, civilians, and other military personnel inside of the base tried to escape from the growing princess, but they were all too slow; within 5 seconds of her growth spurt, the entire complex had been laid to ruin by Euphemia\u2019s expanding feet. Even though the entire military base, and with it, the growth ray, were now ground into dust beneath the giant catgirl, the enormous woman continued to expand faster and faster. Euphie covered her eyes with her hands, the sight of the destruction she was causing by simply growing was too much for her to bear; just like with Kallen an hour earlier, nearby homes and buildings that had stood erect for decades crumbled in an instant, the pressure of Euphemia\u2019s increasing feet being too much for them to resist. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity of growing to Euphemia, her body suddenly came to a halt at the predicted height of 30 miles tall. Feeling the sensation of growth subsiding, Euphie slowly removed her hands from her eyes as light once again filtered into her pupils. The titanic princess nearly gasped at the sight before her: The once beautiful and lavish landscape of Area 11 and the surrounding continent was now replaced with massive craters and deep imprints of the dueling goddesses\u2019 impacts. Upon gauging the full extent of their destruction first-hand, the massive catgirl was now determined to bring the madness to an end and to save as much of the planet as possible before any more harm befell the rest of the Brittanian-controlled territories. After quickly adjusting her cat ears with her right hand, Euphemia soon focused on the deep well of power now within herself and let it flow throughout her being, causing the young noble to instantly skyrocket in size, doubling in height only 2 seconds later. As Euphie stretched higher and higher into the air, she unconsciously began to grind what remained of Area 11 beneath the soles of her expanding feet, her mind currently unaware of her surroundings and only focusing on growing bigger and stronger. Since Kallen and CC were battling over in mainland Asia and currently extending the breadth of their brawl into North America, the other women were oblivious to the rapidly growing noble, their own minds focusing on defeating their current opponent. As Euphemia approached nearly 10,000 miles in height, she gently pushed against the surface of the Earth and launched herself into the seemingly endless void of space, her body still enlarging; the power now permanently infused within Euphemia from the experimental treatment permitted the princess to breathe in space, just as Kallen\u2019s and CC\u2019s respective growth triggers allowed them to survive in environments with little to no oxygen supply. Now having plenty of room to increase her strength and stature without fear of further damaging the planet, Euphemia released the restraints she had placed on her power and increased the rate of her expansion exponentially. Euphemia glared at the dwindling planet as she rapidly enlarged, acquiring a front-row seat to the rampant destruction the other women were dealing to the Earth. The sight of such unnecessary catastrophe filled the princess with a quiet rage, fueling her growth further and further and causing her to decide that she would punish both of the growing women once she was truly unstoppable. Holding the planet in the palm of her hand, Euphie continued to watch the planet-wide brawl as she soon expanded past 1 million miles in height; however, this size was only a brief milestone as the gorgeous catgirl soon reached 2 million miles tall...then 3 million miles...followed shortly after by passing the 5 million mile mark and still growing. As soon as Euphemia could no longer make out even a glimpse of her former home, she slowly brought her expansion to a halt, the Brittanian princess now almost 10 million miles tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now,</i> Euphie thought, <i>it is time for justice to be served, and for the great name of Brittania to be forever preserved along with the Earth!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently lowering the planet in her hand, it now completely under the influence of Euphemia\u2019s powerful gravitational field, the massive princess released the planet near her feet, readying her counterattack. Moving her right foot only slightly, the titanic goddess maneuvered her pinky toe on top of an almost invisible red dot that was covering a large portion of the minuscule planet.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my,\u201d the larger woman spoke, \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel good when <i>you\u2019re</i> the defeated one, now does it?\u201d </span></div></div>",

If you want my toe off of your body, simply push it off of you. C\u2019mon, go for it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell...How the hell can she hear me?\u201d Kallen asked herself as she tried to push the planet-sized pinky toe off of her frame with all of her might. Try as she could, Kallen\u2019s efforts were utterly futile, her arms not able to move the mass of flesh on top of her in the slightest. <i>If I could only get bigger, I\u2019d bring this Brittanian scum back down to her proper size. But, with her toe pinning me down like this, I don\u2019t have any room to expand further. I\u2019ve gotta find a way to have her let me go so I can outgrow her...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s quite a simple explanation,\u201d the titanic catgirl began. \u201cYou see, even though I may be much, much, much larger than you are, I can hear you quite clearly, almost as if we were having a normal conversation. My hunch is that in addition to breathing in space, I\u2019ve acquired this ability as well in order to interact with tinier populations...or, in this case, one self-righteous bimbo who believes that completely destroying the planet will achieve her goal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bimbo?! Who are you calling a bimbo, you overgrown Brittanian trash?!\u201d Kallen countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare you have the tenacity to speak to a princess of the royal family like that after what you\u2019ve done?!\u201d Euphie sternly asked her prisoner. \u201cWeren\u2019t you ever taught any manners as to how you address royalty such as myself? Well then, why don\u2019t I give you a quick course in proper etiquette?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat beginning to enjoy the expansive size difference between herself and her captive, Euphie smiled as she gradually bent downwards towards her foot, making sure not to accidentally crush anything with her large breasts as her chest soon was positioned directly in front of the tiny speck of a cosmic entity known as Earth. Moving her right arm very slowly, the colossal princess eventually positioned her index finger right next to her pinky toe, annihilating an area of more than 3000 square miles with her finger\u2019s impact on the planet. With a quick movement of her appendage, Euphemia scooped up Kallen from beneath her toe and quickly curled her finger against her palm once the bunny girl was in her possession; since the speed of the Brittanian\u2019s movements was so incredibly fast, the former Black Knight did not have any time to begin a quick growth spurt before her body was restrained once again, the minuscule CC still trapped in her bust as well. With a playful giggle, Euphemia\u2019s smile slightly widened as she formed her hand into a complete fist and gently began to raise it to her eye level while simultaneously removing her foot from the planet\u2019s surface, leaving an immense imprint of her toe into the earth\u2019s crust, its depth piercing into the earth\u2019s magma mantle and spanning a horizontal distance of over 10000 miles.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, where was I...?\u201d Euphemia asked herself aloud. \u201cAh yes, I remember now. I owe you an etiquette lesson, don\u2019t I? Well, let\u2019s begin shall we? When addressing royalty such as myself, you are to refer to them using their noble title before calling them by name. For example, I am Princess Euphemia li Brittania. Now, you try it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stubborn redhead quickly gathered a small amount of saliva in her mouth and spit as far as she possibly could onto the top right portion of Euphemia\u2019s fist. \u201cGo to hell, you worthless Brittanian piece of garbage!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal noble slowly closed her eyes and shook her head from side to side in utter disappointment. \u201cTisk, tisk, tisk. Can\u2019t even do that, I see. Well, perhaps a little bit of discipline will change your tone...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, the gargantuan catgirl clenched her right fist tighter, causing her captive to let out loud, agonizing screams of pain as a smirk crossed Euphie's face. \u201cThis is for all those you hurt with your fighting on the planet!\u201d Euphie quickly clenched her fist as hard as she possibly could then quickly released her grip to its previous strength, the sudden movement forcing the minuscule Area 11 revolutionary to yell out in sheer anguish, the sudden stress placed upon her body almost causing all 5 lumbar bones in her spinal column to break simultaneously. \u201cSo, are you ready to cooperate now and face the justice you so rightly deserve?\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All I wanted was to return my people back to their former glory\u2026a glory you Brittanian scum took from us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were going power mad and destroying the world beneath your feet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you weren\u2019t?! Look at your handiwork your<i> Highness.\u201d </i>Kallen gestured to the planet by Euphie\u2019s feet, littered with craters and partially demolished from Euphie\u2019s toe on it minutes before. \u201cMy battle for Japan might cost a few thousand lives, but you wiped out <i>millions!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEuphie backed away, or\u2026floated away as it was. The horror in her eyes was clear, her resolve weakened, \u201c\u2026But\u2026I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen grinned; this was just what she needed. \u201cYou what? You focused so much on growth you forgot about the world around you? You wiped out half the planet just to capture one girl? You\u2019re a Brittanian alright. <i>No</i> empathy, <i>no </i>feelings for the people.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Princess faltered again, her grip on Kallen weakening.<i> \u201cB-But\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts! You have to be held accountable for your actions Princess!\u201d Euphie continued to falter, her grip nearly vanishing entirely. Another push and it would be over and done with. \u201cHow does it feel knowing you killed your own family\u2026? Your beloved sister\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it, Euphie was finished. Kallen readied herself to grow back into victory as her hand began to slide open, but a voice commanded Euphemia otherwise. <i>\u201cDon\u2019t let her manipulate you Euphemia.\u201d</i> The voice was completely monotone, devoid of any emotion. Kallen clicked her tongue, <i>Damn, forgot about her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what had almost happened, Euphie tightened her grip again. \u201cWhere did that voice come from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to have forgotten there were two women fighting before you arrived.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEuphie remembered right away, \u201cYou\u2019re that green-haired woman that was trying to stop this girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere should be a green dot hidden away in the cleavage of the girl you\u2019re holding.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon further examination Euphie realized C.C. was right, hidden deep within the red bug she held was a smaller green one, held right in the cleavage of the woman. Euphie poked her free hand\u2019s nail as close as it could go, \u201cCan you reach that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. reached from the depths of Kallen\u2019s cleavage to grab Euphie\u2019s nail, a large, piercing blade that was dangerously close to Kallen\u2019s throat, not that it bothered the immortal girl . With her captor unable to move it was no problem at all freeing herself and climbing on Euphie\u2019s nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEuphie brought her closer to her eyes, \u201cThank you for stopping me from letting this criminal go. What is your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall me C.C.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess blinked, initials? Certainly odd\u2026although not much odder than three giantesses who outsized each other. \u201cThank you C.C\u2026I may have destroyed so much, but the least I can do is prevent this woman-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKallen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-Kallen from destroying the rest of the world.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. looked back to the planet far below. Being the smallest, she could best see the state of affairs; the Earth wasn\u2019t fairing too well to say the least. \u201cActually Princess\u2026I have a different idea\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess tiled her head to the side, \u201cAn idea? What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch didn\u2019t mince words, \u201cDestroy the Earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! Why would you even suggest something like that!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. stared unflinchingly into the eyes that dwarfed her, \u201cBecause you don\u2019t see what I see. That world is no longer hospital.  One half is already gone and wiped out, the other half is suffering in an upturned world as the results of our giant squabble tear the environment to shreds. It\u2019d be an act of mercy to ease their suffering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEuphie opened her mouth to speak, but found no words. The inner turmoil of such an act battled with in her, but deep down she knew C.C. was right. \u201cBut\u2026But I can\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me free and I\u2019ll wipe it out with you!\u201d Kallen called from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. ignored her, \u201cI figured as much, so I propose an alternative. A contract.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cContract?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. laid a hand against the nail she was on, sending a cycle of images through Euphemia\u2019s mind. \u201cYes, a contract for power\u2026It will isolate you. Such is the fate of those who wield the Power of Kings. But it will give you the power to defy Destiny itself. You will become more; you will gain a power unlike any other. Do you accept this contract?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEuphie gulped, this contract she was offered sounded scary. She didn\u2019t understand what she was seeing; it was like watching a thousand years of history flying by in seconds. What had she gotten herself into? Regardless, it was the only option she had\u2026in this world of her mind Euphie spoke in a regal voice. \u201cI, Euphemia Li Brittania accept this contract!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in reality, Euphie looked down to the green dot on her fingernail, eyes red with a familiar sigil on them...The power of the Kings...Geass</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Euphie said no words; she only looked to the one who gave her this power of Geass. Her body was acting of its own accord, looking to C.C. with such a deep focus it almost made her dizzy. Why she was doing it, she didn\u2019t know. But it was having a surprising effect; C.C. was growing! A reddish aura surrounded the woman, and slowly her body grew from more than a speck. Soon she was Kallen\u2019s size, and later she was beyond that. C.C., not showing any sign of surprise, leapt away from Euphie towards an empty spot in space; where her growth continued without fear of interruption. Euphie and Kallen watched in shock (and the latter\u2019s horror) as C.C.\u2019s expanding frame soon came to half Euphie\u2019s size, quickly moving past that until she was even to Euphie in every way. She was across from the Princess, facing the other side of the Earth. As the growth came to a halt Euphie snapped out of her trance, eyes reverting to normal. \u201cW-What just happened\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. spoke as if nothing had even happened, \u201cThat is the power you have been given Euphemia. The power to determine the size of anything and everything.\u201d She stopped to look at Kallen, petrified by the sight of another bigger than her. A small smirk formed, \u201cHow does it feel being an insect to me again Kallen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead was unable to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEuphie gasped, \u201cYou mean\u2026I can change anything\u2019s size now?\u201d She looked back to the Earth, could she go back and live her life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant green-haired girl followed her gaze, \u201cYes, but as I said to you before. That planet is no longer a place to live. It\u2019d be far better to just wipe it out than let the people suffer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t do that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is why I am here.\u201d C.C. positioned her big and second toes around the chaotic planet. \u201cGive the word and I will do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026what about everyone still alive? I can\u2019t forsake all of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are already forsaken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-Bu-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve have been granted authority Euphemia. Now choose! Let the people suffer or ease their pain?\u201d There was nothing else to be said, C.C. was right and Euphemia knew it. So, with a heavy heart, she did what she knew to be best. She nodded and right away, C.C. clenched her toes together. The lives of the remaining millions vanished in an instant. All that remained was the debris between the green-haired giantess\u2019 toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization struck the Princess suddenly, instantly she kneeled over and began to cry, releasing Kallen in order to cover her tearing eyes. Finally seeing a chance, Kallen focused on growing yet again, but similar to Euphie, C.C. grabbed her before she got the chance. She paid the redhead no mind though; her eyes were only filled with concern for the weeping Princess. She embraced the girl in her arms, \u201cYou did well Euphemia\u2026You saved millions from a hellish fate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I killed them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou chose Death instead of a painful Life. It was a tough decision, but you chose the right choice. It may be the first time, but it won\u2019t be the last. Such is the curse of people like us.\u201d C.C. stuck the flowing pink hair of her Highness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Like\u2026us\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. brought Euphie\u2019s face up to hers, \u201cI told you. Accepting that contract gave you a power, it made you more. You are now a higher being, and because of you, I am now one too. We are Goddesses now. Beings in charge of Life and Death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word made Euphie freeze in stunned amazement, \u201cGoddesses\u2026?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect. And we never need to be alone. We can be one another\u2019s companion, their friend\u2026even their lover. We will run this universe as the Goddesses it needs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint blush formed on Euphie face, \u201c\u2026Lovers\u2026?\u201d Her face began to unconsciously lean forward, as did C.C.\u2019s. \u201cYes, we\u2019re all each other has, we need to make the most of it\u2026\u201d Their noses touched and they paused, expecting one to lead them through the final step. It was soon made as a joint decision, their lips embraced for the first of many times. Euphie\u2019s heart fluttered in a way she never felt before, even Suzaku hadn\u2019t ever made her feel quite like this. The pink-haired Goddess truly felt like C.C. could be all she ever needed. Their lips pulled apart and Euphie looked to her companion with a mixture of adoration and joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026never knew I could enjoy something like this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. smiled, \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised what you can be capable of Goddess Euphemia\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEuphie chuckled, \u201cThat will take some getting used to\u2026\u201d A stray thought wandered into her mind, \u201c\u2026Wait\u2026what about Kallen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. brought the miniscule redhead near their faces, her form held firmly between two fingers. \u201cAll Goddesses need a worshipper. Perhaps we need to ensure she doesn\u2019t try to outsize us though?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEuphie looked to the redhead, the Geass sigil appearing again. A red light bathed the girl in its glow, but nothing else happened. \u201cShe\u2026shouldn\u2019t be able to grow anymore\u2026I\u2019m still new with this power though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C. confidently slipped the girl into her vast cleavage, \u201cI know you did a good job\u2026\u201d  She pulled Euphie closer for another kiss\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Empire of Britannia fought for world domination. Nothing had seemed to be able to stop them, but one day, the mysterious Zero appeared in Area 11 and led a rebellion which was growing stronger every day. Zero, who was actually Lelouche, a former Britannian prince. If things continue that way, he might even be able to stop the empire. V2 could not let that happen. He had to make sure his and his brother\u2019s plan would succeed. Luckily, after years of research, the order had found a way to create a new kind of Geass. A Geass that would not influence people\u2019s minds, but reality itself. He did not know yet if it would work and how powerful that Geass would be, but surely no-one would be able to rival such power. Unfortunately, V2 was not able to gain a Geass himself, so he had to find another person to bestow it onto. And he already had the right person in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city had been evacuated as the rebellion army approached. They had secured the place and now, they were taking cover between the buildings. The Tokyo settlement was near, but the Britannian army blocked their way. Their enemies were about to attack, so Zero was waiting, using the terrain to his advantage. They would crush the enemy troops and then, they could attack the settlement directly. Soon, Area 11 would be free. Then, hope would spread across the world and more rebellions would break out. Zero smiled behind his mask. Victory was getting closer with each passing day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eZero, the enemy started his attack, but\u2026\u201c It was Kallen. She approached Zero, but something seemed wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eWhat is it?\u201c, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eWell, only one Knightmare is attacking. The rest of the army is still waiting.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eWhat? Is it Suzaku, again?\u201c Confused, Zero went outside to get a clearer view of the situation. It was true. One single Knightmare was approaching. But it was not his friend and rival. Instead, it was the personal Knightmare of Cornelia. \u201eIs this some kind of trap?\u201c Zero\u2019s thoughts were racing. Was it a decoy? But why? Anyway, he had to act, fast. Cornelia\u2019s Knightmare had already entered the city and showed no sign of stopping. \u201eAttack!\u201c, Zero commanded. The Knightmares positioned nearby opened fire and destroyed the enemy\u2019s vehicle with ease. Zero took a binocular and looked closer. Impossible, in between the Knightmare-wreck stood Cornelia, unharmed. Not even her clothes were damaged, save for some dust on them. \u201eWhat kind of trick is this?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to Zero\u2019s horror, he saw a red Geass blinking in Cornelia\u2019s eyes. But before he was able to recover from this shock, something else happened that made his jaw drop. Cornelia started growing. First slowly, then speeding up until she stopped at around 200 feet tall. \u201eToday, this little rebellion ends. Surrender now. If you insist on struggling, you will be crushed like the insects you are!\u201c, she declared with one hand on her hips and a superior smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero finally closed his mouth and gritted his teeth. That was unexpected, but he would not fail just because his enemy surprised him. \u201eShe might be bigger, but that does not make her invincible! Attack her with full strength! Show the Britannians that the higher you are, the deeper you will fall!\u201c Encouraged by the words of their leader, the rebels overcame their shock, let out numerous battle cries and started shooting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Cornelia was way faster than her size should allow her to be. She dashed forward as multiple rockets exploded behind her. She crushed the closest Knightmare under one of her boots, then kicked another one into a building. Still, she was standing in the middle of the rebel\u2019s Knightmares and bullets were hailing on her from all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to his frustration, Zero had to find out that Cornelia\u2019s skin seemed to have gotten more resistant as well. Most bullets just bounced off and yet\u2026 He smiled triumphantly as he saw that after a while, wounds started to form on her body. Cornelia\u2019s face changed from furious to painful. She looked around, saw a gab between two buildings and dashed through it, kicking the Knightmares which were positioned there away. \u201eShe must not flee!\u201c, Zero shouted. The rebels charged after her, continuing their assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, Cornelia stopped, taking cover behind a tall building. Then, her voice echoed again across the city. \u201eIt seems I was over-confident. I thought I could take you out at that size, but I was wrong. Well then, how about this?\u201c With that, her Geass was glowing again. The rebels stopped and watched in awe and horror, as the princess was growing again. Higher and higher she rose into the air, until her head was visible over the building. The Knightmares which had charged after her turned around and fled from the princess of battle, who was now more like a goddess of war. An angry goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero cursed as he had to watch helplessly when Cornelia ran towards the city\u2019s center again, casually crushing Knightmares under her boots. Each of her steps made the ground shake and the few rockets that were shot by some remaining brave soldiers just bounced off ineffectively. Kallen looked at the 1000 feet Britannian princess, then at Zero. \u201eW\u2026what should we do?\u201c \u201eLet me think!\u201c Zero turned around, walking in circles. The noise created by Cornelia\u2019s footsteps made it hard for him to focus. They could not face her openly anymore. She was just too big. But they had been prepared for an attack of a superior foe. Of course, they were thinking of a large army, not a giant woman, but still, the traps they had build should also work on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eDetonate the bombs in the underground structure!\u201c Under the city, there was a vast and deep network of tunnels. The sewers, but also remains of some underground facilities. Upon detonating the bombs, the ground beneath Cornelia gave in and she fell. To her, it was not deep, but she still sank in almost to her knees. That was enough to make her fall. \u201eNow, the buildings!\u201c More bombs exploded and let the surrounding buildings collapse upon the titanic princess. She screamed in pain. \u201eNow, finish her off!\u201c Filled with new hope, the rebels opened fire on Cornelia again. After almost a minute of shooting, Zero commanded them to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust lifted, a victorious smile formed on his face. Cornelia lay there, covered in wreckage, multiple wounds on her body. \u201eYou did it!\u201c, Kallen said happily. Zero nodded, but then, another thought crossed his mind. \u201eThe Britannian army!\u201c He looked again toward the enemy, but their troops still did not move. Then, he could feel his blood freeze as he heard a rumbling noise. Looking down on Cornelia, he had to watch in shock as she slowly rose up again. You could see her feeling pain with every move, but her wounds were slowly disappearing. Then, as she looked up, directly staring at the rooftop of the highest building, Zero\u2019s current position, the rebel leader had to take a step back. Cornelia\u2019s face was a mask of pure anger. \u201eZero!\u201c, she screamed. \u201eYou will pay for this!\u201c Zero could feel his hands starting to shake as he had to watch powerlessly when Cornelia made her next move.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, the building started to sink into the ground. But there was no rumbling or shaking. Confused, Zero looked over the edge of the roof. The base of the building was fine. But strangely, the ground around it seemed to move away. Finally, he realized what was going on. The building was somehow shrinking. Even worse, everyone on it was shrinking as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to evacuate, quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunately, there were no knightmares on the roof. They had to walk all the way down and the building was shrinking at an alarming rate. A loud booming noise accompanied with a rumble woke him from his thoughts. Looking behind, he saw two giant, white boots. His gaze wandered up to eventually find C.C.'s expressionless eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C.C., how...?\", he started. But the green-haired girl grabbed him and Kallen, who had already shrunken down to a few inches tall. \"I am not affected by Geass, remember?\" With that, she just jumped down the building, which by now was only a few meters high. She then quickly ran behind the rebel's lines. Finally, Zero came back to his senses. \"Damn, why haven't you been faster.\" A stare of C.C. silenced him. At her size, she was pretty intimidating. \"Be grateful I wasn't slower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero looked back. The building had stopped shrinking and was not much bigger than C.C.'s boots. If he were still on there... Behind the empty place where the skyscraper once stood, Cornelia's massive form rose into the air. \"Hm, maybe I should have targeted a larger area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero cursed. \"Damn! I can't let strategy loose against the sheer power of one person. How can we defeat a power like that?\" The question was aimed at C.C.. The green-haired girl seemed to think for a while before answering. \"That is a form of Geass I thought could never exist. I'm not sure how it works, but maybe... maybe I could at least create a Geass that can counter it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero nodded. \"Fine. Then give it to me.\" The witch shook her head. \"No, that's not possible. You already have one. But she can have it.\" C.C. looked at Kallen. The redhead looked at Zero. Her eyes told him that she was willing to accept it. \"Ok, Kallen. I believe in you.\" A thunderous \"Ahem!\" caught his attention. \"Oh, and in you too, C.C.!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mark on the green-haired witch's forehead then began to glow as she bestowed Kallen with the new Geass. \"Ok, try it out.\" Kallen's Geass glowed and slowly, she and Zero grew bigger and bigger. After a short while, C.C. had to place them down and eventually, they were back to normal. \"Excellent.\", Zero said enthusiastically. \"Now, bring her down to size.\" He pointed at Cornelia who had now reached the rebels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple-haired goddess lifted one of her white boots. \"Time to die, bu-uh?\" She started dwindling in size. Loosing her balance, she put her foot back down and took a step back. \"No way!\" Her Geass was glowing again and her shrinking stopped. \"What's going on?\", Zero asked, looking at C.C. She looked at Cornelia. \"The Geass' are interfering. Kallen uses her Geass to reverse Cornelia's growth, but simultaneously, Cornelia uses her Geass to grow again.\" Zero thought about that. \"So as long as Kallen keeps this up, Cornelia is stuck at that size. Fine, then we have a chance now! All rebel forces, ATTACK!\"</span></div></div>",

A man can shrink but he can only interact with girls, and only girls can grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No scat or toilet material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don't use too many curse words in a single add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Unless they are choice chapters, no single sentence adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Nothing gay, except for yuri aka girlxgirl.
