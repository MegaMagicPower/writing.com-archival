I have been traveling through the void of spaces for more than a month, supplies are running low and so is fuel. I doubt Earth has built a fuel station this far from Earth. I look to my right to see a giant planet infront of me and I smile sadly. \"Kind of looks like Earth\" I say to myself before letting out another sad sigh. My father use to work for the government, After he found out how corrupt it was he tried to leave. The saying goes <i>Once you join the Government, your in it for life</i>, Funny though, My family was rich once, I could have anything I wanted if I wished for it, In 24 hours though I had nothing. The government stormed our home with G.I (Government Intelligence) Officers and began shooting my entire family to death. I barely managed to escape by taking a spaceship I had gotten for my 16th birthday after getting my licence. That was 2 years ago. Its sad, I miss my family but moaning about it will get you nothing when your on the run. Another bad part about it is the Government knows everything about me, They even made up false charges on me, I am wanted for High Treason, Theft, Murder of Government Officials and of course Organized Crime. None of its true, I have killed Government members but that was afterwards when they decided to shove a assault rifle in my face. I lean back in my ship once more and turn the ship on auto pilot before resting my eyes. I'm most likely going to die within the next few days, I had just escaped a Government ship carrier the other day by jumping into hyper speed and now I have no idea where I am. A ship carrier was thought up from Aircraft carriers but instead of being large giant boats they are giant platforms packed with cannons and spaceships. I took minor damage that I could repair at the next station but I have not seen one yet. I sigh and decide to relax and not worry about myself dying in space alone and within a few moments I fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>2 hours...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snap out of my sleep and I look at whats happening to see red lights flickering like crazy and the on board computer saying Warning! over and over in my face. I turn off auto pilot and I stare in fear to see myself barreling through the Atmosphere of the large blue and green planet. \"OH SHIT!!\" I shout before flicking a few switches and I begin trying to pull up out of the atmosphere but the word <i>STALL</i>flashes infront of me before I begin dropping. Its too late!, I have already passed the atmosphere and Im not dropping!. \"Shit shit shit shit!\" I shout before pulling a switch for the hyper speed but the word <i>ERROR</i> flashes in red. \"GOD DAMMIT!\" I shout before aiming the nose down hoping to gain speed so I can pull up. \"120 miles, 170 miles, 260 miles\" I say as my heart races. I can see blue tree's below on the ground. \"360 miles, 430, 500 mi...\" I begin to say as I pull back to pull up but then something goes wrong, oh so very wrong. I hear a ear shattering loud noise that sounds like metal bending before the entire ship jerks to the side and I begin spinning. <i>FIRE!, WARNING, CRITICAL DAMAGE!</i> all flash infront of me. My best guess is the speed and drag from the atmosphere just tore the left back wing off. A hundred things flash through my head at once on what to do and I have an Idea, my only chance. I grab the dufflebag to my left before pulling the strap around my neck and shoulder. I grab the lever attached to my chair before taking 2 deep breaths and trying to time it right. After 2 more seconds I pull the lever and in a millisecond the top shoots off the cockpit and the seat is launched up out of my ship. It did not work as I was hoping. The second I left the ship the pilot seat began spinning around in circles. I could breath cause I was screaming the whole time till the parachute launched and the spinning stopped but not before 2 of the cords get tangled with me and the seat. The parachute definitely slows me down but not slow enough, I know that when I hit the ground its going to be a hard landing. I see my ship crash into a small clearing in the forest and exploding upon impact, sending flames and smoke soaring through the air with flaming shrapnel raining down around it. I look down to see the tree's rapidly approaching and I take a deep breath before I crash into the tree tops. The blue leaves and wood break like toothpicks. In a flash I find myself falling again this time with no parachute do to it either being torn off or shredded to bits by something. I scream in terror before I hit a larger tree branch which sends me rolling into another tree which I crash up against. Blue flashes infront of my eyes before I smash face first into a branch. The back support snaps in half before I fall forward to the blue and green ground. The last thing I see is a blue leaf and then darkness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I open my eyes groggily before groaning in pain, My entire body aches. Infront of me is a stone ceiling made out of some kind of sand colored stone. The room I am in smells fresh and like the forest with a weird union smell in the room. \"Huki?\" asks something and my eyes shoot wide open before turning my head to the right to see....I don't know what it is. The best way to describe it would be a wolf standing on 2 feet. The difference is that its body is more....human. It stands up straight and its hands have 5 fingers with claws on the end of them. Its feet are...paws, not feet and its face is like that of a wolfs with a muzzle, wet nose and pointy ears. From the word it spoke earlier it is female, It wasn't growly or struggled as I would expect from something with a face like that, It had been...Normal. Her fur is obsidian black and she wares robes the same shade of black. The robes look well kept and has 3 blood red lines around the sleeves and the bottom of the robe. The hood that currently was on her head was trimmed with red and her eyes also are blood red and seemed to glow lightly in the dim room. \"Wha?!?!\" I scream in terror and shock but I instantly regretted it from the sharp pain in my jaw and I groaned in pain. \"Ket dak unk lamk\" says the creature softly to me and I stare at it in confusion. What the hell was this thing saying?! \"What?!\" I ask confused but groin again for it hurts to talk. \"Ru ur karf\" it says to me softly again before lightly with her fingers touching my chest and I get the idea. I lay back down slowly and let out another groan. It hurt, So very badly. I closed my eyes and just when it couldn't get any worse, it did. Pain rockets into my head and I feel tears roll down my cheeks. The FUCKING PAIN! it hurts so bad!, Its in my legs, My arms, My chest, My head, My jaw and fuck! Even my damn ass hurts right now!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Please!...What ever you are! Make the pain stop!\" I beg turning my head to see the creature returning to the room with a bucket and some supplies. Great! is this thing going to slit my throat and drink my blood?!. \"Fikal\" it says to me softly again before I hear something dipped into a liquid before dripping as she wrings out a cloth and then gently begins cleaning my face. The water is cold and numbs the pain in my head and I sigh lightly. When she is done she gently pulls the blankets back off my body to reveal my legs all bandaged up and held in place by wooden supports, I am guessing I broke them. My chest was wrapped up tightly in them as well meaning I most likely broke a few ribs and my arms are heavily bruised. \"Rut Baleka ur brankik\" she says to me pointing to my legs and then my chest. \"Listen...Lady...I don't know what your saying\" I say through the pain in my jaw before she picks up a stick....that's blue and points to my legs and chest before snapping the stick in half. Ok, My bones are broken. \"W-whats your name?\" I manage through the pain and she just stares at me without any comprehension of what I am saying, GOD DAMMIT!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Me\" I say pointing to myself and she looks at my hand as I point at my face. \"Alan\" I say before I point to here. \"You?\" I ask in a questioning tone so she gets what I am asking. \"A\" she says pointing to herself. \"Naika\" she says and gives me a small smile, Amazing how she can do that with a muzzle. \"You\" she says using my language but from how she speaks it I can tell she is not familiar with it. \"Alan\" she says gently laying a finger on my forehead and I nod. \"I, Naika\" she says and I smile lightly before she gives a small smile back and then takes the cloth from the bucket before wringing it out again and then gently putting it onto my head before gently taking my arm in her fur covered hands. The palm has a pawpad which I find makes sense or else they wouldn't be able to hold anything properly. She covers her hand in a green lotion before gently spreading it over my bruised arm. Instant relief!, Its like the first moment ice cream hits your tongue and feels so lovely, The pain seems to melt away and I let out a happy sigh. This would make doctors on Earth Jealous!, Freezing doesn't do anything compared to this!, Its not to cold or unpleasant at all. Naika begins humming something silently, its a very relaxing melody that calms me down considerably. Minutes go by and within a few moments I fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I slowly open my eyes to find myself feeling a hell of a lot better than last night. I look to my right to see sunlight visible on the floor from a window. \"Naika?\" I ask and in a few moments she comes inside the house from somewhere and smiles at me before a look of curiosity paints itself onto her face before she holds up my dufflebag. IT SURVIVED!!. \"Oh fuck yes...\" I say staring at it and she gives me a curious look. This will take some getting use to. I gesture with my arm for her to bring it to me before I thank her which she gives me a blank stare with, Aka not understanding a fucking word I say. I unzipped the top and prayed it was...YES! IT IS!. I pulled my laptop out of my bag before sitting up and...wait...didn't I have broken ribs yesterday?. Looking down I saw the bandages to be gone and I stared in shock. \"How the...\" I said before Naika tapped my shoulder and then stepped back a bit before resting her hands flat together and resting her head on them to imitate sleep before holding up a page that had 5 lines drawn on it. I've been asleep five da....Wait, FIVE DAYS?! How the hell did I heal?!. FUCK I WISH I COULD ASK HER SO MUCH!!. \"I'll ask later\" I muttered silently but she heard it and shrugged, Still no clue. I opened up my laptop and hit the power button and the screen turned on. The desktop picture was of me and my family. Naika noticed my look and looked at the picture before getting an idea of why I was looking at it. I clicked the internet and it got no signal. \"Figures\" I said unsurprised before looking through my other programs and then closing the laptop. I looked through the bag a little more and I pulled another bag up before seeing my fire arms and I smile. Atleast I got a weapon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I finally could walk. My entire body had healed like a snap but what delayed me from being mobile was nerve damage. Amazingly this soup Naika had fed me for a month and a half restored Nerves, It was made from a root called Jykadin Root. In its raw form it was bright blue but when it was cooked it turned green and slightly transparent. Over the past 2 months I began to pick up Volfakia which was the species name and language name. Naika also picked up on English. Overall by now she could speak it well enough so I understood her though she needed help on a lot of words here and there to describe things, I was the same though Volfakia was a hell of a lot harder to learn. The language did not have a normal alphabet, It did not go from A to Z simply, It had letters going the normal direction as well as 2 branches that branched off from the first letter which was called La and then curved in a half circle till it reached the final letter Ket. The entire alphabet was just the beginning. The writing was god aweful. It had ZERO similarities to Earth languages. It was made up of Squares, Circles and triangles that were all connected by a single line that usually branched out to more symbols and lines that branched out to even more. It gives me a headache trying to read that shit!. Its not read from left to right, its read top, down, left, left, left, diagonal down left, down, down, diagonal down right etc till you end up with the page of writing being a circle of lines with different shapes that had shapes inside them and sometimes other little symbols above those!. The language itself had to be spoken extremely fast which was god aweful. Naika loved English though. She easily picked up on the writing system and I made my own little ABC paper to teach her the alphabet and different symbols we used like the question Mark. I also got to know more about her a little more as she picked up on my language and I picked up on hers. She was the local healer of the town of Densholm and usually was gone for around 5 hours total throughout the day, Here they made home visits still and she usually had to go and find a solution for someones sickness or tend to a wounded soldier. From what she described the civilization to be like her race was much more....behind mine...A good two thousand years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Volfakia in comparison lived in a mix between Medieval times and the Roman Empire. Like humans they were the only intelligent race on there planet. There were 2 kingdoms, The North, and the South. The North was Ruled by the 675th Monarch Queen Kaiza while the south was ruled by there 433rd monarch King Stirralt, We were in the North, That is all the history I knew currently, I had not been able to discuss the religion or anything like that. \"Good Morning\" says Naika somehow appearing out of nowhere in the space inbetween the room I have been in and the other room. \"Good Morning Naika, Sleep well?\" I ask her curiously while I get use to standing on my legs again. Its not that I couldn't move my legs, The issue that Naika found out was that my legs would not be able to support my body weight, technically I was a cripple, But unlike earth that has medicine that shreds the hell out of your body instead of actually helping you the Jykadin root repaired my nerves and muscles, Thinking back on everything makes me smile slightly. \"I sleep well\" she replies and I smile lightly. \"I slept well\" I correct her and she smiles. \"I slept well then\" she says with her tail that pokes out the back of her robes where a humans tail bone would be wags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand up and in a flash Naika is beside me and steadies me. \"I guess being in bed for 2 months kind of messes you up\" I say and she gives a small smile at my comment. \"take\" she says giving me a walking stick and I take a few practice steps. Its uneasy and I almost fall twice but after 20 minutes I find my balance returning though my legs are already exhausted. \"My god I am out of shape\" I comment to myself and she nods lightly before smiles. \"Muscles will be better soon, Must rebuild strength with good food\" she says with a hint of excitement before quickly moving into the other room and soon returning with another wooden bowl of stew. \"I've already eaten 2...\" I say looking down at the stew. It has a blue broth with small green chunks of some kind of vegetable and more Jykadin root with the same kind of meat as usually, It tasted like chicken with a hint of buttery taste. \"More food is better\" she says before turning around and walking out of the room. After a few more minutes she returns to view but walks to the animal skin that is her door to outside. \"I be back in 2 hours, Make muscles stronger but not hurt yourself\" she explains and I nod. \"See you then\" I reply before she lifts the skin and disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next two hours I spend my time finishing my bowl of soup, Walking around the room with the walking stick and exploring Naika's house for the first time. Past my room is...well a storage/kitchen. On the walls that I could not see are all different kinds of tools. Things that look like scalpel's to things as simple as bandages. The scalpels of course not like earths were simply very small knifes without a hilt guard but they did look razor sharp. There were bowls and plates and other eating surfaces on shelfs. I also found a wooden jar filled with the Jykadin root and another filled with something else. On the other wall around the corner was a fireplace with a large square hole in the roof of Naika's house big enough for the smoke of the fire to escape. The fire was huge but what made it really cool was that its flames were flickering between blue and green. A pit had been made when the house had been build and around it was a chair that I expected Naika sat on usually. It was simple and made of wood. Past my current room I found a staircase leading downstairs and another animal skin over a door which I expected was Naika's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI approach the stairs and look down to see its quite simple, 8 steps and then a dark room. Sighing softly I slowly begin maneuvering my way down the stairs and make it without incident. I enter the dark room to find where all of Naika's healing herbs and all her other solutions are. The room is full of shelves with hundreds of wooden and clay containers. Like all the wood its blue in color and I find myself relaxed by the smell of the room from all the herbs. Turning around I very carefully make my way back up the stairs before stopping at Naika's room. Out of curiosity I lift up the animal skin to see its quite simple. The floor is covered in furs and her bed like mine in the other room is not nearly as well crafted as the ones they had on earth. It was simply a flat wooden surface with furs stacked up like a mattress and then furs ontop for blankets. Not wanting to make Naika think I was rude or weird I turn around and walk back into the main area. I am really curious what its like outdoors and what the civilization is like here but it will have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to my right on the shelf again I grab a book and I look at the cover and its in Volfakia, Same with the pages. \"Screw it\" I say putting it back before Naika comes inside again and gives me a kind smiles. \"Legs OK?\" she asks and I nod. \"A little weak but getting better\" I say and she nods smiling before walking past me into her room. I take a seat in the wooden chair and rest my hands on top of the stick. \"I feel old like this\" I say for a joke to myself before Naika returns and begins making food.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I am awoken by something loud and I instantly sit up in bed before climbing out and walking out into the main room to find Naika picking up arrows and putting them back into a quiver. \"Good morning\" she says not looking up and I give a slight nod. \"May I come out with you?\" I ask and she looks up at me. \"Are you sure?\" she asks and I nod. \"I've been stuck in your home for 2 months, I wish to come with you\" I say and she debates it. \"K\" she says simply before I turn around and pull off the blank brown robe I have been wearing for the past while and I get dressed into my Earth clothing once more, Blue Jeans, Grey shirt, black boots and a black hoody is what I choose. I reach into my dufflebag before pulling out one of my favorite weapons, The Xavier. The Xavier is a black rifle with a detachable scope and a handle that can be pulled back so you can hold it like a sword. Holding the rifle this way and clicking the button on the side causes a razor sharp blade to pop out, making the Xavier a sword in a matter of seconds. The butt that you usually have against your shoulder becomes a hilt guard and another cool function is that you can still pull the trigger while it is in the sword function. The Magazines hold 24 bullets and one can be held inside the handle for a quick reload. Its light, its mean and it is definitely deadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaika gives me a questioning look at it and I give her a smile. \"What is that?\" she asks and I couldn't be happier to explain. \"This is the Xavier, Both a hunting rifle, sniper rifle and a sword with a flick of the wrist\" I say proudly and she smiles again. \"This is a Huk bow\" she says smiling and holding up the blue bow. It looks like a longbow to me but blue and wrapped in a black grip where her hands are. \"So what are we hunting?\" I ask and she smiles. \"A Habla\" she says and I give a questionable look. \"Yummy food, Clean animal, You'll love taste\" She says forgetting \"the\" in her sentence but I smile and nod. \"Alright\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Exiting Naika's house I am met with a very different world infront of me. Infront of me are thousands upon thousands of tree's, all dark blue with a lighter blue for the leafs. Infront of me is a sun still not high in the sky and providing light for the forest below. Below I could see other homes for Volfakia. Below the sun was a mountain range with one giant overhang in the middle of it. Past the village was a large river and the sky was light blue with small clouds in the sky. \"Beautiful\" I say to myself. It reminded me sort of like the photo's of Earth in the 21rst century, As far as the eye can see in beauty, Nothing is like that anymore from Earth, its all sad and...dead. \"It is\" says Naika behind me before beginning to walk down a path and I follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path forked after moving half down the mountain side to the right and led into a thick forest. The forest floor was covered in blue leaves that had fallen from above and was sprinkled with bushes. The tree leaves here reminded me of Maple leafs from Maple Tree's from back on earth though they were slightly different. On a maple leaf, for example the Canadian flag you have 3 separate parts of the Maple leaf that has little spikey parts on them. Take the middle part of the leaf out and remove the little spiked parts and add hundreds of them all over the leaf edges and then cover the leaf in a weird small amount of oil, that's what a Huk leaf looks like. \"Why do all the leafs fall?\" I ask even though its kind of a stupid question but I want to know to see if they have seasons. \"Huk tree's drop them to stop insects\" Naika replies looking at our surroundings while we walk. \"Oh are the Insects parasitic to Huk tree's?\" I ask curiously and she shakes her head. \"Zirylla, Goddess of Life made Huk tree's so the animals would have homes\" she replied. \"Oh, How many gods do you have?\" I ask jogging up so I am walking beside my friend. \"Five, Zirylla, Dykaro, Zabathen, Lorsha and Oblyk\" she replies before smiling. \"What about your race?\" she asks tilting her head slightly. \"Well...Religion on my planet is not the same, On my planet my race has fought against each other due to there beliefs, We had Christianity, Islam, Buddhist, Jewish and Atheism, Though 200 years ago most religion was destroyed due to conflicts that it caused...My race is evil. I've known it, and I've known it my whole life, We have a guilty nature to us that makes us view ourselves as being the dominant race, We have made thousands of species extinct in the past 400 years and all everyone cares about is money, My world is corrupt Naika and I am glad I do not live there anymore\" I say and she gives a slight nod. \"I am sorry to hear that\" she says to me. \"What about your race? do you fight over religion?\" I ask and she nods which disappoints me. \"Zabathen is good, Oblyk is evil, Here in North we have 5 but in the south they have 6, The sixth is Kalyth, He lie, Not true\" Naika explains and I listen with interest. \"South believe he once living, Rewarded Godhood, Not true and have been led a lie\" she explains. \"I tell you more later, Habla nearby\" she states crouching down and examining the ground. \"Close\" she whispers wagging her tail before standing up and sniffing the air. \"Smell anything?\" I ask curiously. \"Yes, You need to bath\" she says before continuing to walk much slower now and with an arrow ready. \"I smell...\" I begin before I hear her growl at me to shut up so I do. I get my rifle ready before I begin following her slowly. I have no idea what I am looking for or what to expect but I hope its not huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaika continues walking with her body slightly crouched down and her bowstring ready to pull back while I try to copy her movements the best I can without making to much noise. A lot of the time we have just been moving through bushes with no general direction in mind, How Naika saw tracks or what ever the hell she saw is a mystery to me. Finally ahead of me I can see the forest open up more into a clearing which makes me glad. Naika slowly rises from her crouch till she is fully standing and in a blink she pulls the bow string back to full draw and holds it for a moment. I try to see what it is she is aiming at but I don't see a single damn thing. She releases her arrow and there is a 3 second pause before I hear some kind of screech of pain in the distance. \"Got it\" she says smiling and I stare at where her arrow went. \"Where did it go?\" I ask curiously and she smiles before leading the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we pass the clearing and walk through some more bushes and under some tree branches we come across a large creature. It reminds me sort of like a Cow, It has 4 legs, a large body, Black short fur and 3 horns on its head and...3 eyes. \"The hell?\" I say looking it over and Naika smiles. \"Its dead\" she says and I nod before she pulls out a knife and begins gutting the animal.</span></div></div>",
