            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole woke up that Saturday morning with her power out. When she rolled over in bed towards the cell phone on her night stand, she discovered that not only had it not charged last night, but also that none of the electric lights worked, either. Stumbling half-sleepily towards the window across the room, she peeked outside to discover that, at some point early in the morning, a truck had rammed into the powerline and knocked her whole street's power out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on loose pajama pants to go with the t-shirt she wore to bed, she walked outside and asked the workers how long it would take to get her power back on. A worker wearing glasses told her it might take ten or eleven hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have all day,\" she said to the man. \"Can't it be fixed any faster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Nicole, it could not be. Frustrated, she slogged back into her little house and made her way into the darkened bathroom across from her bedroom. She kept the door open, so that some sunlight might illuminate the room, and brushed her teeth and showered quickly. Without electricity, the shower was cold, so it was a very quick shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole dried back off and stood in front of the mirror. She didn't want to risk putting make-up on in the dark, so she decided to skip it for the day. It was a shame because she liked wearing make-up, and she thought that she looked particularly good in red lipstick and eyeliner. She tried to wear makeup and look her best whenever possible, but, today would not be one of those days. Instead, she tied her curly dark brown hair into a loose ponytail and went back into her room to put on some clothes for the day. She opened up her closet and decided to wear a button-down shirt with a thin blue sweater over it, khaki capris, and black slip-on shoes. It made her feel better about not getting any make up on for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince her phone was dead and had not charged the night before, she decided she would have to go to the coffee shop a few blocks away to charge it. She would bring her laptop or a book and spend part of her day there or something. \"It's not really what I want to do with my Saturday, but I guess I'll have to\" she thought to herself. Maybe one of her friends living downtown would text her and want to get a drink later or something. Nicole packed her laptop bag with her computer and her phone (and a charging cable for each), as well as a novel she had been meaning to read and her wallet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went out her front door and to the garage where her beat-up car is kept and realized she couldn't get it out of the garage without the electricity running. \"It's fine\" she said. \"I'll just walk.\" And so, she did. It was hot out, but the wind was blowing pleasantly, so she thought she walking be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had made it down to the end of the street when she discovered a loose cable had been hanging from one of the powerlines. It hung there, limply. \"Must have fallen when the truck hit the powerline\" she said to herself. She went to walk around it, and, as she did so, was suddenly shocked. The wind had picked up and blown the cable into her. The shock was mildly painful, where the cable connected with her shoulder, but she thought it would be a lot worse. Her body felt tingly, that was for sure. She was just glad that didn't kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" she said, grabbing her shoulder. She rubbed her shoulder where the cable hit her and felt another tingle ripple through her body. Her vision began to blur, and then she didn't quite remember what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she regained consciousness a few moments later, she found herself at six inches tall, exactly. She didn't know this, as she hadn't a ruler to measure herself, but she was suddenly six inches tall nonetheless. \"Oh my god!\" she exclaimed, taking in her now large surroundings. It was like being on an alien world, except it was her trendy suburb at a massive scale. She looked around - there wasn't anybody approaching, or anybody within her line of sight who could have seen this happen to her. She instinctively reached for her phone to call for help, but remembered that it was out of power. \"Can't charge it at this size...\" she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided she would continue walking, until she found someone to help her. No use staying in the same place, lest somebody else accidentally get shrunk down by a loose electrical cable. She just walked and walked, for what seemed like hours but probably wasn't around the corner on the sidewalk. She was afraid to cross the street in case a car ran her over. Her tiny legs wouldn't be able to carry her away from the crushing wheels in time, she feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time walking, somebody found her. It was somebody she recognized, but wasn't friends with. It was...</span></div></div>",

She was excited to be home, because she would be interning at the library this summer for Bridget. However, her internship didn't start for just over two weeks, so she had some time to kill in the meantime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning, she had been on her way to do some things. The sun was out, the breeze was pleasant, and she was in a generally happy mood. She had been walking down the street when something over at the edge of the corner had caught her eye. It was moving, but it didn't look like an animal, like a mouse. She walked quickly over towards it until the shape became clearer and it looked like a tiny person, which didn't make very much sense to her, but she went over to it anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she said, kneeling down in front of the small person. \"I know you, don't I? Your name is Nicole, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is. I don't think I remember your name, though\" the tiny woman squeaked up at her. She cowered under Liz's shadow. \"Um, this is going to seem weird, but do you think you might be able to help me? I've somehow shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that\" Liz said, a huge smile forming on her face. \"You look adorable at that size, did you know that? You look like a little living doll person or something, and it's just cute. Oh, and I'm Liz. I'm surprised you don't remember me, you used to babysit me when we were younger\" Liz said, laughing. The tiny woman was just so cute, she just wanted to pick her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she did. Nicole barely had time to react before Liz's pale hand circled around her torso, and lifted her off of the ground. She stood back up, holding the tiny woman up in her hand. \"You've got a little doll bag and shoes and everything, and it's so adorable,\" Liz gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please put me down,\" Nicole said. \"Won't you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think there is anybody who can help you. I don't think anybody has ever shrunk before, do you?\" Liz asked, cheerfully. It wasn't meant as a taunt - she was, in her mind, just stating the facts of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, how about you just take me home then?\" Nicole asked. She reached into her pocket to get her key, but then remembered that they key was now too small to fit into the lock of her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got places to be first, honey. You'll come with me instead,\" Liz said. With that, she tucked the tiny woman into the backpack she was wearing, and zipped her up in complete darkness. Liz went...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz walked briskly to Sarah's house. She was teeming with excitement, thinking about the doll she had in her backpack. She almost texted Sarah to tell her she couldn't go shopping anymore in order to take her new plaything home, but decided instead to just leave her in the bag for now. Not like she could go anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole, for her part, was not having a good time. Every step Liz made caused Nicole to get thrown around into other objects in the bag. Currently, she was being crushed underneath a book that was twice the size of her, and a whole lot heavier. It occasionally bounced off of her, allowing her to move, but would soon find its place back on top of her. Nicole tried screaming up to Liz that she was in pain, but the backpack muffled sounds that went in and out of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, unaware of Nicole's plight, Liz continued walking. She reached Sarah's house after twenty or so minutes, and was greeted by her friend at the door when she arrived. Sarah's parents must not have been home. Usually they were the ones to answer the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, Liz walked up the stairs with Sarah as they chatted. Liz took off her backpack and set it on the ground, propped up against the wall, as the two of them caught up after being away from each other for a year. They talked about their classes, and what majors they were studying, as well as what kinds of parties they went to and whether or not they were going to join any sororities next semester. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on the ground, Nicole was able to struggle a little more successfully. She was currently pinned underneath the book, which pinned her legs to the ground below her. Slowly, she was able to pull one leg out from underneath the heavy book at it time. It hurt more than she thought it would, but she didn't seem to have any broken bones or otherwise have any serious injuries. So far, she had her right leg free. It was sore, and she was sure she had a bruise on her knee, but her capris covered it up. Now to work on getting the other leg free. She kept glancing upwards nervously, hoping that Liz wouldn't suddenly open up the bag and snatch her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of the Nicole's plight, Liz and Sarah were just getting ready to leave to go shopping. Liz had a choice to make, however. She really wanted to see the little doll-woman again, and to hold her in her hand before leaving, and she really, really wanted to show her new toy off to Sarah. Maybe they could even take Nicole shopping with them. However, she didn't want anything to happen to her at the mall. What if somebody stole her? Or what if she ran when they were trying on clothes? That sounded unpleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz decides to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole kept walking and walking. She was beginning to get tired, but would keep walking until she found somebody to help her. Somebody had to be out this Saturday morning who could help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the corner of the block she was on and realized she could hear music. Somebody must have started listening to it just now, because she only heard birds chirping for a while. Nicole turned towards the sound of the music and realized that, a few houses behind her, somebody had just opened their door and had sat down to do some gardening. Her heart dropped when she saw who it was - Julie Cramton. Well, her first name was Taylor, but everyone called her by her middle name, either Julia or Julie. Julie was two years younger than her, and had annoyed her all throughout middle and high school. She was very loud and bubbly, and loved to talk. Julie always tried to hang out with Nicole, thinking she would become cooler because Nicole was older, and, therefore, cooler than her. Nicole never wanted to, and usually brushed her off. Unfortunately, Nicole didn't know when the next time she would see somebody would be was, and so she walked up onto Julie's lawn and approached the towering girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie had had her blonde hair pulled back in a bun, and was wearing her \"gardening clothes\", which were also her running clothes - a white tank top and black biker shorts. She was a little curvy, but not in a way that was unappealing. In fact, many people would find her attractive until she talked their ears off. She was humming alongside the music, and was trimming some hydrangeas. Nicole did not like the look of the trimmers, which were larger than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie,\" Nicole said. Julie did not hear, for the music was too loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie,\" Nicole said, louder this time. Still nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Nicole went over to Julie and tapped her left thigh, which she sat upon. She tapped it two, three times, and got nothing. She tapped it harder, which prompted Julie to only scratch at thigh, as if grass had merely imitated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole didn't usually get angry or frustrated, but she always had a short fuse when it came to Julie. She huffed and then kicked Julie as hard as she could above her ankle. It probably didn't hurt very much - if at all - but it was all Nicole could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Julie didn't turn to look to see what happened. Almost as if by instinct, Julie instead reached her hand down to where Nicole kicked her, as if to rub it again. Nicole was surprised when Julie's gargantuan hand instead swatted at her, catching her in the stomach and sending her tumbling a few inches away with a thud. She had been winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That didn't feel like a bug,\" Julie suddenly said. \"I wonder if that was, like, a rabbit or a mouse or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and turned, walking over to see what she had just smacked. To Nicole, it was like watching a tall building walk towards her, and felt rushed and trapped when the giant woman crouched down to get a closer look. She spread her legs out around the tiny Nicole as she sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" she said, lifting her hand up to her mouth. \"Nicole? You look like a little doll or something! How did you get so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't kn-\" Nicole began, but was cut off as Julie snatched her up with great force and swiftness. Her fingers squeezed her - too tightly - around her midsection. Julie giggled, pleased at her find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh! This. Is so. Cool! I'm so glad you came to see me. I didn't mean to swat you away like that, but I won't do it again,\" she said, fawning over the tiny woman. Julie began petting her, playing with her hair and her limbs. \"I was going to garden this morning, but now that you're here, I think it can wait\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was about to ask her for help again, when she found herself cut off once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh wait! Maybe you can help me with my gardening. You could be like a little gnome! Or a garden fairy! I'll have to get you a costume!\" she gushed. \"Okay, now hold this pose,\" Julie said as she began to bend and contort the tiny woman's body. Satisfied, she set Nicole down next to some flowers she had planted the week before. \"Perfect!\" she beamed, and reached for her phone to take a picture. She took a few. \"And when Christmas comes, you can be a part of my nativity diorama! That would be so cute!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie. I can't be a garden gnome. Or fairy, or be in a Christmas nativity. I'm not a decoration\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're right. What if someone or an animal tried to take you? Or if you tried to get away? That would be awful,\" Julie said, grabbing Nicole roughly once more. \"I guess I'll just have to keep you inside, then. But don't worry, we'll have lots of fun. I can do your makeup, and give you a haircut and a makeover, too. And then on Monday you can sit on my desk at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep me inside? I'm not your plaything. I need he-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe not. But you are mine now. I'm going to take good care of you though, don't worry!\" she said. With that, she took the squirming Nicole inside her house and shut the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole decides to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know, like the ones they make for athletes. I could spray you up with gold and pose you on top! Wouldn't that be cool?\" she asked. \"Well, maybe it wouldn't. You'd get all sticky and then I'd have to scrub all of that paint off of you. That would be a pain for sure!\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was mortified. \"You can't just cover me in paint like that! I'd probably suffocate from the fumes alone!\" she protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I'm sure it would be fine. Besides, we're not doing that right now anyways, so don't worry about it too much\" Julie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the couch, one hand on her chin, the other wrapped around Nicole, thinking about what to do with the tiny woman. Occasionally, she would toy with Nicole, passing her between her hands, or tossing her up in the air, or toying with her tiny legs, all while Nicole thrashed and squealed with displeasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I definitely don't want to put you outside anywhere...\" Julia said, aloud. \"Aha!\" she said, snapping her fingers. \"I know just where to put you!\" She shot up off of the couch and ran towards the back of her house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into her bedroom and held the tiny Nicole up in front of a bookshelf. On top of it was an old teddy bear, a snowglobe that said \"Flughafen Frankfurt am Main\", a Statue of the Eiffel Tower that must have been nearly three times as tall as Nicole, and a figurine, about Nicole's size, of the David statue. \"They're my knick-knacks from my travels. Well, and my old Teddy Bear, because he's special. You can stay up here with them!\" Julie said enthusiastically. She set Nicole down next to the David figurine roughly, causing her to stumble and topple onto the shelf. Standing back up, Nicole turned towards Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to stay up here! I'm not some knick-knack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you're not some knick-knack. You're special, because you're alive! That means you can talk and sing and dance for me whenever I want you to!\" She said, squealing with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" Julia exclaimed, overcome with excitement. \"I know JUST what to do with you. Stay there, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia leaned in and kissed Nicole on the head, pushing her off-balance, and then turned to leave the room. \"I'll be right back!\" She shut the door as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked desperately for a way to get off of the shelf, but there was none. Eventually, she got bored, and sat down, laying against the towering Teddy Bear. She was about to doze off when Julie burst back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiiii Nicole! Guess what I bought you?\" she asked, gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" she said, startled. She didn't really want to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie rummaged around in a plastic bag and brought out a little plastic package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those look like doll clothes\" Nicole said, grimacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are! It's a ballerina outfit. Do you know why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Nicole said, preparing for the worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're going to be my little ballerina!\" Julie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie, for the last time, I'm not a doll. Now, if yo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doll?\" Julie asked. \"No, you're definitely not a doll. I'm making you into a little ballerina for my new music box!\" Julie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's heart dropped. \"M-music box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm! I'll show you after we get you changed!\" Julie said. She grabbed Nicole in a tight grip and carried the little toy woman over to her bed, laying down on it. \"Now, don't worry, I'll be gentle with you, like always\" she said as she began to pull on the tiny woman's clothing. Off came the sweater first, and then the shoes and capris Nicole wore. Nicole attempted to protest, but Julie's hands were forceful as they undressed her, able to overpower her easily. Julie suddenly set Nicole down. \"Unbutton your shirt, I don't want to break the little buttons\" she ordered, folding Nicole's now-discarded clothing neatly. When Nicole finished, she took the shirt, folded it up, and then set all of the little clothes into her nightstand drawer. Nicole was just in her undergarments, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, for the fun part,\" Julie said, smiling. She picked up the tiny woman again and forced her into the ballerina outfit. It didn't fit Nicole properly, as it was intended for a doll roughly her height but with somehow even thinner proportions, making the outfit constrictive and restrictive. The tights and flats, thankfully, weren't too terrible to bear, but the frills of the tutu and the tight top felt more like a corset than something designed for comfort. Nicole was then flipped over and laid flat against Julie's bed, ace down, as she undid her ponytail and wound it tightly into a tight knot. \"Don't you just look perfect! We're almost done\" Julie said, turning her tiny toy around to face her. She sat up and grabbed a few things off of her nightstand before crouching down over Nicole again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's left?\" Nicole asked, laying flat on her back. She was so sore from being handled so roughly by Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your makeup, duh!\" Nicole let out a sigh and shut her eyes as Julie prepared a bright stick of lipstick and lowered it towards Nicole's waiting face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Julie finished dressing up Nicole, she had to wipe her toy's face off several times. The lipstick was too wide the first time, and covered half of her lower face in red, so she kept trying and trying before lathering some on a thin brush and applying it that way. As for the rest of the makeup, it was quite heavily applied - Julie colored Nicole's cheeks in bright pink, and heavily applied white foundation to the rest of her face. To top it all off, she tried to paint eyeshadow on, but it was sloppily done and heavily applied, making her look like a caricature of a ballerina. Many pictures were taken of the Ballerina Nicole doll that Julie had made, some posed and some informal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, for the box\" she said. She went over to her bookshelf and removed a few books from the top shelf, depositing Nicole on the now-empty shelf. She left the room and came back with a big wooden box - big enough for Nicole to fit into, and to have some wiggle room, but not huge. She set it on the shelf next to Nicole and opened the top, placing Nicole in the center on a red velvet circle meant to imitate a stage. \"I had to find one at the antique store that was missing the original figurine, but you'll do nicely!\" she exclaimed. Her eager hands reached in to the box and posed Nicole in a pose, her arms raised, with one knee bent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Now you fit right in with the rest of the knick knacks\" Julie said. With that, she slowly shut the box on top of Nicole, leaving her standing in the cramped darkness.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, her neighborhood didn't have many trees in it. There were a few over by the library, though. The library wasn't a super far walk from her house normally, but, at only six inches tall, it was like walking to another city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing stopping, she continued on in that direction anyways. She only had to cross the road twice to keep moving - and while the first time was frightening, the second time was much easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she could see the little library. It opposite the corner of a couple of houses and near the community center. It was still so far away though, and, after crossing the crosswalk in her way, Nicole decided she needed a rest. Her tiny body just couldn't keep going. Nicole had, thankfully, packed a thermos of water before leaving her house for the day, so she wasn't at risk of getting dehydrated, but her legs ached. \"At least they'll be toned after all of this walking\" she thought to herself. She trudged over towards the tree nearest the corner and fell face-first into the grass, her arms laying at her sides. She found herself sleeping in short order, exhausted from the ordeal. She was, as she had planned, in the shade, and the grass was cool enough to be comfortable. She would try to get help in a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, Bridget Kagen, the community's librarian, walked towards the library. It always opened late on Saturdays, but fewer and fewer people were using it these days. She would probably spend her morning doing clerical work and taking care of her other duties, and then be bored for the rest of the day until she went home. She usually spent her afternoons dreaming up ways to try to get more people in the community back into the library, or reading a book. She spent her free time at home, usually meticulously caring for her things or decorating her house. She collected old and rare books personally, and had a growing collection of unique spoons and stamps from different countries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed something colorful in the grass - a bright patch of blue. She hoped it was not a bird, fallen from a tree. She jogged over to it and saw nothing but a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she said, picking it up. \"A pretty little doll. Someone must have dropped you last night on their way out of the library.\" There were sometimes kids who brought toys with them, and they tend to lose things. \"I guess you can come with me for now. Maybe someone will come back looking for you,\" she said. She couldn't tell what brand the doll was - it was too small to be a Barbie doll, and too realistically proportioned to be one of the other dolls on the market. \"Must be a collector's item or something. Who would spend so much money on a nice doll like this for a careless kid?\" she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stroked the doll's hair, smoothing it, and then walked on in to the library. Going to the information desk in the center, she set the doll down in one of the shelves, next to her cell phone and other belongings. Bridget decided that she'd keep the doll here for a few days to see if anybody claimed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget went about putting away some of the returned books (of which there were very few) and then returned to the desk to work on some spreadsheets she had to finish for the end of the month, deciding on which books to purchase and which to donate. She hated doing this part, and, seeing as how she could put it off for a little while, reached down for her cell phone. Her hand hovered for a moment, and then instead grabbed the doll again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised nobody has come back looking for you,\" she said, toying with the doll in her hands. Bridget liked the way that the doll's legs bent at the knee, and how there didn't seem to be any visible joints. \"You certainly are unique...\" she said. She began to covet the doll - she'd never collected them before, but this doll would be a great center piece for a collection. She could get her a stand and everything. \"And you are pretty. Although, I think I would apply a layer of makeup or paint to really doll you up,\" she said, running a finger across the doll's face. Glancing at the clock, she decided to return to her work, but kept the doll placed upon her lap, resting in her purple skirt. The more she looked at it, the more she decided she would love to start collecting dolls - especially this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime went by quickly for the rest of the day. It was already 2:00 pm - and she got to leave work at 3:00 pm that day. Nobody had come in yet, so she kept touching and playing with the doll when she got bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>2:30 pm. 2:35 pm. 2:40 pm. It was almost time to go home. Bridget was excited - she decided to keep the doll. If any kid was careless enough to lose a doll as intricate - and expensive - as this one, then, as far as she was concerned, the doll shouldn't be theirs. She was just glad it hadn't rained all night - the doll could have been damaged!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had, for the past twenty minutes or so, tried to search online for the brand of this mysterious doll. She couldn't find any websites that made custom dolls that were as intricate or realistic as this one, especially not in this area of the United States. She tried the google image search, she tried etsy, and she even trolled some forums for a short while trying to find anything that resembled her new possession. Nothing. This meant that she would have to come up with a name for the doll, of course, but it meant that finding more clothes for her would be difficult as well. Not only were they meticulously embroidered, they fit the doll perfectly. She decided she would text her seamstress friend, later. Maybe she would make some new clothes. Bridget decided that she would pay whatever her friend asked for just for some clothes that fit her new darling doll properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:45 pm. Bridget struggled to think of a name for her new doll. She wanted to give her new doll a proper flowery name, like Marguerite. The doll didn't look like a Marguerite though, she decided, as she laid the doll flat against her desk and hovered over her protectively. Marigold wouldn't work, either. Delphine sounded kind of nice, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:55 pm. The name would have to wait until she got home. Bridget had almost settled on Delphine as she began to pack her things into her satchel. She gingerly picked up her new doll, tentatively named Delphine, and secured her in the backpack. Closing it, she set the backpack on her chair as she logged off of her computer and walked over to the front door to put the \"Closed\" sign up. Walking back over to the information desk, she turned off the lights in the library and reached over for her bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step back as something moved in the bag. She could hear something muffled inside of it. It almost sounded like squeaking, or chirping. A mouse, perhaps? She hoped it wasn't damaging her new doll. She hurried over to it and tore the bag open, leaning in to examine her prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another massive step back as the tiny doll looked up at her and shrieked. She almost screamed too, but her initial fear was overcome by curiosity, and then by her avarice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... not a doll at all\" Bridget said as she leaned over the open bag. She reached in and, less gingerly this time, wrapped one slender hand around the tiny woman. \"But you are definitely unique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for taking me inside! I must have fallen asleep on the grass from exhaustion. Please, help me!\" Nicole pleaded with the gigantic librarian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget began re-examining her new doll, feeling her react to her probing hands and to her sudden movements. A small smile formed on her face. \"What a lovely little surprise you are. I'm going to enjoy having you\" she said, stroking Nicole's hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having me?\" Nicole asked, timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know, I'm a collector. I like to collect unique things. Like books! And you've inspired me to collect dolls, and you are the most unique doll I've ever seen\" Bridget said as she fawned over the tiny woman. She was a pretty little thing, and she would look even better once Bridget had dolled her up even more. \"Back in the bag you go. We'll play later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget put Nicole back into the bag once more, zipping it shut. She paused for a minute, straining her ears. While muffled sounds could be heard, they would be undetectable if she walked by passerby's quickly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up her bag and went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bridget walked home briskly, thinking about her new toy all the way as she went home. Delphine wasn't a good name after all, she decided. Amalie Desiree sounded nicer. She decided she would instead call her doll that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bridget got home, she quickly locked the door and made a beeline for her desk in her home office. She not-so-gently set her bag down on the floor in front of her feet and opened it. She saw Amalie when she opened it. She greedily reached down for the doll-woman, and, wrapping a slender fist around her, picked her up and deposited her onto the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hair and clothes are a mess, Amalie,\" she said, stroking Nicole's hair with one finger. The ride in the bag must have thrown her around considerably, as her hair looked like it had gotten all tangled and disheveled, and her clothes had become wrinkled and covered in dust. \"But that's okay, I'm going to take care of you. You'll look your best all of the time now,\" Bridget said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who's Amalie?\" Nicole asked, nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, are, silly,\" Bridget said. \"That's your new name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my name is Nicole. It's nice that you found me and want to take care of me, but I need help. I shrunk this morning and I need to get bigger again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget suppressed a laugh as Nicole pleaded with her. She looked so cute! \"No, your name is Amalie Desiree, and you're going to live with me now. You're going to be my little doll, and I'm going to take very, very good care of you.\" Bridget moved her fingers down around Nicole's waist and picked her up in a tight fist. She adored the way that Nicole's little legs dangled as she held her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you...\" Nicole asked, cut off as Bridget began playing with her arms and legs, examining her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These clothes fit you marvelously. But they don't really *fit*, you understand? I have something a bit more... glamorous in mind for you. I'll just need to make a phone call, hold on,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding Amalie, Bridget picked up her phone with her other hand and dialed a number. \"Hello, Jessica? Good, I hope you're doing well. Listen, do you get off of work soon? You do? Good. I have a little commission to ask of you - and I'll pay whatever you want. It's just that I've acquired the most darling little doll, and I want to make some custom-fit clothes for her. Maybe a few pairs of dresses or something, I'm not sure yet. Anyways, come over once you're off work and you can take some measurements, and we'll discuss payment. Thanks Jess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget put the phone down. \"My friend, Jess, is a seamstress, and she's going to make you look wonderful. You'll look like you walked right out of Downton Abbey!\" she gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole knew Downton Abbey. \"I don't want to wear one of those dresses. Those things are huge! And they look like they're hard to move in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget either didn't hear her or didn't care. Bridgets hands suddenly descended on Nicole, and began to remove her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! What are you doing?\" Nicole screeched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax. You'll get them back soon. We'll just need to take some measurements.\" Bridget said. She gently pulled Nicole's shoes off, and then tugged her pants off her legs, followed by her top. She was left in just her undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget's fingers closed in on Nicole, as if protecting her from the gaze of others. \"Come on, she said, putting the discarded clothing in the desk's drawer. \"I'll brush your hair on the couch while we wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4:00 pm. Someone knocked at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget pulled the brush away from Nicole's head, and set both of them down on the table. Nicole tried to stand but found herself falling straight onto her back - she was exhausted from being handled so vigorously. Bridget squeezed her tightly in one hand, immobilizing her, while the other roughly brushed at her hair with a brush that was larger than her. It clearly wasn't meant for use on toy-sized people, and it hurt as it tangled and dragged her hair. Nicole was afraid the force was going to break her neck or twist her head, but, thankfully she lived - she was just in pain the entire time. She was also thankful that none of her hair was torn out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked up and saw the gigantic Bridget open the door. Another titanic woman entered, this one with red hair. Jessica, the seamstress. Bridget led her over to the table and both sat down in front of Nicole, who watched as the two looming faces examined her body. Jessica was wearing a skirt, and, to Nicole, her legs alone looked as tall as a skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the doll?\" Jessica asked as she plucked Nicole up in one hand, cupping her against her palm. Nicole, still tired, did not resist, instead resting limply in Jessica's soft palm. \"I didn't know you collected them,\" she said, as she began to play with Nicole's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she inspired me to begin,\" Bridget said, watching with satisfaction as Jessica inspected Nicole. \"Anyways, I was hoping you would be able to craft some outfits for her\" Bridget said. \"Definitely some Edwardian ones, with the big hats and everything. Corsets as well, if you can make them for her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Jessica said, setting the doll back down on the table. \"I brought my measuring kits, so let me take some measurements for her and I can make them this week.\" Jessica bent down into her purse for her measuring kits, while Bridget grabbed Nicole and stood her up on the table. \"Stand still, dear, so Jessica can measure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Jessica asked, confused. She sat back up, setting her measuring kits on the table. Was Bridget talking to the doll? \"Who are you talking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doll, of course. Her name is Amalie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Nicole\", Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's eyes widened, and then a smile crept across her face. \"An interesting doll,\" she said. She picked Nicole - Amalie - back up and reexamined her, enjoying how she moved on her own and squeaked. \"Playing dead before, I see. Bridget, she is wonderful. Where did you buy her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I found her. Unfortunately, I don't think there are any more like her for sale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shame,\" Jessica said, setting Nicole down. \"Amalie, stand up tall for me so I can take some measurements\" she commanded of the toy person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nicole stood up straight, she brought over rulers and measuring tapes. She pushed Nicole up against the ruler - the doll was six inches she noted - and then wrapped her up in measuring tapes to measure everything: her shoulders, her chest, her stomach, her legs, her arm lengths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, she and Bridget sat for some time, discussing the outfits Jessica would make and what Nicole would pay. It would be expensive for outfits to be made, but Bridget was willing to pay whatever it cost. Anything for her prize possession. As they spoke, they took turns toying with the tiny Nicole, redressing her in her clothes that were removed earlier and posing her in their hands. Nicole decided that Jessica definitely wasn't going to help her escape - she was enjoying holding the doll-woman too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Jessica got up to leave, handing Nicole back over to Bridget as she left. She'd be back in four or five days with the clothes, and they'd have Amalie try them all on to make sure they fit properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole watched from Bridget's hands as Jessica walked off, feeling uneasy as the massive door shut and she was trapped with Bridget in her house.</span></div></div>",

She can take being thrown into things, sat on, purposely crushed, squeezed, being held underwater, etc. but she can not die or be seriously or permanently be injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<span class=\"chotpink\">No further size changing will be permitted</span>. Nicole is currently at six inches tall, and will not get any larger or smaller without my express permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<span class=\"clred\">No body modifications, inflation, etc</span>. Aside from being six inches tall and being unable to die or get injured, she's a normal woman. In fact, all of the characters in this story are normal people, so they won't suddenly have a size gun or size change powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<span class=\"chotpink\">None of the characters in this story have a size fetish (unless the route is marked 18+)</span>. While they will all want to keep Nicole for various reasons, they won't be doing it because it turns them on or because they want to use her for sexual purposes.

This is an inclusive label, and can include cis women, trans women, and non-binary women, as long as they are written respectfully and without reverting to stereotypes or offensive portrayals. Men may be introduced, but they are not the focus of the story, are not going to be in possession of Nicole, and should not take over any of the paths. Avoid interaction with characters younger than 18, please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Nicole <b>does not</b> like being six inches tall, or being a plaything for strangers. This is an important part of the (unwilling) interaction in this story. At no point will she suddenly like being a pet, and she will only be compliant if she thinks acting compliant can give her some advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<span class=\"cplum\">No insertion. No gross stuff</span>. Some feet content is permitted (accidentally stepping on Nicole, for example, or a character kicking her away upon discovering she is alive), but the focus of the story is not on feet.
