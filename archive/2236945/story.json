Nor was it the leather binding that caught your eye. You're barely interested in the stuff inside of books, let alone the stuff they're made out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it was the book's lustrous colors\u2014the blood-scarlet of the cover and the gleaming gold of the pentagram\u2014that stopped you in your tracks. Even then, it was only because red and gold are your high school colors. Mr. Walberg has everyone out collecting a lot of junk for the school time capsule, and you were shopping for something to throw onto the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if the book had nothing to do with your high school, your home town, or the current year? So what? Time capsules are stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in the special collections cabinet of Arnholm's Used Books with a bunch of other rare and expensive items. But the glass door was ajar, so you quietly pulled the book out for a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntricate designs of golden thread were woven throughout the cover; the same anarchic, subtly shifting designs covered the title page and facing papers when you opened it, and they made you dizzy just to look at them. Whoever created them had masterfully conveyed the illusion of movement and alteration with his pen strokes.  This was especially true of the stylized faces that gazed out serenely along the bottom of the title page: an old man, a young woman, a hale warrior, and a child. As you studied them, they seemed to shift ages and attitudes, so that the old man from a different angle became a double of the young woman, and the child aged into a crone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even looking through the rest of the book you took it up to the front to ask about the price ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ted Arnolm is standing behind a stack of books, marking the inside cover of each one with a pencil, as you approach his work station. He glances up at you from under tangled white brows. \"I can't find the price,\" you tell him as you set the strange book in front of him. \"How much is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe regards you with a mildly skeptical expression before turning his attention to the book. With his thick wooden pencil he circles a faint number in the upper right-hand corner of the title page: $225. You face falls. \"A little out of your price range?\" he asks with gentle sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to take the book up again, but he stops you. With a bony white finger he points to a spot on the inside of the front cover. \"Water damage. I can take a bit off for that.\" He slashes the pencil through the original price and scribbles \"$200\" in its place. You make a face. \"Did you get this out of the special collections case?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cabinet door was unlocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grimaces through his white beard. \"Lemme check for other damage.\" Arnholm, you've found, isn't a very nice man, but he is a fair one. He won't let the book go for as little as you can afford, but he might try driving the price as low as he thinks he can bear. You wilt and absent-mindedly glance at the rows of used D&amp;D manuals that line the top shelf of the store's \"Games\" section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom,\" he barks, and his brother pokes his head out from behind a shelf. \"Who's the joker that glued this book's pages shut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou retrieve your attention as Tom Arnholm hurries up to join his brother, who is shaking the book and vainly trying to turn its pages. But even with his thick, yellowed thumbnail, Ted cannot pry the pages apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom takes the book and also gives it a go. He tries peeling pages back one at a time, but none of them will yield. In fact, they are so tightly bound together that the book itself might be a clever fake carved from wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it like this when you cataloged it?\" Tom asks Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it wasn't like this when I cataloged it,\" Ted retorts. \"I wouldn't have cataloged it if I'd seen it was in this state!\" Tom casts a suspicious glance at you. \"I don't even remember cataloging it. I assumed you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember it. It looks like it came from the Blackwell acquisition. Mitch did the work on those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed Arnholm looks relieved: a victim has been found and will be summarily executed. He gives you a po-faced glance, then inserts a decimal point between the \"2\" and the \"0\" in the price. \"Might make a nice bookend,\" he says with no little bitterness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou part with a single dollar and some coins, and with the book under your arm almost dance out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou don't live on the outskirts of Saratoga Falls, exactly, but it's still a good twenty-minute drive back to your house, during which you pound your fist against the truck console in happy time to the rap music blaring from the truck radio. Actually, you don't even live in Saratoga Falls, but in the township of Acheson. A hundred-and-something years ago, the two villages were separated by many miles, but the former mushroomed in size after the railroad went through. It has since grown to nearly engulf Acheson, and the latter now exists mostly as a bedroom community for the well-to-do who want the amenities of a city while still living on the edge of the countryside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gun your engine as you pull into the driveway, startling your thirteen-year-old brother, who's kneeling in the front yard next to his bike. Robert flips you off as you hop out of the cab. \"You know, they got satellites sharp enough to spot that kind of shit,\" you say as you slap at his hand with the book. \"One of these days, they'll snap a picture and pop it up on a big screen at NASA, and Dad'll freak when he sees you.\" Your father is an aerospace engineer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert ignores you and snatches at the book. \"Whatcha get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something for school. When's supper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Lemme see that.\" You hold the book out of his reach as you saunter toward the open garage. \"Is it porn?\" Robert asks. \"I bet it's porn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If so, it's your kind of porn.\" You shove the book at him, and grin to yourself as he tries to flip the pages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't even a real book,\" he exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kind of porn you deserve.\" You try to snatch it back, but he yanks the book away. So you grab him around the waist and thrown him into the yard. The book bounces off, forgotten for the moment, as you wrestle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nUp in your room, you flop onto your bed and flip on the TV to waste a little time before dinner; your mother chased you out of the kitchen when you tried getting an early sample of the spaghetti sauce. The strange book is by your elbow, so you pick it up and glance at it casually as commercials play. To your surprise, you see that the first page has turned loose and now flips over easily. You examine it and the page behind it carefully, but can find no trace of glue residue. The rest of the book, though, remain tightly sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up and study your discovery. Both the first and second pages are covered in whole paragraphs of intricate script. At the top of the first page is what you take to be the book's title: <i>Summa Libra Personae,</i> it reads in big letters. Underneath, in slightly smaller letters: <i>Personas. De Elementa, et ad Relatio Inter Se; et eorum Constructio; et Modum Repraesentationis et ejus Reflexio in Materia</i> The rest of the page, and the page follow, are alas also in Latin. You take out your phone and pull up an online English-Latin translator. With a notebook and pencil plucked from off your desk, you start to copy down a translation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise and dismay you find that pens and pencils leave no trace\u2014not even a crease or indentation\u2014on the page as you try to write down your translation. You open a word processor on your laptop, but it freezes and crashes when you try typing the translations into it. Even the web browser you're using becomes glitchy when you try putting large blocks of type into the translator. The hairs on the back of your neck are soon standing on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad will not be coming home for supper, so you beg off joining your mother and brother at the dining room table and take your plate upstairs, where between mouthfuls of pasta you doggedly set about deciphering the page, word by word, memorizing it as you go. It is sweaty, tedious work, and most of what emerges reads like garbled nonsense even after you abandon Google Translate for a more scholarly website. But gradually, by inference and intuition more than translation, it dawns on you what you've got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a book about disguises. <i>Personas,</i> it calls them\u2014masks that can transform their wearers into other people. It's not just theory either, for the book promises you that these <i>personas</i> can have very practical uses. Dangerous uses, too, and the second page is given over almost completely to warnings and cautions about the penalties of deceit and the risks of using the book without full understanding. And it closes with the exhortation not to \"sign\" the book in a light-hearted spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latter exhortation causes you to frown. <i>Sign the book?</i> What does that mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to the title page, which is when you see that the facing papers inside the cover have changed. Those shifting, dizzying patterns have vanished, and on the newly blank inside cover a sentence has appeared. <i>Emptio me cum pecunia, possidere me cum sanguine.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe translation is easy enough: Claim me with money; possess me with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eye drifts down to the whorl of lines that has appeared beneath this exhortation, and you chill when you recognize it as the stylized form of a thumbprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. Well, if anything is going to drain the lightness from your spirit ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a deep breath you draw your pocketknife along your thumb. It hurts like hell, but to no effect. You grit your teeth and cut deeper, until blood wells out. You spread it over your thumbprint and press it onto the symbol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What have I just done?</i> you wonder now that it's too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find the answer when you flip back into the book, and find that that page with the warning has come loose. Behind it is a page that brings something new: two paragraphs of Latin, but also a wheel-like design whose rims are inscribed with complex symbols of intricate design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this new page, like the pages before, stoutly refuses to pull away from the rest of the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmmm.</i> You've begun to see a pattern. It looks like the book will yield a new page only after some action has been performed. Purchasing the book apparently opened a second page; \"signing\" the book has revealed this new page, which you take to be a spell of some kind. As for what action will unlock this page ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt opens with a list of ingredients, some of which seem very obscure. What does it mean, for instance, when it asks you to procure \"celeriter\"? That you should purchase the ingredients quickly? You wonder if you should get some help -- someone who knows Latin, maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"You talk to your dad about that job at his company?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's just before first period, and Caleb Johansson, your best friend since third grade, has materialized at your locker. He peers at you with that jutting-chin stare he uses when he thinks someone is screwing him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll ask him this weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you ask him tonight, then give me a call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't wait till this weekend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you're not angling for the job yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's why he's got his chin out. \"I told you I don't want it,\" you retort, \"and I don't know why you do either. It'll just be file work. If you're lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's a foot in the door, and I wanna make some contacts. A job at Salopek is, like, a major in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt. You've never paid much attention to your dad's company, which is some kind of aerospace contractor. But Caleb is deeply into science and engineering; he's the kind of kid who had motorized Lego sets when he was only nine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make you a deal,\" you reply. \"I'll talk to him tonight if you talk to Lisa today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you haven't talked to her yet. Jesus, I asked you Monday to pump her for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's hard,\" he mutters. \"She's not dumb. She'll know you're the one who wants to know why she broke up with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why she'll talk to you,\" you retort. \"The way I figure, girls only think they want to spare a guy's feelings. Actually, they just don't wanna be the ones to tell you themselves.\" You shove one set of books into your locker and yank out another. \"So she'll talk to you, because she knows it'll get back to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at Caleb: his eyes are wide, and for a moment you think that he must find your observation deeply perceptive. Then you see he's looking over your shoulder. \"Molester at three o'clock,\" he mumbles, and turns around. Smoothly, you drop to the floor and pretend to fiddle with the locker under yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you'd hoped, Lester Pozniak, soccer goalie and bully, passes without stopping<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou go to the college library after school to look for books on Latin and magic. Most of the ones you find are pretty useless, except for one that relieves your puzzlement about \"celeriter\": it tells you that certain writers whose grasp of Latin was flimsy would append it to \"calx\" to make clear they were referring to \"quicklime.\" Ah, so the spell wasn't asking for a pebble when it used the latter word. Still, it's no relief to discover that the book's author was no better at Latin than you are. You're playing with something dangerous, possibly under the direction of an incompetent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the evening\u2014in those moments when Caleb isn't texting you reminders to talk to your dad\u2014puzzling through the rest of the spell. Fortunately, it doesn't look like the first item will be hard to craft. Basically, you just have to buy some stuff, mix it together, pour it over a convex mirror, then put a match to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you have to wonder where you're going to find some of the ingredients. You're pondering the kinds of stores you'll need to visit when you hear a sudden rushing of feet and slamming of doors, followed by the hiss of running water. You idly wonder what Robert is up to. Using the toilet? No. The shower? No. The water shuts off; a door is nearly yanked off its hinges; feet are bounding down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my God, it must be\u2014!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leap for your own door, pausing just long enough to run your fingers through your coarse blonde hair. You briefly consider changing shirts, but you don't want Robert down there alone for too long. You yourself hit the turn on the landing in only six steps, crashing against Robert as leans over the balustrade. Down in the living room, your cousin Umeko is talking to your mother. She glances up and smiles at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou straighten back on your heels. \"Hey,\" you say in a voice pitched half an octave lower than normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eye glints. \"Hey yourself,\" she replies in a voice deeper than usual. \"Caught a bullfrog, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" You fake a little cough. \"Just a touch of something.\" Robert looks up at you incredulously; you kick him in the shin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, are you coming down with a cold?\" you mother asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's\u2014 it's nothing.\" You clear your throat. \"Just some dust.\" But she's already bustled into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert bounds down into the living room; you follow at a more grown-up pace. \"You doing anything this weekend?\" Robert asks Umeko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to see that new animated movie. But you're probably a little old to be watching cartoons,\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snort in a very adult manner\u2014of course you're too grown up for that. But Robert nods eagerly. \"I'd love to go if you're going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" she says, and you freeze. \"How about we hit the early showing?\" She looks at you mischievously. \"I'm sorry you're not interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still trying to figure a way out of this self-sprung trap when your mother returns and presses a lot of pills into your hand. Then you can only mumble and listen as she and Umeko discuss a piano-flute duet they're to perform in church next Sunday. You'd love an excuse to practice anything with Umeko: She's a year older than you but has a poise beyond that; and taboos about cousins\u2014whether adopted (as Umeko was) or not\u2014can't relieve the crush you've had on her since she taught you how to kiss at age thirteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore leaving she flirts a little more with Robert, who glows, then turns back at you. \"I hope you get to feeling better,\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine.\" You glance at the pills, which are now slightly sticky in your palm. \"Do you know any natural remedies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light in her eyes cools slightly at you accidental, oblique reference to a heritage that isn't really hers. \"I'm not a shaman,\" she says. \"Maybe you'd better spend the weekend in bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nInstead, you spend Saturday hitting art supply stores, greenhouses, and other places you don't usually haunt; and unless you've misunderstood things, you get everything you need. Early that evening you move your desk in front of an open window, turn on an electric fan, copy the sigil onto a sheet of paper, and start mixing. As you drop the ice cubes into the dry ingredients you wryly wonder how old-timey magicians performed the spell back when most houses lacked freezers. But the thought vanishes as the mix starts to smoke and pop and bang loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cuss to yourself as you dive away. What if you blow up the house? Or, worse, just your own room? The bowl quivers and shudders as clouds of smoke billow out. An acrid odor pours into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps sound on the stairs; without knocking, your father bursts in. \"What the hell? Oh, God!\" He covers his nose; Robert peeks over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Science project?\" you say through a ghastly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when are you taking Chemistry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm helping out Caleb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father's lips whiten. \"Do you know what he's doing? Oh, never mind that. Does Caleb know what he's doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad lets out a long, weary exhale of the sort you know so well. He glowers, then with a shake of his head leaves you to it, pulling Robert after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there's still one more step. You set the mirror on the sigil and pour the bubbling mixture over it. It hardens almost instantly, and you put a match to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor fifteen minutes ghostly blue flames dance over the still-forming mask. When they wink out, the hardened mixture is a dull grey color and cool to the touch. Gingerly, you pull it off the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has a feel like alabaster. You are running your fingers lightly over it when it twists from your hand and bounces harmlessly off the carpeted floor; when you pick it up, it has changed shape, from a smooth and regular half-globe into something like the mold of a face. You loose a low whistle. Now you <i>know</i> you're dealing with magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last step is to \"polish\" it, so you clean up the mess and flop onto your bed with the mask and a cloth. The spell is vague about how much polishing is needed, and after a few minutes work, you put a movie into your laptop so you have something to watch while your fingers mindlessly rub the mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, the mask doesn't look any different, and still nothing happens when you put it to your own face. Maybe you should bring in a confidante, someone who knows something about chemistry.</span></div></div>",

He's pleased when you tell him that you asked your dad about part-time work at Salopek; he's less pleased when you bring up the subject of Lisa, and he has to admit that he couldn't get her to tell him anything enlightening about her breakup with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, you had, like, all day Saturday to talk to her!\" you explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't,'\" he retorts. \"I told you, I just ran into her at the mall. We had about fifteen minutes at the food court, and she spent most of the time looking over my shoulder for Eva and Jessica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why didn't you call her and set up a special meeting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how was I supposed to do that?\" He sounds peevish and hounded. \"What was I gonna say.

She needs help in Chemistry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone needs help with something,\" he mutters. \"But all she said was that it wasn't working for her. Why do you think there has to be some reason for it, other than that maybe she wasn't all that into you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clench your jaw. The thing is, that's exactly the conclusion you've been trying to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThat she dumped you is less of a mystery than the fact that Lisa Yarborough ever went out with you in the first place. You're not that funny looking, you flatter yourself. Sure, maybe you're a little too tall and gangly, and maybe your nose is a little too big and prone to zits, and maybe your hair sticks out stiffly like windblown mats of straw. But you must have something going for you, because during your junior year she turned down approaches by guys on the football and basketball teams, but she let you hang out with her starting at the end of May. And boy, was that fun, even if you didn't do much except sit close to each other. Lisa has violet eyes and thick, shoulder-length, raven-colored hair; bosoms that are large without flopping all over the place; and rocking hips that induce something like seasickness's pleasant, fun-loving cousin when you watch her walking away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a lot of her over the summer, and she wouldn't just sit next to you when you hung out at the park. She'd put her arm around your waist and nestle her head against your chest and let you lean your own head against the top of hers. And if she never got a bright, shiny stare when she looked at you, her eyes would still dance with pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, shortly after school started up again, she started making excuses for not hanging out after classes; and then during one horrible break between classes, when you went up to her and put your arm around her shoulder, she turned and calmly told you that you'd never actually said you were going out together. It was like the start of your summer-long fling, except in reverse: very cool and very casual, and without the hint that there was any meaning at all behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's hard not to replay that scene in your head. It's almost as bad as the scene that has Lisa talking to Geoff Mansfield, and smiling up at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is exactly the scene you saw on Friday afternoon when you got out of sixth period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nWhen you get home you catch your brother in your room, sitting in your chair, at your desk, hunched over your laptop with one hand pressing hard into his lap while the other hovers inches from the pornographic image that fills the computer screen.

You'll be in bigger trouble than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll put those blocks on your laptop too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and then you'll lose all your access too. Take your punishment like a man, you little shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter delivering five hard punches to his gut and groin, you let him wriggle out and run away, then slam and lock your bedroom door behind him. You hurl yourself into the chair, close the browser, and\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd open it up again, returning to the image he'd found and was working himself over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a low whistle. It's a good find. You copy it to your desktop, then move it into an innocuously titled folder buried deep inside fifty other folders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you go looking for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're done and have got most of the tension worked out, you turn your attention back to the mask\u2014you've nothing better to do than to work on it some more. But instead of polishing it all over, as you'd done before, you decide to concentrate on one spot and see if that makes a difference. Again, you start up a movie while you absent-mindedly rub a small place between your thumb and the knuckle of your index finger<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the movie you're called downstairs to take out the garbage. When you return and pick up the mask you notice a change in the place you've been rubbing: a spot, about the size of a quarter, has turned from dull white to a soft but brilliant blue. At first you are elated: your work has paid off, and you've some idea of what you should be doing to finish off the mask. But the feeling of happiness fades as it occurs to you that an hour of work has only buffed this one small patch. At the rate of an hour per square inch, it will take you more than week (and almost all your spare time) to finish it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resume watching the DVD, but this time you take frequent pauses to assess your work, and are relieved to see that it doesn't take as long as you'd feared to polish up a patch. But it is still going to be a long and boring task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe week brings a lot of homework, which doesn't give you a lot of time to spend on the mask: maybe two hours a day, tops, to polish it as you surf the internet or watch videos. School itself isn't very exciting, and Caleb, despite his promise, is very slow and reluctant to do any more snooping on your behalf. You have one infuriating conversation, though, when you go to the library for seventh-period study hall and stumble upon Geoff Mansfield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's typing on his laptop when you come in, and gets a gleam in his eye when he looks up to see you. It stops you short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prescott,\" he says coolly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mansfield,\" you reply, trying to be just as cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you and Lisa broke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only bite your lip. He continues, leaning back in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought maybe there'd been something going on between you two, so, you know, I've been real careful not to come between you guys. It wouldn't be cool to make a play for another guy's girl. I suppose there'd be nothing wrong with asking her out now, though, would there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMansfield is only a few months older than you, but he's solidly escaped the awkward puberty phase. He's at least an inch taller than you, with clear skin and thick, dark hair that curls behind his ears and over his forehead. He cruises confidently through the school corridors with shoulders back and chin out, and gazes calmly at the world out of dark, amused eyes. You've never been particularly jealous of the athletes in the school\u2014buncha muscle-bound jerks\u2014but Geoff is more or less like you. Just with all the kinks and awkward angles straightened out and all the blemishes erased. Which somehow makes it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do what you want,\" you snort. You suddenly feel the awkward weight of your backpack on your shoulder, and want to find a place to escape to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can do what I want,\" he replies with casual insolence. \"I wasn't asking for permission. I was just expressing a thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, find someone else to share your thoughts with,\" you mutter lamely as you brush past him. You can't be sure, but you think you hear him snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe weekend comes, and after finishing up all your required chores on Saturday morning you attack the remaining portions of the mask. You've got a system going by this time, trading the mask between hands when you get tired, and polishing in ever-widening circles. More and more of the mask turns a clear and brilliant blue. By Saturday night only a few streaks mar its glowing surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to the spell to double-check for anything that you might have overlooked. Nothing leaps out at you, though now that you are so close to finishing the job you are given pause by its ambiguity in describing how the mask is supposed to work. As best you can translate, the mask, when prepared, will \"absorb the form\" of any face it is laid against. Does this mean it will somehow suck out the very shape of the person you try it out on, leaving behind ... What? A sodden mass of flesh? Or will it only copy the person's features? How much will it copy: just the face or the entire body? You are also made nervous by the lack of any clue about how to unlock the rest of the book. Will it be enough to simply polish the mask to completion? Or will you have to take a chance and try the mask on someone\u2014yourself or another\u2014before the magic will let you proceed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis leaves you feeling very worried about trying to use this thing you've created, whether on yourself or on another person. If it's a dangerous thing, you'd prefer trying it on someone you dislike, but it would be very hard to get close to that kind of person. That leaves a friend or family member as the only kind of readily available guinea pig.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sit down at your desk and take up the mask; you've smoothed away even the tiniest imperfection you could find on its surface. There seems nothing else to do but try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie on your bed, holding the mask in your hands. You've taken the precaution of taking off all your clothes, in case they should interfere with whatever is supposed to happen. And so it's with a chill\u2014but also a tingle\u2014that you take a deep breath and slowly lower the mask onto your own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels very warm against your flesh, and you suddenly feel very drowsy. Great weights seem to be resting on your eyes and on all your joints. You try lifting your arm, but it is very heavy. There's a fog in your head, too, which makes thinking very difficult. Something warm and relaxing, almost like liquid sunlight, seems to be flowing over you. A buzzing sound, like a fly in a window, whispers in your ear ..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your eyes snap open. You are very cold all over, and stiff. Your eyes are, of course, hooded by the mask, so you can't see anything. In a claustrophobic panic you snatch it off your face and sit up. The blood rushes to your head and you almost topple over from dizziness<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you see that you still have arms and legs and a torso and other important appendages, all in the right places and all apparently unchanged. You blink stupidly and rub your eyes, feeling for all the world like you've just awoken from a very short but deep sleep. You glance at the clock: ten minutes have passed since you lay down, which means you almost certainly have been asleep. But you don't feel refreshed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the mask. It is still blue, and seemingly unchanged. And yet ... There is a reflective gleam there you hadn't seen before. You look more closely, and the gleam resolves into a shape. With a shock, you recognize it as your own face, held in the mask like a 3-D image. Though faded and almost colorless, it seems to be a perfect simulacrum, too, except for the black ovals where your eyes should be. As you turn and twist the mask, you find that you can glimpse different parts of the image from different angles, and when you tip it to peer at the top edge\u2014as though looking down on your crown\u2014you are amazed to see it also holds an image of your torso and stomach; when you tip it to the side, you are also able to glimpse part of your shoulder. It seems reasonable to conclude that the mask copies not just your face but your entire body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get dressed and return to the book. A light, oval-shaped stain has appeared on the spell page; its meaning seems clear enough, and you lay the newly enchanted mask on it. When you lift it, the page flutters. Eagerly you flip it over<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reverse side page more writing\u2014what looks like a continuation of the spell. You grab up your phone and open up the translator you've been using. You hope there aren't any nasty surprises in store. It would suck if the book has saved any warnings about side effects or booby-traps for after the mask has been made and used on someone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, there aren't any surprises, though there is new information. It appears that the mask will continue to \"absorb\" new body images each time it is laid upon a face, melding the new image with the old and thus creating new faces. You guess this means that if you put the mask on Robert, the mask would create a new form that looked like someone halfway between you and your brother\u2014a useful feature if you wanted to change your appearance without looking exactly like someone else. (You can't help wondering, though, what would happen if you combined male and female body types.) The mask won't work as a proper disguise, though, until you \"seal\" it, after which anyone who dons the mask will take on the form of whatever image the mask contains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at the next page, which looks very similar to the spell that you just completed. Two paragraphs of what looks like ingredients and instructions, and a sigil. That, you would hazard, is the spell for sealing up a mask.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can always create another mask to experiment on; right now you are just eager to see what further surprises the book holds. So you turn your attention to the \"sealing\" spell. This one appears to be simpler than the mask-creation spell, and requires no materials you haven't on hand. Rather less, in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindful of what happened last time, you wait until the next day, when the rest of your family is outside or off running errands, before setting up the desk and fan near the window. You carefully draw the sigil, set a bowl in it, and begin mixing ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are no explosions this time, even though you again have to put a flame to it. The result is a puddle of stuff with the consistency of paint, and when you lift the bowl the page flutters free. You concentrate on finishing the spell, though, and with a brush you coat the mask's inner surface with the stuff. It dries almost instantly and becomes transparent. Luckily no polishing is required, and you settle back to look over your newly sealed mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appears to be unchanged. Again, you take off your clothes and gingerly put it to your own face. Again, a deep feeling of drowsiness overcomes you, and you struggle to stay awake as warmth flows over your trunk and limbs. And then it evaporates, leaving you feeling very cold and shaky. You remove the mask and examine yourself, but there are no changes to yourself or the mask that you can spot. On reflection, you're not sure that you could have expected anything different. After all, would it have made sense to disguise yourself <i>as</i> yourself? At some point, you realize, you are going to have to try it on someone else. But how to do that without tipping the fact that you have this mask, and a book that describes how to make it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss the problem aside and after getting dressed you flip forward a page. On the reverse side of the spell is a single sentence that tells you no more than you've already figured: You have sealed up the mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you sigh heavily as you study the list of ingredients for the next spell. It requires a bunch of stuff you don't already have, and some of them\u2014like quicksilver\u2014will be hard to find. You're in lower spirits still when you get through deciphering the instructions on making the mysterious new item: it will apparently be some kind of metal band onto which you will have to inscribe some complicated runes and symbols. That will require you to purchase some new tools as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance over at your top dresser drawer, where you keep your cash stash. It's already pretty depleted from your earlier purchases. You drum your fingers for awhile, until your hear voices from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad is watching TV as you come down, and he glances up only briefly when you ask if you can borrow some money. \"How much?\" he asks, returning  his attention to the ball game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hundred?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat earns you his full attention. \"What the hell for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That science project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why doesn't Caleb pay for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm doing some side stuff on my own. I mean, it's related, but ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eyes you carefully. \"Why don't you take that part-time job at Salopek?\" You make a face. \"If you don't, I don't see how you're going to pay me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb really wanted it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then find another job for yourself.\" He turns back to the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could look for a job, but who knows how long it would take, and you're eager to get your hands on some cash now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I applied for that job, would you lend me the money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you apply, I'll loan you a hundred. If you <i>get</i> it, I'll loan you the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll do it. How do I apply?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bring you the forms tomorrow.\" He reaches into his wallet and plucks out a stack of twenties\u2014ten of them. \"You'll get it,\" he explains as he hands them to you, \"but I'll want those bills back if you screw up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAfter school you use the advance to purchase supplies. But instead of taking them home, you drive to the old elementary school, which is about two blocks over from your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's an ancient, graying hulk, with a half-abandoned playground out back that some of the younger neighborhood kids still haunt. A few years ago the village renovated the old cafeteria and turned it into a community center, but the rest of the building was left alone. You've been in it a few times, passing through old, dusty classrooms that appear to have been last renovated in the 1940s. The most interesting thing about the building\u2014and what recommended it to you several years ago as a hang out\u2014was its basement, which is accessible only from a sunken, recessed door hidden under the old gymnasium. You'd found that door, which is on the outside of the building, last year by poking around. With a little jimmying you got it open and explored inside, which you found stuffed with a jumble of old desks and tables and bookcases and cast-off gym equipment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd improvised yourself a small fort, more out of mischief than a sense of fun, and found your fort still intact when you checked back a few days later. So you installed a brand-new padlock on the door, as you were curious to see how long it would be before someone needed to go into the basement and cut your lock off. A few weeks later, it was still undisturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you'd taken to rearranging the basement to suit your own tastes, hiding in it some stuff you didn't want your parents to find, and inviting Caleb and Keith and few others to hang out and explore.You and the guys even spent last Halloween down there, telling ghost stories and sampling some liquor that Keith had gotten ahold of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was about the last time that you'd been out there, and you're surprised but pleased to see that your padlock is still on the door. Inside, you clear away spaces next to some of the windows that peek out just above ground level, set up some tables, and generally go about making it into a workshop and laboratory. If you're going to burn anyplace down, you'd rather it be the old school than your own house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou worry about ventilation and so have brought plenty of fans, but the new item you're making proves to need little in the way of combustion. You dribble a drop of mercury on the copper strip as directed, cover it with a strip of zinc, then sandwich the strips between two mirrors laid flat on the sigil in the book. With a steel-nib pen scratch the specified symbols on the back of the top-most mirror. Only a subtle hissing tells you that something is happening. When you pull out the metal strip you find that it has turned a brilliant silver and become almost infinitely flexible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a second one, then return home, where you can complete the etching and engraving in the comfort of your own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad is waiting there with the application for the job at Salopek and the assurance that the job is already yours; you will start it next Monday, working three hours a day after school on weekdays and five hours on Saturday. This will <i>really</i> cut into your free time, so you decide tomorrow to start preparing a new mask so that you can start getting it polished before the new job starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, you take out the small metal engraving tools and start cutting the runes into one of the bands. It is slow, delicate work, but you push through and stay up past four in the morning, working by the lamp on your desk, until you have completed both bands. You eyes are drooping when you fall onto your bed and lay one of the bands across your forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe shrill buzzing from your alarm clock wakes you, and you sit up in surprise and alarm. What is it about these things that they put you to sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rip the band from your forehead. It doesn't seem to have changed\u2014 No, wait, something glitters around the runes. You look at them more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThin, blue letters seem to float above the runework: WILLIAM MARTIN PRESCOTT, they read<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand drops nervelessly into your lap. The thing knows your name! It was odd enough that the magic could copy your face and body. But it's is far scarier to find that the magic can reproduce your name, a thing that isn't on your body, but, if it is anywhere, is inside your body, inside your <i>mind</i>\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger over to the book and lay the newly made band across the spell's sigil. When you try it, the page turns, revealing a new spell and the remainder of the old. The latter is only a few words long, and can fit inside a browser window without causing it to crash: \"to know the mind of another\" appears to be the best translation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low whistle escapes your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course: It wouldn't do to try imitating someone if you couldn't carry off the deception perfectly, which would require somehow gaining their memories. With such an instrument you could learn everything you desired to know about a person: what they know, what they fear, what they desire, what they hate ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eye falls on the second band, already prepared and ready to be used on another person.</span></div></div>",

You read it carefully and discover that the next spell is fairly straightforward, using only material that you already used to make the masks and sealant. It's the work of only a few minutes to make a thin paste, which (under the book's direction) you use to attach the metal band to the mask. You set the modified mask onto the page; when you lift it again, the page beneath flutters free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reverse side (characteristically) tells you what you've done: You've glued a copy of your brain to a copy of your body. (Dur!) But it means that anyone who puts on the mask now will not only get your looks, but your memories and personality traits, making for a perfect imposture. Soberly, you reflect that you will have to keep your mask in a very safe place, and you hide it in one of the desks back against the basement wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then make up a new, blank mask, then take it and the book back to your house before it gets dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad is working late again, so you take your dinner upstairs and turn your attention to the next spell. It takes a lot of careful reading, translating and note taking; and with a sinking heart you go online to see how easy it will be to get the materials. The outlook is grim: it calls for a lot of chemicals and fuels, some of which may be hard to find and all of which will be quite expensive. You've already blown through almost all of the advance your dad gave you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's the main ingredient that gives you the most pause, even though it should cost next to nothing: earth taken from a graveyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drum your fingers on the desk and stare off into nothingness. You'll be starting that job at Salopek next week, but it'll be two weeks before you get a paycheck. It's an engineering company; maybe they will have some of the expensive items, and you could lift some? Tricky, risky. You open up your desk drawer and look down at the blank mind band you still have. You could put it on someone at Salopek, and that might tell you how to get ahold of anything that they have out there ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's still only a medium-range plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you can still make a start. Tomorrow you'll see about getting out into a graveyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<i>The next day.</i> You stop a few feet from your locker and blink. Three girls, two in cheerleader togs, are standing in front of it, chatting intently. One is Kendra Saunders, one of the snootier and stuck-up members of the squad. The second you don't recognize. The third\u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my God.</i> It's Chelsea Cooper. Head cheerleader and unofficial queen of the school. The tippy-top of the tippy-top of the pyramid. On a clear day you can almost see her from the gloomy depths that you and Caleb and Keith inhabit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, you glance over your shoulder to see if her boyfriend, the basketball team captain, is around. Dude will punch you into next week if he sees you up close and talking to his girlfriend, which you'll have to do if you're to get into your locker. You gulp and draw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you say to the third girl while pretending to not notice the other two. \"I need to get into my locker here,\" you mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea turns on you with a bright eye. \"Oh, hey,\" she chirps. \"Have you seen Lisa around?\" You stare and shake your head. \"Don't you share lockers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the color rising in your cheeks. \"No,\" you murmur. \"She's over in C wing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea's smile instantly falls off her face. \"I thought you shared lockers with her.\" She wheels on the third girl in her trio, who though you don't recognize her as a cheerleader is of exactly that type. \"You said they share lockers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the poor girl mumbles. \"I said they're going out together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said they share lockers.\" Chelsea's sweet soprano is like a sheath for the icy dagger in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shrinks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were going out,\" you blurt out, \"and we did share lockers for a little while.\" That's not true, but you are feeling really sorry for the girl. \"But not any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for nothing anyway.\" Chelsea rolls her eyes and stalks off with Kendra in tow. The third girl shoots you a quick look\u2014of gratitude? anger? bafflement? you can't tell\u2014and hustles after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, though, take some compensation in watching Chelsea's magnificently swaying ass until it vanishes around a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nFortunately, the town has several cemeteries, but the nearest is the Masonic cemetery a mile from your house. You wait until it is good and dark, then drive out to it, parking in the back. The book said nothing about dirt from an actual grave, so you pick a spot just inside the wall and start digging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's long, hard work, as the spell calls for four hundred pounds of earth. You begin by carefully packing it into sandbags, which you stack neatly by the wall. But the wind comes up, and the trees begin to creak, and the thin, crescent moon falls below the horizon, leaving you plunged in darkness. That's bad enough, but you are soon made jumpy by the sound of cars passing. You're sure no one can see you, but if someone spots your truck and comes investigating, you'll have a hell of a time explaining what you're doing. Before long, you're just shoving dirt into bags and pushing them feverishly aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms are aching badly long before you're finished, but you grimly press through to the end, taking the bags back to the school and transferring them to the basement. Back at the house, you can barely lift your feet from the floor as you shuffle into the living room. Your dad and father swing around to gape at you; Robert puts his hand over his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell have you been doing?\" your dad demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance down: you are covered in dirt and sweat and grime and ... well, you hope it's nothing worse than those three. \"Uh, just out with some friends. Kind of started, uh, rough housing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Into a tub,\" your father orders, stabbing his fingers at the stairs. \"And put those clothes in the garage before you get in. There's no way they're going into a regular load.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and return whence you came. Your clothes are filthy, you have to admit as you peel them off. Far filthier than they should be, you think, to your own discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the new mask into the bathroom with you, and start polishing it while you soak in the tub. You haven't much hope that soap and water will make the job go faster, and it doesn't seem to. You rub and you rub, and your mind drifts back to Lisa and thence back to the episode at your locker. Chelsea is a cunt, but God! she is gorgeous. Long, golden hair; thrusting lips; bosoms you could rest a saucer on; an ass that swishes invitingly inside that pleated cheerleader skirt; long, strong, shapely legs ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mask slips from your hand to the floor beside the tub, and soon you are polishing something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Caleb, can I borrow some money from you?\" you ask him the next day when you're in the library before classes have started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hundred?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles. \"Lemme call my financial adviser.\" You blink as he takes out his cell phone. \"Yo, Warren,\" he says jauntily into it. \"How's the market doing, old bean? You don't say. Telephone's down. Railroad's down. Steel's down. How is ILovePrescott-dot-com? In the shitter? That's too bad. And PrescottSucks-dot-com? Through the roof? Tsk tsk. Should've put my money there.\" He closes it and serenely returns your glare. \"Sorry, old chum. Portfolio completely wiped out. Gonna have to let some of the servants go, in fact, it looks like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could've just said 'Fuck you'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I could've. In fact, I think I will. Fuck you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still sore about that job at Salopek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe twists his mouth up hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You take a job that I wanted and you didn't,\" he snarls. \"A job with a pretty good salary and lots of connections. And before you even start it, you hit me up for ... two hundred dollars?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got the job! I'm good for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're good for fuck all, Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want the job? I'd give it to you, but\u2014!\" you start, and then snap your mouth shut. Your brain starts to feel hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill Prescott has the job, sure, but does Will Prescott\u2014the real Will Prescott\u2014have to be the one who shows up? If Caleb wore the mask you made of yourself he could go out there for you. Of course, that would mean taking him into your confidence, but you've come real close a couple of times to doing just that. And after seeing what you've stumbled onto, he'd probably be real happy to chip in some money right away for those chemicals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe downside\u2014well, one of several, you suppose\u2014is that he'd want to keep at least part of that work salary for himself. But you could afford to be generous, since he'd be doing you a big favor. Heck, you might even give him ... thirty percent of your paycheck?</span></div></div>",

Don't fuck with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's worth ninety percent of your paycheck to keep me from going in on Monday, totally fucking things up, and getting your ass fired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale. \"You wouldn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was the one who wanted the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Caleb, who, thanks to the mask he is wearing, is sporting both your face and a most infuriatingly smug expression. You're in the elementary school basement. There's a floor-to-ceiling mirror propped up against one of the walls\u2014probably rescued from a school gymnasium\u2014and he has been studying himself in it for the last five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know you wanted that job,\" you tell Caleb through gritted teeth, \"and that's why I'm giving you this chance to take it. And it's why I'm offering you ... forty percent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb gives you a withering look. \"Dude, I should get a hundred percent, since I'd be doing all the goddamned work for you. The money is the only thing in it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you wanted the job and you'd have it!\" you exclaim, trying to turn his earlier statement against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted the job for the money and the connections. I can't get the connections if I'm being Will Fuck Up Prescott. That leaves the money as the only attraction. 'All work and all pay' is the only way I'll take you up on your offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppress the urge to throttle him; choking a guy who looks like yourself would be too weird. You slump onto one of the many dusty tables jumbled up in the basement, and sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought you in on this ... really cool secret,\" you protest. \"That's gotta be worth something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb eyes you shrewdly. \"You want some of the work money, you do some of the work. We'll keep a schedule. At the end of each pay period we'll split the pot in proportion to how much we worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still deserve some kind of bonus for bringing you in,\" you insist. \"I bought the book, I bought the shit that went into that mask you're wearing, I shoveled that pile of shit back there\u2014\" You jerk your head at the pile of sandbags in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what is that for?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya got me. Freakin' book tells you what to do with it, but not what it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Caleb says. \"What you say is a fair point. For an equal partnership I'll chip in as much as you've already spent. How much would that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little more than two hundred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got forty to my name at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you do fly at for his throat. \"The whole reason I showed you this shit was so you could kick in some shit to pay for the shit that I need to shit shit use to shit finish the next shit spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just grins. \"And how much do you need to finish it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least two hundred!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs. \"Well, payday would be in a few weeks. It might take two pay days to raise it, what with taxes and all, but\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to wait that long! If I could've waited that long we wouldn't be having this conversation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it that you've the patience of a squirrel.\" He checks himself out in the mirror again, and brushes his hair over. \"I can understand it better, but I can't fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glower. \"You know, it occurs to me that you are taking all this magic stuff pretty calmly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still not convinced it's really happening. Like, I thought you told me this thing was supposed to give me your memories and not just your crappy looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it doesn't. Tell me something I should be remembering,\" Caleb challenges you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown at him. \"How much money did I have when I started this project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb gives you a look. \"Do even <i>you</i> know the answer to that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit that you don't, not to the dollar, at any rate. But no matter what you throw at him, he affects to not know anything about your life that he doesn't already know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you fucked it up,\" Caleb eventually says. \"Not that I'm surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look in the mirror,\" you retort, \"and tell me again that I fucked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a fuck up of a different kind,\" Caleb says. But he does give himself a once-over that you flatter yourself is at least a little appreciative. \"Anyway, it does seem like a good idea you brought me in on this. Maybe I can keep you from blowing yourself up. At the very least, I'll be able to look things over, make sure you're doing things right. Speaking of which, now that we've settled the financials, what can I help you with? What else can you do with that book you got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I need money from you. I can't do the next spell 'cos I don't have the money for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why don't you just skip ahead to some other spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain how the pages of the book are locked, and how to unlock them. He demands to see the book himself, and makes a sour face when he finds that you weren't mistaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we can make things like this thing that you fucked up making,\" Caleb observes. \"You still got the stuff to make those things, at least?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I also got\u2014 Oh yeah!\" You snap your finger. \"I got another one of those memory stick things. By itself. I was thinking of using it on someone at Salopek. Maybe they've got a bunch of the chemicals we need for the next spell, and if we knew where they were, you could pick up some after you go in to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assuming it works,\" he says. \"So, have you done that? Have you used it on someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't connected with anyone who works at Salopek yet,\" you tell him with grinding patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks over and grabs your shoulders. \"And where does our dad work?\" he asks in a weary tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething catches in your throat. \"You're not serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will, why is neither of us capable of using your brain this afternoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou hunch in front of your father. It's Saturday, and he's taking his afternoon siesta on the couch. His sleep is a bit deeper than normal because he's got a mind band inside him at the moment ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention is caught by a movement in the corner of your eye. Your younger brother frowns down at you from the entryway. \"What are you doing? If you wake him up--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not doing anything. Push off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks over to crouch down next to you. \"What's up?\" He peers at your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shove him. \"I said go away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushes you back. \"He's my dad too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wake him up\u2014!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then be quiet!\" he shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab him and wrestle him away. He howls, and the two of you roll on the floor, tearing at each others' shirts. \"Mom!\" he yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" You work your way on top of him and clamp your hand over his mouth. He glares up at you, and then his eyes go wide. A firm hand grabs you by the shoulder and hauls you up. Your dad's icy eyes bore into yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on!\" he roars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He started it!\" Robert yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't doing anything!\" you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then both of you can do it outside!\" He puts his hands on his hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert scrambles up and stomps away, but you hurl yourself into the easy chair and snatch up a school book. \"I was studying,\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just snorts and starts to turn away. As he does so, something catches his eye, and he bends down to pick a strip of metal up from the floor. You nearly choke, but he just sets it on the coffee table, and with a quiet oath leaves the room. You grab the mind band and shove it into your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" says Caleb when you meet him at his house later, holding the mind band aloft. \"Lemme see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull it back from his outstretched hand. \"Who says you're going to put it on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be the one working at Salopek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs. \"Whatever. So put it on, see if it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a rude noise with your lips, look down at it ... and freeze. It's your dad's name\u2014HARRIS BRIAN PRESCOTT\u2014floating over its silvery surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ewww.</i> Do you really want to get inside your dad's head? The squick factor, clearly, was the reason you hadn't even thought to use him as an entry point to Salopek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lick your lips.

It glows, sinking into him, and he falls onto his back. You watch him for what seems like forever, pacing back and forth in a tight circle, then freeze when his eyes pop open. His brow furrows, he blinks at the ceiling, and he sits up. The expression he gives you is rather puzzled. Then his brow darkens, and his mouth turns down. With a shock, you recognize it as your father's characteristic frown. \"Caleb?\" you squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm here,\" he says brusquely. \"You know, you're getting yourself into a shitload of trouble, young man. Science experiment, my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou back up against the wall as he gets to his feet and surveys the bedroom, hands on hips. \"Dude, this is pretty freaky,\" you whisper, and can't quite keep a quaver out of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think I feel?\" he retorts. He looks down at his feet, then examines his palms, flexing his fingers. \"At least your friend here has a pretty solid brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who exactly am I talking to?\" Your voice is now edging toward a shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jogs the side of his head with the heel of his hand. \"It's me, Will,\" he says, though that doesn't exactly answer your question. \"But your dad has a pretty strong personality.\" He blinks and shakes his head. \"God, you can be such an idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't  start that with me,\" you retort, recovering a little. \"I get enough of that at home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, alright.\" He shakes his head again, then sighs. \"Okay, let's look at that list of ingredients you need from work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith more reluctance than you'd like to feel, you dig your notebook out of your backpack and hand it to him. He flips through it, and frowns at the list of materials you need. He sniffs and pulls at his nose--another creepily Dad-esque gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we got this stuff at Salopek,\" he says. \"Or we can get it. But how were you planning on walking out the front gate with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how would you do it? You'll be the one going in to work on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives you one of those parental looks that makes you bridle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing to do is to get\"\u2014he stumbles a little\u2014\"your dad to pick them up and take them out. If you try walking out of the complex with this stuff you'll get busted and fired and grounded and maybe even arrested. The thing to do is to make a phone call.\" His throat seems to work. \"Have you done your homework yet?\" he asks with peevish impatience. \"What did you get on your last math test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" you ask in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to do your dad's voice. Did I sound like him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I mean, that's the way he talks, but your voice isn't\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we have to get a copy of his body. Make a total copy of him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you out of your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm inside his. <i>You</i> couldn't outwit a gerbil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sits at his desk, pushing the mess aside with a loud snort, and begins scribbling in your notebook. The hair on your back rises as you recognize your dad's handwriting as it flows across the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make a phone call on Monday, have them put together what we need,\" he says. \"They'll pack it all up, nice and neat, and we can have it messengered out of the complex.\" He taps his finger. \"No, that'll require signatures and expense accounts. Finance is bollixed up, but Tom might notice something.\" His frown deepens. \"No, as long as we've got a copy of your dad, we'll just have to use it. He'll pick it up, take it over to the clubhouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to copy my dad! Getting that mind band was creepy enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes freeze. \"Look, do want these chemicals or not? You go in half-assed and you'll get your whole ass blown off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could just lift his credit card, buy the stuff in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're just looking to get busted, mister. I'll defin\u2014 Your dad will definitely notice those kinds of charges on the statement. The card company might even decline the charges while you're standing at the register, and then what will happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt'll be the middle of the week before you can get the new mask polished up, and the weekend probably before you can try getting it onto your dad. You spend Monday afternoon hiding out in the elementary school basement, polishing the mask and watching a movie on your laptop while Caleb goes into work for you. Afterward you drive over to Caleb's to talk about his day at Salopek. \"Oh, you know Sean Mitchell?\" he says after giving a brief description of what sounds like a very boring job. \"He works out there, they've got me paired up with him. Pretty nice. If we could copy him for you to wear, we could have some fun out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how would we get him out of the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, I'm not serious. Anyway, it's not a lot of fun, but it's more fun with him than it could be. You know he's got a bottle of Scotch stashed away in one of the buildings? We had a little nip before quitting time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just grunt, and then a thought hits you. \"Say, what'll happen if he tries talking to me at school about work?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I guess you'll have to improvise. Anyway, what are the chances you'll have to talk to him?\" Sean is a wrester and football player: not a jerk, but not someone you know except by acquaintance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden thought comes to you. \"Hand me the mask. I wanna try something.\" He cocks an eyebrow as he hands it over. You finger it tentatively. Putting it to your face might destroy the day's memories it contains; or it might give them to you. Taking a deep breath you put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat seems like ages later you wake with a feeling of claustrophobia and slap the mask off. Caleb is sitting on the bed by your side, staring at you intently. \"What happened?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It went into you, then came back out. You've been out for twenty minutes. What happened on your end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your memories roll back, to remember\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving to work in Caleb's car; filling out paperwork; meeting your supervisor and Sean; working; the drink in the distribution center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember what happened today,\" you tell Caleb, and feel relief. Before you can stop him, Caleb takes the mask from you and puts it on himself. The transformation into you takes a few minutes, and then you compare notes after your newly reborn twin sits up. \"Whoa, double vision,\" he says. \"I remember being at work, but I also remember\u2014 God, that was a boring movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou part soon afterward, and are glad for having done the experiment after you go home and have to endure a third degree from your dad about the day's events at Salopek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nOn Saturday you manage to get the new mask onto your dad without a repeat of the incident with Robert. You also filch one of your dad's dress shirts and slacks from his closet and take them over to Caleb's: You still don't want to get inside your dad's head, so you'll be going to work on Monday as yourself, and Caleb will play your dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Monday afternoon arrives, you're glad that you have the past week's memories of being at Salopek to draw on, for it makes working with Sean and the others at the complex very natural and easy. Sean himself, as you \"remember,\" is very friendly and easygoing, and you enjoy your time working with him. At around four-thirty, your supervisor, Andy Keyes, sends you around to the distribution center, where Jack has a package for your dad\u2014seems he asked for you specifically to deliver it to him. <i>Ah, the stuff,</i> you think happily to yourself. To your surprise, as you round a corner you find that Caleb hasn't contented himself with waiting for you by the front office, but has plunged into the complex to find you. You thrust the box at him. \"Jesus, better get outta here before someone spots you,\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares at you as he takes the box. \"So what'll happen if someone 'spots' me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be kinda awkward. Just get out of here. I gotta get back to work anyway.\" You hurry off, but at the corner of a building you turn and catch sight of him, rooted to the pavement, staring at you. <i>Moron,</i> you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the route back to your current task takes you by the front office, and as you pass you hear someone call your name sharply. You turn and do a double-take: It's your dad. \"You got something for me, mister?\" he asks in a hard voice. \"It's been nearly ten minutes since I called for it. There something wrong with the gears in your ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops, and in a daze you point back whence you came. \"I just\u2014 I just gave it to you. Back\u2014\" He frowns, and you feel your cheeks pale: He's wearing a different shirt\u2014the shirt you pulled from his closet. You gulp. \"I just gave it to you a minute ago.\" You point again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe follows the direction of your finger, and you see him swallow. His eyes flick back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk about this later,\" he says in a cold, meaningful tone. \"You just see what you can do about fixing your little screw up.\" He turns and stalks off into the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow on earth are you going to explain your behavior to your dad--especially while trying to get the mis-delivered package back from him? Every fiber in your body says you should run and hide and leave well enough alone; maybe it will work out if you just stay still. But what will happen if he looks in that box and starts asking why someone was delivering a box of that stuff to him?</span></div></div>",

Well, you'll get used to it all the quicker the more you see of him,\" Andy says with slightly folksy sarcasm. \"Go back and get the voucher. Hop to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you hang back unwillingly just long enough for Sean to rescue you. \"I can go, Andy,\" he tells your supervisor. \"Mr. Prescott doesn't freak <i>me</i> out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look between Sean and Andy with an intense sense of mortification. Sean rescues you there, too, by just sauntering out of the center. He shoots you a wink over his shoulder as he disappears out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look so impressed with him, Prescott,\" Andy says, and you realize you mouth is hanging open. \"I don't think much of anything could freak Mitchell out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>True,</i> you reflect as you hang your head. <i>But he </i>is<i> a football player and wrestler, and is built like one.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAnd the punch line, of course, is that Sean has left you with all the heavy work while he gets to take a relaxing stroll through the complex. And you do mean <i>all the heavy work,</i> for Andy himself returns to his office to take care of some sudden business, leaving you alone to sweat and strain and grunt and struggle with heavy iron equipment that needs moving off the dirty, greasy floor and onto some handcarts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you're in a bad mood when Sean saunters back in. The son of a bitch is whistling, even. \"What, did you take a vacation while you were at it?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answers by knocking the cap off your head, and you shoot him a dirty look as you bend to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dad made me wait while he looked inside that box,\" he says with a grin. \"Then he made me take it back to the distribution center 'cos he didn't ask for any of the crap in it. <i>Then</i> Jack had a <i>different</i> box for me to take to your dad, and then he gave me a <i>different</i> voucher to give back to Jack. Oh, yeah, I've been busy.\" He lifts his chin and smirks good-naturedly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you blink hard at his words. \"That box? My dad sent it back?\" you ask. \"To the distribution center?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain and your heart both start running at a hundred miles an hour. \"I gotta take a piss,\" you mutter. \"Can you handle things till I get back from the head?\" Sean rolls his eyes and with those massive biceps of his he picks up a drill piece that ought to have required the services of a forklift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're already on your phone even before you reach the facilities. You almost trip in mid-stride when your dad answers the call, and you stammer uncertainly as you try to figure out if you hit the right item on your call list. \"Uh, hi,\" you say. \"Did, uh, did Sean get that voucher from you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a pause. \"The fuck are you talking about, Will?\" your dad says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart flops almost audibly about your chest. \"Caleb?\" you squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's yo mama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you!\" You catch yourself and whirl around, to make sure you weren't overheard. \"Bad enough you're being my dad, you leave my mom out of it! But listen, I got things set up for you. Just go to the distribution center. Jack has the box there\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not setting foot inside the complex while your dad's still there,\" Caleb tells you in your dad's firmest tones. \"If you can get to those supplies, mister, <i>you</i> can carry them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't! Not after the\u2014!\" You charge into the restroom, and drop an F-bomb as an almost solid stench of urine and sweat whomps you in the face. \"God <i>damn</i> it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" For instant Caleb sounds like himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just\u2014 Faugh! Anyway, after the fuck up I just pulled, I can't be seen with that box! So you're gonna hafta\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, hang on.\" Your dad's voice returns, then cuts out. As you wait for him to continue, you experiment with breathing the foul air through your tongue and tonsils, and when that doesn't work you experiment with breathing directly through the pores in your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Mitchell there?\" Caleb finally asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? Sean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there another Mitchell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop sounding just like my dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, go find Jack and tell him\u2014 No, wait. Just go find him and tell him I want to talk to him. On your phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gladly!</i> You nearly tear the door off the restroom as you run outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distribution center you find Jack typing at the computer; that box you delivered is sitting on the counter in front of him. \"Here,\" you tell him as you thrust your phone at him. \"My friend\u2014 My dad, I mean! My dad want to talk to you.\" You feel yourself turning a bright red as Jack takes your phone with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack mutters gruffly into the phone, and he copies something down on a sheet of paper. When he's done, he hands the phone back to you. \"Send Mitchell back over here,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what? I mean, yes sir.\" To Caleb, once you're out of earshot: \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do as you're told,\" he barks. \"I've got it covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean looks vastly amused\u2014but also slightly puzzled\u2014when you give him the message. He is gone for a very long time, almost to the end of the workday, which leaves you huffing and straining and sweeping and cleaning. But you keep your temper when Sean finally shows back up. \"Where'd you go?\" is all you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had to play delivery boy,\" he says. He looks around the cleared spaces with an expression of deep satisfaction, and slowly brushes his hands together. \"I'd say we did a good day's work here. Wouldn't you?\" He returns your glower with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"It's like fucking Christmas,\" Caleb chortles. He's still in your dad's clothes, but at least he's out of the mask. \"I do so enjoy being a genius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it was my dad's idea,\" you retort as you pull out the neatly labeled canisters that you got Salopek Aerospace to order and buy for you. \"You were using his brain when you thought of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. He was using <i>my</i> brain. His brains were in his office, with him, so\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your brains are gonna be all over the basement wall if you don't shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still you have to give Caleb credit, both for the initial plan and for being able to salvage it at the last minute. Using your dad's voice and knowledge, he got Jack to give the package to Sean with orders to deliver it to the recreation center in Acheson. Then Caleb, watching at a distance, only had to saunter over and claim it using the ID of the person that he had told Jack to tell Sean to tell the rec center would be collecting it: one \"Caleb Johansson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he only had to carry it around the corner and into the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cataloging all the items and confirming that you have everything you need, you get down to the work of concocting the spell. While Caleb measures out the chemicals, you draw a copy of the requisite sigil atop a conference table, then unload four hundred pounds of cemetery earth onto it and douse it with chemicals. Caleb double-checks the recipe, and snips off a bit of your hair to add to the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a couple of minutes you hesitate and argue, for the next part requires you to put a match to it, and considering the kind of incendiaries on that pile you and Caleb both worry about setting the old school ablaze. But you've gone into it this far, so you position yourself near the door while Caleb, standing at some distance, strikes a match and flings it onto the dirt pile. For a moment you think the match must have gone out. But then a purple bloom of flame rushes off it with a gentle <i>whoosh.</i> After you and Caleb have recovered from your shock, you advance cautiously on the violet flames that have engulfed the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No heat,\" Caleb says, and he thrusts his hands into it. \"None at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we just leave it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. But how long is it supposed to burn?\" You check the spell, but it only says to let the pile burn until it cannot be relit. Caleb eventually goes to get you both some supper while you sit and watch, and when he gets back you treat it almost like a campfire, sitting and watching the flames as the night settles about you. Along about ten, though, you decide there's no point in watching any further, and go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAccording to your partnership agreement, Caleb still owes you two hundred dollars, so each day of the following week he dons your mask and goes in to work at Salopek. You keep hidden, meanwhile, at the basement, where you watch (and occasionally relight the fire) while doing homework and/or polishing up a new mask and mind band. The plan for the latter, of course, is to make a copy of Caleb to complement the mask of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're still not done with it when, on Saturday, the fire goes out and will not relight. Your fingers tremble with excitement as you dial Caleb (who is working at Salopek) to tell him that it's done.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fire has definitely done something to the dirt. For a start, it has shrunk and tightened up into a solid object with something like the consistency of baked clay. Fissures have opened in it: one running up the middle of the central axis almost to the midpoint, and two shorter ones opening on opposite flanks higher up. These give it the appearance of a crude, quarter-finished statue of a person, with legs at the bottom and two arms on the sides. A certain bulbousness at the other end contributes to the illusion by resembling an onion-shaped head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last step of the spell says that it has to be \"polished,\" and you and Caleb both groan. If it takes a week to polish a mask, this will take a year! Or two years! But, to your relief, it turns out only to need a light dusting to get the remaining impurities off it. Then Caleb lays the book, spell-side down, on the thing's \"chest\". The page is already dangling loose when he flips the book back over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a golem!\" Caleb says in an awed whisper after you and he have pored over the reverse side of the spell. \"You know, like in those old East European stories!\" You shake your head. \"These magicians would make a clay statue, and they'd imbue it with life somehow,\" he continues, \"and it would be their servant. Kind of like a robot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the pile. \"So how do we turn it on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You jerk it off?\" Caleb chortles. \"No, seriously, you put a mask on it.\" He points to one of the passages in the book. \"Where's\u2014? Here!\" He grabs up the mask he's been wearing to Salopek and drops it onto the thing's \"face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt vanishes like a dinner plate slipping into a still pool of water. You'd almost think that ripples run through it ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, during a microsecond when you weren't paying attention, the clay pile is replaced by a human figure: a skinny, scrawny human with patchy hair at its shins and pubes and chest, and thick, straw-like hair at its crown. Its eyes crinkle and open, and it blinks at Caleb, and then at you as it sits up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and both leap up and back away. \"Holy fuck!\" you cry in unison. You bang the back of your legs on a table, which collapses with a crash to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, a kid who look a lot like you has put his head up and, with a wild-eyed look of terror on his face, has backed up against a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb howls with laughter. \"Jesus Christ, Will! It's just like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is? That?\" you gasp. The other kid\u2014who, yes, is your exact twin\u2014stares with terrified horror between you and Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" he wails, and he points at you. \"What's <i>that?</i>\" He looks down and hiccups. \"And why's it wearing my shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn!\" Caleb hoots. \"It doesn't know it's a fake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, everybody just calm down!\" you shriek. \"Just calm fucking down!\" Your breath is coming is such short gasps you're afraid you'll hyperventilate. \"You!\" You jab a finger at the naked you. \"Who? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will!\" He gulps, and his face twists up. \"Will Prescott!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb interrupts. \"What's the last thing you remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I dunno!\" It wipes its face. \"Going to work, driving here? Wait!\" It straightens up and its look of panic darkens into one of suspicion as it looks between you and Caleb. \"I came here, and I talked to\u2014\" He points at you. \"I talked to you about work. And then I\u2014\" His brow furrows and his lips work as he peers at Caleb. \"Shouldn't I be <i>you?</i>\" he squeaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb nods, but you can only stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look here,\" Caleb says. The boy who looks like you flinches but suffers to let your friend drop a hand on his shoulder. \"You're a mask, okay? You remember that, right? Going onto and off my face? And then I'd go around and pretend to be you? Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing licks its lips, and nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And sometimes you'd go onto that fucker's face,\" Caleb continues, and points to you. (\"Fucker?\" you mouth at him.) \"And then you'd remember things that he's done. Right?\" Again, the boy nods. \"So you remember how we made a pile of dirt and set it on fire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" your twin croaks. \"We got that stuff from Salopek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Caleb spreads his hands. \"Well, you're that pile of dirt. It finished burning, and we put that mask on it, and voila! Here you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour twin staggers and puts his hand out to catch himself. \"You mean I'm\u2014?\" He turns green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a golem,\" says Caleb. \"Don't let it bother you,\" he adds cheerfully. \"So you're made of dirt and clay. So are we!\" He spreads his arms. \"Whole fucking universe is made of dirt and clay, basically! Well, hydrogen, if you wanna be pedantic\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing doesn't look any happier at his words. \"So what are you going to do with me?\" it cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" you exclaim. \"My dad thinks one of me is enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb rolls his eyes. \"Dude! Use your imagination! Use him to do all the stuff you don't want to do! Like, I don't have to go in to work for you anymore! We can send Clayface here instead! He can go to school for you, and go home and do your chores!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gape. \"And what do <i>I</i> do while he's doing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb shrugs. \"Hang out here and jerk off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, that doesn't sound very appealing. \"And what do we do with it while I'm out doing the stuff I want to do? Shit! Caleb!\" You feel yourself turning very pale. \"Does it have to eat? Am I gonna have to get <i>another</i> job to buy food for it so it doesn't <i>starve</i> to death?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" the golem says. \"And what if I don't want to do that stuff like school and chores?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb marches over to the book. \"It says right here,\" he calls out in a loud voice, \"that the golem has to obey the master!\" He looks around with a triumphant expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your mask,\" says Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the golem, which is turning green again. \"Do you have to do what I say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rictus spreads across its face. \"Something in me says I have to say yes,\" it tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDizziness sweeps over you. \"Touch your toes,\" you say faintly, and your twin, with a miserable expression, bends over to grasp his naked feet. \"Do a jumping jack.\" It flails like a marionette with tangled strings. \"Er ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell it to suck my cock,\" Caleb says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" You advance on the golem, which returns you a terrified grin. \"Huh,\" you say. \"I guess it could be useful. But if it has to be fed\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on,\" Caleb says, and he pulls you back. \"Let me try something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reaches for your twin's face, but the latter slaps him away with a snarled, \"Get away from me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will?\" Caleb says, and you tell the unhappy creature to put its hands down and hold still. It complies, though it looks like it's about to burst into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb grasps it by the brow, mutters under his breath, and pulls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face and form vanish, to be replaced by that clay statue again, now standing upright with appendages slightly akimbo. Caleb turns to you with a grin, and shows you the mask in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <i>that's</i> how come you don't have to feed it,\" he chortles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nCaleb wants to put the mask back onto the golem and order it to finish polishing the new mask, but you tell him he can polish it himself. Caleb relents with bad grace, but cheers up when you suggest taking a look at the next spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same freaking stuff as we needed for the last one,\" he reports as he copies down a list of ingredients. (It makes sense that one person go through the book instead of two, so you're goofing off with YouTube videos on your phone.) \"Good thing your dad ordered us so much stuff,\" he chortles. \"Say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not putting my dad's mask on that thing! It was creepy enough when you were wearing it,\" you add as he grins at you. \"Having a completely fake him down here with us?\" You shiver hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just don't have a sense of fun,\" Caleb says as he bends over the book again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should get a mask of your mom,\" you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now <i>that's</i> not funny,\" Caleb barks. \"Now, if we knew where <i>my</i> dad was, and we got a mask of him, there's a few things I'd like to say and do to him.\" His normally good-natured countenance falls into a hard glower. But he doesn't continue, and just resumes scribbling on a piece of paper. His father abandoned him and his mother when he was young, and this is one of the few times you've heard him speak openly of the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we don't need to make another trip to the cemetery,\" Caleb says a minute later. \"This one only calls for forty pounds of dirt, and I think we've got that much left in the corner.\" You nod vacantly. But a minute later you look up when Caleb says \"Uh oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't answer, but starts working furiously at his phone. \"What?\" you ask again, and still he doesn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several minutes you stare at him as he scowls at the book and taps at his phone and pulls at his nose and lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he says, \"Maybe we do need to make a trip to the cemetery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth falls open. \"A corpse? The spell calls for a <i>corpse?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so,\" Caleb says grimly. \"Actually it just calls for a human body. But if it doesn't mean 'corpse,' then the recipe calls for a live person to be sacrificed.\"</span></div></div>",

Or Eva, if it's her face we put in the mask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb looks at the golem, and looks at the mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" he says. \"I guess we should run a test first. I know!\" He snaps his fingers. \"Your dad's mask! Put it on the golem and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will! We gotta find out if it obeys us! Well, you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what happens if it doesn't?\" you retort. \"I don't need my dad, even a fake dad, down here trying to order me around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will, it won't order you around, you'll order <i>it</i>\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless my dad is it's master because it obeys whoever is inside the mask!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your dad won't be here to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you insist that you <i>won't</i> put your dad's mask onto the golem, and that Caleb will just have to finish making his mask and use <i>it</i> in a test.

You regale him\u2014or try to; he remains very sober\u2014with an imitation of the youth pastor. \"So, you get that mask done?\" you sigh when your comedy routine has drawn no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscles in his cheeks tighten. \"What mask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, 'What mask'?\" you jeer. \"The one you were gonna finish up today.\" You leer at him. \"Or did you spend the morning polishing something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to answer that,\" he mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I really want to know.\" You sprawl out on his bed. \"So is that mask ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" he asks after a pause. \"What do <i>I</i> want to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the fuck else would\u2014?\" You sit up sharply. \"Did you show it to somebody else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then! So where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lips tremble. \"Um ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb. What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did something happen to the mask?\" You grab him by the knee. He flinches. \"Did something happen out at the clubhouse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe huddles up. \"Which question do you want answered?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink at him a couple of times. You really dislike this evasiveness. \"Were you at the clubhouse this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he says through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you experiment with the golem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitates. \"In a manner of speaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get chills all up and down your body. \"Get your keys,\" you tell him as you stand up. \"We're going out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe must have a very bad conscience about something, because he follows you very docilely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAt least the building is still standing, you note when you arrive. You sit in the truck, drumming your fingers while you wait for Caleb to pull up next to you. You noticed him hanging back all during the drive, and he caught at least one light red that you got green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after five minutes, he pulls up and gets out. \"Is there something you want to tell me?\" you ask him. \"Before I go in and see it mys\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will!\" a voice shouts from far away. \"Will! Get away from it! That's not me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there's nothing I want to tell you!\" Caleb shrieks. \"Come on, man, let's go get something eat! My treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will! Over here, you fucking moron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb clutches at you. His eyes are bugging out. \"It's not my fault!\" he says. \"I mean, I guess it is! But it's mostly <i>his</i> fault, if he wasn't such a moron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull away and look around. Something is waving at you from a window in the basement. You step forward and peer at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Caleb. He's in the basement. \"Will! Watch out!\" he shouts, and his voice is muffled by the glass. \"Don't let it get away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wheel around. The other Caleb, the one you drove out with, is sprinting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"You are a grade-A ding-dong, you know that?\" you tell Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" he snarls. \"Same thing could've happened to you!\" He pulls on the shirt he got off the golem after you ordered it to come back. The thing, stripped of Caleb's mask, is now standing mutely in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have waited for me to show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were at church!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile broadly. \"Pastor was right. God smites the wicked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when Caleb clocks you in the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his own damn fault, of course. He'd finished polishing the mask during the night, and come out early to the clubhouse to attach the mind band to it and to copy himself into it. He'd set it on the golem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at first everything went swimmingly. They talked and compared memories and bodies, and the golem assured Caleb that he totally had to obey him as its master. Then the golem, with a sly grin, suggested that he put on Caleb's clothes and go home as him, so that he could \"prank Will.\" Caleb agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when he heard the padlock close did he begin to suspect he'd been played for a sucker. Then he realized he didn't have a phone or any way to contact you. It was by purest serendipity that you showed up to rescue him before the golem could do any more damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe not serendipity. The golem had foolishly let you get too close to it, and discovered to its undoing that you were its master, and that it had to do what you said. It even had a hard time lying to you\u2014though it tried\u2014when you questioned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's because we used your hair when we made it,\" Caleb mutters as he looks through the spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe it's because it's my book,\" you chortle back. He replies with a spiteful glance. \"Only thing to do is make another one and see what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face falls. \"You mean we dig up another four hundred pounds of dirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you mean by 'we,'\" you retort. \"I'm the one who dug up the first batch, motherfucker. You can go out and get your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you won't help?\" he shrieks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pat him on the shoulder. \"No. But someone will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Fucker,\" Caleb snarls at you the next day at school. He's slumped in his desk. \"I'm not talking to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On account of last night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even see you last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why I'm pissed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around. You're in Mr. Walberg's classroom, and though it is mostly empty, for the first-period bell hasn't rung yet, there are still enough people nearby that you can't speak openly. \"I sent someone along to hold your hand,\" you remind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he spent the whole time jerking off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? Didn't he\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't do anything, Will! We got out to the\u2014\" He looks around, and lowers his voice. \"To the cemetery, and then he just told me I was on my own.\" His eyes blaze. \"Why didn't you tell him to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did! I told him\u2014\" You're talking about your golem, which you sent along with Caleb to help him get the dirt, of course. \"I told him to give you all the help you needed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those things are fucking slippery, Will,\" Caleb mutters, and he slumps lower in his seat with folded arms. \"We got out there, he looked around, and then he said, 'Looks to me like you don't need any help at all'.\" Caleb curses under his breath. \"Then he got back in the car and spent the night playing on my phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's right. That's pretty damn slippery behavior. You were going to send him to work for you today. But maybe you should handle it yourself.</span></div></div>",

You're wedged inside a small mob of Westside students, all surging down the covered walk toward the breezeway that runs in front of the gym. Basketball practice will be starting soon, but you feel safe enough in the crowd that you don't feel like you have to keep an eye out for assholes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" he grumbles. \"Why don't you let <i>me</i> go in? Are you even up to speed on what to do out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I am. I put my\u2014 Uh, I got up to speed last night.\" You hastily correct yourself so no one in the crowd will hear you talking of \"masks\" and \"getting\" or \"putting\" memories into them. \"We were in perfect synch last night before I sent, uh, that guy out to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! So it's like it really <i>was</i> you out there with me,\" he sneers. \"I don't know why I broke my promise never to speak to you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. For awhile you thought Caleb was over the \"prank\" your golem played on him last night, but you're tired of apologizing for what that your twin did (or, technically, in this case, didn't) do at the cemetery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I should earn at least one day's honest living,\" you tell him. You don't add your real reason for going in to work yourself: You're afraid that Caleb might get revenge on you for what your golem did last night by fucking things up for you at Salopek. \"Tomorrow, maybe I'll let you cover for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck that. Send your gay twin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" you hiss, for even though you're out of the breezeway and into the parking lot, there are still students around. \"If we can get him figured out, then sure, we can start using him. But I'm with you,\" you add. \"These things are slippery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when Caleb doesn't reply, you repeat your initial question. \"So what are you gonna do while I'm at work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I could start on a new project,\" he says, and adds more acidly, \"After all, I did get the dirt we need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" you mumble. \"You're not having the best luck with those things. Maybe you better wait until I can meet up with you. After supper, maybe. How about you start on another mask,\" you suggest after a moment's thought. \"We'll need one if we want to do that thing with the girls like we were talking about.\" You hope that will mollify him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't. \"Jesus. First you tell me I can't get lucky with a dirt pile, then you suggest we turn the dirt pile into a girl I can't get lucky with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant! We'll get it figured out.\" <i>Eventually,</i> you add <i>sotto voce.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nWork is relatively relaxed, at least for the first hour, for Andy sends you and Sean to help out at the distribution center, where an audit of the inventory has been ordered. \"Yeah, everything's all balled up,\" Jack says. His manner is very peevish, and you think you catch him shooting you dirty looks. \"Make it fast but make it accurate, guys,\" he tells you. \"I got people screaming at me to get their shit delivered, but I been told by His Exalted Poobahness\"\u2014and here you're certain he's shot you a look of loathing\u2014\"that nothing gets shipped or sorted until we know exactly what we got in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo important is the task, you discover, that other employees have been pressed into service, and you and Sean join a dozen others who swarm through the postal-style back rooms with clipboards and inch-thick sheaves of invoices and vouchers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe all-hands effort has been going on long enough, and has enough workers attached to it, that it winds down before five, and the building clears and packages begin to move again. But Andy comes to find you and Sean while you're relaxing and splitting a Coke to tell you that you're both wanted again. Sean gets sent back to the distribution center, and you're sent to see your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour knees are quaking as you cross the reception area and knock on his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's on the phone when you enter, and he looks even more pissed off than usual. We waves you into a chair, tells the person on the other end of the phone there's a difference between \"possessing proprietary information\" and \"having your head up your ass\" and hangs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last Monday you delivered a box to me,\" he says to you. \"You remember. You <i>thrust</i> it at me in the middle of the complex with a smartass remark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Yeah. But that was just a joke! The remark, I mean, not the\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't get a voucher from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh. No, I didn't know that\u2014 Didn't Sean get one from you? He went to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave him the box to take back. Because I didn't order it.\" He leans across his desk to glare at you. \"What happened then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! Ask Sean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you go to the distribution center with a message about that box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warning bell goes off in the back of your head, and sweat breaks out all over your body. \"Uh. Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the message?\" Your dad's eyes are fixed hard on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you stammer. \"I was just told\u2014 <i>You</i> told me\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ulp.</i> Did you just make a mistake by starting to tell your dad that <i>he</i> was supposedly the one with the instructions for handling that box?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late now. You press on. \"You called me, told me to go to the distribution center and give the phone to Jack, you had a message for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad's eyebrows go up. \"I did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I recognized your voice and everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite spots show in your dad's cheeks. Your eyes water as, unblinking, he holds your gaze in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he puts out his hand. \"Let me see your phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith infinite reluctance, you hand it over. He scrolls through it, quickly at first, and then carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks up. \"My number isn't in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Well maybe you\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of my numbers are in here. In fact, you never got a phone call on Monday.\" He turns the phone around to show you. \"You called Caleb that afternoon, but you never got\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow hard, and pray for an earthquake that will bury you alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who did you talk to?\" your dad says with barely restrained anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's nothing to do but persist in the lie: \"You! I don't know why my phone didn't record your call! Maybe it messed up! Or\u2014! I think erased all my calls from that day!\" You grab for your phone but your dad pulls it away. \"Because I <i>know</i> I got calls that day from people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your call history goes back to before Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I don't know what happened! Why it didn't record the number! Because I talked to you, and told me to find Jack and give him the phone! Talk to Jack! He'll tell you\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already did.\" Your dad slumps back in his chair and drums his fingers. He frowns fiercely at his desk. \"This phone call from me,\" he says after a moment's thought, \"did it come before or after you talked to Caleb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before. I mean after!\" You grin weakly at your dad. \"Let me think.\" You wrack your brains, trying to figure out the safest answer. \"After,\" you finally decide. \"I remember, because when you called I thought it might be him calling back. The phone calls were right next to each other. I was taking a bathroom break at time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad slumps further in his chair. \"Did I do something wrong?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he says after a heavy sigh. \"And if anyone asks you about this, tell them the truth.\" He dismisses you with a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he stops you at the doorway. \"Did it really sound like me?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"You even yelled at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure, but you think he winces at your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou sweat out the rest of the day alone, for Sean doesn't return before quitting time, and you race away from the complex as fast as you can. Not until you're away and rocketing back home do you remember that you forgot to get your phone back from your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you stop by Caleb's house to see if he's there; he isn't, and as his mom has just got back from work herself, she can't tell you where he is. You take a guess and race out to the elementary school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's car is parked in front of the basement door, and the lock is off. Your heart is pounding as you burst in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway down the stairs, you freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guy who looks like you is staring back up at you from the basement floor. His eyes are very wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWide too are the eyes of Caleb Johansson, who is standing a few feet behind and to the left of your twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the other side of the conference table, another Caleb Johansson goes bug-eyed as he looks up at you. A heavy book\u2014the grimoire\u2014falls from his nerveless fingers with a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb?\" you squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Calebs raises his hand. Then the other raises his. Your doppelganger does a double take back at them, and raises his hand too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that bit of tomfoolery, you lose your shit.</span></div></div>",

I tried stopping him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try pinning this on me, motherfucker!\" the other Caleb retorts. \"I wouldn'a had the idea, boss,\" he yells up at you, \"if he didn't have it first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour doppelganger grins and hops on the balls of his feet. \"They're both in on it together!\" he shouts. \"You take one of 'em, and I'll take the other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will the fake Caleb Johansson please go home now!\" you holler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Caleb who called you \"boss\" immediately moves for the stairs.

Before you can answer it, Caleb says, \"Go wait in the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour doppelganger's face falls, and with gritted teeth he makes for the stairs. You flinch back as he approaches you. \"Boo!\" he says as he passes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door closes you wheel on Caleb. \"You made a golem?\" you shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently,\" he mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get it finished so fast?\" You do a double-take at the stack of sandbags still standing in the corner. Your voice rises to a nearly operatic scream. \"And without using any of the dirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb covers his ears and winces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he says after he's answered your glare by lowering his hands. \"I got an easy answer to where the other me came from. I just hung my mask on that golem we made. I wanted to see if I could, uh, civilize it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'yuh? And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs. \"We worked things out. We talked while I was working on another thing. Oh,\" he adds. \"And I figured out how to speed up mask production. You just need a car polisher and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa whoa!\" You raise your hands. \"What 'other thing' were you working on? Another golem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, another mask. Like you suggested after school.\" He's begun to get back some of his spirit, and snaps his fingers impatiently. \"Over there, you see?\" He points to the worktable, where a handheld motor with an attached cloth has been added to your tools. \"I got the idea on the way home that maybe a polisher could speed the work up. So I dug out this old polisher we had in my garage, and when I got here I made a mask and polished it up. It only took about forty-five minutes that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the golem helped you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. We talked, straightened things out between us.\" He gives you a narrow look. \"I told him about what happened last night, with fake Will not helping me dig up the dirt, and we both agreed it was a shit thing for you do. We bonded over that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return his dirty look with one of your own. \"So glad I was available to be the common enemy. Okay, that puts you and your twin here at the scene of the crime.\" You jerk your head toward the door. \"So where did that <i>other</i> me come from?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting to that. I guess it started when my guy took over for the polishing while I started putting together the stuff to make another golem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you found a way to speed up production on that too?\" You glance back at the pile of dirt. \"Without using that shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb lowers his head. \"Yes. Sort of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your hands on your hips. \"What do you mean 'sort of'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Will, like I said, it's not my fault!\" He thrusts a finger at the window. \"It was him, my twin, my evil twin! He's the one who\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Who what?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb puts the table between yourself and him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sean Mitchell came in. He saw us and he kind of freaked. Because he knows who I am, and he knows I don't have a twin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDread encloses your heart. \"What happened then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my doppelganger had the mask all done by that point, and he was showing it to me. When Sean came down the stairs, my other self jumped on him and slapped the mask on him. To knock him out, see, until we could figure out what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice has crawled back into a distant cavity in your chest, and only emerges as a whisper. \"Then what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's shrugs; it looks more like a spasm. His eyes dodge about your face without ever settling on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at that point certain decisions got made,\" he says. \"Sean's a big guy, you know, and even though he's a good guy he was also asking certain questions that none of us wanted to see answered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab your head and sink into a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The good news,\" Caleb says with desperate cheer, \"is that we're on to the next spell in the book. And there'll be a spell after that and a spell after that, and there's <i>bound</i> to be a way of fixing him, I betcha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou have to get up on tiptoes to look Sean Mitchell in the eye. He can't look at you back, though, for his eyes are closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, he's been turned into stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, at least, is the impression you've got. From the tips of his shaggy hair all the way to his toenails, Sean is the color of concrete. He's hard as concrete, too, though you don't test the hypothesis by tapping too hard at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he's not petrified, not like a fossil. By putting your hand on him, you think can detect just the barest hint of a swelling and contracting chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next spell in the book\u2014the one neither you nor Caleb wanted to chance\u2014has done this to him. Caleb and his twin\u2014who weren't thinking very clearly at the time; at least, that's the charitable hypothesis you have decided to subscribe to\u2014laid him on the grimoire as it lay open on the table, covered him with the same chemicals and dirt as used in the spell that made a golem, then set him on fire, like the spell prescribed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would have happened if it took him a week to burn?\" you demanded of Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would have kept him quiet and out of the way,\" Caleb replied. \"Which is what we were wanting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at the back of it all was that damn box of chemicals your dad was asking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey, you pick up a box here last Monday?</i> Sean had asked on appearing at the head of the basement stairs. Then his jaw dropped when he saw that there were two Caleb Johanssons in the room, and <i>then</i> he saw the shipping box, still with some of the open containers in it. <i>Is that it?</i> he yelled, and came charging down the stairs. The fact that there were two Calebs was probably his doom, as he likely didn't know which of them to grab, which left the golem free to slam a mask onto his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're holding the mask now. The name SEAN JASON MITCHELL floats above its inner surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you put this mask on the new golem? Why put mine on it?\" You indicate the \"Will Prescott\" mask that Caleb had taken off this Sean-shaped golem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I didn't know what would happen,\" Caleb says. \"What if he tried killing us? So I put <i>your</i> mask on it, to test it out. You, I could take if it turned into a fight. Especially given there were two of me down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. \"What did you find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That it thought it was you. It had no idea that Sean had been here, didn't know anything about him, except what it knew about him from work. Oh, and he obeyed me.\" He pats his chest. \"So you got a golem you can order around, and I got a golem I can order around, and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then what were you going to do? After you put my mask on Sean\" \u2014you tap the petrified wrestler\u2014 \"and found you could order him around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb sighs. \"Well, we started to explain things to, er, you. The fake you. We knew we'd have to explain things to you anyway, and we thought we'd get some practice in first. But we'd just started when you showed up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to the petrified Sean. <i>What a fucking mess.</i> \"Well, we can't leave him like this,\" you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll fix him,\" Caleb says with cheery confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this afternoon we won't be able to,\" you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know that. Maybe the next spell tells how to reverse it.\" Caleb picks up the grimoire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab it away from him. \"Then we can look at it tonight. Sean's been out of circulation too long.\" You check the time on your phone. \"He probably should have been back at Salopek an hour ago! So the way I see it,\" you continue as Caleb looks amused, \"is either we put his mask on this thing and hope it brings him back to normal\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might hope that, but I sure as hell don't!\" Caleb interjects. \"At least not yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we put one of our masks back on it, and one of us goes back home as him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Caleb only returns your look with a blank one of his own as you cock your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually your meaning dawns on him. \"Fine.\" He rolls his eyes. \"If you really want me to, I'll go home as him.\"</span></div></div>",

You notice that he hasn't even made a move toward the mask. \"Christ, I didn't think I'd have to <i>guilt</i> you into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll do it,\" Caleb blurts out. But his heart clearly isn't in it, for he doesn't fight for the mask. \"You're going to kill me, aren't you?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't killed you yet,\" you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The day's young.

Before you can think through the ramifications of what you're about to do, you jam Sean's mask to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're being squeezed to death. Someone's got their arms wrapped around you in an unbreakable hold, and they are squeezing you hard. You struggle, and as you are a talented wrestler, you know exactly how to twist and leverage your mass. But they are too strong, and they have wrapped themselves all about you. They are a snake, and you are a sausage casing, and they are squeezing you, and in a minute your raw flesh will come bursting out of your skin and splatter all over the walls and ceiling ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes with a gasping choke. You're on your back, and hands are pulling at you and squeezing you. You slap at them, and someone yells sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rise up on one elbow. God! The pain in your abdomen! Feverishly you grab at it. There's a hard, tight right about your waist, and it is squeezing your organs into jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still, Will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers close on metal. A buckle! You pull at it, and it feels like something inside you has popped. Hands flap at yours. \"I'll get it!\" the voice yells again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you've too tight a hold. Somehow, your fingers knowing better than your brain, you pull a length of leather free, a skinny tongue of metal pops loose, and\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank God! You let out a deep sigh as all the pressure relents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, most of it. Things are still a little tight down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTight upstairs as well. You feel like you're all wound up inside some bed clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're staring at a dusky ceiling and trying to figure out what's going on when a face appears in your line of vision. You frown at it. You know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Caleb!</i> Your fingers flex, and he jumps back as you reach for his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remember who you are, and what has happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God <i>damn</i> it,\" you mutter, and kick off shoes that are now several sizes too small for you. You take a couple of deep breaths, then peel off jeans that are also a too tight fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Sean Mitchell is fat or anything. But he is bulky about the abdomen, and he's built on a larger scale anyway. You peel off the constricting underwear, too, and after you sit up you take the socks and shirt off as well. You scratch and rub yourself all over, and grimace, then sit up and swing your legs off the side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you think Caleb must have run off, but then you see his face peering around a bookcase. He freezes when he sees that you've spotted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. \"You can come out now. I've decided not to kill you after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't move. \"Who?\" he asks in the plaintive manner of a terrified owl, and points at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me. Will. Your friend. Which doesn't always stop me from wanting to kill you, and today wasn't the first time I've wanted to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb steps out from behind the book case, but he still hangs back. \"Yeah, well,\" he says in a shaky voice. \"It's not like you could'a killed me before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know where you sleep,\" you remind him. \"But damn!\" You stretch, and kick your feet back and forth. \"So it works? I look like Sean Mitchell now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb nods, and points to the mirror. You glance back at it, then stand with a grunt and shuffle over to give yourself a look over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it's a familiar face. Broad, a little flat, with soft, whitish whiskers running along the jaw and cheek, and shaggy blond hair that falls over your brows and ears. You grin. It's an easy, confident smile that goes with the direct, confident gaze. You raise and flex a bicep\u2014it's like a python rippling under your skin\u2014and scratch at a hairy pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb appears in the mirror behind you. \"How much have you got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of it,\" you tell him, and turn around to flap your cock at him. He jumps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha. I mean\u2014\" He taps his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your head back and think a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Birthday, Social Security number, parents' names\u2014\" You stop to frown at that, and at another name. \"Address. Best friend when I was five years old. Uh, name of my third-grade teacher. My class schedule.\" You pinch the bridge of your nose. \"Oh yeah, and how to do <i>this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhomp!</i> You grab Caleb, throw him onto a table, and inside of three seconds have him pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erk,\" Caleb croaks. \"Yes. I think you've got it.\" You grin and let him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou bump fists with Eli Anders as you saunter past to drop into the desk behind him. Across from you, Tanner Evans, one of the nastier of the school bullies, hunches over his phone and ignores the blatant stare of disdain you're giving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could never get away with that kind of a stare before,</i> you think to yourself with a smile. Then: <i>I could get used to this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This\" is being Sean Mitchell. Despite the playful confidence you felt in the basement immediately after waking, you actually went to bed last night feeling spastically mortified, both at being in a strange bedroom and in a strange bed. But when you woke this morning with wood you felt hardly any compunction about filling a sock with cum. <i>It keeps the pipes clean and shiny,</i> was all you thought as you dropped heavy feet to the floor afterward and stumbled to the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, dear,\" Mrs. Mitchell said when you padded into the kitchen, already dressed for the day in comfortably broken-in Levis and a sleeveless sweatshirt with \"Westside Dragons\" stenciled on one side and \"Wrestling\" on the other. (The one with \"Football\" on its back is in the hamper.) You kissed her cheek and made some coffee and breakfast, and after she asked you about that thing, you told her \"I'll talk to some of the guys about it.\" Then you cleaned up for both her and you and drove yourself to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's first period now. Mr. Santiago's \"Current Issues\" class. Your friend Keith is in here too, sitting on the other side of the room and scoping out the girls. You're watching the open door, though. You gave Sean's schedule to Caleb before parting with him for the evening, and your best friend and collaborator in magic glances into the classroom with a querying eyebrow just before the first bell rings. You stretch meaty arms with upraised thumbs, and grin. He nods, and is about to turn away when Will Prescott pads up behind. The latter does a wide-eyed double-take at you, and for a moment it looks like he's about to come in to talk, but Caleb grabs him by the neck and hauls him into Mr. Walberg's room, which is directly across the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli, who is on the wrestling team with Sean, turns around with a quizzical expression. \"Guys I work with after school,\" you tell him. \"There was some excitement yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"But it's all over with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, so you hope.</i> You returned to Salopek to tell Jack that the mystery box you'd been sent to track and recover couldn't be traced further than the rec room of the Acheson Community Center, where \"you\" had delivered it last Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli turns back around as Mr. Santiago steps to the front of the class. You lean back and play with the brim of your cap, flipping it up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you drop your hands into your lap. <i>Don't break it,</i> you chide yourself. <i>It's too valuable.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSecond period is wrestling practice, which is probably Sean's favorite class, and as you have not only his memories but his talents, his tastes, and his intuitions, you find yourself having a blast in it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet you are distracted enough by another issue that Laurent Delacroix, the captain, pulls you aside to ask where your head is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. \"Well, it's not up my ass, if that's what you're asking,\" you reply. Laurent snorts, but smiles. You wince and bite the inside of your cheek and remind yourself that it's really not any of your business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm not here for long,</i> you remind yourself. <i>A day or two? Hopefully? Even if we don't get Sean ... fixed ... then Caleb can take over for me. Or we'll put the mask on a golem. I'm not really Sean, even though it feels like it. I didn't mess up Sean's life, Caleb did, so it's not up to me to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what I'm thinking of doing might not even be the right thing to do.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you remember the expression of wan worry on the face of Sean's mother, and what she said just before you'd made the (so you thought) rote reply, \"I'll talk to some guys about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you don't do it for Sean, can you at least do it for her?</span></div></div>",

To make up a little for losing another\u2014</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Bickelmeir,\" you tell Laurent. His expression tightens. \"It's getting worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were going to give him some distance,\" Laurent says. \"You know, what you can't see won't piss you off.\" That was the quote Sean had given him the last time he and Laurent talked about the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's closing the distance. He's started parking in front of my house. Not when I'm there, though. When my <i>mom</i> is. When she's there <i>by herself.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurent's eyes go wide. Then they narrow. A purple flush rises up his swarthy cheeks, and his black hair visibly bristles. He's part Iroquois\u2014the best part: dark, with hard cheekbones and a strong chin\u2014and to watch his anger rise is almost like watching an aboriginal warrior stepping from out from behind a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know this because?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because my <i>mom</i> told me about this car that's been parking in front of the house, and I caught it there last week and it was Bickelmeir.\" Sean's own hot anger starts rising in your gorge. \"I told him to get lost, but my mom said he was back there again on Friday, and I think I saw him drive past on Sunday. He was definitely there yesterday, though, for almost an hour, she said, and he only drove off just before I got home. Like, he must have been watching for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurent pulls at his nose, and looks away. \"This is fucked up, Mitchell,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try telling me it isn't. No, I don't think he's going to do anything\" \u2014Laurent looks over at you sharply\u2014 \"because he knows I won't wait for any cops if he does. It'll be me and him and then it'll just be me. But I don't want it to get that far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurent goes back to staring over your shoulder. Something catches his attention, and he shouts, \"Hold him, Mull! You're wrestling with him, not spooning with him!\" Then he turns back to you with a sigh. \"Who else knows about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About him hassling my mom? Just you. I've talked to Cameron about the general situation\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard you and Scott almost tore each other's faces off a week or two back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. But Cameron's got his own problems, and Bickelmeir's not someone he can exactly afford to piss off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Laurent's interest is either fading or deepening, for his gaze has gone very distant. But after a moment he retrieves it. \"What lunch you have? Fourth?\" You nod. \"Go find Brownie in the library then. Talk to him. Tell him everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not looking for any favors\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you're not likely to get any,\" Laurent says, and he smiles tightly. \"As my grandfather used to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not looking for any favors,\" you repeat. \"You just asked where my head is, and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't want you losing it.\" Laurent claps you on the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt was Sean's plan, but you've got it bubbling your brain now\u2014to get Laurent's help with Scott. That's what you meant when, on instinct, you told Mrs. Mitchell you would \"talk to some guys\" about it. But as you talked to Laurent you felt Sean's own prickly pride erecting a barrier. <i>I should take care of this myself,</i> you kept telling yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still it came out. The anger and (yes) the fear that comes from knowing that a creep has been watching your mother in defiance of your warnings. It comes bubbling out more strongly when you sit down with Alec \"Brownie\" Brown in the library during fourth period. \"I always thought of Scott as a good guy,\" the other wrestler says after you've talked a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands clench under the table. Not that grabbing Brownie would do any good, for even though he's not as massive as you, he is quicker <i>and</i> he knows lots more moves. (He grew up in a family of fighters\u2014literally. They're Army brats.) Besides, Brownie is just about the straightest-shooter Sean knows. That's probably why Laurent wanted you to talk to him. If you can convince Brownie that there's something the matter with Bickelmeir, he can carry half the sports teams at the school with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrownie's comment comes after you've told him what Scott Bickelmeir, the school's wide receiver, has been doing at your house. You have to admit that, in isolation, it sounds like a weird but not necessarily malicious thing. So when Brownie asks if there's a \"history\" between you and Scott, you plunge into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It goes back to him hanging out with my brother Taylor,\" you say. \"You know about Taylor, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrownie blinks. \"I've heard, but never from you. Tell me yourself so I've got it straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the old anger building again. \"Taylor was my twin brother. We were close. Always close. Forever close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the sudden tears in your throat. Brownie's eyes soften.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know we were at Eastman up until last year. Bickelmeir too, you know. Him and Taylor started hanging out the start of last summer. They started working at the same place, too. I saw less and less of Taylor. I felt it but didn't say anything. I mean, we're twins, but we're not the same person, you know?\" Brownie nods slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to swallow before you can say the next few words: \"The last time I saw Taylor, he was driving off with Scott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence envelops you, and the titter of freshmen girls at the next table suddenly seems very loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Scott have anything to do with the accident?\" Brownie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question explodes your resentments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" You grab the edge of the table to keep from flying off. \"He won't say <i>anything</i> about it! Him and Taylor and some other kid from work, they went up to the school, to Eastman, together. The next thing anyone knows, Taylor's in a car wreck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrownie's eyes narrow. \"What makes you think Scott had anything to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it wasn't just Taylor! There were three of them out there that day. Taylor was in a wreck, and the other guy went into a coma, all on the same day. Only Scott made it home that day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you tried asking him about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't tell me anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrownie bites the inside of his cheek. \"That doesn't mean\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, there were two casualties that day, both under really funny circumstances. And the third guy who was out there sure is acting like he's guilty of something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sink back in your chair. \"And then he started following me,\" you continue. \"I moved to Westside this year, for a fresh start.\" You wipe your brow and your hand touches the cap. <i>Taylor's cap. Your father's cap, before he died.</i> \"And then Bickelmeir followed me over. It's like he's <i>haunting</i> me, but he won't say <i>why.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now he's started haunting your mom,\" Brownie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said 'haunting', but 'stalking' is probably better,\" you growl. \"I told him to stay the  fuck away, but he <i>won't.</i> And he's <i>scaring</i> her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrownie nods. \"Well, thanks for telling me this,\" he says, and he abruptly gets up. \"Hang out here till I get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBut you don't see Brownie again until the start of fifth period, when you're already inside Mr. Hartford's classroom. That's when you glance over and notice him loitering in the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice Laurent loitering there too. And Eli Anders. And Austin Mull and Chris Ratliff and Devin Haney. All clustered in the doorway. They've not looking at you, though. They're standing there, waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Scott appears. The gang closes about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment he looks confused. Then the cluster moves, and he is swept out of sight down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart beats for a solid minute, and you squirm in your seat. <i>What have you done?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings and class starts and Scott is absent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, actually, he's just tardy. He is pale when he comes in five minutes later, but he looks healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he doesn't look at you during football practice either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Get me out of this thing,\" you snarl as you run down into the basement after work. Will Prescott (or a reasonable facsimile thereof) clatters down after you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb looks up in alarm. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sean's life is just too dramatic for my taste,\" you reply. You throw yourself onto a table and grab at your face. But you pause long enough to point to your placeholder. \"Get the mask off him\u2014take your clothes off!\" you bark. \"We're gonna try putting Sean's mask on him, see what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's reply is swallowed in the swirling darkness as you rip Sean's face from your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"The next time we pull a stunt,\" you tell Caleb after you're awake and are in your jeans if not your shirt, \"we research the asshole first, make sure his life isn't stressful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with Sean's life?\" Caleb asks. He's peering out the window of the basement. \"He seems like a guy who has his shit together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tick the items off your fingers. \"His dad's dead, his twin brother's dead, his mom is barely hanging onto her own shit, and he's being stalked by Scott Bickelmeir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb turns wide eyes on you. \"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott Bickelmeir. You know, he plays football.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he's stalking Sean? As in, following him around?\" Caleb's eyes are like saucers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically. He\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb dives under a table at the same time the basement door bangs open. You stand rooted to the spot\u2014like the petrified Sean at your elbow\u2014as Scott Bickelmeir comes down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks around. He stares at Sean. He stares at the masks on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looks at you and says, \"What the fuck did you do to my brother?\"</span></div></div>",

All internal deliveries have to be signed for, and the voucher returned to the distribution center.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringe. \"Cripes, I\u2014 I forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeyes smiles. \"Well, trot back around to the center, tell Jack you delivered it. He'll cover for you.\" You're so glad Keyes isn't nearly the hard-ass your dad is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Jack has another job for you. \"Forgot to have you give this one to your dad too,\" he says, thrusting another, larger, heavier box at you. \"You can get the voucher for the other one when you take this one over.\" He holds up two fingers. \"That's <i>two</i> vouchers you owe me now, kid,\" he grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit.</i> Looks like you'll have to see your dad anyway. But which one is the package that Caleb prepared?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad glowers up at you from his desk when you stick your head in through his doorway; the first package is sitting unopened by his elbow. \"Uh, Jack says you need this one too,\" you say nervously, setting the second box on the chair in front of him. \"Also, I need a signed voucher from you for this one and the other one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, methodically, he signs first one piece of paper and then another. \"You know,\" he says heavily. \"It's a bad idea to make too many trips out to the distribution center. We had to fire a couple of high school students a few weeks ago for <i>drinking on the job.</i>\" He holds the papers close, so that you have to lean across his very wide desk to take them from his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not drinking on the job, Dad,\" you say. \"Or after it. I was just, you know, joking around with you earlier. Like, 'Come here often? What's your sign?'\" He just stares at you, and you practically run from his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou call Caleb after work, and nearly drop the phone when your dad answers. \"Uh,\" you stammer, not sure if you pushed the right entry on your call list. \"Sorry, I was trying to call Caleb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep hanging around that kid and you'll come to a bad end,\" he snorts. \"Did you get that stuff like I told you to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop yourself from cursing just in time: You're still not sure it's Caleb. \"What stuff?\" you ask guardedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a package of some very important chemicals put together,\" he says in a strained voice. \"And like a complete dumbass you managed to hand it over to exactly the wrong person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you take that fucking thing off already?\" you scream into the phone. \"Or tell me where you are, and I'll come over and rip it off you! I'll take some skin with it when I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your mouth,\" he says. \"I'm at the clubhouse. Did you get the stuff?\" But you just hang up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he's returned to his normal form when you show up, and he also has the wit to duck when you take a swing at him. \"Alright, pax,\" he says, holding up his hands. \"But I am pissed at you. Jesus, could you have fucked things up more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has a point, but you're in no mood to confess it. \"It might not have even been the right package anyway,\" you retort. You tell him about the second box. \"I couldn't have walked off with both. My life wouldn't be worth living, assuming I even <i>had</i> a life afterward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighs and leans against the edge of a desk, arms folded. \"I suppose we go with Plan B, then. Get a credit card or debit card off him and buy the stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he doesn't get out of the way, and staggers back as your fist connects with his jaw. You hope you hurt him as much you hurt yourself, for your fingers sting hard. \"I thought you said we couldn't use his plastic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not <i>just</i> his plastic,\" Caleb shouts back, though his voice is muzzy. He holds his jaw and winces. \"If <i>he</i> goes in and uses plastic to buy the stuff, it'll work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The more we use that thing, the more trouble I get into!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" he retorts. \"We're duplicating people. You think you can do that and <i>not</i> get in trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get into his wallet. He will <i>kill</i> me if he catches me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about a check? Get a blank one and we can cash it. Does he keep a checkbook in his desk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you can cash a check without a driver's license, and anyway, you've been wearing those things way too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what's <i>your</i> bright idea?\" He picks up the book that's gotten you into all this trouble and flips to the last open page. \"If you want to finish this spell\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I don't,\" you say in a ragged voice. \"Maybe you're right, this is all just going to lead to too much trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that was a reason to <i>stop,</i>\" he retorts. You stalk off to the door without replying. He calls after you: \"Look, give me a call after your dad gets home. Tell me what happened with the boxes.\" You flip him off without turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou pass a sleepless night, tossing and turning, wondering if all this has been worth the hassle. Oh, it's fun exploring magical stuff, until someone gets hurt\u2014especially if it's going to be <i>you.</i> At the same time, you keep being drawn back to that last spell. Damn that book and the way it hides the good stuff until you've performed a spell. Surely that is part of the design: to tease you with the promise of some kind of revelation <i>if only</i> you follow through and finish a spell. It's nearly three in the morning before you drift into a kind of slumber, which is punctuated with all manner of many-faced monsters, some of which sport your own visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb is chipper the next morning despite your fight, and ostentatiously avoids the subject of masks and magic. At least, he avoids it until last period, when he asks you to cover for him at work. \"I got some stuff I need to do,\" he says. \"But meet up with me at the clubhouse afterward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shove a finger in his face. \"You stay out of my dad's stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, please. I'm all done with that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after work do you realize how ambiguous his disclaimer was, when you walk into the basement to find him grinning at you. There are a couple of plastic mixing bowls on the table by his elbow, and you start when you see a large box open next to them. \"Ready for the next spell?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't call last night,\" he says, \"so I waited until I figured your dad would be gone, then went back to Salopek as him. I had to talk to a few people, but found out that your dad had opened the box I'd packed up and then sent it back to the distribution center because he didn't know what the hell it was. I went over and gave whatsisname a new address to ship it to. So here it is. Same-day service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at it all: neatly boxed-up packages of chemicals and tightly sealed canisters of liquids. Caleb already has the book open to the page. All you have to do is put it all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou temporize before answering. \"What about that second box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs. \"He sent it back too. Quick glance told me it wasn't the stuff we wanted.\" He hops on the balls of his feet. \"You're the magician, I figure you'd want to be on hand for the thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince. It <i>is</i> all ready for you, but your mood hasn't improved from last night. If you can resist temptation <i>now,</i> maybe you can end all this before it gets completely out of hand.</span></div></div>",

So, we got everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except one thing.\" In a flash Caleb reaches up and with a pair of pocket scissors snips off a lock of your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Book says it needs a bit of your hair.\" He tosses it into one of the mixing bowls. \"Shall we get cooking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, you dump the dirt and chemicals onto the book because that's the only way to get them into the necessary sigil, and that leads to a nerve-wracking moment when it's time to set the stuff on fire. You and Caleb almost chicken out. Not only are you risking destroying the book, but there's a lot of volatile chemicals that you stole, and you both worry it might set the dry, junk-filled basement ablaze. You position yourself near the door while Caleb, standing at some distance, strikes a match and flings it onto the pile of earth. There is a brief pause, and a purple bloom of flame rushes off it with a gentle <i>whoomp</i>. Caleb throws himself to the ground, and you almost tear yourself in two as one leg tries to dash up the stairs to the outside while the other tries running downstairs to get your friend. But the flash dissipates as quickly as it had appeared; in its place is a low, violet flame wafting off the pile of dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Caleb approach it carefully, and he puts his hand over it. \"No heat,\" he says, and thrusts his hand into one of the flames. \"No heat at all. It should be okay, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book is buried under the dirt and flame, so you can't consult it to see how long it should take to finish, but you do know that the fire is supposed to be relit if it goes out. After another hour, you and Caleb give up watching it and you both go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nCaleb still owes you two hundred dollars, per your agreement to bring him into partnership, so he takes your place at work for the rest of the week while you spend each afternoon in the basement watching the burning pile, playing on your laptop, and lazily polishing up a new mask and finishing a new mind band--two raw items you that Caleb made up before starting the new spell. Caleb has suggested that you should make a mask of him, and you agreed it would only be fair. By a nice coincidence, you are both in the basement on Sunday afternoon, having just finished up both items and used them to copy Caleb, when the glow fades from the dirt pile. Caleb tries relighting it, but it won't ignite. He calls you over. \"I think it's done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About fucking time.\" You both press around it. The magical flame has caused the heap to congeal into a mass of something that looks like baked clay. Three great rents have opened up in it, giving it the appearance of having two arms and two legs, and a misshapen lump at one end further contributes to the illusion of a crude, humanoid figure. You pull the book out from under it to see what comes next. Both of you groan to see that it has to be polished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, it turns out that polishing in this case consists of little more than a light dusting that brushes loose impurities from its surface, leaving it a dull, chalky, grayish color, and there seems nothing else to do. The page has turned loose, and you turn it over to see what you have made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a golem!\" Caleb says after you've worked out a translation of the reverse of the spell page. \"A magical robot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we get it to work?\" Not that it sounds very useful: you couldn't let it out of the basement, and what jobs could you give it down here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this.\" Caleb snatches up a mask, frowns at it, exchanges it for a second mask, changes his mind again, and picks up the third mask. He hops excitedly over to the thing. He sets the mask on its \"face,\" and to your astonishment it glows and sinks into the thing. The golem glimmers and shimmers, and its form distorts, and moment later reconfigures itself as a naked duplicate of Caleb himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance over at Caleb, whose slightly mad expression suggests he is, simultaneously, both immensely pleased and a little freaked out. Your attention is quickly reengaged by the new addition to your club when it groans and stretches its limbs. \"Oh, Jesus,\" he yawns. \"Those things really knock you out, don't they.\" He sits up, then freezes in a double take when he sees you and Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere tenses as the new Caleb swallows. \"The fuck is going on?\" He points to your friend. \"Who the fuck is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you,\" you say. \"The real you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing on the table turns pale, and then very red. \"The fuck are you--?\" he growls. He looks down, notices that he is naked, and glares up at Caleb. \"You trying to get rid of me, get yourself a new friend to play with?\" There's a tremble in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour throat works, but no sounds come out. Caleb steps in. \"You're our slave,\" he says sharply. \"You have to do what we say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snarl the thing leaps off the table and hurls himself at Caleb, tearing at him. \"Stop it!\" you yell, grabbing at them. \"Get off!\" The naked Caleb abruptly releases the real Caleb and falls back, panting wildly. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to get my life back,\" the thing says, its eyes mad with anger and fear. \"All I know is we made a copy of me, and when I wake up--\" His nostrils flare and he glares over at Caleb. \"You put the mask on--? Who is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Caleb!\" you tell it. \"The real Caleb. You're--\" You wheel the thing around to face the now-empty table. \"We finished the spell. It made a golem, a slave. We put the mask on it and ... Well, that's what you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stares at the table, breathing heavily. \"Get the mask off it, Will!\" Caleb snaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach up to the thing's face, but it bats your hand away. \"Hold still!\" you order, and it falls into a slump. Gingerly, you reach up to its brow, mutter the incantation, and pull the mask off. It instantly reverts to a lump of clay-like flesh, now standing instead of reclining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking thing is broken,\" Caleb says. He's breathing heavily. \"We can't have fake versions of us running around, not if they're going to act like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown into the mask, thinking furiously. \"No, hang on,\" you say. \"It didn't know what it was. It didn't know we'd finished the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What difference does that make?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thrust the mask at him. \"Just put it on. Recharge it with your memories. We'll see what happens when we put it back on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb grumbles but complies. While he's unconscious you pace, thinking hard. A convincing duplicate should act like the original, so you're not quite as freaked out as Caleb had been at the thing's behavior. At the same time, Caleb is right: a slave needs to do what its maker says. But who's the maker? You have a sudden thought and wheel to examine the spell again: <i>Ah, yes,</i> you think. <i>That hank of hair that Caleb put into the mix.</i> Maybe that's the secret. It didn't fight you the way it fought with Caleb; maybe it is supposed to obey you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Caleb reawakes you quickly outline your deduction to him; he is still skeptical and jumpy, but doesn't fight when you put the mask back onto the golem. The duplicate Caleb, when he reappears, is much calmer, but looks warily between you and his original. \"Okay, I see what's going on,\" it says in a guarded tone when you ask it what it knows and remembers. \"You can't expect me to be happy about it, but I understand now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand that you're our slave, right?\" you ask it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts eyes flick between you and Caleb. \"I don't have to do what this cocksucker says,\" he says, glowering at his original, who flushes. \"You? Okay, something inside me says I have to follow your orders.\" It makes a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a fraught afternoon, so you remove the mask from the thing shortly afterward. After talking things over with Caleb, though, you both brighten up considerably. \"You know what this means,\" he points out to you. \"You don't have to go in to work tomorrow. I don't have to go in to work for you tomorrow. You can put your mask on that thing and it can go in for you. It could even go to school for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still owe me some money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two weeks should just about cover it,\" he says. \"You get paid tomorrow, so we'll see what it comes to after taxes and shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd still rather you go in for me. Remember how I fucked up the one day I went in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let the golem go in and fuck it up for you. The job isn't awful, but I got a life and am a little sick of giving twenty hours a week of it to you.\"</span></div></div>",

You swap out into a second set of clothes that you picked up at home, charge the mask of yourself with your most recent memories, and put it on the golem. \"Someone's getting the short end of the stick on this deal,\" your new double grouses as he dresses. \"And I think it's me.\" But except for that one complaint, it is completely docile, with you and Caleb both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it's gone, you and Caleb turn your attention to the next spell. \"Most of the same ingredients as the last one,\" Caleb says, surveying your supplies. \"Good thing I ordered up a double helping of the stuff we needed for the golem.\" He starts mixing stuff together before you've even finished translating the list. \"Can we use my hair in this next one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" you reply. \"You need a golem of your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I need is a girlfriend,\" he says. \"When your double gets back with the cash, we should make a store run and pick up supplies for some new masks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives you a pitying look. \"We get the masks onto some girls. Like, really good-looking girls. Hot girls. Some of the cheerleaders. Maybe Lisa?\" He waggles his eyebrows suggestively. \"Put 'em on the golem and wham! Instant lays!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were with him up until Lisa got mentioned. \"The only way we get a mask of Lisa is if you agree to wear it and give me a blow job,\" you tell him coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the golem--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna hear you talking about Lisa that way. What we had was special, it wasn't just ... sex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't even that,\" he sniggers under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" he says. \"Still. Cheerleaders. Yumi would be yummy, but Chelsea would be the jackpot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou talk a little more, until you hit the last ingredient on the spell list. You'd expected it to call for another pile of dirt, but this item is far more disquieting. \"A human body?\" Caleb exclaims in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A corpse? Or a real person?\" You stare at the spell too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe translation algorithm doesn't turn up an unambiguous answer to the question. \"I'm not digging up a dead body,\" Caleb says firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're not using a living person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we use ourselves as guinea pigs?\" He doesn't sound convinced, even after he adds, \"We've been experimenting on ourselves so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pace the basement. This is definitely the place to break off your experiments, and you tell Caleb so. He's unwilling to make the same conclusion, but there's not a lot of heat in his argument. At the same time, you still feel the tug of curiosity, and the two of you go round and round on possible ways of proceeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still arguing when the door opens and your double walks in. \"Guys,\" he says, raising his hands in a mollifying gesture. \"It's not my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart goes into your throat, and for the first time in your life you sympathize with your father: How many times have you opened a conversation with him with those words or variants on them? \"What?\" The word, as it escapes your throat, even sounds like the kind of growl your dad makes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't got any money for you. Dad confiscated it. Called me into his office and had me sign the check over to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" Caleb demands, but you groan and put your face in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the golem answers for you. \"I owe him\u2014 We owe him\u2014 God, pronouns are hard to use right now,\" he says. \"But he lent, uh, <i>us</i> two hundred dollars in exchange for getting the job at Salopek. First paycheck goes to paying him back. In fact, you still owe him fourteen dollars and eighty-three cents,\" he tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say he lent <i>us</i> the money but <i>I</i> still owe him?\" you peevishly demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider what I am,\" he shrugs. \"A counterfeit Will Prescott would be dealing in counterfeit money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this sucks,\" Caleb says. \"You mean I was working to pay off <i>your</i> debts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you'll be going in to work for me another two weeks,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you figure that?\" he demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold out your hand. \"Where's the two hundred you promised me for our partnership?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opens his mouth to speak, but says nothing. He points to you, then to the golem, then to you again. \"Lemme get a piece of paper,\" he finally says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes almost twenty minutes of argument before you all agree\u2014with no help from the golem, who seems inclined on causing mischief\u2014that he has paid for the partnership by paying off your debt to your dad. Which still leaves both of you broke. \"Well, as long as this asshole can go in to work for you, it's no big deal,\" Caleb shrugs, nodding at the golem. \"We can wait for the next payday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you decide to go to work the next day as yourself, figuring that if you're going to get in trouble it might as well be you and not your equally feckless twin. \"Well, leave your mask with me,\" Caleb says when you tell him at school. \"I'll put it on the golem, and between our two brains maybe I figure out a way around the next spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nTurns out you were right about one thing: it's a disaster to leave your duplicate in charge of your life. Not that you discover anything wrong at work the next day. It's when you get back to the clubhouse early in the evening you find yourself in the equivalent of the <i>Titanic</i> after it's been hit by the <i>Hindenberg.</i> You hear raised voices emanating from the basement even before you open the door. \"Jesus Christ,\" you yell, adding your voice to the cacophony. \"Could you be any louder? I don't think the guys in the community center can hear you!\" Both Caleb and your double jump and stare guiltily. \"What is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look at the ground or at the walls or at the ceiling\u2014anyplace but your face. Finally, the fake you nudges Caleb, who furiously nudges him back. \"You're the one who did it,\" the golem hisses. \"Well, you went along with it,\" Caleb hisses back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is it?\" you demand, putting your hands to your hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golem pales. \"Jesus, you sounded just like Dad when you said that.\" He laughs nervously. \"Speaking of whom,\" he adds in a high, squeaky voice. \"He stopped by today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he stopped by the clubhouse. Had a good yell at us. Freaked us out. Then Caleb got a bright idea\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Caleb says. He is very green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Happened?\" you growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golem swallows a couple of times. \"Actually, Dad's still here. In a manner of speaking.\" He tugs at his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare. Only now do you notice that your double is wearing one of your dad's dress shirts ... and slacks ... and shoes. And then you notice that the golem\u2014the big, claylike slab\u2014is standing in the corner, where you last left it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyes bug out of your head. \"Dad?\" you ask, and it's your turn for your voice to turn squeaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um ... Not really,\" your twin says. He turns to Caleb. \"Do the honors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb gulps, then reaches over and pulls at golem's face. It comes off ... And standing there is your father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSort of. The thing's skin is chalky, grayish-white, as is its hair. But in form it looks just like your dad. You draw close. The detail work is perfect. It's a life-size statue of your dad. Except\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The good news is that I unlocked the next spell,\" Caleb says in a rush. \"The bad news is ... Well, apparently I turned your dad into a golem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the knot in your throat you choke out the words: \"And how did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb puts the mask back onto the thing, and your twin reappears. \"Is he still there?\" it asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were in on this?\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you'd have done the same thing,\" it says defensively. \"We're exactly alike, right? So if I helped Caleb do it, then it stands to reason that if you'd been here--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a sense of paralyzed horror keeps you from throttling the thing with your bare hands. Before you can move, Caleb jumps in. \"The quickest way to explain things is for you to put this on.\" He holds out a mask, which you recognize as your dad's. You rear back, but Caleb won't be dissuaded. \"Look, Will, someone is going to have to go home as your old man. It might as well be you.\"</span></div></div>",

With a vast reluctance you lay the mask over your face. The world goes dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYour first feeling on waking is anger. You raise your head and glare at Caleb and at\u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you realize, that's not your son. It's a fake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you have to remind yourself that it's not a fake of your son, but of you. You take a deep breath as you sit up, and have to grip the edge of the table to keep your hands from shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole welter of confusing memories, impressions, and bits of knowledge press upon you, and you have to concentrate to sort them out. You\u2014 No, your father was jumped by these two, and something ... a mask ... was pressed on to your ... his ... face. He was investigating the basement because of the car parked nearby, and he was investigating because no one at the community center proper could explain where that mystery box went after it was picked up. And the mystery box was important because\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I see now what happened,\" you growl. \"Christ, Johansson, you had my\u2014 my dad's head, and you still managed to not cover your tracks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The box. You put\u2014 You put his name to it when you mailed it here from Salopek, here to the community center.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the only way to do it,\" he says. \"I was pretending to be your dad at the time\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but the delivery confirmation went back to Salopek and from there back to his office. He got curious because he didn't remember putting in a request to have anything sent out, and certainly not to this address. So he talked to Jack this afternoon, and from there tracked it here. The guys at the community center said a kid picked it up. He spotted your car and this door, and that's why he came in here. He took one look at you two jokers\"\u2014you glare at the fake Will Prescott\u2014\"and naturally figured it was you two behind it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb blinks. \"Okay, I guess that makes sense. He started yelling\u2014I guess you, uh, remember that part\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so you jumped on him with his own mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to get him to shut up,\" Caleb protests. \"I couldn't explain anything to him. He wouldn't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he'd understand if you explained it all to him. He'd have killed you, but he'd have understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't want to be killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which makes you a minority of one.\" Caleb turns red at your retort. \"Now, how did this golem business come about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't leave the mask on him permanently,\" Caleb says. \"I thought ... Well, I thought 'Let's try the next spell'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus. Did you even have a clue what it would do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might not have done anything bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and where would you have been then? What if it gave him superpowers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then he wouldn't have been pissed, would he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After wearing his face so many times, you think he would have been okay with being mugged?\" You can't tell where your own rage ends and your dad's begins. The sheer idiocy on display in this room\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, what's done is done,\" Caleb says. \"You wanna hit me? Hit me. I guess I deserve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething like a red mist seems to descend over your vision, and it takes a supreme effort of self-control not to follow through on the invitation. You lower your head and say, through gritted teeth, \"That won't do any good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's silence for a moment, and then the golem speaks. \"So, what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him, and something like a cold knife goes through your heart. <i>You dumb kid.</i> But you're talking to yourself, too, when you think it. The thing is right\u2014if you'd been here you'd probably have helped Caleb do it because you'd be in such a panic. And your dad\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddamn it, your dad actually would understand. It's not that he has such a low opinion of you, but\u2014 You stare at your twin, and actually want to burst out crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I was actually the same way when I was his age,</i> a voice says in your head. It's a familiar voice and a familiar caution, one that your dad has often given himself. <i>I was smarter than him, I could do worse things and walk away from them.</i> You catch yourself smiling grimly at your dad's memories, at incidents you never knew about. <i>Remember the time you nearly burned down the house? Remember the time you blew up your bedroom at three in the morning because you set the timer on that homemade bomb wrong? Remember the time the Air Force visited because your homemade UFO\u2014a lawn chair, dozens of helium balloons, and a string of Christmas lights\u2014showed up on their tracking radar ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Will had half my ingenuity he could do the same things. If he had half my wit he could walk away from his own disasters. But he's got my sense of curiosity but he's missing that same little voice that says 'Think real hard before you attach those rockets to your roller skates, and try to anticipate all the bad things that could happen'.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel very tired, and your shoulders slump. You glance at your watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get back to Salopek,\" you say. \"You two pack everything up\u2014hide the first golem in the back somewhere\u2014and take the stuff to my house. I'll look through the book and see if I can figure anything out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do we get together? Tomorrow?\" Caleb asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't.\" You reach for your wallet and remember who's wearing whose clothes. You snap your fingers at \"Will\" and tell him to undress. \"I'll give you your two hundred back later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not serious,\" Caleb frowns. \"You're ending our partnership?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown at him. \"After this, you really think I want your help and input?\" Caleb thrusts his lip out belligerently, then shrinks back again as you stare stonily at him. \"Anyway, I've got a new partner,\" you continue. \"My dad, and he's a hell of a lot smarter than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe basement is quiet as you change into your dad's clothes, and then you drive back to Salopek to finish up for the day. Back at the house afterward, you find two large boxes in your study. You take them out to the garage and carefully stow away the more flammable elements for eventual disposal. Dinner is muted, and it only takes a glance to get Robert to stop him horsing around. Afterward, when the boys are upstairs, Martha\u2014your mother, your wife\u2014sits next to you on the sofa and asks what's wrong. \"Just a hard day at work,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it something Will did?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you grunt. But lying does not come easily to your father. \"Not at work, at least. I told you he was helping his friend Caleb out with a science project.\" She nods. \"I found out what it involved. Someone was going to get hurt, so I had to put a stop to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it?\" Her eyes widen in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were just playing with some dangerous chemicals. It wasn't school sanctioned or supervised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Robert doesn't have a dollhouse for them to blow up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince, then smile at the private joke. \"Does Amanda still carry a grudge over that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have just built a house out of Legos and used that as a prop for your volcano.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't have had the structural properties I needed to demonstrate the power of pyroclastic flows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't a school-sanctioned experiment either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it was a success. And her dollhouse did make a nice little one-house Pompeii. Surely she's old enough now to appreciate that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's an interior decorator, Harris, not a volcano-ologist.\" She puts her arm in yours. \"And I think she ruled out Hawaii for her honeymoon because of bad memories of mountains blowing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the point is that she can visit now without worrying that her nephew is going to reenact the experiment for her.\" You snort. \"But it will just be something else when it happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles and kisses your neck deeply. \"All this talk of fireworks,\" she murmurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan softly. Two teenage boys in the house, and twenty years of marriage, and ... and they still do it at least once a week. Visions and memories bat at your imagination. A shudder passes through you\u2014one that combines dread and anticipation. You should switch back into your own form before going to bed, let a fake dad sleep next to your mom. At the same time, though, it's easier to deal with what happened by pretending to be your dad. It makes him feel less absent. You're not sure you'd be able to look at his replacement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind flashes back to the dinner table: Yes, Will never once looked you in the face all during the meal.</span></div></div>",

You're in your dad's boxers (and nothing else) because you're in his body, and you're also in his bed. From behind the bathroom door come the sounds of your mom getting ready to join you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pinch the bridge of your nose, then return to staring at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Boxers.</i> Your dad sleeps in his boxers. No pajamas. So there will be nothing but them between you and your mom when she joins you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force the thought away. That's why you're staring at the featureless ceiling. To turn your mind into the kind of blank that won't have thoughts like that drifting through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's hard to avoid them, given where you are and, yes, what you're wearing. You remember, when you were a kid, your dad coming out in boxers on Saturday mornings, back when you were awake early enough on Saturday mornings, and back (now that you think of it, with both your brain and your dad's, for he's in here with you) when you were young enough that he thought nothing of parading around in his boxers in front of his kid and the kid's baby brother. It made sense to you at the time that your dad would sleep in his underwear, for you did too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince turning twelve (or thereabouts), to the extent that you do think of your parents' sleeping arrangements, you imagine them both swaddled like mummies and sleeping in separate beds with an iron door, of the kind that falls from the ceiling in the title sequence of the old <i>Get Smart</i> sitcom, dropping between them with a thunderous clang when it's time to go to bed. <i>Well, that's not literally what you imagine, but ...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile twitches at the corners of your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fantasized about having a door like that for your room, back when you were twelve. With an electronic eye that would recognize you so it would lift when you approached it, and would drop once you were on the other side. <i>Let the old man try to get in with </i>that<i> between me and him,</i> you chortled, and you even drew up blueprints\u2014not childish drawings, but actual blueprints taking weight and tension into account\u2014and clambered into the attic to study the layout to see if such a door would fit\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile drops into a frown. <i>No, wait, it was your </i>dad<i> who did that. It was your </i>dad<i> who was always trying to avoid his father, to avoid the chores and the questions and expressions of pinched incomprehension, by dropping an iron door between them.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn electric arc, a spark of fellow feeling, leaps between Harris and Will Prescott, who are cohabiting the same skull, as they recognize what fathers and sons so often have in common. Your dad couldn't build that <i>Get Smart</i>-style door for his bedroom, so he had to be content with hanging up a sign that said \"DANGER: LIVE FIRE EXERCISES\" and installing an electronic eye\u2014yes, he did fashion one of those\u2014that triggered a spray bottle aimed to hit the cat when it tried wandering in. <i>Well, the cat and your father's\u2014grandfather's\u2014ankles.</i> The cat learned quicker than the old man did ... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump as your mom hits the bed, and it's not just the action of the springs that lifts you. You tense all over, and she notices when she throws her arm over your chest and kisses you deeply on the neck. \"You are stiff all over, hon. Just not where I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stiffen even more\u2014but not where she wants\u2014as she plunges her hand down the front of your boxers and cradles your junk. Sweat breaks out on your brow. \"I'm preoccupied,\" you mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what?\" she croons softly, and kisses you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm. That experiment you made him stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. No. In general. It's got me thinking.\" <i>Distract her, yes, distract her!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ummmmm ... </i> \"I don't know. Which is part of what's bothering me.\" You are very much aware that you're gabbling. \"It's like it lit a fuse somewhere inside my brain, and there's going to be an explosion, and I don't know what's going to explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raises up. \"You're not worried you're having a stroke, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't mean physically. I mean, uh, emotionally.\" <i>Yeah, that's it! Get her talking about feelings! Women love that!</i> (According to the magazines you\u2014your dad\u2014has noticed her reading.) \"You know, he's going to graduate this year. And next year Robert's going to start high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs. \"You're worried about what Will's going to do after he graduates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You grit your teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad is in absolute agonies about your academics and what they portend for you. <i>Is Will going to be one of those kids who won't figure out what he wants to do or what he's good at until after he's left college with a useless degree?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your forehead. \"I mean, I already knew I was going to be an engineer before I was even a junior in high school, and my dad used to actually complain\u2014he'd complain!\u2014about the college catalogs I kept sending away for. But Will ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't respond well to pressure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I try not to put any on him.\" Something like a heavy weight settles onto your chest. \"I think I do anyway. Or he thinks I do. God!\" You rub your face again. \"If he only knew just how hard I <i>could</i> come down on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe funny thing is, as you imagine what your dad could do to you, and imagine how you'd respond, you realize you would hardly feel worse than you actually do. Your dad doesn't have to say or do anything. Even just in his eyes, long before you made this mess that left you crawling into his brain, you could see the disappointment he feels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, not disappointment. <i>Fear.</i> Fear that you will wind up lost and unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't worry about the things that have already happened or what we did or didn't do,\" your mom says, and she returns to stroking you. \"We just carry on the best we can from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Which means doing what?</i> you almost ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realize that her words apply just as much to you and what you've done to your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no point in obsessing over how you got here. The best thing to do is to use all your wits (which are little enough) and all of your dad's to fix this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom kisses you again on the neck. \"Harris, honey,\" she says, \"you shouldn't\" \u2014she kisses you again\u2014 \"go to bed with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and turn your head to kiss her forehead. \"I know. But it's kind of ruined me for, uh\u2014\" You feel her freeze. You turn onto your side and pull her toward you. \"Can I just hold onto you? To remind me you've always been the best thing to ever happen to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel rather than see her smile, and it's not long after she's fallen asleep that you do too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're up and showered and shaved long before Will and Robert are up, though one of them\u2014Robert probably\u2014is running the water in their bathroom as you button up your dress shirt. Harris Prescott is forty-eight years old, and he's your dad, so there's lots of horror in looking at yourself in the mirror and seeing <i>him</i> looking back at you with hardened eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut other than that there's nothing much wrong with him. He eats right and spends an hour a day at the Salopek gym exercising, and that has kept the inexorable paunch to a minimum. He has all his hair still\u2014it's a sandy color, and he keeps it in a short but not severe trim. He looks at the world with a direct stare out of cool hazel eyes, and his grin is broad and confident when he's of a mind to deploy it. As you expertly knot a silvery silk tie around your neck, you remember a couple of business trips to Houston and to Seattle, and the women at the hotel bars after hours who flirted hard with ... with your dad. He didn't do anything with them\u2014he's been faithful since his bachelor party, at least\u2014but he was flattered and didn't resist the temptation to flirt hard with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, you fix yourself some coffee\u2014an upscale brand carried by the Milagro Beanfield Warehouse; your dad is a real coffee snob\u2014while your ... wife ... puts the finishing touches on your breakfast: scrambled Eggbeaters and lean ham on a sprouted whole grain English muffin. (Your dad went on a paleo diet last spring, but has since relaxed it a little.) You bring in the Wall Street Journal from the porch and give it a quick read while eating. Your mouth purses as you read one of the guest editorials, but you say nothing. Your dad has some very strong political opinions, but he keeps them to himself because he hates \"blowhards\" even more than he hates the current Administration and congressional leadership. (Not that he has much respect for the opposition, either; \"When I think of one I prefer the other\" is his attitude toward both parties.) Your ... wife ... settles in with her own coffee and the <i>Saratoga Falls Morning-Journal</i>; she saves her breakfasts for after you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom upstairs comes the sound of male teenage voices, low at first, then rising. You look up at the ceiling. You're about to open your mouth when you catch your ... wife's ... expression, and lower your head. Feet sound on the stairs, and Robert runs through the dining room into the kitchen. A few minutes later, Will, very red in the face and with his eyes bugging out, thunders in after him. He stops short, though, when he catches you out of the corner of his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his hair sticking out all which way, and his shirt crooked, he looks like a scarecrow washed and thrown wet into a tumble dryer without fabric softener.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd <i>this</i> is who you're going to work with to restore your dad? Maybe you'd better get Caleb's help after all.</span></div></div>",

You never understood what your dad did, and now you understand it's because he does a little bit of everything. \"Vice President of Shit Shoveling\" is the title he's threatened to put on his business cards\u2014so he's told Gavin Wagner, his immediate boss, when the man's brought him yet <i>another</i> screwball problem to fix. Technical, contractual, legal, personnel\u2014whatever the type of problem, one way or another it almost <i>always</i> crosses your dad's desk, for advice if nothing else, for he seems to know everything, and typically he's the only with enough stick to go after problems with a baseball bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake the crisis that Griffiths brings you at ten-thirty. You're on the phone to Atlanta, explaining to your counterpart at Murray-Huemler that if they do <i>not</i> come across with certain proprietary information about the construction of their jet engines then Salopek will <i>not</i> be able to guarantee proper engineering for the turbine blades they have ordered, and that it would be very bad for everyone if one of Murray-Huemler's next-generation engines subsequently died over the south Atlantic and took two-hundred-fifty passengers and crew with it because it dreaded the loneliness of the cold ocean below. You're tapping your pencil and listening to a lot of hemming when Jerry Griffiths puts his head into your office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me back at five,\" you growl into the phone, \"if you've got an affirmative. If you don't, your great-great-grandchildren will <i>still</i> be awaiting delivery of those turbine blades.\" You drop the phone into its cradle. \"Yes?\" you snap at Jerry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hustles in. He has big, wet eyes set in a hound dog face. \"Legal asked me to show you this, when you have a minute,\" he says as he sets a fat file folder in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have plenty of minutes. I just don't have time.

Your eyes pop, and you grab up the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want Bill Stutzman,\" you tell your floor's receptionist. \"Did you talk to him about this?\" you ask Griffiths. \"Why didn't he call me with\u2014? Bill, it's Harris. How much shit are you actually planning to flush into the municipal waste system? Or is this number that legal is showing me\u2014 <i>Sit. Down</i>,\" you mouth at Jerry, who has begun edging toward the door. \"Is that just a negotiating ploy?\" You allow Bill ten words of explanation before cutting him off. \"Not that big, we're not going to get, not if we're flushing\u2014\" You eyeball that number again. \"Christ! Because even if the city lets us flush away that much heavy metal contaminant, we'll wind up with the EPA hanging a Superfund site designation on us, and <i>they'll</i> bust us back until we're in nothing but the organic, hand-crafted <i>thumbtack</i> business!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen a bit more, then say, \"No, <i>I'll</i> call Roberts. You just write, <i>Sometimes I have to tell the boss 'No'</i> one hundred times on your office wall with a permanent marker.\" You punch a button on the phone, and Jerry quails as you stab him with a short, hot glare. \"Linda, I need to talk to Mr. Roberts,\" you tell the woman who answers. \"Tell him it's about the upcoming CNN expose that's going to bankrupt us.\" As she relays your message, you scribble three names on a scrap of paper and push it at Jerry. \"Call these guys,\" you tell him, \"and tell them to clear their afternoon schedules in case there's a meeting. Yes sir,\" you say into the phone. \"No, not yet there isn't, but there will be if the city accepts this number that Bill Stutzman wants to slip past them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next three hours you conduct a running battle with the president of the company, sometimes abetted and sometimes opposed by three vice presidents and two facilities engineers, along with pop-up support by the head of the legal affairs office, in which you argue against both the ethics and the practicalities of dumping excessive amounts of toxic waste into a municipal system that Salopek\u2014but not the city's own engineers\u2014know can't handle them. The president doesn't back down until you threaten to resign over the issue, and even then you buttonhole Gupta in legal and tell him that you'll be visiting the city's own lawyers on your own time to look over the contracts that Salopek gives them to make sure that the company keeps its promise to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the middle of that, while jogging on a treadmill in the exercise facility, you have to field a call from the accounting department wanting to know how to itemize a certain disassembled drill press for depreciation purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harris, is there anything that goes on around here you don't know about?\" asks Larry Haygood, who is puffing along on the machine next to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lay awake nights dreading that there is,\" you reply, and wipe the streaming sweat from your brow as you slow the treadmill to a walking pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSo consumed are you by your father's work that you forget all about your afternoon meeting with Caleb until four o'clock, when there's a sharp knock on your door and a skinny kid in a sloppy hat and cargo shorts looks in at you. \"Hey Dad,\" he grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're on the phone, so you growl a \"What?\" at your son before things click into place. \"Oh. Right.\" You listen impatiently to Pete Ritter for another minute while glaring at Will, who has plopped his butt and his shit-eating grin into a chair. He waggles his legs back and forth and lets his arms dangle to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to bring Caleb along,\" you snap at him after hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.\" Will's grin widens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then where the\u2014?\" A penny drops. \"Oh. God. No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill\u2014Caleb\u2014rubs his nose. \"Hey, I been coming in like this for the last week anyway, and this way it doesn't look funny if\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you tell Andy Keyes you were coming up to see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile vanishes. \"Uh. No. I just\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close the door.\" As you dial Andy to tell him that your son is up in your office, and that he'll be down to work in fifteen minutes, and to deduct his pay accordingly, Will, his butt still wedged in the chair, stretches his lanky arm <i>waaaaaaaaayyyy</i> over at the door. He still can't reach it, though, and has to tip himself over, raising both clodhopper feet into the air to counterbalance himself, until he can weakly brush the door closed with his fingertips. \"So, whaddaya wanna see me about?\" he asks with cheerful insolence once he's restored himself to something vaguely like a dignified sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drum the desk, weighing the decision, before replying, \"Get used to being inside that mask. You're not taking it off until we get things fixed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat smile, which had crept back onto his face, vanishes. \"The fuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your language,\" you snap before you can stop yourself, and he smirks sourly back. \"I want you at home, in character as me\u2014\" A patch of sweat breaks out between your shoulder blades as you contemplate what <i>that</i> is going to be like. \"Tonight and going forward. It's an all-hands project to get my dad back to normal and I want you around until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dad seems pretty normal now,\" your friend grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, am I freaking you out? You think I'm not freaking <i>myself</i> out?\" You knead your forehead, which is warm. \"Yeah, I want your help. Will you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure!\" He actually looks insulted by the implication that he wouldn't. \"I just don't see why I have to stop being me in order to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll give you an incentive. The sooner my dad's back, the sooner I'll be back, which means the sooner you'll be back. Besides,\" you add as Caleb shrugs. \"He's got a job here and you don't. You want the money Will Prescott's earning? You play Will Prescott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb shrugs again. \"Okay, it's a deal. But will you at least stop barking at your son all the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to bark at him, then catch yourself. You sag, and your eyes drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try,\" you say. You look up again. \"Maybe that's another reason I want you there, playing me.\" Caleb's eyebrows goes up. \"I'll have an easier time dealing with my\u2014\" You swallow thickly. \"My goofball son if he's better than the goofball he usually is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart rises, just a little, at Caleb's wince and his reply: \"You're not a goofball, Will.\"</span></div></div>",

But you're too tired to care. \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pork medallions for supper. Green beans and a salad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked about you.\" You nuzzle her ear. \"Not supper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wilts a little, and puts her arm around your back. \"I fought dragons. Cleaned Robert's room. Umm ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm?\" You put your nose in her hair and smell it. It's still got some of the shampoo scent, but it's mixed with honest sweat and her own musk. Your motor thrums a little harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're getting up close to the time, I think, when we'll have to talk to him about ... emissions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the motor sputters and stops. \"Intentional or accidental?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accidental. Haven't had a big patch yet, unless they happened where I didn't find 'em, but\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" You let go of her and rub your eyes. You yourself know that Robert is into the porn, and your dad suspects it. Your mom? You've no idea what she knows, suspects, or plain just won't tell herself about her sons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that reminds you that this is your <i>mom</i> you were feeling up. \"Where's Will?\" you ask as you lean back against a counter. Your wife\u2014 <i>Focus, Will, that's your mom!</i>\u2014turns back to the stove, where the beans are gently simmering. \"His truck's here, so\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upstairs, I guess. Did you have that talk with Caleb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I also found out what it's all about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you knew what it was all about,\" she says as she checks inside the oven, where a pork tenderloin is sizzling. Your mom loves cooking and baking and sewing and cleaning. \"They were trying to blow themselves up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I found out what Caleb thought he was doing and why Will was helping. He needed help with his math, and this was his way of paying Caleb back.\" It's a plausible lie, and you take no great satisfaction in your ingenuity at coming up with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good, isn't it?\" Martha asks. <i>Yes, think of her as 'Martha'.</i> \"It means he knows he needs help and is getting it and he's paying his way. Sort of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to remember to look at it that way,\" you reply in your dad's driest tone. \"But I put a stop to it, and told Will I'd be taking over as his tutor. A couple of hours every night, just the two of us, in my study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha turns with an expression of pure alarm. \"Are you sure, honey? Your blood pressure\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine. I can't very well <i>yell</i> at him two hours straight. Besides, maybe this will, you know, break the ice between us.\" You wince at the expression, which is horribly apt. \"Maybe that's why it's been so long since we've gotten along. We're like strangers to each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha's expression softens, and she pulls you into a gentle hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Alright, tomorrow I want you to switch out with yourself after school,\" you tell your fake son later that evening as you close the grimoire. \"Send Will in to work, and you go back to the clubhouse to execute the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I still get paid for his time?\" Caleb asks with one of your old, raffish grins. He is clutching a list of the ingredients you will need for the next spell. Will Prescott's calculus homework still lies unopened at his elbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" You tap your pen on the desk. \"I wish we could find a more secure facility to do this stuff in,\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A building at Salopek, maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the opposite of secure,\" you retort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you muse on the idea, and your eye settles on your replacement thoughtfully.  \"You know, if you were older we might fake up a sublease that would give you one of the smaller units to work in.\" And that gives you another idea, and you study it from a couple of different angles before laying it aside. \"But for tomorrow,\" you resume, \"just do it at the clubhouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could go over there tonight,\" Caleb says. \"Tell your mom I'm going for a quick jog, and you could finish my homework for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow is soon enough. And <i>don't</i> go on to whatever spell comes after it,\" you add more firmly. \"I want to look over everything before you do <i>anything.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolls his eyes. \"Yes, <i>Daaaad,</i>\" he whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I going to get attitude from you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, dur. Don't you <i>always?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return his snicker with a glower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell Caleb will be executing tomorrow is the one he unlocked by turning your dad into a golem. It looks like a variation on the last two spells, for it uses almost the exact same ingredients but on a smaller scale. The main difference, thankfully, is that it calls for <i>no</i> bodies whatsoever, and only a handful of cemetery dirt. As ever, there is no indication what it makes or what it does, but Caleb will have an answer to that when he brings you the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it seems like the only way forward. None of the spells have come with a \"reverse,\" so the only thing you can hope is that by going forward you will eventually come upon something that will fix your dad. You hope you don't have to keep doing horrible things to people in order to reach it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBusiness transacted, you push the grimoire back into your old book bag and pull out some of the other homework while Caleb tackles your math. You can write in both your and your dad's handwriting, so you scrawl out some answers on your Sociology homework, then check over Caleb's work. You only find three errors, and you tell him to leave them uncorrected. \"I want Bs, not As,\" you tell him, \"or Mr. Kowalski will spot a fraud. B-minuses, if you can cut it that fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, you release him to goof off upstairs, and pad into the living room to watch TV with your wife. \"It went okay,\" you reply to her querying glance. \"He only rolled his eyes at me seven times. Okay, five times,\" you say when she gasps. You kiss her. \"Thanks for the philosophy talk last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What philosophy talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About how this is the first day of the rest of our son's educational career.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say that? I was <i>trying</i> to get you to\u2014\" She grabs you down low, and you jump, and she giggles. Fortunately, just then Robert comes through on his way to the kitchen, and she lets go of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she won't let go of you when you get upstairs and in bed, not until you've peeled off your boxers and turned over to get on top of her. You let go and try to pass out as you let your dad's instincts take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your dad's instincts are that he <i>loves</i> having sex with his wife. Hot, grinding, deep-thrusting sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Whew! Someone sure wanted in bad, didn't they?\" Jack Weiland says as he shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Andy Keyes exchange annoyed looks behind his back, but you say nothing, and Andy only says, \"I'll set some guys to fixing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\" is a window, high up in the back wall of one of the secure units where Salopek keeps its most valuable materials. The glass has been blown out and lies scattered on the asphalt beneath your feet. The heavy steel shutters have been peeled back like the skin off a banana and hang limply from busted hinges. You are one of half a dozen Salopek employees staring up at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head over it. It's the second burglary within the last two months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you countermand Andy before he can move. \"I want Mike Salazar and his team to look it over before we start fixing it up.\" You turn to Sean Mitchell, who is standing next to you and craning his neck to stare up at the window. \"Go find Will, the two of you will start making an inventory of what's in that room. Andy will get you a manifest so we can find out what was taken.\" You take out your cell phone to call security. \"Get in there before the door codes change.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why change the door codes?\" Sean asks. \"If it was burglars, they went in through the window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They went <i>out</i> through the windows, Mitchell. The glass.\" It crunches as you shift your feet. \"The explosion came from inside. My first guess is they let the door close on them after they were inside, and this was how they chose to get back out. Phil,\" you say into the phone, and begin directions to get all the door codes of the complex changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that reminds you that you want to find a new spot for Caleb to do his research in.</span></div></div>",

Happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. I told you. Oh, something happened last night. Someone got into one of the units and it looks like they used an explosive to get back out again. Funny thing is, they would have brought their own. Isn't that right, Will?\" You give him a hard look as you take a swig from the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" he says in a low voice. \"Me and Sean\" \u2014You let the ungrammatical expression slide by\u2014 \"didn't find anything missing.

We need to hire three new security guards because the two last night didn't hear anything like the earth-shattering kaboom the damage would indicate, and the one this morning who was supposed to be patrolling the alley didn't even see anything. We only found the busted window at around three this afternoon when his replacement came on duty.\" You take another refreshing swig of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha looks between you and Will in a way that tells you that the conversation has only been suspended, not terminated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nDinner is pleasant enough, as Will has begun to leave Robert alone, so that you only have to squash one of your obstreperous offspring instead of both of them.

Did Will and Sean miss something in that room? Did they go at it half-assed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Sean was an anal-retentive prick about checking everything. Or that's the impression I've got.\" He rubs at his forehead, where a new crop of zits is breaking out. \"Unless someone made an explosive cocktail from the things in those drums and then got the seals back on, everything's accounted for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll order an audit on the manifests. Maybe they were incorrect.\" You sit at the desk. Your old book bag is already sitting atop it, and you begin emptying it for the night's session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't an explosion, <i>Dad,</i>\" Caleb sneers. \"Not from the inside.

Anything that could have taken those shutters out would have\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are ways of making a unidirectional explosion,\" you reply. \"But it's nothing for you to worry about. You need to worry that your mother is going to make you quit that job because it's too dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I know that look she got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, cool. Then maybe you can get them to hire Caleb Johansson as a replacement.\" He beams. \"You know, he's been bugging me like a fucker about it, and he came real close to kicking my ass when I stabbed him in the back by taking it myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile thinly. \"Maybe we can arrange for Caleb to get your job. You'll still be living here, though, and doing the research I set you. Speaking of which\u2014 What happened at the clubhouse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb takes out a mask and a Tupperware container. \"This is the stuff it made,\" he says as he opens the tub. It is filled with a thin, grayish paste with the consistency of watery oatmeal. \"That was what came out, and it was enough to get the page to turn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls off his cap long enough to comb out the stiff locks with his fingers before continuing. \"I think this is the stuff that's got your dad covered up. If it is then maybe we can chip it off him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean it's covered him like a shell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb hunches his shoulders and squints. \"Well, I don't know. We won't know unless we try. But it's made with the same stuff, mostly. And instead of pouring it over a body\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't 'pour' it over my dad,\" you remind him. \"You piled the stuff on him and set him on fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be pedantic. But this stuff, instead of going on the person, goes inside a mask. See?\" He pushes the mask across the desk toward you, and you pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masks you've made and seen to this point are, when completed, polished a brilliant blue all over. But this one is blue only on its convex side. On the side that sits on the face, it's a pasty white, the same color as the stuff in the Tupperware tub. But you can feel the raised spot where the metal band is, and Caleb's name still floats over the inner surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you had to use your mask, huh?\" you say. \"Whose hair did you use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine. The way I figure it, based on what the spell says\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe outlines his theory, then you pore over the revealed reverse of the spell page with him. After some discussion, you tentatively concur with his reading of it. \"Of course, the only way to find out,\" you tell him, \"is to try it out on someone.\" You push the mask into his hands. \"Go put it on your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's face\u2014the face of Will Prescott\u2014collapses in shock. \"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm totally serious, mister.\" You set your mouth in a grim line. \"Now. Text me when you've done it so I can come up to look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb turns white, and he swallows, then he gets to his feet. He gives you a backward glance in the doorway, then shuffles out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up a pencil and doodle on a notepad, trying not to think of all the ways this could go wrong, until your phone dings. <i>redy,</i> says your son. You heave yourself to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, you shut the door to Robert's room behind you. Will and his friend Caleb\u2014the latter squeezed into clothes that are too small for him\u2014stare back at you palely from the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a few seconds to find your voice. \"What's your name?\" you ask the kid with the short, tightly curled hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me, Mr. Prescott,\" he says. \"Caleb Johansson? And I'm really, really sorry about what I did to you back at the, er\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems to be, uh, me,\" Will says. \"I asked it a few questions, and it knows everything I know. And it obeys me too, just like a golem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know about Robert?\" you ask the fake Caleb. \"Will's brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only that Will thinks he's a pest,\" he says warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where he is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks around the room, but shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, take it off him,\" you tell Will. Your heart thumps hard. \"Let's see what it did to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb flinches as Will reaches for his face, but relents long enough for your \"son\" to pull at  his brow. It comes away, and Robert falls back unconscious on the bed. Other than that, he seems none the worse for wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, scram,\" you tell Will, and he doesn't wait for a repeat of the order. \"Wait for me in the study.\" Then you sit on the bed next to Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look him over carefully\u2014his pulse and breathing are consistent with merely being asleep\u2014before gently waking him. \"Hey, Bobby,\" you call to him, using his childhood endearment. \"Bobby buddy. Wake up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stirs, opens his eyes, blinks at you, then bolts up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh,\" you tell him. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasps. \"It was Will, Dad! He\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert blinks and shakes his head. \"He came in here,\" he says, \"and he jumped on me with something, shoved it in my face. I couldn't breath, and then ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trails off, and the little hairs on your body rise. \"Then what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I woke up and you were here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look closely and deeply into his eyes. They are clear. \"You don't remember anything after Will came in?\" you ask. He shakes his head. \"You didn't hear me come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Will just\u2014\" He turns red. \"Will just socked me in the face and then\u2014\" He gingerly touches himself all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look him over, too, and tell him that he's fit as a fiddle. \"You must have fainted,\" you tell him. \"I've already yelled a blue streak at your brother, and he won't do it again. It was just a prank that went wrong.\" Robert doesn't look mollified, but he doesn't make any more trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least not for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the study, you tell Caleb that your hypothesis has been confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The question now is,\" you say, \"whether we use these masks to set us up a safe space at Salopek or at some other facility?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with sticking to the clubhouse?\" Caleb asks.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Caleb argues, and you come real close to forcing a decision on your terms. Before you can settle firmly on an alternate decision, though, you let him return to the clubhouse so he can set his mask back on the golem\u2014the one you turned your father into\u2014so he can send it home. While he's gone, you open up the grimoire so you can study the next spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it goes easily enough. It opens with a list of ingredients, which some cross-checking shows is identical to the list of ingredients for the mind-band. There is only a single line of instructions on assembly, though, and the translation seems to be ambiguous: \"Use me, solve me\" seems to be the most straightforward translation, and there are any number of ways of understanding that gnomic line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there any clarification below? Apparently not, for the bottom half of the page, where the sigil should be, is a jumble of blurry lettering, as though the page had got wet and the ink had run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait, that's not right. You frown at it. It's not only blurred. It is also ... blurring. Actively shifting, like words glimpsed at the bottom of a choppy pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your eyes, then focus on a spot in the middle of the page. Yes, the letters are shifting. A word that looks like <i>mrefph</i> turns into <i>nncigb</i> and then into <i>imq8s.</i> At the same time, the words you glimpse in your peripheral vision seem to stand still, and if they weren't in Latin you could <i>almost,</i> you'd swear, be able to make them out. But when you shift your gaze to look at them, they begin to dodge and weave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a minute of this you feel a headache coming on, and rest your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open them again, you attack the page in a more relaxed way, skimming it lightly and picking up details from the corner of your eye. In this way you're able to pick out that there's a faint line running across the middle of the page, just below that one bit of Latin. You brush it with your fingertips, and find that it's an imperfection in the paper itself. It feels as though\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cover that mad, dancing gibberish with your left hand, and peer at and brush the page with your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a tear. The bottom half of the page has been torn away. You're not seeing the bottom half of the spell. You're seeing the bottom half of the spell <i>behind</i> it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a flash you understand what must be happening. The book will not let you see the next spell it contains until you've solved the previous spell\u2014it keeps the page locked. But some idiot has tried to get around that by tearing out a page. And instead of becoming legible, the text beneath has become dancing gibberish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb, when he returns, finds you grinning angrily at the book. \"What's wrong?\" he asks. You show him the book and explain your deduction. \"Can we do the spell anyway?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No instructions,\" you point out. \"Unless this 'use me, solve me' is it. But even then\u2014\" You flip to the earlier spells. \"They all use sigils, see? Sigils at the bottom of each page.\" You return to the torn page. \"The sigil has been torn out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's a dead end?\" Caleb asks. He has the grace to sound horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't answer. Your dad wouldn't give up, and neither will you, for both your sakes. But neither can you see a way forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept to execute this spell as far as you can, in case there is a clue to be had there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's looks like it makes a mind band,\" you point out to him, \"at least until the sigil does its work. Tomorrow, do like you did today, send Will in to work, and make the thing up like it's a mind band. We'll look at it tomorrow night. Maybe one of us will have a brilliant idea in the meantime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb nods soberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you do homework together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nLater, in bed, Martha brings up the topic of Will's working someplace where explosions can go off so easily. You remind her that you're at greater risk than he is; and besides, while you were tutoring him he told of some things he noticed in that that room that make it look like it <i>wasn't</i> an explosion. She gives up on convincing you that he should quit; but you don't get lucky a second night in a row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is, admittedly, an ambivalent defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, at a meeting to discuss the break in, Mike Salazar reports that he's at a loss to explain the damaged window. <i>No residue on the glass, no residue on the shutters, nothing on the walls or floor or ceiling, no damage to anything in the room. Not even to the dust on the top shelves.</i> Maybe the damage was inflicted from outside? Some machinery that pulled the shutters back? <i>But the glass was exploded outward.</i> Mike is utterly baffled. \"If you ask me, it was the Incredible Hulk,\" he says. \"He was inside the room and he <i>punched</i> his way out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just tell your wife, when you get home, that the investigation ruled out an explosion of any kind. \"Just someone with a sledgehammer,\" you tell her. If you thought that blaming the mistake on a maniac would make her feel better, you were wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill doesn't look very happy either when he gets back from Caleb's, where (he explains) he stopped off on his way back from work. When you're alone with him for the evening, he violently tugs the grimoire from his bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking Molester,\" he snarls. That would be Lester \"The Molester\" Pozniak, the soccer goalie and bully who occasionally pops into the lives of you and your friends long enough to make you miserable. \"So I'm standing at my locker, about to go to math, and he grabs my book bag and goes walking off with it. It and <i>everything in it,</i>\" he adds as he yanks more books out and drops them with a clatter on the desk. \"I had to tackle him to get it back. Right in front of the main office.\" His head sinks. \"I have three days' detention, starting on Monday,\" he mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an instant only, you'd like to yell at him. But you know the Molester too well. \"What's the Molester's punishment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nothing!</i>\" Will flings out his arms. \"Get this, he grabs my bag away, but according to Sagansky, that's not worth detention. But <i>I'm</i> supposed to be punished because I 'used violence'\" \u2014He makes very violent air quotes around the phrase\u2014 \"to get it back instead squawling off to a teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I in trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not with me. As long as you didn't lose anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't.\" He shuffles through the book bag, then pauses. \"Unless I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour scalp starts to crawl. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it together, man,\" he mutters, and starts methodically pulling out the rest of his books and papers and looking through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I hope! But, um\u2014\" He bites his lip. \"Could you help me find a metal band, about yea inches long and yea inches wide\" \u2014He pinches the air to show the dimensions\u2014 \"that looks kind of like a\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't lose it at school if you made it after school, Will! Er, Caleb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I did make it at school. I skipped third period.\" Caleb paws through the untidy pile of schoolwork without meeting your eye. \"I snuck into one of the portables and made it there. What?\" he exclaims when you start breathing heavily. \"I could get it done then! Save time afterward! And even if I lost it, I can make another one lickety-split, it only took, like\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut him off with a word and start helping him to look. Fifteen minutes later, after looking through each book, each notebook, each wad of paper, and the pockets and lining of the bag, you find no sign of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and open the grimoire. \"Then you'll make me another one,\" you tell him grimly as you leaf through the book to the torn page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach it and you go right past it. Not until you've turned it does the fact register. You flip back and stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe page looks very different when it is whole than when it is torn away. You have to check to see that the previous spell is the one that makes that stuff you put inside a mask, and that the ingredients at the top of the page, and that curious instruction \"Use me, solve me\" is there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the really strange thing is that there is no tear immediately below that line. Instead the page is whole, and shows no seam or any other sign of repair. It is also unblemished by any kind of mark: no words, no pictures, no stains, and no sigils. You and Caleb can only stare at it with looks of dumbfounded stupefaction. \"You saw it too, didn't you?\" you ask him. \"Last night?\" He nods. You turn the page, then flip it back, then turn it again. There is nothing written on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe page magically repairing itself is almost worse than its being torn, and you very nearly declare yourself ready to be rid of the book. <i>If it is going to be this strange and this creepy ...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your dad's mulishness pushes you ahead, and you and Caleb bend your heads cautiously over the next spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nLater that evening, after you're watching TV with your wife: \"Honey, do you think you're bonding with Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her. \"Somewhat,\" you allow, then decide to go further. \"Yes, I think I really am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not angry with him? I noticed you didn't say anything at dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His detention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. You didn't know Caleb had told her about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt and turn your eyes back to the TV. \"No. He explained it. The other guy was in the wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're okay with it?\" she says. \"Even though he sent that other boy to the nurse's office?\"</span></div></div>",

Your dad's reaction: <i>The hell?</i> Your reaction: <i>Way to go, Caleb!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three days' detention?\" you ask Martha, and you keep your voice very neutral. She nods. \"Will told you this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The school called.\" She hesitates. \"I didn't tell you because I was hoping that Will would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm. Well, he did. He just didn't mention the nurse's office.\" Martha's eyes widen as you get to your feet. \"I think I will have a word with my son,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harris,\" she says. \"Harris?\" But you ignore her and slowly mount the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rap on the door to a bedroom that was once yours, and enter without waiting for a summons. Will Prescott, splayed on his bed, tries to levitate off it. He thrusts his cell phone half under his butt, and turns very red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah. Porn.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close the door behind you. \"I hear that the school called. They had a much more complete report about what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill's face twists up. \"What do you mean, 'more complete'? I told you what happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About the nurse's office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face freezes, then falls. \"Oh. Heh.\" He grins weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I'm not proud of you,\" you say in a very level tone, \"for laying out the Molester so bad he needed\u2014 Well, what did he need from the nurse, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, some pain medicine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise one eyebrow, a gesture that both you and father know means, \"Pull the other one, it's got bells on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he was kind of woozy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp goes the other eyebrow, in a gesture that means, \"Strike two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I knocked him cold!\" That grin reappears, wider and more nervous than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lock the bedroom door. Will swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, Caleb,\" you murmur in a low, hard voice, \"but I will tear that face off you and put it on myself and find out directly what happened at school today if you don't\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I put a mask on him and it knocked him out! Jeez, are you happy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw slackens. \"A mask?\" It takes you a moment to get the word out past the blockage in your throat. \"You slapped a mask onto the Molester in full view of the\u2014?\" You slam your mouth shut before your voice can rise to a shriek. \"Never mind that, where the <i>freaking fuck</i> did you get a mask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made one?\" The sweat has popped out on his brow. \"Um, a couple, actually. With mind-bands and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's like your eyeballs want to jump out of your head. \"Fuck you, no you didn't. When did you find time, those things take fucking <i>days,</i> mister, to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used a car buffer! You know, for waxing cars? Makes it go a lot faster, you can get one buffed in less than an hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour knees buckle, and you sit on the edge of the bed. \"And you didn't. Freaking. Tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was going to be a surprise,\" Caleb says. He twists on the bed, like he's trying to burrow into it with his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. \"So what happened at school?\" Froth starts to fill your mouth. \"The truth, this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it turns out he did tell you the truth. Mostly. He was slipping a blank mask out of his backpack and into his locker while reorganizing his shit when the Molester loped past, grabbed the bag, and went down the hall. Caleb ran after, mask still in hand, and leaped on the soccer goalie. They twisted about for a time, with Caleb whaling feebly at him, and accidentally smacked him in the face with the mask. That knocked the Molester down and out, and he and Will both got shipped to the nurse's office for observation. There was a lot of panic in the office over the Molester's condition, for nothing they tried could revive him. Luckily, Caleb was alone with him when the mask came out, and he hastily snatched it up and hid it in his shorts. But the apparent seriousness of the injury was the reason Caleb got suspended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering the circumstance, you think, your friend got off light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've been making masks,\" you say when he's done. It's a topic less likely to set you off. \"How many?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhere between a few and a bunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A number, God damn it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three. Definitely three,\" Caleb says. And when you continue to stare, he adds. \"Polished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh God.</i> \"What about unpolished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grin is a rictus. \"Nine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pinch the bridge of your nose. \"Twelve. You've made twelve masks. That you hadn't told me about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've told you n\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it, Caleb! You know what we're supposed to be doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we <i>are</i> doing it!\" He flings his arms out. \"We're getting your dad back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's all! That's <i>all</i>, Will! Caleb!\" you correct yourself. You thrust a finger at him. \"So you stop what you're doing right now! No more! You just do what I say from this point on, and no more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the boss of me,\" he says sulkily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leap halfway across the bed at him. \"I can <i>make</i> myself the boss of you!\" you roar. \"I can <i>make</i> myself\u2014!\" Your voice dies in a strangulated choke as Caleb, eyes wide with terror, stares back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou straighten up and take a deep breath. Your face is boiling hot. But you keep your voice very calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you've got some masks,\" you say when you speak again. \"I will overlook the fact that you <i>have</i> got them, because it saves me the trouble of telling you that I <i>want</i> you to make some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe perks up. \"You do? That's great! Because I know who we can\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One.\" You hold up a finger. \"We only need one. And until I tell you otherwise, you will stay where you are, as my son\u2014 As me, I mean, and you will give me <i>everything</i> you have made so I can lock it away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb grimaces like he's sucking on twenty-five lemons, all at once, but nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Because I'm not going to let you distract me while I'm trying to get that fucking book figured out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave him with that and return downstairs. Martha is very pale. \"I heard you,\" she says as you sit down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear what I said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the words, just the tone.\" She rubs your back. \"What happened to the bonding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we're still bonded.\" You settle back on the sofa, and she raises her hand to massage your neck. \"I just explained to him that I really appreciated that he told me about what happened at school, but that in the future he should tell me <i>all</i> of what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got really intense,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I did.\" You rub your face in your hands. \"Because I really thought we were on the same page. And I wanted him to understand how much it <i>hurt</i> me, to find out that we weren't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Harris,\" she says, and she pulls you toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThose were conversations that happened later. Much later. Before, when you and Caleb were still down in the study, and were bending over the next spell together:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter staring at it in horrified fascination, you talk about it for a few minutes, then tackle it from opposite ends of the page. There seems no better way to attack it, for it is just a solid wall of text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo list of ingredients. No set of instructions. And certainly no sigil. Just closely set words in a cramped handwriting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse comes when you try entering the words into a translation program, and then into Google. None of them are real; all are just nonsensical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an hour you and Caleb struggle with it. Are the words anagrams? Are they sensible words, but broken up with odd spacing? A combination of both? For awhile you think you'd found a key in a set of words that, if rearranged and respaced, yielded a Latin phrase meaning \"three dogs windows kicked\" but that leads to nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ninety minutes of fruitless fiddling, you send Caleb upstairs. Before going out to join your better half on the sofa (where she will tell you the rest of the story of your son's day at school) you study the spells that have come before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a definite pattern to their progress. A mask to copy the body. A sealant to make it wearable. A metallic strip to copy the mind. A glue to bind one to the other. A golem that wears a mask and so become a servant. A spell that turns a person into a golem so that they can be replaced by a duplicate. A mask that hides a person so he can be replaced with a duplicate but without transforming them into a golem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder in almost spastic irritation why the book tossed that next-to-the-last one into the progression. It's like a \"fuck you\" dick move on the part of the book. It occurs to you then that maybe that's the point. It's there to separate the ethical people from the unethical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's that page that was torn and then just as mysteriously got repaired. Or did it? You wonder if the page is still damaged, and that's why the page that follows is such a mess of gobbledygook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be balked is a terrible frustration, to yourself but still more to Harris Prescott. Words have never much interested him, but matters mathematical, scientific, or engineering have never baffled him for long. You can't but feel a swelling rage at discovering a science-like method that won't yield to your mental battering ram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there must be people who do understand magic, for one of them has written a book of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure you want to know who those people are. But you do an internet search, and that yields a local name to go with two others you already know of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now you're going to get one of them\u2014or a golem of them, now that you know what Caleb has done\u2014to help you.</span></div></div>",

To Will: \"Get your stuff together, I got extra words for you outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sullenness of a snail on its way to a shell extraction, Will puts his gear together and follows you out to the garage. It's all you can do to keep from slapping the hat off his head. Instead\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop by your place on your way to work,\" you tell Caleb in a low voice, \"then switch out and send, uh, Will to Salopek.\" Your friend instantly perks up. \"Then you follow. Come find me in my office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it for?\" he says with barely restrained excitement. \"Is it about those masks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I got a job for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch until he's gone, and the roar of the truck motor has hardly died away before your wife comes into the garage. \"Harris,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that in there was for Robert's benefit,\" you interrupt her. \"I don't want him getting the idea it's okay to hit bullies, so I'm piling extra punishment on Will. I told him that if he serves out the extra detention here this weekend, I'll relax his curfew by an hour starting Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raises her eyebrows, but doesn't argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAfter Will is away, you go back in the house to gather some stuff for the morning's plan. That done, you announce that you've got some errands to run, and take the SUV in to Salopek. The lie is necessary because Martha doesn't like it when her husband goes in to work on the weekends, and he does his best not to. But every once in a while he has to, but will tell her he's going someplace else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill's truck isn't in the lot when you arrive, and you can't help snorting softly to see that he'll be at least five minutes late when he does get there. Up in your office you kill some time by working on some papers that you'd abandoned yesterday, and you're soon so absorbed in them that you don't hear your visitor until he's knocked. \"Mr. Prescott?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Caleb. How are you doing? Come in. Close the door.\" He obliges. \"Sit down.\" He sits. You hold his eye. \"Why the fuck was my son late for work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolls his eyes. \"He stopped to get donuts first,\" he says, and holds up a sack. \"Got enough to share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not on my diet. Now, about those items you made. Those masks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb bites on his grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know magic,\" you say as you lean back. \"And you don't either, and neither does my dad. It's a real pisser, 'cos that book's doing stuff we don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand it either, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already mentioned that fact.\" Caleb's grin fades a little at your words. \"We need to get some help. From a professional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyebrows quirk. \"Like who? David Copperfield? Penn and Teller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a couple of people in mind, but I want to start with someone, mm, small. Maybe learn just enough that we can then learn the rest on our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarm now shows in his face. \"You want to show this person the masks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I want to use a mask on them. Copy them and put it on a golem. Then they'll work for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Caleb's face has lost all its animation by now. \"So I guess you're not talking about using a mask on Cindy Vredenburg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you think she would know anything about this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Caleb's expression turns shifty. \"Uh. Maybe I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't. I was thinking of Braydon Delp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb jerks so hard he almost comes out of the chair. \"Delp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's into this stuff. More than we are. I've heard he knows about Tarot cards and stuff like that. And people gossip about him and what he\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's just a guy in high school! Like us! How about Morgana, Will, if you want\u2014? She's a girl at least, and\u2014\" He cuts himself off as you cock your head at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you what I want,\" you say. \"I get the impression Delp is real serious about this stuff, and I've heard him talk about Morgana and he doesn't think much of <i>her.</i>\" You frown as Caleb clucks his tongue. \"What were <i>you</i> planning to do with Morgana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Morgana? Nothing. But I was thinking we could\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you used any of those masks yet?\" you demand. \"Except on the Molester?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sinks in the chair. \"You mean besides him? And us? And your Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're not going to. Go home and put all that stuff you made in a duffel bag\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's at the clubhouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go to the clubhouse and put that stuff in a duffel bag, and go get Delp and bring him up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus! How am I supposed to do that? I hardly know him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're already taking out  your cell phone, and you swipe and tap into it while you talk. \"I'm sending you a jpeg,\" you say. \"You go find Delp, you show him the jpeg, you tell him the thing is up here at my office, and that he should come in to take a look at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Half of Caleb's face curls up into a quizzical smile. \"What is it? Porn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delp's kind of porn,\" you say as you hit \"Send.\" \"It's a picture of that book we're using to make masks. I snapped a photo of it before I came up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAfter Caleb has gone, you take the grimoire out of your briefcase\u2014it's been there the whole time, but you saw no reason to tell Caleb that\u2014and a few more items. These include a list of ingredients, and you go downstairs to do some shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way back you do a search of the complex until you find Sean Mitchell. \"What's Andy got you and Will doing?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Putting up new shutters on that storeroom,\" he tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Will's actually helping?\" You have a hard time imagining anyone of your bulk and frame being able to manipulate things of that size and weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean grins. \"Sure. He's keeping me company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt. \"Can you miss him for the next thirty minutes?\" you ask, and Sean shrugs. \"Send him up to my office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, there's a soft knock at your door. \"Come in, son,\" you say, and he enters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're struck by his appearance. Gone is that grinning rapscallion you sent away this morning when Caleb was wearing the mask. This kid is shy, tentative, and he looks at you with sidelong wariness. You frown. Is that really you? Or is it the golem? Is that \"kid\" you've been \"bonding with\" for the past few days really Caleb and not in any sense yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you catch him frowning in turn, you tell him to shut the door and take off his clothes. He pales, and asks if he has to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Worse and worse.</i> This is the golem of your {i]dad under there. It's under Caleb's control, but that's not what's worrying you. It's that you'll have to look at your dad's petrified form again when you make this switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the sooner you make it, the sooner you'll be past it. You gruffly repeat the order to strip, and when he's done you rip the mask off, like a band-aid off a wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe last stage of the comedy begins with a knock at your dad's office door. \"Come in,\" your dad calls, and he shoots you a querying look. You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb enters. \"Mr. Prescott?\" he says. \"I've got that friend I was telling you about who might, uh\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Come in, er, Braydon isn't it?\" Your dad stands and puts out a hand to his visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latter seems to have oozed in. Braydon Delp is a short, skinny, slump-shouldered slacker in dark jeans and a dark tee; hair clumsily cut into a fauxhawk and darkened with what looks like shoe polish; mascara on the lashes of his droopy eyes; and, in a contrast to the aura of black he's surrounded himself with, an abundance of silver around his neck, wrists and fingers. Even from across the room, you can tell that the handshake he gives your dad is as limp as a twice-boiled noodle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile pleasantries are made, you cross the room and kick the door shut. Caleb frowns at you when you snap your fingers at him; then understanding dawns in his eyes, and he unslings the bag from his shoulder and unzips it. You pull from it a blue mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraydon is bending over your dad's desk, studying the grimoire, when you grab him from behind and press the mask to his face. He sinks into your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Will!\" Caleb explodes. \"You could'a told me you were yourself again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just did.\" You've got enough of your dad still in your head that you've no time for foolery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" Caleb asks. \"I've got some of that paste I made. We can put it in Braydon's mask if we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we do, we'll use a batch I made after you left,\" you reply. \"I put it in my dad's mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut do you put yourself back under dad's mask, take over for Braydon, or let Braydon go and rely on the mask to tell you what you want to know?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You have just enough of your dad's mind inside yours to judge the thing to a fineness: Harris Prescott is not going to have enough time to study whatever books Braydon Delp has read, so you're going to have to do it from inside Delp. Caleb grumbles about it when you tell him what you're going to do. \"Always taking the good stuff for yourself, aren't you?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think <i>this</i> counts as 'good stuff',\" you retort as you yank off one of Braydon's Doc Martens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he has a girlfriend, doesn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gillian Kiefer, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm.\" You have a vague memory of seeing Braydon and a girl together. \"But that's not why I'm doing this.\" You pull off Braydon's other shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you start to unbutton his pants, you catch sight of your dad frowning at you from behind his desk. It gives you the briefest spasm of panic at being caught out by him before you remember yourself. \"Uh, Dad,\" you stammer, \"can you give us a little privacy?\" Even now, with him as an obedient golem, you can't bring yourself to order him around<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see it in his eyes and you hear it in Caleb's snicker: You asking for \"privacy\" as you strip another guy of his pants. Your face burns like a hot coal as your dad stalks out, and you turn your back on Caleb as you complete the job of stripping Braydon of his things. To cover your embarrassment, when you're done with that you snatch up the mask of yourself and start coating it with the \"golem goop\" that you made up while waiting for Caleb and Braydon to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb waits until you're almost done before making the laconic observation: \"So I suppose I'm not gonna be playing <i>you</i> anymore.\" That's when you realize that by coating your mask with stuff that will enslave it to your will, you have made it so that Caleb can't wear it anymore. You mutter a curse word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess not,\" you say. \"Well, if Braydon can hang out with me, he can hang out with you. And yes, you'll still get paid for what 'Will' does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb settles back in a chair with a contented sigh. \"It's a sweet life. Someone to do my work and give me his paycheck.\" You snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nTo save time, you're already out of your clothes and into Braydon's by the time the mask has reappeared on your classmate's face, and you waste no time dropping your modified mask onto him. You ought to feel guilty about imprisoning Braydon this way, but you don't. It's for the greater good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it's to help get your dad back. Even now, you're a little ambivalent about whether that's for the \"good\" of the universe or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter \"Will\" has dressed, you send him and Caleb out to join your dad while you lift Braydon's mask to your face. You feel very cold as you do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you feel very warm as the mask covers you with a sensation like hot syrup pouring over you and into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're cold again when you wake, though, and you sit up with a jerk. For a moment you are lost and confused, and you frown at the strange room you find yourself in. But is it strange? It also feels very familiar, and you're struck with deja vu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all floods back, and you know where you are. But still the sense of oddity lingers, for this office is a strange place to Braydon Delp, and now you are also him, on the inside and the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are also quite alone. But you're in no hurry to catch up to Caleb, so you lay back on the desk and blink at the ceiling a couple of times. You raise your hands and look at them. The fingers are long and white. Your forearms are white too, with black hairs that stand out against the pallor. You wriggle down inside your clothes, and pluck at your t-shirt thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your silver!</i> You sit up sharply. The jewelry is spread out on the desk next to you, but it's no longer a strange affectation. Each piece is meaningful, and it tells you its meaning as you pick them up and put them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver ring carved all about with intertwined pentagrams, which Braydon empowered the day of the summer solstice by heating it in a brazier over a bed of charcoal and a dead blackbird. According to <i>The Book of Balaam</i>, wearing it on your right index finger\u2014you slip it on there now\u2014increases your potency to command others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround your right wrist you wrap a silver chain, among the links of which are scattered disks into which are stamped the mystical letters (of five different alphabets) associated with Sol. Have Braydon's grades improved since wearing this charm meant to invoke the academical prodigies of the Sun? Maybe by a little ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver your head and about your neck and under your shirt you slip the polished bicycle chain Braydon stole off Ian Rush's bike his sophomore year. Ian was a senior, and a track star, and Braydon was sunk in envy of his athleticism. It was out of no mean desire to hurt Ian that he lifted the chain, however. According to Cornelius Agrippa, the virtues of one man may be communicated to another, like an infection, through an appropriate physical medium. Braydon lost interest in track soon thereafter, but he keeps the chain still, for he likes it as a decorative piece; and who knows, maybe one day he will discover the proper way to unlock that virtue of speed that Ian put in it all those days that he pedaled furiously to and from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're up now, and you stand and settle into your clothes. The grimoire you slide into the book bag that Braydon brought with him. From one of its pockets you take the bottle of mascara and step into the office lobby. Your dad looks back at you from the window he's staring out of, and does a double take. \"All yours again, Mr. Will's dad,\" you call softly back to him. His brow darkens, but he nods. You go looking for a bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face that looks back at you from the restroom mirror is thin and pale enough that very faint freckles stand out on your nose if you look closely enough. The heavy eyelids and down-sloping eyebrows give your large, hazel-colored eyes a slightly worried look even when you're relaxed. You darken your lashes with the mascara: not enough to look like a transvestite, but enough, with the died fauxhawk, to give you just the slightest androgynous look. You resettle your clothes and twist at the ring. Does it work? That's the thing about the magic that Braydon has tried: It does not <i>do</i> or grant anything that he does not, to some degree already, possess. It is only supposed to augment it, and so there is no obvious test that will confirm or disconfirm its efficacy. Braydon is acutely aware that he is playing with a theory that cannot be verified\u2014or even tested\u2014but tries to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you feel his hunger for magical power more sharply as you think of that grimoire: It certainly counts as <i>proof</i> that the \"magic\" he has tried invoking, and been roundly mocked for believing in, is <i>real.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat worried expression softens a little as you smile at yourself. <i>Time to go find Johansson, and to put Braydon's brain to work on that book.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"It's not about potions or wands or Latin catch-phrases,\" you tell Caleb when you're in the school basement. He's in an old, broken-down swivel chair; you're sitting on a desk. \"That's not what magic is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't?\" He raises his eyebrows and lifts the cover of the grimoire to flip through the pages. \"Then no wonder we fucked up, man. We been doing it wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile sourly. \"I'm just telling you what Braydon believes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then Braydon's a dipshit and you're wasting your time in that mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a recipe book we've got there,\" you explain, and pull the grimoire away from him. \"Braydon's got a bunch of them too, and there's nothing wrong with them. You find something that works, you write it down. But Braydon's all about finding the <i>principles</i> underneath the magic, like the way a chef finds the principles in back of how to cook a roast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that Braydon's analogy?\" Caleb chortles. \"Are you sure he's fucking Gillian? 'Cos that just sounds gay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, man. I'm trying to explain to you that magic is about making the elements do what you want. Figure out the elements, and we can figure out the spells. And if we can figure out the spells, then we can figure out what the <i>fuck</i> is going on with this one.\" You hold up the grimoire, and point to the gibberish-encrusted page that has you both stumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? So you have ideas about what's going on there, Houdini?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your tongue, not at the gibe\u2014though you and Braydon both are getting pretty tired of the way Caleb is riding you\u2014but because you don't have a ghost of an answer to give him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd because according to Braydon's preferred philosophy, real magic isn't even about the elements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Magic is about the soul,</i> he has written in his secret journal. <i>Only a special kind of soul is capable of discerning and using magic. A magician is a musician, and only those blessed with high and rare talent can practice it and develop their practice to the most perfect pitch.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrote that in a moment of boastfulness, and still believes it. The conceit has soured into fear and anxiety, however, as his various magical practices have yielded nullities. For it implies he hasn't got the kind of soul he thinks he should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb is still looking at you expectantly. Luckily, your phone dings just then with a message from Gillian. Which is a perfect excuse for getting away from him before you embarrass yourself further with Braydon's lack of real knowledge.</span></div></div>",

Gillian Kiefer is going to be a serious distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's already a serious distraction to Braydon Delp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, he doesn't think of her as a distraction. He thinks of her as the most wonderful thing in his life. But she really does like to keep him off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake the way she talks about him. Delp isn't her boyfriend. He's her \"hubby,\" and she talks to other people as though he and she are already married but are content to live apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's for the best. They <i>shouldn't</i> be moving in together, not while they're both still in high school, and maybe not for a couple of years yet, even if they do wind up attending the local university, as they both plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Gillian really is content to live apart from Braydon. And there are days when, if he doesn't go looking for her at school, he won't see her at all. Sometimes they never so much as exchange a text over a weekend. Well, Braydon will send her texts. She'll ignore them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she likes to flirt with other guys. Hard. She even goes on dates with them. Braydon has asked her if they have an \"open relationship.\" She only laughs and says that if he wants an open relationship he'll have to have it with girls not named Gillian because she won't stand for that. Once, when he got jealous of all the time she was spending with Aaron Flood, he asked her if she thought she got to have multiple SOs while he (Braydon) didn't. She just told him not to be sulky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then sometimes she will practically move in with him, not leaving his bedroom for hours and hours at a time, and giggling and playing with his ... appendages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sink back with a groan. Gillian really knows how to keep a guy entertained and feeling good, even without touching the magic spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she seems to have a gift for knowing when he wants to do some serious studying, particularly of the occult stuff, for that's when she likes to pounce and make him pay attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you've carved out an afternoon for yourself. Braydon hasn't got any homework, so you'll have five or more hours to start acquainting yourself with his library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThirty minutes after you get home, and are just settling in on Braydon's bed with a glass of OJ and a peanut-butter sandwich, the doorbell rings. You set your lunch aside with a sigh: Mrs. Delp is at work, and you're home alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGillian beams at you through the screen door when you answer the bell. \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me in? I notice your mom's not here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Let me in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unlatch the screen door. \"I thought we weren't meeting until six-thirty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we're meeting at six-thirty. But no one said anything about not meeting before then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGillian Kiefer is only slightly shorter than Braydon, and Braydon is pretty short as it is. She has soft brown hair that she wears in a bob that curls out just under her earlobes. She has chipmunk cheeks and pert lips that curve naturally into a secretive smile, and her brown eyes glint and glimmer with mischief. Her bare arms are downed with light brown hair, and her wrists are wrapped with flimsy leather friendship bracelets. She has the cutest little overbite that she likes to play up when she's feeling puckish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is obviously feeling very puckish now, for she has her hands clasped behind her back. \"When's your mom get off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five-thirty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plenty of time. You hanging out in your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Listen, Gillian\u2014\" You rub your forehead. It has gotten very hot where you're standing, like a blast furnace has opened up right behind you, and parts of you are getting rigid in a way that bodes ill for your willpower. \"I'm working on some stuff\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Homework? I can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want me to help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure, but\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So show me?\" She sways from side to side, like a little girl trying to tease her elders. \"I won't come in if you don't invite me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour resistance doesn't fold so much as it flops to the floor into a limp heap, like linen slipping off a clothesline. \"Come on.\" You pull her inside and close the door after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans against you, cradling her head on your shoulder, so you have to half support and half tug her toward the staircase. \"What are you working on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My books. You know the ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ever going to make me a love potion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need one for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly. There's a guy that I want to use it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stiffen, and not in a pleasant way. \"You don't need to use one on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, 'cos it's for another guy. I want him to be sadly, sadly in love with me,\" she goes on as you tense all over. \"I want him to be so sadly in love with me that he can't even eat. I want him to waste away, sighing and sighing until there's nothing left of him but a ghostly sigh that lingers in the air.\" You're upstairs now, and she hops into your bedroom and onto your bed. \"A sigh that lingers like a stain in the air over his bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is the guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't decided yet. But wouldn't it be poetical and tragical and romantical?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't feed <i>me</i> that kind of potion, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scrunches her nose, and does a double-take at your sandwich. \"You don't eat enough as it is.\" She picks it up and peels back the bread to study the insides, then starts eating it. \"I worry about you sometimes, Braydon,\" she mumbles around the peanut butter as she sits on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give my food rations to starving children. Karmic investment to counterbalance the black magic.\" You fall onto the bed next to her and stroke her calf. \"What are you gonna do while I read?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chews carefully, and swallows, and sucks on her teeth before answering. \"I could go down on you while you study. Would that help? It seems to me that having sex while studying black magic is a pretty natural combination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll onto your back with a groan. \"I really am pursuing a project, Gillian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this time is serious. It's for someone else. They want me to do some research for them.\" It's the only way you can think of to maybe give you some space and time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's confidential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true. They don't want me\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come? Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"Just some guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone turns sour and skeptical. \"You're not an expert on this stuff, Braydon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more of an expert than anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are they asking you about, and how come you can't tell me who it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You</i> should be embarrassed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a couple of guys from school. They found this book and they want to know what it's all about, so they asked me to read it and explain it to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What book? Is it this one?\" She picks up the paperback\u2014Van Dunkel's <i>Elements of Natural Magic</i>\u2014that you were starting to peruse. \"This is yours, Braydon, I've seen you with it a hundred times\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It overlaps with this other book. This other one is, like, more advanced or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Well, how much are they paying you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paying?\" You blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God, Braydon! You're not doing someone else's work for free are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting something out of it too! This other book, it's got stuff in it that's\u2014!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, <i>I</i> need to get paid, if it's going to be worth my time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your time?\" You can only gape like a landed fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat chipmunk smile flashes onto her face. \"Sure! I'm going to help you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nShe's finally exasperated you enough that you force her off your bed and out of your bedroom. \"I said I was going to meet you at six-thirty, Gillian, and I'm going to meet you at six-thirty,\" you tell her at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really have to buckle down on this stuff. I'll have homework next week, and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you love me anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull her to yourself long enough to kiss her while fondling her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you more than ever,\" you say when you let go of her. \"So why don't you go make me jealous or something with another guy while I do this? That way we can both be mad at each other.\" You push her gently away and shut the door on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot till you're halfway up the stairs do you realize what you just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not until you're inside the bedroom do you wonder if maybe you should put Caleb on \"distract Gillian\" duties. He keeps talking about wanting to do something with masks and girls.</span></div></div>",

But he just grins at you and makes no move toward opening his back pack. You sigh. \"Come on, man, I'm up against a time limit here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" he replies, still grinning. \"Who's it for? You said you'd tell me when I got out here with it, and now I'm here so out with the rest of it. Who's the mask for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, you could lie to Caleb and tell him it's for Braydon's mother or his aunt or Christian Knouse\u2014one of Braydon's RPG-playing friends\u2014or for Mr. Walberg or for any other number of people. Anyone less embarrassing than who it is actually for. But Caleb would figure it out sooner or later, probably, and then you'd be both embarrassed and busted. So\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for Gillian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it! Ha!\" It hardly seems possible, but Caleb's grin gets even wider. \"She not putting out for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she is. Which is why I thought of you and how you keep trying to get into a mask of a girl. I thought <i>you'd</i> like to put it on and spend your time <i>not</i> sucking me off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's grin fades only a little, though his eye hardens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, Will, but you don't need <i>me</i> for that, 'specially when you asked me to bring along that golem goop you made for yourself. Come on, let me in, and we'll talk about how you're gonna turn Gillian Kiefer into your love slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step aside. Just inside the foyer is the formal dining room (never used) and Caleb unloads the goods onto the cherry-wood table: a blank mask with attached mind band, a tub of golem sealant, and a brush. \"Where's your mom?\" he asks as he looks around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Braydon's mom? At work. You can go now. Thanks again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going anywhere, Will.\" Caleb pulls another blank mask from his satchel and drops it with a clatter on the table. He folds his arms. \"Let's talk about who <i>else</i> you're going to copy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nGillian smiles at you from under a squint as you enter Besandwitched with Caleb in tow. \"Oh, aren't you sweet,\" she says as she gently pushes you back and grabs Caleb by the elbow. \"And I didn't bring <i>you</i> anything.\" She pulls your best friend into the booth beside her. Caleb turns a little pale as she puts her arm in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return Gillian's scrunched-up smile with a tight one of your own. \"Pop quiz,\" you say as you drop into the booth opposite them. \"What's his name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's whose name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His.\" You point at Caleb. \"The guy you're feeling up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGillian pauses, the resumes rubbing Caleb's arm. She peers into his face with a chipmunk smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend swallows. \"Caleb,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's adorable,\" Gillian tells you. \"Is he one of the guys you're working for? He says they're shy and easy to embarrass,\" she continues, addressing Caleb again. \"Are you shy and easy to embarrass?\" She rubs him harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gillian's the reason I'm gonna have a hard time getting that reading done,\" you tell Caleb. \"She likes to get in the way.\" Gillian sticks her tongue out at you. \"So let's talk about who we're going to get to distract <i>her.</i>\" You pause. \"Hey, Ursula.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last is addressed to the waitress, who has materialized and is standing at your elbow without introducing herself. You give her only a flick of a glance before adding, \"Just some water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I want one of your fancy coffees,\" Gillian says. Into Caleb's ear she says, very audibly, \"Get whatever you want, my hubby is buying.\" Caleb murmurs, \"Water,\" and Ursula leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's this plot you guys are hatching?\" Gillian asks. \"Braydon <i>never</i>\"\u2014 she shows you her teeth\u2014\"tells me to fuck off when he's working on something, so it must be really evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two projects,\" you tell her. \"The really evil one, and the one to distract you while we work on the evil one. That's the one I'd really like your help with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGillian again makes a face at you. You answer by hooking your foot into hers under the table. She resists, then relents and lets you pull her foot into your lap. You untie and pull off her shoe and massage her foot inside the sock. She slides down a little in her seat, but continues to knead Caleb's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour best friend, meanwhile, is sitting up very straight, and gives the impression that he's a rocket eager to escape the launch pad for someplace else\u2014anyplace else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you hang out with when you're not bothering me?\" you ask Gillian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just shrugs. \"If you don't want my help, Braydon, I won't force it on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't reply, but you can tell by the tightening around her eyes that you're pissing her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to shake you off, honestly. It's just that these guys have a project\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What project? And why do I have to keep asking you that?\" Gillian squeezes Caleb's hand. Caleb's face shows surprise\u2014and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I keep telling you it's just some\u2014 You see what I'm up against,\" you tell Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should show her,\" he blurts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's something you can show me?\" Gillian coos. \"Sounds fascinating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide out of the booth and gesture to Gillian. \"Hold things down here,\" you tell Caleb. \"Tell Ursula I want a number eight, no pickles. Gillian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have half of what you're having,\" Again, you give Caleb a look that says, <i>See what I have to put up with?</i> Gillian herself answers by stepping on your foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back seat,\" you tell her when you're outside and at your car. She looks puzzled, but slides in as you hold the door for her. \"Scoot over, the thing's in the bag in the foot well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here?\" She grabs at the satchel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me get it out.\" You crawl in after her. She giggles, and grabs your head long enough to bite at your ear. \"It's this thing,\" you tell her as you take out the blank mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes light up. \"Oooh! Looks fascin\u2014!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's all she gets out. You push her hands down and jam the mask at her face. She just has time to flinch before it rams home, true and hard, and vanishes into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, she holds a rigid pose. Then her head flops back, cracking against the car window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, close the door behind you, and snuggle up close to her with your arm around her shoulders. You pull her head close and press her face into your neck. She smells good, and with your free hand you fondle her breasts. You kiss her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cock stiffens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dammit, even unconscious she is a </i>huge<i> distraction.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for ten minutes you rest there with her, feeling yourself get excited all over. And as you rub her and stroke her, it occurs to you that it would make you very happy if you <i>had</i> her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your phone wakes up, and with a grunt and grimace you pull it out. The text is from Caleb: <i>so who for me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhang on and let me think</i>, you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's actually no shortage of people that Caleb could step in for: Gillian, despite her \"goth\" proclivities, is a very vivacious and sociable girl with a wide set of acquaintances. Girls in the marching band and orchestra, girls in the chorales (Gillian was in them her junior year), some of the girls on the swim team and volleyball teams. And she's friends with lots of the juniors as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo pick the right one of those, though, would probably require getting into her head. There are, however, a couple of girls who might work for your present needs even if they are not friends of Gillian's. Caleb unintentionally raises the first possibility when he pokes you with the alert, <i>coffees here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Braydon, Ursula\u2014your waitress\u2014is into the occult. Of course she is, since she works at Besandwitched, which has pentagrams and astrological symbols painted on its walls. Giving Caleb her brain while you run Braydon's could help your research efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrouble is that Ursula doesn't attend Westside. She goes to Eastman, which means you'd only be able to get together with her/Caleb outside of school. Then, too, you're not sure how much she knows about anything useful: Braydon has the impression that she's only into the crystals and mumbo-jumbo and has almost no grounding in actual theory or practice. And that's the third strike against her: She and Braydon just don't like each other very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou doubt Caleb would be much interested in an alternate possibility: Morgana Hollis, another girl with an interest in the occult, but one who goes to Westside. She's a dumpy and unattractive thing. And yet, spitefully, you find yourself attracted to the idea of forcing her upon him as revenge for his making himself into a nuisance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut probably Caleb wants someone from among the few girls that you and he know. In fact, you're sure he's thinking of the four cheerleaders who sometimes talk to you because they're friends with Jenny Ashton.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To answer Caleb's question\u2014<i>who for me?</i>\u2014you're going to have to get inside Gillian Kiefer's head. But the parking lot of Besandwitched\u2014which fronts onto Grant Boulevard\u2014is not the place to pull off a bodyswitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>get fod to go,</i> you text him back. <i>pay u bac meet at school.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's not until later, when you're pulling into the Westside student parking lot, that you realize that you should have been clearer about which school you meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we doing here?\" Gillian asks from the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at her in the rearview mirror as you shut off the engine. \"Did I say you could talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you just meant, you know, on the drive over,\" she says. She wears a very vexed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reply annoys you\u2014and, in truth, frightens you\u2014enough that you ask her, \"Who has to do exactly what I say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" she says. \"But\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then don't argue,\" you interrupt, and she claps her mouth shut with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's a relief. At the same time, you don't much enjoy it. Though you're glad to see Gillian Kiefer for once docilely doing what you ask of her, you have to admit that you'll miss the teasing, the goading, the arguing that Braydon is used to getting from her, and which is part of the huge turn on that he has for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that you, as Braydon Delp now, have for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around as you get out of the car. There are a couple of cars parked up next to the gym, which worries you. Those will belong to the jocks, who will be up in the fabled \"fuck room\" over the gym. You've parked in the farthest corner of the lot from them, and you doubt they'll come down to investigate or to hassle you. But you can never tell about these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the trunk you fetch a heavy blanket, and Gillian's eyes go wide as you clamber into the back seat with it. For a moment it looks like she's going to speak or even argue, but she keeps still, though she shrinks back a little from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd, that. She doesn't normally flinch from Braydon. But then, she doesn't normally find herself tongue-tied at his behest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's on account of the mask, of course. She's not really Gillian Kiefer anymore; she's a golem. The mask came out of her while you were still parked at Besandwitched, and after getting your \"golem goop\" into it you pasted it back onto her face. The resulting golem picked up exactly where the real Gillian had left off, but to her own astonishment she'd clammed up when you told her to be quiet and stay still in the back seat while you went up front and drove off, leaving her car back at the restaurant. Now it's time to complete a transformation, at least long enough for you to figure out where to put Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw the blanket over Gillian and tuck it around her; when she pulls it off her head, you push it back over her. \"I need you to get out of your things, Gillian,\" you tell her. \"Take your clothes off, sweetheart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groans, and the blanket writhes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you? Well, you hadn't thought through this next part completely, and you cast a wary eye at the gym first. But while Gillian is still disrobing, you pull off your shoes and unbutton everything. \"Keep the blanket over your head,\" you tell Gillian. \"Keep quiet. Try to go to sleep.\" It would be nice, you reflect, if she actually did go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause that's what you're about to do. You grab your face by the brow, murmur a string of nonsense syllables, and pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<i>where r u?</i> is the text that greets you when you wake with a groan and a grimace. You blink at it stupidly before you remember where and who you are again. Without thinking, you reach under the blanket to grab Gillian's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bites you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you nurse your fingers, the blanket falls off her, and Gillian blinks at you in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the\u2014?\" She looks around. \"Where's my hubby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Gillian,\" you snap. \"I'm in disguise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasps. Then to your immense annoyance, she bursts out laughing. You lunge for her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she bats you away. \"No, seriously, Will,\" she says. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased as you are to see that she knows your name even if she doesn't know Caleb's, you're made wary by her resistance. \"Who's your boss, Gillian?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes go wide, and her laughing smile fades. \"You are,\" she says. She looks you up and down. \"You're my\u2014 <i>Braydon?\"</i> she gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" you tell her. \"It's me. I told you, I'm in disguise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did you\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh! Just be quiet, Gillian. You'll understand everything in a minute. You'll understand everything, because <i>I</i> understand everything. And in a minute\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice turns ragged as you grasp her forehead. Her eyes flutter shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a minute, I'll <i>be</i> you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it's a cheesy line, but it gives you a thrill to utter anyway. The mask comes away in your hand, leaving a sleeping Gillian behind. If she woke now she wouldn't know where she was or how she got there, and she certainly wouldn't be happy to find herself naked\u2014even if under a blanket\u2014in the back seat of her boyfriend's car with Will Prescott, even if he is dressed like her \"hubby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you quickly press Braydon's mask onto her. You'd slopped some of the \"golem goop\" into it before setting out to meet her at Besandwitched, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraydon's face appears where hers had been, with a muzzy and puzzled expression on it. His eyes sharpen when he does a double-take at you, though. You let him look you up and down, as Gillian had done, and he peers under the blanket at his state of undress. \"Um,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start stripping. \"So what do you think is going on?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe presses his lips shut, and waits until you're disrobed before speaking. \"If I had to guess,\" he says, \"I'd say that there's some kind of switch-off happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it exactly,\" you tell him. \"Now, you give me that blanket and you get dressed.\" You shove his shirt and pants at him. \"Then text Caleb back and tell him we're on our way, and drive us out to the old elementary school in Acheson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are briefly interested to note that, although you knew everything that was going on in Braydon's head while you were using the mask, the mask doesn't appear to have picked up anything that you knew or were planning. But there'll be time enough to think about that later, if it continues to be interesting. \"Use Google Maps,\" you tell him as you pull the blanket around yourself. Once you're comfortable, you pull Gillian's mask out, and with a gulping breath push it to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe world is softly vibrating when you wake. It's also dark and closed in. But it's warm too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mm.</i> You like this blanket. It smells like Braydon. You smile and snuffle in a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world seems to make a left turn, and it vibrates harder. A moment later it stops, and the vibrations cease. So too does the sound of a motor. You throw the blanket off and frown at the roof of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Braydon's car, and you're not shocked. It must be Braydon behind the wheel. What the hell is going on with him? First he's all mysterious with you, then he starts ordering you around\u2014and you go along with it!\u2014and then he's turning himself into a copy of Will Prescott? <i>It's like something out of a dream!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even as you savor the delicious feeling of mystery, you sigh as the mystery dissipates, like a vapor under a strong sun. A car door opens, and Braydon says, \"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" That's Caleb, indulging his impatient honk. \"Where the fuck were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out at the school. Westside. Switching around, apparently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Switching? Switching with\u2014? What the\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up with a grunt, wrapping the blanket around your bust. Caleb jumps back from the car a couple of feet, his eyes bugging out. \"Tell him it's me,\" you order your hubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Gillian,\" Braydon calls out to Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no thtat!\" You whack at your hubby's head, but only manage to hit the headrest. \"Tell him it's Will, I changed places with Gillian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gillian says to tell you it's Will,\" Braydon calls out, sounding tired. \"He changed places with Gillian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb, still hunched over, advances a few wary steps. \"Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You sigh and push your bangs out of your eyes. \"Get up front with Braydon. Oh, you bring that sandwich?\" Caleb brandishes a brown paper bag. \"Great. Braydon will take his half and I'll take mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, man,\" Caleb chortles after he's crawled into the car and shut it. \"I didn't know you were going to go all the way with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny. But I don't know for how long,\" you reply as you take half of the paper-wrapped sandwich he's extended you. \"I'm just in here long enough to figure out where we can put you. Mask-wise, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" Caleb's breathing sounds very loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a bite of the sandwich, and chew it very long and slowly, and you swallow it before answering. \"It'll take me awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb groans. \"Come on, Will! You're having all the fun! It's my turn now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just take another bite of the sandwich. And another. And another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another. Caleb slams his face into the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Monday,</i> you want to tell him. <i>I'll tell you Monday, and I'll try to get it arranged for you by Tuesday.</i> That's how much you want to punish him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could just give him one of the most recent three names to show up in Gillian's text messages. You take out your phone and open them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Interesting,</i> you think as you thumb down them.</span></div></div>",

Not that those two things have anything to do with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you don't have a social life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do now.\" You dimple at your best friend and pull out Gillian's phone. \"Let's get you one too. She's got lots of boyfriends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you want, Caleb?\" You suck the last of your sandwich out of your teeth as, with a delicately poised fingertip you scroll through Gillian's many, many contacts. \"You wanna be a cute girl like me? Then either you're gonna have to have a hubby\u2014like me\u2014or you're gonna have lots of guys getting up close to you and touching you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's remarkable how much noise a teenage boy can make when he <i>slumps</i> really hard into his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSusie is so sociable that of course you're unable to get her out to see you on a Saturday night, and in her texts back she keeps goading you to bring Braydon out to the party where she's hanging out. But you decline and send Caleb home with the promise that you'll get Susie for him on Sunday afternoon. Braydon drives you back to Besandwitched to pick up Gillian's car. You really ought to switch masks with Braydon, and return home to do some work\u2014the reason you turned Gillian into a golem, after all, was to give yourself some breathing space to get work done. But you'd just have to turn yourself into Gillian again tomorrow\u2014wouldn't you?\u2014so it seems easiest to go home and spend the night as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Braydon's being a butt-head,\" you airily announce as you enter Gillian's house to be met with stares of surprise from her mother and father, who are cuddled up watching television. \"I'll be in my room, see you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kiefers live in a house that built back in the early '70s by builders who apparently tried to mate the hippie and Brady Bunch aesthetics. The owners who came after have tried softening the hard edges\u2014replacing mustard-yellow and vomit-green colors  with whites and grayish-blonde woods. But there are still some kooky design choices, like the three porthole-shaped windows looking into the back yard, and the three-foot-high door that opens onto a hobbit-sized passageway connecting her bedroom to her parents'. (Like, WTF is that?) Her bed has no headboard but is instead shoved into an alcove formed by an arch-shaped book case. As you grimace at it you can't help thinking that a bedroom like this couldn't help warping the person who slept in it, and that maybe that's how come Gillian turned out so funky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh you flop onto the bed with its heavy, homemade quilt\u2014navy blue and snowy white; \"Sailor Moon,\" Braydon calls it\u2014and squeeze up into the cubbyhole formed by the bookcases. You waggle your toes. You are suddenly very conscious of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are wearing a heavy peasant skirt with lots of pleats and ruffles and folds, and a sleeveless blouse. You rub your bare arms and hike up one leg to cross the ankle over a raised knee. You make a face at your white calf. Gillian certainly isn't fat, and she doesn't think of herself as fat, but she is covered all over with soft baby fat, and she does think of her calves as chunky. Her arms, too, have no tone, and their flesh flaps and jiggles a little. Her fingers are short, and when you cup your face in your palms there is a lot of cheek to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she is so tender, and so sensitive, and Braydon knows <i>exactly</i> how hard to nibble and bite and suck in a way that gives Gillian little whirlpools of excitement under her skin. You hug yourself and think of your hubby and irritably wonder why he was being such a butt-munch this afternoon when you only wanted to cuddle and play and stroke and tease him into making you feel good all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know the answer to that question, of course, but still pout over it as you peel off your sandals and rub your feet. They're small with stubby toes, and you make a face at them and at the green nail polish on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open up your blouse and loosen your skirt and sprawl on the bed with a sigh. You still can't quite bring yourself to molest yourself in your new body, though you can think of lots of delightful things to do with your fingers and boobs and other pieces and parts. You give some thought to taking a bath\u2014Gillian loves a good bubble bath\u2014but that would be too much of a hasty plunge. Instead, you slowly work at and burrow into yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you've got the blouse open, for instance, you spend some time running fingertips delicately your bra. Gillian has enormous breasts, though not so big and sloppy as to be gross, and they warm and tingle as you gently squeeze them. You unzip the skirt and cast it aside to stroke and smooth a creamy thigh. You twist on the bed, digging into it with your hips and shoulder blades until, impatient with the final encumbrances, you flop over to grab and grasp at the bra, peeling it off. You cross your right arm beneath them in support while clasping your left bra. They prickle in the air, and you peer down with a smile at their rosy tips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise in the rest of the house reminds you of your exposed position, so you sit up and pull the sheets and blankets back on the bed, then pad into the bathroom to fill the tub with water. There you pull off the rest of your clothes and change into a short, belted kimono. You lean against the sink and peer at yourself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face is round and soft and a little doughy when slack, but a smile is all it take sot transform into something toothsome. Gillian's dad still calls her \"dumpling,\" and there is something delectable about the way her cheeks both fill out and dimple when she smiles. But it's a mischievous smile, too, one that can't help show a little flash of teeth behind it. You pat at the soft, dark bangs of your bob, then brush it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathwater is very warm when you slide into it, and you shiver all over as it touches your tits. You didn't put any bath crystals or bubbles into, so it's just you, and with only your toes and knees breaching the surface as you sink down so that your chin touches the waterline. You grip your inner thighs and pull gently at them, and tease at the bush to let the water in. Slowly, a bit at a time, your fingertips dig more deeply in, rubbing and stroking and relaxing and stimulating ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething turns loose, but it's not the fabled female orgasm. It goes deeper than that, as though a fault line has slipped and all the bones and sinews of your body have shifted and settled and submerged under a warm, inundating sea. A deep groan fills you, and you suddenly hunger for a mouth to close over yours, and for a tongue to suck on. <i>Braydon, why aren't you here?</i> ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a short sigh and a quick, vigorous rub, you give up on pleasuring yourself, and let your body steep in the bath water, filling it from the steaming tap whenever it turns tepid. You have pruned all over, and your hair has lost its bounce when you come out. You dry yourself slowly all over with a flannel towel, then put your kimono back on and clamber into bed. You answer a few texts from friends who are wondering why you're not at any parties with them, then before it's even eleven o'clock, you change into PJs, put out your lights, and amuse yourself by watching some random videos on your phone. When you feel your eyes sinking back in your head, you lay your phone aside and go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSaturday was drizzly and cool, and Sunday continues to be cool as well, but at least the sun comes out from behind the rain-fattened clouds. There are Pillsbury cinnamon rolls for breakfast and KFC for lunch, so there's a reason Gillian isn't the trimmest girl in school. But you don't partake of much of it, so there's a reason she's only soft and not plump all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not until after one that Susie finally responds to your texts telling her that she should hang out with you and Braydon and \"this other guy.\" <i>eyah who?</i> she wants to know. Yu reply, <i>trust me he wants to be into you.</i> You smirk at your clever play on \"into\" until you realize it could be taken in just a really dumb sexual way. But if the innuendo causes Susie to raise an eyebrow, she doesn't show it when you meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this nice? Like a little suburban oasis?\" you ask her when you meet at the old Acheson Elementary School. You and Susie and Braydon are strolling through the playground. The old building rears up on one side, but suburban houses overlook the park from the other three directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just an old school,\" she says. You smile at her but don't argue as you pull Braydon closer to your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie is Hawaiian, which means she has an Asian cast to her features without looking like she just got off a plane from Tokyo. Her face is flat with high cheekbones. She has a nice, wide smile that lifts all of her features, and her face is framed by long, silky brown hair that falls in gentle waves halfway to her elbows. You're dressed down in sweat pants and windbreaker, but she's in a maroon sweater and dark jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There he is,\" you say as Caleb's car pulls into the lot. You smile to yourself as your gawky, geeky friend untangles himself from behind the wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Susie moans. \"Not him!\"</span></div></div>",

But you have him for English, don't you? Yes, when you're being Will Prescott you and Caleb have the same English class. So that means\u2014doesn't it?\u2014that you have Susie in English. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Yeah</i> You knew she seemed familiar when you suggested her to Caleb, but you just put it down to Gillian's memories, not your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while you're musing on all this, Susie has started edging away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, you need to fuck up this scene before it gets even more awkward. \"Braydon?\" you call to your hubby, who has been loitering nearby. \"You can do that thing now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your hubby drops the backpack and unzips it, you loosely grasp Susie's wrists and smile in her face,. \"I'm sorry, Susie,\" you tell her, \"I didn't know you had a problem with him.\" But before she can reply, Braydon reaches around from behind and presses a mask into her face. You and he catch her as she crumples to the ground, pulling all of you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb runs up with his mouth hanging open. \"Jesus! What are you doing this thing out here where everyone can see? You should'a got her in the basement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, sweetie.\" You brush a lock of hair from your face. \"Don't try running the show unless you know what's going on. Apparently, Susie knows you're a pervert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're always staring at her Ms. Gladstone's class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not! I don't even know who she is!\" He steps back and stares down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Susie, your new identity, you perv, and we've got her in English. We've got her in Calculus, too, now that I remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb frowns at the stricken girl. \"Sit down,\" you tell him. \"Let's make it look like a picnic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Caleb says after he's squatting around the unconscious Susie. \"Right, we do have her in those classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can confess now that you're a pervert who eye fucks her when\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says?\" Caleb demands. \"Did she say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't say that,\" golem-Braydon interrupts. It's just about the first time he's spoken since picking you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Braydon, sweetie.\" You cup his chin in your  hand and kiss him. \"Mommy's talking. I only know what she told you, Caleb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm eye-fucking anyone in Gladstone's class,\" he grumbles, \"it's Andrea Varnsworth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. So does Susie sit between you and Andrea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck if I know, I only notice Andrea.\" He frowns at Susie, then shrugs. \"Eh, I guess she'll do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll <i>have</i> to do. If she wakes up and she isn't you, she's going to be a very unhappy girl. You got your mask and the golem stuff?\" Caleb pats the satchel hanging from his shoulder. \"Good.\" You look around and smile brightly at the day and at your friends. \"This is fun, we should do it more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBraydon cradles Susie's head in his lap while you check your phone for texts. Danielle Davis is talking about a giant pizza-and-a-movie thing (but without volunteering her place) and Emma Witkin wants to know if anyone is up for a thing at the river, on account of yesterday's rains ruined that location for a Saturday night thing. You like both ideas, and you show them to Caleb, but he only shrugs and bobs and swivels his head while watching the nearby houses with bulging eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the mask comes out of Susie. You watch from under lowered brows as Caleb fumbles the golem stuff into it. He makes it a sloppy affair, almost certainly on account of nerves. When he's done, you pull it from his grasp and yourself set it on Susie, as Caleb would likely jab her in the lip or eye with a sharp corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb,\" you tell him as Susie opens her eyes and looks around with puzzlement. \"Tell her not to talk or scream, and to follow you out to the basement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his jaw just hangs open and his eyes bug out as Susie scoots back from him. \"Gillian,\" she stammers, \"what the hell\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, you better do something,\" you murmur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gyuh?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie scrambles to her feet. Losing all patience, you kick Caleb in the ribs. \"Ow!\" he yells. \"Quit it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't yell at me, yell at her, your new\u2014 Oh, shit! There she goes!\" And sure enough, Susie has gone sprinting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muh?\" Caleb says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her to stop, you moron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call her by name, you fucking\u2014!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie! Stop!\" Caleb yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie trips and falls. Caleb, like a gooney bird trying to take flight, galumphs over to where she sprawls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I love about you, sweetie,\" you tell Braydon who has been watching Caleb's contretemps with a smirk. \"You come when I call and stay when I tell you.\" You nuzzle at his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Caleb says to the Susie-golem manages to work, for both of them, looking nervous and aghast, stumble off toward the basement door. You watch until they disappear. Then, as there won't be any excitement for awhile, you hook an arm around Braydon and pull him down to the grass. \"Pay attention to me,\" you tell him. \"All over.\" He obliges while you graze on his hair and watch the basement door over the crown of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe five minutes pass before a figure appears: Caleb, looking as distracted and embarrassed as when he vanished under the school. You raise up with a frown, but after flashing you a sour look he lopes over to his car and gets in. He has some trouble starting it, it looks like, but after it roars to life he turns around and drives slowly away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Susie doesn't come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she doesn't come out, and she doesn't come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're on the verge of mounting a rescue mission when the door finally opens. Susie Lekuawehe, in her burgundy sweater and tight jeans and leather boots, and her hair draping softly around her shoulders, comes out and pulls the door shut. She looks around, and advances on you with the gait of one who is trying to navigate in bare feet a floor scattered with fish hooks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl!\" you call out to her, but she winces. \"What's wrong?\" She doesn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes long enough reaching you that you have plenty of time to notice how clumsily she wobbles on her feet. She also twists about, as though trying to get comfortable in her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb?\" you say as she comes up, and \"Yeah,\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie?\" you prompt, and \"I guess,\" she mutters back. With a sigh and another wince she lower herself to the grass. She digs through her hair with long fingers. \"What's wrong?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing?\" But still she frowns, and pulls at the front of her sweater. She flushes as she accidentally tweaks a boob. (And a fine, large cluster they are, too.) \"Just taking awhile to get used to things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you want to do tonight?\" You pull Braydon up so that you can sit in his lap with your arms dangled about his neck. \"So who did you make out with last night?\" you ask when she doesn't answer. \"So you can find someone new or else go back for seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh at your tease, but Susie shoots you a dirty look. \"What's wrong?\" you ask. \"Just because Susie thinks you're a creep\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she?\" Susie bursts out. \"'Cos I don't know <i>what</i> she thinks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nCaleb's expostulation surprises you, but it doesn't alarm you when he goes on to say that he hasn't got <i>any</i> of Susie's memories. \"Maybe you should just relax,\" you suggest, and shrug when he asks how long it took for you to get into Braydon's and Gillian's and your dad's memories, because they seem to have come to you instantly. For a quarter hour you tease him while he looks around with a grumpy expression on Susie's very pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after twenty minutes, at the end of which he professes not to remember a goddamn thing about her\u2014such as her birthday, address, family, or classes\u2014you become alarmed enough to suggest something has gone wrong with the mask. It's an awful sight when you pull the mask off Caleb, leaving him inside Susie's clothes, but the inside of the mask looks okay: SUSAN KIRA LEKUAWEHE. It has golem goop inside it, so you can't get in to check it out yourself, but you pull at Braydon's face\u2014revealing Gillian\u2014and pop Susie's mask onto her long enough to confirm that golem-Susie knows all about Susie's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go home if I don't know where I live!\" Caleb exclaims after he's fitted out in Susie's mask again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know where she lives,\" you assure him. \"That's not a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I mean!\" For a minute you think he's going to hit you. \"I mean, if I don't have her memories, if I don't know how to act like her\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we keep you out of her house,\" you say, and you dig through Susie's purse after her phone. \"That's not a problem either. Susie's never home that much anyway.\" Caleb reaches for the phone, but you pull it away. You ignore the texts that are piling up to send one to her mom: <i>What tiime u need me home?</i> \"If it's still a problem tonight,\" you tell him, \"you'll just have to go home as yourself and send the golem home for Susie instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking this awfully well, Will,\" Caleb says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my problem,\" you retort. \"Besides, Gillian's good at not panicking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, it looks like plans are piling up: Danielle Davis has got commitments for a small party at her place, but others like the sound of a thing down by the river. Whatever you do, though, you don't want to leave Caleb to fend for himself.</span></div></div>",

You stroke Susie's bangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's very pretty,\" Braydon agrees, but he's looking everyplace but at you and Caleb as he says it. <i>He's so cute when he's embarrassed!</i> you think. But you dismiss him with a firmer order to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think I'm so pretty,\" Caleb grumbles, \"maybe you and me should go off and have a party by ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle. \"That would be fun, but I want to see if you can swim. That's what you're supposed to do with someone, right? Throw them in the deep end? If you <i>have</i> to act like Susie, maybe that'll get you acting like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2014!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But nothing. Come on, you drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYour destination is a long strip of low riverbank on Mohegan River. It's a grassy stretch with the gurgling river on one side and a fringe of trees on the others, where kids like to park and party and make out. Susie moans all the way out, which gets on your nerves until you snap at her to \"stop acting like Johansson.\" She gets very quiet after that, which isn't much better, since Susie is a bubbly, voluble girl who <i>loves</i> to flirt and tease and laugh and joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are a lot of cars when you arrive, for there's a mile or more of places to park, and lots of people have apparently had the same idea about a Sunday hangout after the rains of Saturday. But finally you spot the cars of the people you're looking for, and tell Susie to squeeze in next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's impossible to tell where this party stops and the next-door parties start, as they're all clumps of people strung out along the bank with beers and colas, some standing and others leaning against or sitting atop cars. As Susie pulls into a space, Eric Harlen waves at you without dropping his other arm from around Rebecca Sykes. Tim Gerard is standing in a circle with Brianna Kirschke and Dean Stratton; he's talking intently, and he makes a face every time Dean puts his cigarette to his lips. Jack Li and Wendy Terrill are guarding a Styrofoam chest while Eric Murphy, Tim Ryan and Jason Church crouch around the hibachi, arguing intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in and among these wander couples with their arms around each other: Parker Stott and Kristin Townes; Andrew Harding and Brianna Gould; Lee Reynolds and Katie Byrd; Spencer Osbourne and Emma Witkin; Gabriel Diaz and Fatima Zahedi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGillian's antennae quiver at the sight of some of these. <i>Spencer and Emma? Interesting! Gabriel and Fatima? No! Really? OMG!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie grabs your wrist. \"I don't know <i>any</i> of these people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you do. These are your best friends. They know {i]all about you, Susie.\" You titter into your hand. \"All your secrets and dreams and crushes and hideous embarrassments.\" You titter again at the horrified face Susie turns on you. \"So you better get your game on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will!\" Susie hisses, but with a laugh you're out of the car and running over to Eric and Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to hide me from Susie,\" you gasp at them. \"She's in a weird mood!\" You put them between you and your advancing friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two dykes just need to do it with each other,\" Eric chortles. \"Break the sexual tension once and for all.\" Rebecca slaps him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where's Braydon?\" Tim calls at you. \"I got a story I want him to read.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of yours?\" You push Eric at Susie (who has run up) and dart off to join Gerard and his two friends. \"Is there anything to eat?\" you ask them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chips and pretzels. Yeah, I wrote it last Friday, it's got a black magician in it and I wanna see what Braydon thinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Braydon doesn't like it when people write about warlocks, he thinks everyone's prejudiced against them. Tell your story to Susie, she'd love to hear it.\" You jump away as Susie catches up, and snatch the joint from Spencer's fingers as you pass. You take a short hit, return it to him, and tell him to share it with Susie, who is still pursuing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the line you go in this way. At the hibachi you ask about the bratwurst they're cooking, and when Tim bluntly asks you for a contribution you tell them to talk to Susie, as she's paying for everything today on account of you won a bet with her. You ask Brianna about her tiger-print jacket while secretly rolling your eyes at the bad henna dye she's given herself. (No professional could have possibly left her hair looking so limp and lifeless). You ask Katie what Gabriel and Fatima are doing together; she tells you it's because Fatima is mad at someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie finally corners you at the far end of the gauntlet, and Parker and Kristin watch with glinting eyes as she drags you back behind a Jeep so you can have a quiet consultation. It took Caleb almost ten minutes to catch up to you because he kept getting snagged by the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you snicker. \"Did anyone figure out you're a fake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do this,\" she whines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can. Susie's an airhead. She's almost as bad as Emma.\" You peer around the corner of the Jeep at the girl who had the idea for the party. She's a vacant-eyed giggler with a halo of reddish-brown hair that floats about her ears. She wears black onyx jewelry, and Gillian has always suspected that if she and Braydon ever broke up, her hubby would make straight for Emma despite the way she can't get more three sentences out without gasping \"Oh my God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not going to know what they're talking about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to. That's the great part about being an airhead. Look, just go over to the ice chest and talk to Jack and Wendy. Flirt with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna flirt with a guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're be totally safe, he's gay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Caleb protests, but you poke and poke until just get away from you he totters over to Jack and Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to being gay, Jack Li is Chinese-American, which would put him at something of a double-disadvantage at Westside if his family wasn't also pretty rich. But at the moment, stretched out lazily on the grass in his long-sleeve t-shirt and jeans with Wendy sitting beside him, he just looks like another clean-cut senior. He grins up at you and Susie. \"So tell me about your Saturday,\" he says to your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for the first time, your own heart skips a beat in sympathy with Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had fun.\" A ghastly grin spreads across her face. Gently, you grasp her by the elbows and kick at the back of her knees, so that she falls down next to Jack. He helps her down, and you feel Caleb stiffening all over. \"Um,\" she says once she's on the grass with him. \"Yeah, I had fun, even though it rained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did you get wet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit.\" Her grin is a rictus. You don't bother keeping a straight face as you settle in next to Wendy, but you fight to keep from laughing out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they need to fix the roof,\" Jack says. \"Which one had the leak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't answer that,\" Wendy butts in. \"It's none of his business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be, one of these days,\" Jack protests. \"You don't know.\" He turns back to Susie. \"It wasn't the last one, was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, more toward the middle.\" She turns a terrified look on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gillian!\" a voice calls. You look over. It's Brianna Kirschke. You wave, but she gestures you to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay here.\" You press a fingertip into Susie's thigh as you get your feet under you. \"Jack,\" you tell him, \"keep her here, but don't scare her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm like bears,\" he tells Susie as you trot off. \"I'm more scared of you than you are of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna smiles at your approach and says, \"Good, I wanted it just you. How's Susie doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I guess. Maybe a little weirder than usual,\" you add, for you've decided that maybe Caleb needs a <i>little</i> cover. You twitch the cigarette from Dean, take a hit, then drop it to the ground and crush it beneath your toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna looks past your shoulder. \"She's not freaked out or anything, is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would she be\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break off, for now you're worried that there's something going on that <i>Gillian</i> should know about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim says, \"Good, 'cos I just got word he's on his way here,\" while Brianna says, \"Don't you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know what?\" A cold spot envelops your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna covers her gasp with the palm of her hand. \"She didn't tell you? About ...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna glances around, and leans close to you. Before she can speak, Dean snorts, \"It's not a big-ass secret, Brianna.\" She spares him a brief glare before clutching you and pulling you close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie was at the Warehouse last night,\" she says in a low voice. \"She wound up <i>upstairs.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Upstairs? As in\u2014?</i> \"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She <i>didn't</i> tell you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Who with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some Eastman guy,\" Tim says. He waggles his cell phone at you. \"And I just got word he's on his way out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I wanna know how she's doing,\" Brianna says. \"In case, you know\u2014\" Her brows bunch up. \"She doesn't want to see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's probably a good idea. But hell\u2014 It would also be a lot of fun to see Caleb try to interact with the guy. And Susie is such an airhead he might get away with it!</span></div></div>",

For starters, you do have work that you need to get back to\u2014the work that Gillian distracted you from. And if you stayed, Caleb would just try hiding out with you, and badgering you into rescuing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's still preoccupied with Jack Li at the moment. He says he hasn't got any of Susie's memories or personality, but the expression of terror on his\u2014on Susie's\u2014face isn't out of character for her. Maybe it's something about her facial muscles, but even when Susie is happy she looks faintly worried, and even when she's partying it's like there's an undercurrent of panic. <i>Oh my God!</i> is Susie's favorite exclamation, and she doesn't so much walk anywhere as much as she scampers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you decide there's little chance of him blowing his cover. When he sees you looking in his direction, you motion at him to stay put. Then, when he isn't looking, you sneak away to your car and drive off without him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's going to be <i>so funny</i> when he catches up to you and is all, like, totally furious with you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBut you're not going to make it easy for him. On your way back into town you stop to text Braydon, ordering him to meet you again out at the Westside parking lot. There are almost a dozen cars there, parked up next to the gym, and from the far side of the parking lot you see that the tennis courts are occupied. You can't tell who's there, though. Since the tennis team is stocked with rich fucks like Kelsey Blankenship who could just as easily get a court up at the country club, it must be regular kids with nothing else to do on a Sunday evening. Losers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Braydon pulls up you crawl into his back seat with him. You're about to wrap yourself with a blanket when, on an impulse, you pull yourself up to him and kiss his chest through his shirt. \"I'm going to leave you alone for the next week,\" you find yourself saying. \"So I'm going to need\u2014 Rrngh!\" You bite one of his nipples, and he jumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to be doing?\" he asks. It comes out as a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I'll distract myself with someone. Probably Susie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" You pull him into a tighter embrace. \"But I need you to\u2014 Mm. Fill me up? To hold me? Until then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fill you up?\" His brows peak in the middle of his forehead. Like Susie, Braydon has a constant look of worry, but this look of worry means <i>Do you really mean what it sounds like you mean?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me feel good, Braydon,\" you murmur. Being inside Gillian is like being inside a hot steam bath, and you can't help relaxing into her personality and her instincts, especially now when you're about to abandon her. You pull the blanket up over yourselves. \"Make me feel like you're going to miss me, and you need to\u2014 <i>Rrrmmmhm.</i> Tear off little chunks of me that you'll keep through winter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Braydon obliges. He leans over, like an overgrown child suckling at his mother's breast, and you cradle him your arms as he nuzzles at the tops of your breasts. Bit by bit, with your help, he loosens  your top and peels it back, and lifts and pushes away your bra. For a quarter hour, at least, he nips at and tickles your breasts\u2014including the tips\u2014 with his teeth and tongue. You relax all over, like your very bones are liquefying  and puddling in your joints, and your fingers are like floppy rubber when you undo and pull off your skirt. Braydon puts his face between your thighs, and his tongue flicks in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Relaxed</i> is as far as you get, though, and not long after you've pulled off all of Gillian's clothes you force Braydon back so you can pull off the mask. You're still relaxed, though, after you're awake, and only the terror of being caught\u2014as a naked Will Prescott\u2014in the backseat of Braydon's car gets you moving. Braydon disrobes under the blanket with you (much to your distaste), and when he's got everything off you pull his face off and replace it with Gillian's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth twists up in a half smile, and she peers at you from under her lashes. \"That was nice,\" she says. \"You wanna pick up where Braydon left off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be nice, but it's getting dark, and you also feel kind of strange being naked with her. (You also still feel her personality bumping around inside you, and Gillian would not be much interested in making out with herself.) Also, her cell phone has been vibrating, probably with messages from Caleb, and you should probably get her off and away so she can distract Susie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you grunt a negative and tell her to get dressed. \"After that you can go home,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can?\" There's a mischievous note in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go home,\" you order her. \"And stay away from me. From Braydon, I mean.\" You hesitated. \"Go flirt with other guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can do that.\" She doesn't sound disappointed. She's already getting into her underthings as she speaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou linger a bit with her, waiting to see if she has anything else to add. She doesn't, and when she's dressed again she just gives you a long, silent smile before getting out of the car. You huddle up inside the blanket and with gritted teeth try to squeeze the erection out of your cock without touching it. It doesn't want to go down, though, so after Gillian has driven off you press Braydon's mask back to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe erection is still there\u2014though it's Braydon's\u2014when you wake again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBack at Braydon's you get much less done than you would have hoped. His mom sends you to pick up a pizza, and she asks you to watch TV with her while the two of you eat it. You let Braydon's sense of guilt drag you along. His father ran off with another woman when Braydon was little, and his mom still holds something of a grudge against the male of the species as a result, so she doesn't have much of a social life. Fortunately, she got everything in the divorce, and her job as a restaurant manager at the IHOP keeps them comfortable, even if her hours are long and varied. You do get some reading done, but it leaves you restless, for there's nothing obviously and immediately useful in the Cornelius Agrippa, and you've no idea if it could lead to anything useful in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGillian, at least, obeys your orders, and the next day at school, even in the classes you share with her, she only twinkles at you with a secret smile. You hide from Braydon's friends, and connect with Christian Knouse only long enough to tell him that you're going to have to miss the RPG session scheduled for that afternoon up at King Kong Komics. He doesn't sound broken up by your confession, though there is a snappishness to his reply, \"Fine, it's just what this country needs, a lot more anti-social deviant fuckoffs.\" But maybe he's pissed about something else, because he's glaring around your shoulder when he says it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have Susie for fourth-period English, though\u2014a class that you and she share with Will Prescott and Caleb Johansson. The person who looks like Caleb ignores you as you slither into Ms. Gladstone's classroom, but Will perks up and watches you all the way back to your desk. He only slumps when Susie comes in, but Caleb sits up sharply, and she flinches and crimsons as she squeezes past his desk. His golem, you notice, turns and stares at her ass as she passes. \"You son of a bitch,\" she mutters when she passes your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Christian isn't the only one with a case of the Mondays. \"You on the rag or something?\" you ask her after class, as you're both on your way to the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you. Bad enough you left me at the river with\u2014 Fuck you! But then I went to find you at Gillian's, and she only giggled at me while I spent a whole hour yelling at her, and only <i>then</i> did she tell me she wasn't <i>you</i> anymore. I called her a lying cunt, and it wasn't until I wrestled her down and pulled her face off\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't!\" you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you. I almost went over to your place\u2014Braydon's, you know\u2014and put a rock through your window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you ever get Susie's memories?\" You've paused just outside the door to the cafeteria, and there's enough noise and bother about that you're not worried about being overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snorts. \"Yes. I woke up with them this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you pissed off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you,\" she says, and stomps into the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's in sixth period\u2014AP Latin II\u2014as you are contemplating the dumpy Morgana Hollis\u2014a would-be Wiccan\u2014that you get an idea so obvious that you can't believe you didn't have it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I remember it,\" Ted Arnholm snorts as he examines the grimoire. \"Hard to forget a hundred bucks that\u2014\" He looks momentarily startled as he opens the book and finds that the first few pages easily turn.

A man like that probably isn't an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you leave off puzzling over the matter when, in your distracted state, you almost run a red light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"So what did I miss?\" you ask as you saunter into the game room at King Kong Komics.

It's practically the same thing. Darrell, think of a number between one and twenty-one. If I guess it right,\" you tell Howie, \"Tiny gets out of the bog and catches up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The odds aren't the same,\" Howie protests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. They're worse. One chance out of twenty-one instead of\u2014 What? Fifty-fifty? One out of three, at making a wrong turn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'd have to make at least six saving throws. That's what I made the other guys do.\" Howie pulls on his lip, but a light comes into his eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristian groans. \"Oh God, look at that!\" he exclaims as Howie takes up a pencil and starts flipping through the rule book. \"He's going to do a <i>statistical analysis!</i> We could'a <i>rolled</i> you out of the bog by now! And you still won't make it, even if you\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet?\" you taunt Christian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three throws,\" Howie says. \"I mean, three separate guesses.

You went along with it, even calculated the odds we'd need to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2014!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it, man, he got you,\" Christian says. He squints at you. \"Fucking clever-ass son of a bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowie makes a noise like he's gargling rocks, but yields. Tiny joins the others, and the company proceeds on its quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're silent most of the rest of the session, preoccupied as you are with trying to be clever about something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to get a mind-band onto the forehead of Professor Aubrey Blackwell. The man's knowledge could be crucial to reviving your father. He is not only a putative expert on magic but was the previous owner of the grimoire. But a warlock\u2014and that's what it sounds like he is\u2014is not someone to be approached directly or carelessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"So send a fake,\" Susie Lekuawehe says. \"You've got enough of them.\" She glances up from her cell phone long enough to shoot Gillian a dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's ten o'clock, but The Crystal Cave is still open, and that's where your trio is hanging out. Your girlfriend\u2014still remembering your orders\u2014is playfully keeping her distance, and is curled up on the bench opposite you with her feet tucked under her. But though she has no words for you, she will still stare at you with twinkling eyes, and will gnaw provocatively on a cardboard stir stick. It serves her right when part of it comes off in her mouth, and she makes a face as she peels it off her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Susie continues, \"why don't you go meet this guy yourself? Or are you too much of a chicken-shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. The guy's an expert on this stuff. And he used to own the book, he's probably an expert on it too. Look at what <i>we</i> got up to with it. I'm not just gonna walk up to a guy who's probably made, like, all kinds of masks and things and ask him to explain it all to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How smart can he be if he lost the book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is a point, but it's not a point that makes you any more confident about approaching Professor Aubrey Blackwell directly. You doubt anyone could be such a butterfingers as to <i>lose</i> that grimoire. It makes you wonder if something <i>happened</i> to him. \"Like what?\" Susie asks when you voice the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows? But maybe\u2014\" You glance at Gillian. \"Maybe the fakes got the upper hand?\" you suggest. \"Maybe he lost control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie sucks in her cheeks. \"So send in a fake,\" she suggests again. \"Do a recon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you asking me\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who?\" you explain to her. \"I want ideas. Not you, not me, not my dad, not Gillian. Not anyone connected to us, or, you know, our aliases.\" Susie frowns at you, so you continue with a sigh. \"You were all excited about making masks and having fun with them. Are you having enough fun as Susie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I could, if\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want a new mask?\" you say, giving up on the attempt to be coy. \"I'm asking you to suggest someone we could copy to send on the recon. Someone you'd like to have a copy of anyway, someone you'd\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea Cooper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rear back. <i>The head cheerleader?</i> \"What? No! Be serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am serious. Or how about one the Garners? Or Cindy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou facepalm. \"Is it you or Susie who's being the bubble-brain? It has to be someone who can, like, jump on this professor. Overpower him. So we can get a mind band onto him, copy his brain. I don't think Chelsea could\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea wouldn't have to overpower him. She could just get into his lap and blow in his ear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you bury your whole face in your hands. \"Okay, I get what you're saying. But I don't think it's going to be that easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what if he's gay? Besides, I don't think a professor is just going to let a strange girl get in his lap. There is such a thing as sexual harassment, you know, and I bet a lot of the people at the university would be worried about\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying you want me to think of a <i>guy</i> to use?\" Susie says. \"Ew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a guy who has a hot girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" She blinks. \"Right. That could ... work.\" You roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking someone like the Molester,\" you tell her. \"Someone big and stupid and scary. We've got a mask of him anyway\u2014you saw to that\u2014so we could use that, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ick. No, let's get someone else.\" Her phone dings, and she makes a face at it. \"We could use my brother,\" she says. \"Susie's brother, I mean. I could get him no problem, but I don't think Sam\u2014 Well, what do you think? Do you think Susie's brother could get laid? He hasn't got a girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should use someone who's <i>not</i> connected to <i>any</i> of our aliases. Just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what about someone from Eastman? That's about as unconnected to us as you can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can get someone from there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winces and nods. \"Sure. The guy I\u2014 That <i>Susie</i> spent the night with Saturday. He's a wrestler or something, and I <i>guess</i> he's pretty good-looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAn Eastman wrestler sounds like a good idea, but even after you say so Caleb will insist on trying to use a girl, and his suggestions become ever more baroque. <i>Copy one of the girls' soccer players, if you want a jock. Copy a teacher. Copy a girl and use her face to copy a teacher.</i> You brush her ideas aside impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once you're home, you decide that he might be on to something, particularly about using a teacher. Maybe a college student?</span></div></div>",

You're far from convinced. Anyway, at the moment you want to master magical theory, not magical artifacts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left Arnholm's yesterday in a forward-thinking mood: <i>How do I get to Aubrey Blackwell?</i> Today, after school, you return to the bookstore with a different plan: To acquire other of the professor's cast-off books. You doubt that a warlock would really part with anything really valuable. But, you remind yourself as you park behind the bookstore, he did part with that grimoire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed Arnholm doesn't look pleased to see you, and he snorts when you ask him to show you the other books that he bought that day from Professor Blackwell. \"It was two months ago!\" he reminds you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you show me the shelves where they might be? I want to buy them. All of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose are the magic words, apparently, for there's no mistaking the glint of cupidity that comes into his eye. \"Matt!\" he shouts in a cracked voice, and a curly-headed college kid hurries over from the front counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, yeah! Let's check it out!\" he enthuses when you tell him you want the titles of the books that Aubrey Blackwell sold the bookshop two months ago. Back at the counter, he opens up a laptop. \"Must'a been a pretty big acquisition,\" he chatters brightly. \"Those're the only ones we ever put in the records!\" He taps furiously. \"And we got a winner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe copies down some titles, then\u2014still making meaningless small talk\u2014he leads you around the bookstore. Most of books (no surprise) are lodged in the Occult and Paranormal section, but two of them are in the History section, and one is in the Science section. A search of the Special Collections turns up nothing, though. \"Must'a sold that one to a collector,\" he laughs. You smile to yourself. <i>Libra Personae</i> is the title he has scribbled down for that spot. <i>So that's the thing's name.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe total price for the dozen book or so books is well outside your budgetary range, so you only buy the ones with handwritten notes in the margins or inside the covers. Ted Arnholm comes over to glower at you while the still-burbling clerk checks you out. \"Thought you were gonna buy all of them,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" you tell him. \"Just not all at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk guffaws, but he shuts up quick as Arnholm\u2014a vein throbbing in his forehead\u2014turns a snarling face on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe next few days pass normally\u2014or at least with what passes for normality for Braydon Delp. You go to class. You talk with his friends. You attend two more gaming sessions. You get cornered in the boys' bathroom by George Mendoza and Joe Thomason, you taunt you as a queer, a pedophile, and a goat fucker. (You're rescued by Gary Chen, of all people, who barges in to demand why the fuck they're jerking off with you, and chases them out. You're grateful to him for about three seconds\u2014before he grabs you by the neck and shoves you head first into the big bathroom garbage canister.) You spend your nights reading books on the occult. All totally normal experiences for Braydon Delp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy Thursday night you're feeling antsy for company, so you summon Gillian to your house and drive out to the deserted parking lot of an elementary school, where you peel off her clothes and nibble her all over while she groans and pants and murmurs your name over and over again. You open up your own trousers, and without being ordered to she sucks you off until you cum. After that, you wrap arms around each other and hold each other until she starts to snore softly and your own eyes close. You drive home after she's woken from her cat nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday afternoon, after school, you meet up special with Susie, to confirm that she's got a special date. \"Yes, it's all set up,\" she groans. \"I'm meeting him at a party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome.\" You hand her a mask and a mind-band. \"I didn't glue them together,\" you explain, \"'cos I figure it'll be easier to get the mind-band onto him. Like, you can palm it. Then when that's done with him but he's still knocked out, you can drop the mask on him. We can glue them together afterward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better be worth it,\" she grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should already know if it is.\" You return her frown with a smirk. \"I thought you already sucked him off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe punches you in the side of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nFriday night is another game night with Christian and the guys, but this time there's pizza, and Eric Kim closes up early so he can join you. You have a hard time concentrating, though, for you're distracted by thoughts of Caleb and his mission for you. In fact, you're so distracted that after you've finished your share of the pizza you turn management of Tiny over to Eric and leave. But you can't concentrate back at your house either, and bemuse yourself into boredom by anticipating the adventure to come: <i>Make that mask. Make another mind-band. Put on the mask. Go out to the college. Slap the new mind-band onto the professor. Take it all home. Put on the mind-band. Figure out how to fix my dad ...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh deeply. <i>As. If.</i> Your eye will keep recurring to the books you bought, now piled up on your desk. They haven't done you a lot of good, though one of the margin notes has referenced a book on magic sigils. Unfortunately, a web search only turns up copies kept in the special collections at libraries in places like Oxford, where they are only accessible to scholars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Yeah, I didn't manage score a copy of that guy,\" Susie says with a yawn when you meet her Saturday morning for breakfast. She's not only got the yawns, but also the most impressive case of bed-head you've ever seen. Her mane of hair flies out in all directions, like she brushed it while gripping an electric fence in her free hand. \"I think I got you someone just as good, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're sitting in Salvation Donuts, a shop that's owned by the family that runs the Agape Christian Academy. Braydon loves to loiter there with coffee and a donut while wearing his most blasphemous and Satanic-looking gear. You've toned it down this morning, though, and have contented yourself with a vintage Black Sabbath t-shirt (horned skull and dancing skeletons) and the bicycle-chain necklace. \"What happened?\" you ask as you slurp your coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My date wasn't interested in me. Can you believe it?\" She paws at her hair, and yawns. \"Guys can be such shits, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get <i>anyone?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I got you someone. One of the guys whose house it was. It was a real rager. House, front yard and back yard all packed. Anyway, I followed one of the guys outside and down the street, 'cos I didn't think I was gonna be able to get anyone without being a total slut about it, and I wasn't gonna do <i>that.</i> I caught up to him, talked to him, got the stuff onto him and then ran off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls the mask and mind-band out of her purse. You whistle at the tongue twister of a name on the band. \"The guy's from Italy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was he?\" She peers at the band, then shrugs. \"He didn't have an accent. When are you going to use it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably Monday after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I didn't have to fuck him.\" She crinkles her nose at someone behind your shoulder, and you glance back to see the fat woman who owns the place scowling at you. \"I want a girlfriend,\" Susie resumes in a loud voice, and she stretches her arms. \"Someone with big tits I can suck on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and scratch your eyebrow, but you also take off soon afterward. Even Braydon has his limits on how far he'll go in taunting the opposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou glare at yourself in the bathroom mirror. Braydon's mom is gone, and you've divested yourself of Braydon's mask. You're wearing the mind-band that Caleb got for you\u2014the first step in finding out if the guy he got will work for your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could work a little too well.</span></div></div>",

So powerful was the brain-band you put on that as you sank into its memories you actually began to act them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause those weren't your memories that you were reviewing.

Every wizard back in town will mortgage his staff to get a chance to buy an uber-lich's book of recipes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowie gapes at the rest of the table: you (back in Braydon's mask), Darrell, Hugh Flake and his little brother. \"Are you guys okay with this?\" Howie demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh,\" says Darrell. \"It's the end of the campaign anyway, right?\" He stretches. Who cares what happens after the curtain falls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was planning a follow up campaign,\" Howie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now I'm <i>definitely</i> keeping and selling Count Mummyface's book,\" Christian says. \"With the coin it'll get me, I won't even have to show up for the sequel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowie frowns blackly at him, and you face palm. A magical grimoire loose in the big city, thanks to an adventurer's greed ... It's a natural hook for a sequel storyline, and you can't believe Howie doesn't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut probably Howie's already sketched out a plot line for sending your next group plunging through the Forest of Fuckdiddily and into the Mountains of Masturbation in quest of some giant diamond that's needed to forge the Cosmic Gauntlet of Jerkoffitude, and he'll stubbornly insist on sticking to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowie and Christian are still arguing when the bell over the comic shop's door chimes. Gillian comes in, smiling that tight, mischievous smile she puts on when she's pissed about something but is trying to hide it. She grabs you by the ears and starts fiddling with them. \"Hey, are you guys done with my hubby yet?\" she asks the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done with them,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point of order,\" Christian says, and raises a long, skinny finger. \"I call for a vote of confidence and the installation of a new game master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What?\"</i> Howie barks. \"I told you, I'm already halfway through developing a follow up\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why I'm seconding my own motion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when do we have votes and stuff?\" Hugh asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I nominate Harrison,\" Gillian says, and Hugh's fourteen-year-old brother jumps in his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I second the motion,\" you say. \"And with that I have to go,\" you add, for you've looked around Gillian and spotted a very embarrassed-looking Susie loitering near the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to have a vote!\" Howie protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we don't,\" you retort as you rise. \"But if you're going to have a vote, Darrell can cast mine.\" You clap him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not part of the rules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christian,\" you call back as you lead Gillian back into the comic shop proper, \"move for a vote on amending the rules. Hell, move for a vote on <i>having</i> rules.\" Howie's bellowed protests mix with Christian's barking laugh as you saunter out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have fun?\" Caleb asks when you're in the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you?\" you retort. Susie had to do something with her family, which was the  only reason you spent this Saturday afternoon and evening with Christian's RPG group. \"Oh, did you know that Hugh has a crush on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On Susie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, on Johansson,\" you retort. (You've no idea if Hugh has a crush on Susie, but you feel like stirring up trouble.) \"Where are we going? I assume we're meeting up someplace,\" you add, for Gillian and Susie arrived in one car, while you've got Braydon's. Balducci's Pizza, after a little discussion, winds up being the choice of hang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you had some work to do,\" Susie says when you're seated in a booth and have ordered. The TV in the corner of the room is blaring out a college football game, and that will cover the sound of your conversation, but you've already scoped out the room for evidence of unwanted potential eavesdroppers. \"Instead you went off playing with\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did do some work,\" you retort. \"And I had to do some thinking. In the campaign, our adventuring group was trying to recover and destroy an evil grimoire. I thought maybe it would give me some ideas for dealing with our evil grimoire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie's jaw drops open. \"That's the stupidest idea you've come up with yet, Prescott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know where good ideas will come from,\" you sniff, and take a sip of your Pepsi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~ ~ ~ ~ ~</div><br>\r\n<i>The book is called the Libra Personae,</i> you wrote while wearing Frank Durras's brain-band earlier in the afternoon.

They possess certain prodigies\u2014</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused and added \"things like superpowers\" in parentheses after \"prodigies,\" even though it made Frank's personality wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2014that they use to hunt and destroy evil creatures, black magicians, magical implements, etc. These they regard as too dangerous to be left laying around. There are only three dozen or so Stellae in the entire world, and two of them are here in Saratoga Falls, enrolled at Eastman. They are still in training, and were sent undercover to find the Libra because the Order got news that it was in Saratoga Falls. This is their first real mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir names are Giovanni Braccioforte and Franz Liebesspruch, but they are living here under the names Frank and Joe Durras. Frank's prodigies come from Mars and Saturn, and Joe's from the Sun and Mercury. Joe is the smart one, and Frank is the strong one.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent a long time chewing on the end of your pen before resuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Joe is probably smart enough to figure out the Libra, and maybe to figure out a way to fix Dad. There are other Stellae who probably could too. If I showed them the Libra, and Dad, and explained things, they\u2014</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere you stopped, and stopped for good. The <i>Stellae</i> take a very dim view of magicians. They wouldn't kill you\u2014Frank's memories assured you of that\u2014but there wouldn't be any fun times after you came clean with them. At best, they would force you to explain everything to your Dad after they fixed him for you, and that would be horrible enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it would fix things, and wouldn't it be a relief to be rid of the <i>Libra</i> and all the problems that came with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~ ~ ~ ~ ~</div><br>\r\nAlmost you yielded. But then Braydon's mother came home, and you had to quickly change into his mask. The influence of Frank's personality vanished, and Braydon's came to the fore. Now you're thinking it would be better\u2014and cooler\u2014to score a copy of Joe's brain, and use his knowledge to fix things yourself while allowing yourself to keep the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would still be dangerous to leave them at large, though. Maybe the very best thing would be to hide them under some masks\u2014as you've hidden Gillian under a mask\u2014so they can't get in your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nNone of this have you told Caleb.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Friday comes, and you take the blank mind band to school so you'll have it with you for your first day at Salopek. You've not forgotten that you need those chemicals for the next spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend your first hour at Salopek filling out lots of paperwork and receiving a lot more; you don't think you've made a friend of the secretary when you ask if you'll get paid for the hour. (You will.) She then leads you from the front office through wide alleys to an open, hanger-like building at the rear of the complex, where she introduces you to your supervisor, a tall, rangy man with a tanned and crinkly face. \"Andy Keyes,\" he says, giving you a firm handshake. \"Nice to meet you, Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise, sir.\" The man's smile is tight but friendly, and though he seems very businesslike you think you will like him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leads you over to a table and has you pick up a hardhat. \"Not much of an orientation for this job,\" he says. \"Just do what you're told. I'll put you with one of the boys and you can spend today getting a feel for the place. I'm not around much--they give me a lot of ground to cover--so stick to him and you'll be okay. Sean!\" he calls, and a head bobs up from behind some machinery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeyes introduces him as Sean Mitchell, another senior at Westside. He's blonde and broad-shouldered, with meaty pecs showing under his tight t-shirt. Instantly you peg him as a football player. But you pay as little attention to the sports teams as you can get away with, so you're not sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that means you're extra surprised when he talks as though he knows you. \"Hey Prescott,\" he says as he crushes your hand in a muscular paw of his own. \"Heard you were getting a job out here. Cool.\" You nod as cheerfully as you can, and mumble something about being glad to have him to hang out with at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeyes doesn't waste much time after introductions, and instructs Sean briefly about what to do with you. Sean nods along enthusiastically, and after he's gone, he slaps you in the stomach. \"So, your dad works here too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He's put me onto the job. Made me take it. Does your dad work here too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean's face tightens. \"Mm, no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made it sound like he did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Oh.\" He nods with sudden understanding. \"I just meant, you're working here, and your dad works here too. You're lucky you got an old man who can give you an in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"Well, if you say so. I guess. Though it's not like I really want to be here or anything. I mean\u2014\" You stop, for it suddenly strikes you how surly and ungrateful you're sounding. \"It is great, but I wasn't asking any favors to come out here, it was more his idea, and I was like, Yeah, sure, that'd be good -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Sean interrupts this embarrassing babble with a laugh. \"No, I get you. Dads can be that way, right? 'Here's something to keep you out of trouble, you lazy sack of shit!' Huh?\" He laughs again, and gestures you to follow him into the back of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relax. Maybe things will be alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, Sean shows you and explains to you, he's been fussing with a big piece of equipment that resembles the unlikely offspring of a hippopotamus and a steam shovel. \"They're moving this to another building,\" he tells you, \"but it's bolted to the floor. I'm having a hell of a time finding all the places where it's attached, so I'm really glad you showed up. Crawl under this thing with me and let's find those bolts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's dirty, grimy business that takes the better part of forty-five minutes to finish, and before it's done Sean has to fetch something that looks like a small jackhammer in order to remove most of them. But large parts of the table still have to be disassembled before the rest can be removed. \"Shit,\" he says, wiping a streaming forehead with his shirt tail. (You use your hand to wipe your own forehead; Sean has abs that can withstand being glimpsed, but you only have shallow plank that jiggles with a layer of baby fat.) \"No way we're getting this done today, and I'll have to talk to Andy about it.\" He trots over to a phone on the far wall, leaving you alone to take in the hanger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceiling is very high, and the concrete floor is mostly open. But there is lots of machinery and tables and heavy cabinets stacked high by the walls. There are also a couple of open bays in the floor where, you guess, vehicles can be parked and worked on from underneath. You wander around without going far, trying to see if there is anything that looks like it might be useful in that spell. But you don't want to get caught snooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, Sean returns with a plan that will let you do all the snooping you could want. \"Andy says to leave it for tomorrow. Probably they'll get it taken out in the morning. I'm supposed to just give you a tour of the complex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter covering the hanger, he leads you out to explore the rest of the grounds. It's a spacious complex spread over many, many acres, surrounded by a high chain link fence topped with hurricane wire. He points out the various buildings and their uses, and telling you which ones you will probably have to do jobs in. \"Not a lot of call for brain work in this position,\" he says. \"Mostly you'll be moving things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I told Caleb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johansson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still more surprised to see that he knows Caleb's name. \"Yeah, he wanted this job. Thought it would give him an 'in' with the company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean laughs. \"Well, unless he can build a working rocket motor from a lot of baling wire and some plywood, I don't think he'd catch anyone's attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there, like, explosives and stuff around here?\" you ask. It's a wretched segue, but it's the first chance you've had to wrench the conversation around to the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got all kinds of shit around here. You won't be touching it, though, so don't worry. You need special training for that. I only know where it is because they tell me where it is so I won't trip over it. They give you a manual at the front office?\" You nod. \"Study it tonight. It'll have all the warning stuff in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're glad he thought you were afraid of getting close to that kind of stuff, instead of fishing for information so you could steal it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last stop is right here, then we'll knock off,\" he says, leading you up to a nondescript tan building. \"It's our internal distribution center. They'll sometimes send you over to pick things up.\" He tugs on the door, but it doesn't open. \"Jack musta stepped out a moment,\" he says. He checks his watch and thinks a moment. \"Aw, heck, he won't mind if we break in. Stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean is punching numbers on a keypad. He tries the door, but it still won't budge. He thinks a moment, and curses quietly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just bullshit.\" He punches at the keypad again, and this time the door opens. \"We had some stuff go missing a few weeks ago, so they stepped up security on this building. Now they're supposed to lock up when there's no one inside.\" He ushers you in. \"They also changed the keypad combo. Which is typical management idiocy, since the burglars came in through a window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside looks a bit like a post office, with a long counter at the front. He leads you around it and through a door into a space filled with metal shelves, most of them empty. \"Doors back there,\" he gestures, \"for taking big stuff in and out. This side is for stuff that's come in. The other side is for stuff that has to go out.\" He grunts. \"Not a lot in here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like a big space for not very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When it gets busy we have a lot.\" He glances down, and kneels to tie his shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaps. His head is near one of the shelves. All you have to do is bend behind him and you can put the mind band to his forehead; you can pretend afterward that he cracked his head as he stood up again. Except he's got that hardhat on ...</span></div></div>",

Then he falls forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart hammers in your chest as you wait, using the time to roll him over and knock the hardhat off. You hear the outside door open, and footsteps, and you hold your breath, wondering if this Jack person is going to materialize. But no one comes in. When the band reappears some minutes later on Sean's forehead, you sweep it back into your pocket and bend down to slap lightly at his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan, he opens his eyes and sits up. \"Dude, that sounded like it hurt,\" you say in a quaking voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You started to stand up again, and <i>whang</i>--\" You tap the edge of the shelf. It rattles lightly. No way it would knock someone out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks up at you suspiciously. \"I thought--\" He frowns, looks at the shelf, looks down at his hardhat, and blinks. \"Huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince at the way he brushes you off as you try to help him to his feet. \"Well, that's enough for today.\" He leads you back out, nodding briefly at Jack--who turns out to be a portly man in his fifties--and striding purposefully toward the front building. For the rest of the day Sean is very brusque, and most of the friendliness has drained from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYour dad is waiting for you at the front office, where he greets you with gruff cheer and asks about your day. You do your best to be enthusiastic, though you are rather daunted at having to talk in front of Sean and the receptionist. He then asks Sean about your first day; Mitchell says good things about you, but both his words and attitude are very muted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad accompanies you to your truck, and leans in at the window after you've gotten in. \"Alright, what did you do?\" he growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do? Nothing!\" Your dad bores holes in your denial with his eyes. \"What? It was just a first day. You think I screwed up already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitchell didn't seem that pleased with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just Mitchell,\" you retort, and twinge internally at the unfairness of what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyebrows go up. \"You know your supervisor that well already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not my supervisor. Look at him. I go to school with him. He knows me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God,\" he groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad! Just give me a chance! Jesus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your language. But keep your nose clean and your hands in your pockets when they're not asking you to use them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" You roll your eyes, and with a snort he turns away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou finger the band in your pocket after he's gone, but the conclusion to your workday has left you feeling sour, and you want to get your mind <i>off</i> Mitchell, not crawl into <i>his.</i> You don't want to go home and you don't want to see Caleb either, so you go find Keith at his house. \"How was your first day at Caleb's job?\" he teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck.</i> \"Shut up. It was lousy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? After that huge build up Johansson was giving it, I thought you'd see angels blowing trumpets overhead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, it's just manual labor. Oh, and you know Sean Mitchell? Get this, he works there, I'll be seeing him every day. Fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brow furrows. \"Sean's a good guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I think he's got a grudge against me now.\" You give him the airbrushed version of the accident in the warehouse. \"He thinks I sucker punched him or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. With your arms? You couldn't sucker punch a Girl Scout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of those girls are hard core,\" you retort, surprising even yourself with the screwball turn. \"Like, I saw this twelve-year-old scout the other day, and she looked like a sumo wrestler who got hit with a shrink ray.\" That marks a permanent evolution in the conversation, and you feel much better by the end of it, good enough to broach the subject of Sean again. \"You have Sean for any classes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Santiago, first period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you talk to him tomorrow, tell him I feel really bad about this first day and what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith's expression falls. \"Don't you believe in talking to people yourself? You got Caleb trying to find out about Lisa--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's <i>another</i> thing,\" you exclaim, snapping your fingers. \"Chelsea Cooper was-- No, never mind. What were you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea Cooper was what?\" You shake your head, and he grips you by the shoulders. \"Chelsea Cooper was <i>what?!</i> Naked? Touching herself? Kissing another cheerleader?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was just at my locker the other day, made a smartass comment about me and Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Chelsea Cooper talked to you?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To insult me, yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd let Chelsea Cooper cut off my left nut if she asked me herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she'd fry it and eat it,\" you snap. \"It wasn't fun. But what were you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" He shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, will you talk to Sean for me tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. No, I won't. Talk to him yourself and apologize if you're feeling so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. I just want you softening him up by asking what happened, tell him I was obsessing about screwing up with him. You know, call me a neurotic if you want. Bitch about me, the harder the better so he'll know I feel sincerely horrible about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you? Do you feel sincerely horrible about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't give a shit. But it'll be easier working out there if he's not being a dick to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou stare in the mirror, and the reflection bores holes back at you. You let your eyes drift over your features: irregular, a little dopey. Stiff blonde hair that sticks out of from under your hat the way straw sticks out of a scarecrow. A nasty patch of zits erupting on your forehead. Your lips are chapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you look down and rub your arm. A thing of no muscle, but you push up your sleeve and grip the bicep. As you flex you press your hand to your weak chest. Not an impressive body. A least you haven't a belly, even if there is no definition to your stomach. You pull up your shirt: oh, a cute little innie. You pull your jeans down slightly so that your boxers show. You like the effect; a baggy-jean look might suit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these aren't baggy. They are very tight as your cock thrusts outward, distending them. <i>Dammit, you're turning yourself on by scoping out your own body!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, trying to clear it, and jump back onto the bed, hugging your legs and biting your knees. Damn, being in another body is so exciting, even one as mediocre as Prescott's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, as </i>mine<i>!</i> you have to remind yourself. But after putting on Sean's mind band it's been a little hard keeping your identity straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind had come in a rush after you'd put the band on, and then it had vanished. You opened your eyes and wondered where he had gone. But after you'd sat up and started looking around, a sort of double vision enfolded you. It was your room, something so boring and familiar; but it was also a strange place you'd never seen before. As you flipped through the papers on your desk you felt a small illicit thrill, as though you were snooping. It was much messier than ... than your other desk. You'd blinked hard at that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew exactly what Mitchell's bedroom looked like, where he kept his stuff, what the ceiling looked like when he lay back in bed and ... Yikes. You'd probed only a little further, gently, as you strolled around your own bedroom, taking it in with a stranger's eyes. Then your gaze had been caught by the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep, ragged breath as you grip your legs more tightly. <i>And you thought </i>you<i> were excited by the discovery of the book. Sean's head would explode ...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoved by curiosity as to what your secret alter ego is up to, you shift over to the computer and check his email and log into his Facebook account and some of the message boards he frequents. They don't tell you anything you don't already know, though it's gratifying to see the nicely encouraging replies to his latest bit of fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you sit back and trawl for the information you intended to find. Yes, some (though not all) of the elements you'll need for the next spell are out at Salopek. Getting them would be no problem for Sean, as, despite what he'd implied, he's checked out to handle them. For Will Prescott, though ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance over at the blank mask that is now fully polished. You can now think of at least one very good use for it.</span></div></div>",

Would there be some way of getting him out of the way? Or going in when he's not around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah!</i> He's supposed to go out of town this weekend to visit his grandparents, and as it is an extended trip he's slated to take Friday off. That's when you could go in. But then <i>you'd</i> be the one missing work. Hmmm ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will!\" It's your dad's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't 'yeah' me, mister.

You gulp a little to see that he's holding the thick binder of work-related material you were given to study. \"Have you even <i>looked</i> at this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's see how much you absorbed,\" he says acidly. He jerks his head, and you follow him into the dining room with a sinking feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty-five harrowing minutes later he pushes the binder away and stares at you in frank disbelief. \"You picked all that up just by looking at it a 'little'?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"Mostly it seems like common sense,\" you improvise. Thank goodness you still had Sean's mind band on, and that he's an expert on Salopek's many policies and warnings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad shakes his head. \"And yet your school work just seems to bounce off you. Well,\" he sighs. \"Carry on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Hey Sean, is there any way I'd be able to miss work on Friday?\" you ask him the next day at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns to stare, and his manner, though not exceptionally unfriendly, is distinctly cool. \"It's not school. You can't skip,\" he says bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that. I just mean, if I asked to take the afternoon off, do you think I could get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just started, and you're already asking for days off? That's really not gonna go well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thing is, I'm supposed to have a dental appointment, and they called to reschedule and wanted to know if I could come in Friday afternoon,\" you lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks skeptical. \"You can ask, but even asking isn't going to make you popular.\" Now he is very frosty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for being honest with me,\" you say, feeling a little desperate to get back in his good graces. \"You were just awesome with me yesterday, I really appreciate it. So, um, I guess I'll see you Friday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see me this afternoon.\" The chill, if possible, deepens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I didn't mean that. I'm just saying I'll be there Friday and see you then, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lips purse, and he grunts. Clearly he doesn't want to have to say that he <i>won't</i> be there on Friday.

Your disguise is as good as you can make it. The face and body and mind of Sean Mitchell are perfect, of course, but you'd had to improvise with the wardrobe, employing one of your rarely used polo shirts and khakis. It should do, however, until you can get into his work locker and change into the extra stuff he keeps there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting the mask had been tricky, and you'd only managed to score it yesterday. Sean had been on his back on the floor of the machine shop, working under some equipment. You werestanding over him with the mask (you'd been carrying it with you for the past few days) wedged against the side of your hip between your underwear and your jeans. You pretended to accidentally knock a heavy hammer off the equipment; Sean winced and looked away as it clanged heavily onto the floor next to his head. In a flash, you had the mask out and pressed to his face. Then you knelt, hiding him from view, until it reappeared. After you'd woken him back up he cursed you out hard as an accident-prone fuck up and said he'd have to report you. It made you feel bad, since you do like Sean and wish he'd like you. For that to happen, of course, you'd have to stop knocking him cold ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you exit your truck and stride to the front office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you had the day off,\" Debra, the receptionist, says in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things fell through, thought I'd come in and work anyway,\" you say. \"That gonna be a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We couldn't find anyone to cover for you,\" she says, \"so Andy'll be happy to see you. Oh, and Will Prescott called, said he'd be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snort. \"Guy's just begging to be fired. Well, when he shows up, send him to find me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, you look around to check that the coast is clear. The alleys aren't crowded, but no one is paying attention to you, so you're able to get to Sean's locker and change into some of his clothes. Then it's off to score some empty containers. You check your shopping list and trot off to your first destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the thirty minutes you have all but two of the liquids--some quite flammable--that you need, and decided to sneak some of them back out to the parking lot. But on your way out you run into Keyes. \"You already finished in the distribution center?\" he asks in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. \"Huh? Oh, I had to step out to the head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You give Prescott that warning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prescott. He showed up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said his truck was out front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale. \"I did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you over the top of his glasses. \"Are you feeling okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. I just haven't seen Prescott. Uh, not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolls his eyes, and which then settle on the four containers you're clutching. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm not sure. I ran into Jorge on the way back and he asked me to step this over to the front gate for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, take this with you, give it to Debra for me.\" He thrusts a manila folder at you and walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you return to the front office. Debra looks up at you in exasperation. \"You here to tell me <i>again</i> you've decided to come in to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow hard. \"No, just dropping this off for Andy.\" You shift items, almost dropping them, and present her with the folder Keyes gave you. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me,\" she says somewhat waspishly. \"Oh, but tell Prescott to trot around to see his dad. The man isn't happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly walk out into the parking lot. (Luckily, no one challenges you.) It <i>sounds</i> like Sean actually decided to show up for work, and it's only a blessed coincidence you haven't run into him yet. Well, maybe it's not such a coincidence; it's a big complex, and it sounds like he's been stuck inside the distribution center since he arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stash the chemicals in the back of your truck, thinking all the while. The safest thing is to ditch Sean's mask and go back in as yourself, pleading an accident, like a flat tire. But it sounds like you're on the verge of getting fired, and if that happens you won't be able to get back in to snag the rest of what you need. Maybe you should just try running the table while you still can.</span></div></div>",

He looks around the storage space with his hands on his hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" he says cheerfully, \"we got like fifteen minutes till quitting time. Not enough time to do anything except goof off. Come on.\" With a wink he leads you over to far corner of the storage space, and to a big cabinet filled with a lot of dusty packages and envelopes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the dead collection,\" he says. \"Stuff that got misdirected or returned or just came in or came back unclaimed. They clean it out every few months or so, but Jack makes sure that <i>this</i> one always stays.\" He digs through a box and pulls out a dark bottle. \"A little end-of-your-first-day nip?\" He waggles his eyebrows, and you grin back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes one big gulp, makes a face, and hands it over to you. It's Scotch\u2014hard and sharp and smoky, and it makes your eyes water, and sets you to coughing. \"Been too long on beer, huh?\" Sean laughs, but there's no meanness in it. \"That's enough,\" he says, taking the bottle back from you and replacing it. \"One good belt before we knock off, enough to make us feel good but not enough to really do anything.\" He smacks his tongue around in his mouth. \"Don't abuse it,\" he says, and his expression sobers and hardens. \"We had some guys who got stinking drunk on the stuff over the summer and got fired. Luckily, they didn't spill about where they got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis expression hardens even more, and his eyes flash. \"They were assholes,\" he says in a low voice. \"Couple of guys from Eastman, underage, so the company really had no choice but to come down hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe liquor has set your insides on fire, and it does feel good, and with a happy eye you lazily survey the contents of the \"dead cabinet.\" Just a lot of boxes and manila envelopes, pretty dusty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one of them on the lowest shelf has been opened. \"What's that one?\" you point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Sean frowns. \"That's funny. If it was opened, someone must've taken a look and decided it wasn't for him. Jack should have sealed it up and sent it back to the sender.\" He kneels and examines the flaps, then looks up at you in surprise. \"It's addressed to your dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel next to him. Sure enough, it's addressed to Salopek care of \"Harris Prescott,\" but the top has been torn completely open. There's nothing inside that you can see except a loose sheet of paper and a lot of packing peanuts. While Sean runs his fingers through the peanuts you take out the paper and unfold it. It's a packing sheet, listing a bunch of items, all very plain and uninteresting, except for one word that leaps out at you: \"Masks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, who's back there?\" a sharp voice calls from the other end of the room. You and Sean both wheel; you crumple up the paper and stuff it into your back pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack,\" Sean calls back. \"Is it quitting time yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's six thirty, it is for you, yeah. Son of a bitch.\" It's dim in the warehouse, but you can make out the shadowy figure of the distribution center overseer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, we're outta here.\" Sean picks up the mystery package and lofts it onto his shoulder. He slaps you lightly on the back. \"You should head back to the front office, check in, see if there's anything you need to do. I'll run this over by your dad's office, see if there was some kind of mix up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly toy with offering to take it yourself, but you really don't want to see your dad. You leave Sean and the building supervisor talking at the front counter about the mystery box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nUnlucky you, your dad is in the front office waiting for you. Your heart thumps hard, out of fear he'll smell the alcohol on your breath, but he just gruffly asks about how your first day went, then sends you home. Not until you plop down in your truck do you feel the paper in your pocket and remember to pull it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't seem any more interesting on closer inspection, listing two books; one manila folder; three bags, each containing \"metallic strips (3)\"; five masks; and a roll of undeveloped film. Naturally, you frown over the word \"masks,\" though it obviously shouldn't have anything to do with your discovery at Arnholm's. But why would anyone be sending masks of any type to your dad at his work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the top of the packing list, and the mystery deepens. The return address is some town in New York, but it's not addressed to your dad at all, but to someone named Shabbleman in the town of Cuthbert. A twitch passes through your upper back: You have relatives named Shabbleman who live in Cuthbert, a backwater hillbilly town a few hours drive from Saratoga Falls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?\" you ask him later that evening. \"Did Sean Mitchell drop off a package at your office near the end of work, after you saw me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. What's the story?\" You tell him briefly about finding the box in the distribution center. \"He must've missed me while I was talking to you. By the way, have you started looking through that work binder yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to show him the packing list, but the sentence dies on your lips. There's probably a company policy against walking off with documents. You tell him you were studying the binder up in your room, and that's what reminded you about the package, then trot back upstairs before he can tell you to return to the books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSean confirms your dad's deduction the next day, telling you that he had to return the box to the distribution center and that Jack would be handling it. And, like your dad, he asks if you studied the binder. \"There's some pretty dangerous stuff around here, and you have to know how to avoid it, since you're not cleared to handle it.\" You nod your head dutifully, but he gets a playfully skeptical look. \"Come on, let's give you a quiz.\" He leads you into a back room in a small building and opens up a cabinet that's stacked high and deep with bottles. \"What's the stuff you shouldn't touch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs. \"Good policy. But c'mon, more specific.\" He alternately nods and shakes his head as you pick your way through. \"Yeah, those two are the worst things to get into,\" he says, pointing to two big brown bottles with big red stickers on them. This stuff\u2014\" He reaches up to take a bottle, but it slips from his hand and shatters on the floor. You step back, but he is even quicker. \"Watch out!\" he yells, and grabs you around the shoulders. As you topple backward, you feel his warm hand upon your forehead ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou wake with a groan to find your nostrils filled with a terrible stench. A rather ashen-faced Sean peers down at you. \"Well, no real harm done,\" he says. \"Hope you enjoyed your nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid me, I knocked something off the shelf. You got a snootful. I got it covered up with sawdust and it'll be okay, but you were out for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself paling. \"Should I head over to the infirmary?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakes his head. \"A nap is the worst thing that happens. I'll have to report myself, though.\" He swears softly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's the start of a run of bad luck at work. The next day you're knocked to the ground by a heavy box, and on Wednesday you bang your head hard on some machinery. Sean chides you for your clumsiness, but says he won't report it: \"Just learn to be more careful,\" he tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the following Monday brings the worst yet. You managed to finish polishing up the new mask over the weekend, and on your way home from work you stop by the elementary school to check the status of your supplies, as you're not sure whether you have enough material to make another mask. To your horror, you find that your lock has been removed from the door and that the basement has been rearranged\u2014apparently the maintenance staff has found your hiding place. Desperately you search for your stuff but find it's all gone, including bags of dirt you filched from the cemetery. You break out sweating as you tear through and cabinets, and with a groan discover that the mask you made of yourself has also been removed. In fact, it looks like someone knew exactly what to look for and what to take, for as near as you can tell only the things you brought down or made have gone missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank your lucky stars that you kept the book back at your bedroom instead of stashing it here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head is spinning as you head over to your house, but you've no time to get it all sorted out. Umeko's car is out front, and you find her in the living room, talking to your mom and brother. Her eyes twinkle as she turns toward you. \"So, what movie do you want to see?\" she asks you without preamble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beg pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes crinkle in that adorable manner that sets your heart thumping. \"Don't you want to see a movie with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do!\" Robert says, leaping off the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoot him a dirty look. This is an unexpected, though welcome, surprise, and you'd like her all to yourself. On the other hand, you are severely distracted by what you found\u2014or didn't find\u2014back at the elementary school, and are not sure your head would be in the right spot for any kind of play date with your cousin.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the mask hidden behind your back, you saunter into Robert's room and lean inside the open doorway; he is instant messaging, and glances irritably over his shoulder. \"What do <i>you</i> want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just being nosy,\" you reply. \"I wanted to see how a loser wastes his Saturday evenings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go watch yourself in a mirror,\" he retorts. \"At least I've got something to keep myself busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk,\" you cluck. \"If you call that 'keeping busy.' You can't even get a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where's <i>your</i> date,\" he says sarcastically. \"Oh yeah, she broke up with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I <i>had</i> a girlfriend to break up with me,\" you snigger. \"Poor little Bobby\u2014\" he hates the diminutive form of his name \"\u2014can't even get a girl.\" He ignores you and just keeps tapping away at the keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis isn't going the way you intended; you were hoping to provoke a fight that would lead to your sitting on him and pushing the mask onto his face. But maybe this will work just as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand behind his chair. He continues to ignore you, though he tenses his shoulders. You expect him to whip around at any moment and yell at you, but when he doesn't you just calmly reach around with both hands and press the mask against his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands fly up and he twists in his chair, but you just keep pressing the mask against him. It suddenly feels very warm against your palms, and even as he pulls at your fingers his strength ebbs away and his arms fall to his side. You keep holding the mask\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014and then you feel it melting away. You look down in astonishment: your hands are pressing against your brother's bare cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush over and close his bedroom door, and as you turn back he slumps out of his chair. Quickly, you pull him up and drag him onto his bed, where you peer down at him. He is breathing shallowly, with his eyes open. There is no sign of the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, you watch and bite your lips. Where has the mask gone? What has it done to him? You knew it was a terrible risk trying this magical thing out on someone\u2014that's why you didn't want to try it on yourself\u2014but the realization that you might have irreparably harmed your own brother isn't long in sinking in. You sit on the edge of his bed, with a sick feeling in your stomach, as you watch, hoping that things will turn out alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes pass, and nothing seems to happen. You've just about given up, and are trying to figure out what (if anything) you should tell your parents, when Robert's face begins to glow\u2014and then the mask reappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snatch it up and peer anxiously at Robert. His eyes are now closed, and he's breathing deeply; it appears to be nothing worse than a heavy sleep. You watch him carefully for a few moments, and then turn your attention to the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is the glint of an image in its polished surface, and as you look more carefully you see that it now holds the pale, ghostly image of Robert's face, reproduced like a 3-D image in the mask's surface. As you turn the mask this way and that, you note that it gives you glimpses not only of his face but of the sides and top of his head; you can even see part of his shoulders and chest when you turn it about to the right angle. It looks as though the mask has reproduced not just his face but his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to creep out of his room when you get a sudden thought, and dip into his closet to snag a shirt and a pair of pants. Then you scurry out before he can wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got the mask and his clothes hidden, and are perusing the next spell in the book\u2014which the newly imprinted mask has unlocked\u2014when your bedroom door flies open. Robert stands there, with a bewildered and angry look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell was\u2014\" he starts, and then stops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" you say with studied innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't you just\u2014 Didn't you\u2014?\" His brow furrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just woke up!\" He says it like it's an accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around carefully. \"And ... isn't it about time to go to bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glowers at you, but apparently can't find anything to say. \"Just stay out of my room!\" he finally shouts, and stomps off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nWhen you turned the newly unlocked page in the book, you discovered some new information about the mask: it will continue to \"absorb\" new body images each time it is laid upon a face, melding new images with old and thus creating new faces, until it is \"sealed.\" Upon reflection, you decided this means that if you now laid the mask upon your own face\u2014and you've no real qualms about doing that, now that you've seen the mask in action\u2014it will create a new form that looks like someone halfway between you and your brother. This would be a useful feature if you wanted to change your appearance without looking exactly like someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were more eager to check that it can actually work as a disguise. This involves \"sealing\" the mask, which the next spell describes how to do. It was too late Saturday evening to work on it, and you had church the next morning, so Sunday afternoon after lunch was the earliest that you could get around to testing it out. You were nervous, because your parents were still home, and you remembered the mess and the smell when you'd made the mask, but you took a chance anyway. It was well worth it, though. The new spell, which only required some of the materials you already had on hand, was much less noisome and explosive, and resulted in a thin, paint-like liquid that was easy to brush on the inside of the mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now holding the newly sealed mask and are laying, naked, on your bed. It's a moment of truth: different from, but in its own way just as fraught, as the moment when you hit Robert with it. Even if you survive the experiment, it will be disappointing if it doesn't work as advertised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you lower the mask onto your face. For a brief moment you are very conscious that it fits snugly against you, and that there are no eyeholes or mouth hole for breathing: no wonder Robert seemed on the verge of passing out when you attacked him with it. Then, with a gasp, you feel the mask sinking into your face. All your limbs go rigid. Your heart hammers briefly, then is still. You are very numb all over, and a great weight seems to be oppressing your brain. You feel very drowsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAnd then you feel yourself spring upright. You are stiff all over, and you groan. What has happened? You arch your back to get the kinks out, and stretch an arm. You were trying on the mask and\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down. Your legs look funny: not as thick, and slightly darker, with thinner hair on the calves. Your toenails are longer, too, as are your fingers, when you glance at them. You touch your chest and feel only a light, downy patch beneath your fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hop up and look in the mirror: Robert's face gazes back. Except it's not the same. In fact, it's totally wrong, all back to front or something. It's like looking at his face distorted in a funhouse mirror. Sure, the hair is the right color\u2014a dark brown\u2014but even combed it lays the wrong way on your scalp. The eyes are the right shade of green, but the eyebrows run off malignantly in strange directions. You grimace, and the lips leer. Even the birthmark beside the nose is on the wrong side\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it hits you. You're looking at Robert's face in a mirror, when you're used to looking at it straight on. <i>This</i> is what <i>Robert</i> sees when he looks at himself, and now that <i>you've</i> got his face ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you've got <i>his face</i> ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you pull out the clothes you stole from his room last night and slip them on. That helps with the \"mirror image\" aspect, and when you look in the mirror again you are satisfied with the disguise: the lanky arms and the big hands; the mop of shaggy hair; the mischievous eyes\u2014more mischievous now that <i>you</i> are the one looking out of them\u2014with the one eyebrow that arches satirically upward; the thick lips. You turn around and around, admiring the effect. You are his exact twin. You'd be his <i>evil</i> twin if you weren't so used to thinking of Robert himself as the wicked little brother. Or maybe you could be his <i>even more evil</i> twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought has barely registered when you hear a shout from outside. Cautiously, you glance out the window, to see Umeko coming up the drive, shouting a greeting to your mother. Robert has gone off for the afternoon to hang out with his dorky friends. This would be the perfect chance to get back at him for stealing Umeko away for that movie. Of course, your parents know that Robert has left the house ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drum your fingers and think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be a simple matter to steal into Robert's bedroom and take a pair of his extra sneakers, then climb out your window and hide in the neighborhood for a bit until Umeko started to leave. Then you could \"appear\" as Robert and say or do stupid things that would piss her off. It would be a lovely prank\u2014assuming you didn't somehow get caught out as an imposter. Of course, if you <i>did</i> get caught out, it could lead to problems so serious it's hardly worth thinking about.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Earth shattering things like... see what it was like to be a girl. Or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god.\" you mutter \"The Molester. I could... what? Imitate him? Or maybe frame him. Or... get the body of someone stronger than him and see how HE likes it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin spreads slowly over your face as you lean back on the bed, but it's short lived. The materials you've gathered will probably make one more mask with a little left over (plus the week and more of effort needed to buff it!) but after that you'll have expended your money supply. How on earth can you get enough to make more masks? You'll certainly want a few of them, just what you've thought of so far would need two or three more masks, and you've barely begun to scrape the surface of the possibilities. You're definitely going to need more cash to make use of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach up and press your hand to your face in the way the book described, say the nonsense phrase three times and tear the mask from your face. Fainting dead away you come to a few moments later. Oh you have got to get more used to this! Falling asleep every time you put on or take off a Mask is going to be annoying. As far as getting money for more Masks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOptions... You could, of course, take a part time job?... Naaaah! Not your style. But what about the masks themselves? Could you make a mask, put a merged image of two people in (so it couldn't be traced to a specific person) and sell it? Could be dangerous. What if someone knows about the masks, about the book, and is looking for signs of them? Heck maybe the government is after this thing if it knows about it. You're sure the CIA would kill for a tool like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, maybe you have been watching too much spy thrillers recently, but still it might be risky. But, what if you made a merged mask, used it, then sold another merged mask. They wouldn't be able to trace you as they wouldn't know your face, fingerprints etc. Nothing should lead back to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there is a problem with that. It'll need two more masks, one to use and one to sell. You'll need probably another $200 to do that, maybe a bit less depending on how much materials you've got left after making one more mask. You can't use your current mask of Robert. It might serve your horrible brother right, but he IS your brother. Either using his face to sell a mask and thus leading them back to him, or selling his mask and not knowing what the guy who is buying it would effectively be framing Robert for are things you just aren't willing to do. Besides, either could lead people back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the glossy mask over in your hands, peering at the odd 3D image of Robert shining in the surface. It is intoxicating knowing you can BE someone else, feel just like him, his energy his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you sit bolt upright as a thought occurs to you. You had his energy, his body, you were perfectly him. You'd been feeling a little off lately what with spending so much time on polishing, but with that mask on you had your brothers boundless energy. What if it could do more? What if it could GIVE more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you get off the bed and go back to the window, this time looking over to your neighbor's house. Andrew would pay through the nose for something like this! He could WALK again! </span></div></div>",

Andrew would have to basically give up his life. A Mask of him wouldn't work, those legs would be paralyzed too (if you can even use a mask of yourself!). But a merged mask, though untraceable, would not be him. If he wore it all the time he'd have to get a new identity to go with it. But, that would be his problem. Knowing him he'd probably find a way, 'adopt' the merged mask persona, then fake his death and give everything to the new him? Hmm, maybe he can come up with something better, but it could work. You are pretty sure you can trust him, thus him knowing it's you that have this shouldn't be a problem, though you don't like the idea of him knowing about the book. Maybe tell him you found the 'recipe' for it online? Then of course the website is gone, no trace anywhere, no history etc. You could show him what happened even! When you try to write the instructions down, or type them into a computer they'd vanish! It'd prove it! That way he'd only know you could make masks and not wonder what else you could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could say you bought the mask that you make and are just reselling it to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst though you need a new mask to sell, and that'll take time. Another week most likely. Another week of back breaking labor! Okay, not backbreaking but still not fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the sounds of laughter downstairs and remember that Umeko just arrived. For the moment you hide the mask (NOT under the bed with your porn! You do not want your brother to find this.) and straighten your hair and clothes before striding nonchalantly downstairs. Yes, Umeko and your mother are talking in the living room, Umeko looking fantastic as ever in a powder blue dress, her hair pulled back in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Umeko.\" you say, trying to sound as cool as possible. \"How've you been doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, thanks Will\" She says \"I was just telling Mrs. Prescott about the movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith difficulty you managed to not let your face drop with the reminder that Robert got a 'date' with Umeko. He would pay for that, you'd find a way. Maybe there are a few things you could try with the mask that wouldn't be too risky?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will?\" Umeko says, waving a hand in front of your face. Oops! You drifted there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry Umeko, I just thought of something,\" you say, and before she can ask what you were thinking of, add \"So are you ready for your starring role today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow, probably amazed you remembered about the flute accompaniment she's doing at church. \"I know I am! Why don't you come and listen, Will. I'd like you to hear how well I've practiced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to church is not exactly your idea of fun, but for this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I'd love to Umeko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, tell Robert, I'm sure he'd love to hear too.\"<br>\r\nYou grin through gritted teeth and just nod. Damn, that's probably going to spoil it for you! Maybe you can avoid sitting right next to him? He's bound to be a pain through the whole thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show is fantastic, and of course you are completely unbiased! Afterwards you can't really remember much apart from Umeko's playing (she was accompanying someone, right?) and how she looked, so focused and really having fun up there. That's another thing you've always admired about Umeko. She has no embarrassment on stage or in front of a crowd. You just tend to clam up. Watching her have fun on the flute, knowing that everyone is listening to her playing obviously is a big thing for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the show is over Robert and you almost get in a fight leaving the church trying to get close to Umeko to escort her home, but a cough from a woman behind you stops you both from making a fool of yourselves. Instead you both look daggers at each other the whole way home and both miss out on chatting with Umeko. Infuriating, and of course it's all Roberts fault!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day is back to school and although there is a temptation to take Robert's Mask into school and play some sort of prank on him you do manage to resist. You don't want to be found with a Mask, let alone for someone to find out what they do! This week does seem less intensive on homework, at least from English, and Physics at least you're good at and can deal with it pretty handily (mostly). That leaves you with quite a few nights of full time burnishing your new mask that you fabricated Sunday night. You have to find a better place to do this, blowing the smoke out the window will only work so long, and your Dad complained about the smell again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEffort on the Mask goes well, and it is mostly done by Wednesday night. On Thursday, though you can't wait to get home to finish the Mask off, things side track you. Well, one particular 'Thing'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Prescott, I was just thinking my fist needed a bit of practice and what do I find? A perfect punching bag? I guess I'm just lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLester The Molester! Oh shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know by now that it doesn't really help to try to talk back to him, it just speeds up the pummeling you'll get... or not. Sometimes he just gets off on the fear in your eyes, the not knowing if Lester will flatten you or not. Unfortunately this isn't one of those times and you stagger to your next class trying to catch your breath after having the wind knocked out of you. At least he didn't give you a black eye. Explaining that to Dad might be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the rest of the day thinking up ways to deal with Lester once you have the money to make as many Masks as you want. A particular favorite is Using a Lester Mask and a merged mask to frame Lester for murder of guy who doesn't even exist! Tricky to pull off but no way to counter it! Even if it never goes to trial the arrest will be on his record forever!<br>\r\nAs you leave Math class at the end of the day you bump into Caleb. \"Hey Prescott. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've seen Caleb a couple of times through the week so far, mostly at your locker, but had been a little preoccupied to say much. From his face he might be worried about you. What have you done wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing much. Got molested, got picked for a verbal presentation in English for next week. That's gonna suck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear you man, so... any word from your Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clench your eyes tight at the familiar question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Caleb, he doesn't trust you, OK? I'll keep trying, and maybe he will put your name forwards, but don't count on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't trust me? Why?\" he says looking genuinely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps that whole 'shoplifting' thing last year...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! You know I was framed for that! I just wish I knew who slipped those magazines in my coat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right.\" you say, chuckling. Magazines was a little too high brow a name for what Caleb had been caught with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Caleb looks like he is going to retort back, but then he stops and stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, what did you do with Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you manage intelligently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't asked once if I talked to Eva about Lisa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hits you. In all your focusing on the Masks you'd completely forgotten about Lisa. Well, not forgotten, just thinking about different things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been busy.\" you say lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what? What could possibly tear the great Will Prescott away from the plan to re-unite with Lisa?\"</span></div></div>",

Oh come on, surely you're over her by now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, like you haven't drooled over her when you bumped into her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't related.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the conversation is predictabl, getting nowhere whatsoever, but doing it loudly. After parting outside school you head home thankful that you can get back to finishing the second Mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you get home the conversation from today comes back to you. What about Lisa? Is there any way a Mask could help get her back? You could make a merged Mask and use that to try and date her as someone else? But that strikes you as a lose-lose situation. If she rejects the new you she still won't be with Will Prescott, and if she doesn't reject him it'll just prove it was the real you that was the problem the whole time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you can't face that, and the only other way you can think you daren't do. Making a Mask of Lisa. Not only wouldn't it feel right you'd probably never get the courage up to wear the damn Mask after you fixed it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the whole idea on the back burner for now until you can find a way that a Mask could help with Lisa. Instead you finish burnishing the Mask while watching evening TV. After an hour and a half it's finally an even glossy blue, deep like crystal just like the first Mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow comes the decision you've been putting off all week. Who to put in the mask for Andrew? You aren't even sure what blending two people in a Mask would actually do. Is it a straight blend between them? Looking as if you were their kid? Hmm, there is the other issue of how to get the images to put in the Mask. Oh, well you and Andrew could just put both your faces on the Mask? That would keep it private at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, that should work, and use the Robert Mask to prove the masks work. Oh this should be interesting. Besides you always liked Andrew. He works at home on his programs (you are still not sure if he is freelance or works at home for a corporation) so he should be in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get some clothes that will fit both you and Robert then head to Andrew's before you can talk yourself out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Who is it?\" comes the familiar response to your knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avon calling. They want their money back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle he opens the door, pulling his wheelchair out of the way to let you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do I owe the pleasure your company Will?\" He says, leading you into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna sound weird Andy, but I ain't shitting you.\" You get out the Mask. \"This thing can make you walk again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence falls and Andrew turns to you with a fierce expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't joke about that man! This shit is serious. I ain't some kind of freak for your...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll prove it!\" you interrupt and (remembering to sit down on the couch this time) you put on the Robert Mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar sensations wash over you as the Mask sticks, you focus as much as you can as you weave, and for a moment you think you can stay conscious ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to see Andrew's shocked face peering down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JEEEZUS! What the hell was that!\" he gasps, touching the side of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is worth a grand, Andy. A heck of a lot cheaper than any of the medical asshole's treatments they pushed on you. This one is my brother, I don't want you wandering around as him, but we can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who whoah a minute!\" He says, getting up close to your face. \"Backtrack. This one what? What the hell have you got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin up at him with Robert's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I have is something I stumbled across online, Andy. A recipe for making Masks that can record what someone looks like, then project that onto whoever wears the Mask! Is that cool or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You found this online?\" he asks suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of weird, but it's there, and it's not. Look I'll show you. You got a pen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew rummages around and finds one and hands it to you with a notepad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, the recipe is like this...\" and you start writing, or attempting to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Andrew says as he sees nothing being written, \"I'll find a working pen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin up at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is working. Look.\" and you write your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Andrew takes the pen and checks it out, finding it works just fine \"This is some sort of joke right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Got me at first though. The original thing is in Latin. Bitch to translate, especially when you can't type or write any of it down. Even on a computer it just vanishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, if it can't be written down how did they write it for the website?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got me, and now I can't even find the website, my browser doesn't even have a history on it, web-address, nothing. It's as if it never existed. The only way to 'store' the instructions is in here.\" You tap your head. \"Maybe it's some sort of safety feature of... whatever this thing is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew slumps back in his chair, exhausted despite barely doing anything physical since you arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I have to look like your brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I tried to tell you earlier this Mask is off limits. I don't like my brother, but having two of him around would be too much to bear. Seriously, you don't want to look like someone who already exists. However, this\" and you hold up the Mask you finished today \"is a blank one. Put it on a face and it records the image of that person. Put it on another face after that and it merges the two into a new, composite, body. Presto! We 'fix' the Mask and you have a new body with legs that work. I'm afraid you'd have to try to figure out some way to change your life over to the new you, but I'll help with that if I can, even if I have to wear the Mask I'm selling you or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew peers down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is something from a friend that I have to pay a Grand for? Some friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up, still a little off balance, not used to Robert's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You don't know the materials and effort to make one of these. It's not easy, I need the money to make more masks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew squints, a faint smile forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ain't telling me everything, Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder, you could just bluff it out, but this is Andrew. He's a pretty smart cookie and if you start using stuff from later in the book and he notices...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, there was more than instructions on making a Mask on that site. Some of it I... I don't know what it was. I just know it takes a lot of cash in materials and a lot of my time. It's emptied my bank account on just two Masks, and this one of Robert I'll probably never get to use! He's a dweeb but he IS my Brother. I'm not gonna get him arrested or anything. This Mask I'm offering is going to make you able to walk which no-one else has been able to give you. Frankly I think that it's pretty good of me to offer it to my friend rather than sell this on the black market!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew just laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm sure you have tons of contacts in the criminal underworld, Will.\" He drums his fingers on the arm of his wheelchair for a few moments and ponders. \"OK, I might consider your deal but I get to test out this Mask now. I can't be sure I really will be able to walk with this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, hang on a sec. To take one of these things off put your fingers like this,\" you press fingers and thumb to temple and nose, grip your face and pull, \"Ungh, pull while saying this.\" and you recite the phrase you learned three times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ripping sensation is very weird, though not actually painful. This time you actually manage to stay conscious, though it's close, and waver, shaking your head as Andrew stares at you.<br>\r\n\"Are you OK?\" he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit weird, but after a few times you get used to it. You'll probably pass out the first time. Here, give it a go.\" and you hand over the Mask to Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively he presses it to his face and convulses, collapsing in the chair before the Mask melts into him. Seeing the changes in someone else is incredible, like a scifi show! You can see muscles shifting, bones moving around into new configurations. You wait nervously and a after a minute 'Robert' wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... My voice!\" he gasps, and looks up at you. He's shrunk and his clothes are now rather loose on him. Going the other way could be tricky. Have to strip to sure you wouldn't do yourself an injury with your own clothes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this enough proof Andrew?\" you say, stepping over and taking 'Robert's' hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you pull, easing him up off the wheelchair till he is standing, amazed, under his own power.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! It's true! Sheeit!\" he starts to dance, and nearly falls over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait a bit, gotta get used to your new legs there MJ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, you have definitely got a deal, Will. God, you're right, this is way worth a thousand bucks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya think I should raise the price then?\" He freezes and grimaces at you \"Joking! God can't take a joke man! So should we do the Mask thing now? I was figuring mix me and you together should make someone no-body would recognize, plus the body should be half way between our ages. Gives you a little fountain of youth thing, hmm?\"</span></div></div>",

Will, you have absolutely no idea, do you? This thing is not worth a thousand bucks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, millions right? But if I go to some research lab they're gonna lock me in a cell so I can't tell anyone about it and the CIA will suddenly have a new toy. Come on, I'm not that dumb! Besides I want to help out my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew smiles and nods, then goes to remove the Mask as you showed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" you cry, \"Sit down for gods sake first. Your legs won't work after, plus taking it off'll knock you out again anyways. Best to sit or lay down while you take it on or off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha.\" he says, sits back down, utters the phrase three times, and rips the Mask off. \"oooooAaaaahhhhhhssshit!\" he groans, and you blink. He stayed awake! The first time he used the Mask and he's getting used to it quicker than you! Damn! Shaking off the jealousy you wave the blank mask in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This takes the image by melting into your face... it's OK! It just kind of merges, you saw it with me right? Anyway, it melts in and... I guess takes an image of your body. Takes a while. Ten, fifteen minutes tops. Then the Mask emerges again and a few moments later the guy being 'scanned' wakes up. Bingo recorded body. The Mask won't work then so you can keep recording images. When you 'fix' it you can't record images any more. Then anyone who wears the Mask becomes that image. Take a look in the surface of my brother's Mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew shakes some of the fog from his brain and peers into the Mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! Looks like a hologram or something, but that's him alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that way we can get an idea of what the finished body will look like before we fix it. If the combination of you and me isn't to your liking we can keep adding people to the Mask, slightly changing it's features till it's right. Once fixed though you can't change it at all. Make sure it's what you want before we finish. You'll have to live with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew looks askance at you. \"You? Giving me Life Lessons? Now this is a role reversal!\" You both laugh at that, but soon Andrew is staring down at the blank Mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" you say. \"Well me first I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay back and press the blank Mask to your face. You make a real effort to stay awake, despite the discomfort, but knowing what's happening doesn't help. A short time later you wake groggily to see Andrew turning the Mask over in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, your image alright. I was waiting for you to wake up before I did me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for you to respond he presses the Mask to his face as well. Just like with your brother you watch as it melts in and you are relieved to find that Andrew faints dead away this time. Maybe 'scanning' always knocks you unconscious? Just using the Mask is different you guess, and you can resist the fainting if you try hard enough. When the Mask emerges you study the face within. It's definitely not you or Andrew but it is a tiny bit like both of you. You're not sure it's half way between you, but it's definitely someone new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, that's gonna be a bitch!\" Andrew mutters waking up slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's any consolation, I think it's designed to knock out whoever it scans. Using a finished Mask is a different story,\" you say it like it's obvious, despite you only having worked it out yourself a moment ago. \"If you use the finished Mask regularly I'm sure you can eventually do it without a twinge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see.\" he says, motioning to the Mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss it to him and he peers into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I definitely like it!\" he says. \"Looks a bit like Uncle Louis, without the beard... and a lot younger.\"</span></div></div>",

I want to use it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, by some strange coincidence I brought the materials to fix it with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew raised an eyebrow. \"OK, you planning ahead? What did you do with Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA ha, very funny. So you don't want me to fix it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew holds his hands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give! Uncle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, you get the mixture you already made and the brush for it out and hold your hand out for the Mask. Andrew hands it to you and you carefully paint the inside of the Mask, making sure not to miss anything. When you're done you hand it back to Andy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Trust me, making the mixture takes a while, but nothing compared to making the Masks. Those take about a week to do for me with School etc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdly he reaches in his wallet and virtually empties it, handing three hundred bucks over to you. You grin as he peers at the Mask intently. Eventually he licks his lips and presses it to his face. The familiar shuddering passes over him and the Mask melts into him while his body shifts and changes. Damn! You meant to tell him about your thought about clothes! You watch and see his legs tear his pants at the thighs, but the rest seems OK, slack if anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" he manages, still conscious! Damn he's getting good at this! \"Next time I'm wearing something more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, and with a silly grin on his face, Andrew stands up. He's a little wobbly but OK.<br>\r\nThe new Andy looks slightly shorter, maybe Nineteen or Twenty by looks, short cropped dark hair, brown eyes and fairly ordinary looking features. He probably looks a little better than you to be honest... which you rarely are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd, this feels stiffer than the other Mask.\" He says wriggling his legs a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck, Robert is hyperactive, what can you expect! I felt weird in his body too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both glance at each other after you realize what you just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fag!\" Andy says laughing at you, but is too focused on his working legs to make much fun of you. \"Hmm, I think it might be more than that actually, maybe merging me and you was a bad idea? I think it got part of my paralysis into the image, just not fully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slap you hand against your head. Why didn't you think of that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn I'm sorry, but the legs work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexes his toes and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, good enough for government work. Hmm, maybe if I get the cash together we can make a mask up without me as a donor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's offering to buy another Mask? Oh perfect! Got to make sure he stays interested then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, boy or girl?\" you say nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew's eyes go wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\" he says, and you can't help but let a grin split your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want a Mask of a boy or a girl? What, you telling me you never thought about that this whole time I was explaining it? Anyone this scans is stored, then you wear the Mask and you ARE that person. Doesn't have to be the same sex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh shit! That's kind of freaky.\" He looks as if he's not as into the idea as you are. Hmm, maybe not a good way to keep him interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you can decide that later, for now this should do fine. I ought to head out and start buying supplies. Some of the stores I need close at ten on Sunday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand Andrew grabs you and hugs tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT going to forget this Will. Thanks for thinking of me first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and hug back. \"No problem Andy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving, you leave him with his new Mask, taking the Robert Mask with you. It's getting late so you dash out to try and get the supplies you need. It's a pinch but you manage to get enough to make two more masks and head home. Crashing down on your bed you look at the table where you made the last two Masks. Not good enough. You need somewhere private to do this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the obvious strikes you. The clubhouse! OK, you haven't been there in months but the locks should still be good. You stumbled across the Clubhouse a few years ago now, a basement in an abandoned Elementary school, but even though some of the upper building has been renovated and turned into a community center no-one thought to do anything with the basement. You put a lock on to be sure no-one could spoil your fun... or at least you'd know when they bolt cut the padlock, and have used it to hang out at with a few friends for years. It'd make the perfect place to make foul stenches and burn stuff and no-one would find out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to wait till tomorrow night you keep an eye out for your parents and brother and once they've all gone to bed you head out to the Clubhouse with bags full of supplies. You've got the instructions down pretty good now and manage to do the operation without referring to the book and the horrible job of translating. When you return to your house at 1AM you have two new gray Masks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get an idea and use a couple of old belts to strap the Masks, one to each knee. Then you use the proscribed cloth and buff them, one with each hand. You'll have to shift the belts to burnish those parts of it, but this'll cut your time in half... though after a few minutes of this you find it's more tiring than before as well. For tonight you give in, put the masks away and head to bed, but soon you'll have another two blank Masks to play with. Well, next week you will anyway. Maybe you can get some polishing done over the weekend?</span></div></div>",

Your mom is rather over protective and would be coming in and out with chicken soup and pills all day. The possibility that she'll interrupt you while you're polishing would be high, and you want to keep the whole thing as secret as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school you manage to avoid the Molester, a small miracle in itself, and remember to ask Caleb about Lisa. Again he hasn't talked to Eva but you seem less angry at him now. Are you letting her go or just getting way to involved with the Masks to think about much else? Or are you burying your emotions on the subject? You don't think so, but how would you know? You're not used to thinking about your emotions like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening as you reach your house you see Andrew's door open and he waves you in. Smiling you head over. He's still in his old body, in the wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So given up on the new body already? Come on, you can't have worn it out that quick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Har har!\" he says, and pulls the mask from under the wheelchair as he pushes the front door shut. \"Right now I'm keeping Freddy to myself. I still haven't got all the details of how to 'inherit' Andrew Gary's fortune down pat and don't want to do something to mess things up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortune?\" you snort. \"Since when are you loaded! You make a hell of a lot more than me, but still, you ain't loaded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Andrew head into the living room as he peers into his Mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not now, but if I can figure out a way to get the life insurance money... Who boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, you think big. How can you pull that off without a body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, a few details aren't there yet.\" You shake your head laughing \"Hey I'll get it, don't you worry! Hey want a beer?\" You nod and he wheels into the kitchen, but comes back running in his new body. \"Catch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing that change damn fast!\" you comment, a little acidly but take a sip from your beer and try to relax. \"I'm just glad that it's working for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's better than just 'working'. It's incredible. Still feels a little stiff but I've managed to work out enough to run and jump a bit. Feels a bit like arthritis or something, but minimal. I'll definitely need another mask later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you take another sip of beer something lands in your lap with a slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven hundred, as promised, in twenties. I figured if your buying chemicals and stuff from stores you don't want it to be in too large a bills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the thick wedge of cash and grin wolfishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Andrew, this will really help. Damn!\" you say, as you realize you didn't check the materials for the new item. Will what you bought work for that? You glanced at the instructions for the new metal strips earlier in the week, but with all the polishing you didn't want to distract from what you were doing. Well, that and the damn text didn't describe what the thing was supposed to do! You'd rather make Masks that you're sure of than leaping into the unknown, well for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Andrew asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just realizing I'd forgotten about something I wanted to try,\" you say lamely, trying to sound casually interested only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, what? The next item after the Mask? What is it?\" he asks eagerly. Damn, you should have kept your mouth shut!</span></div></div>",

Frankly it's not far from the truth. Who knows what the strip does? \"Look, you're really getting into your new body, I need to sort some things out, so do you mind if I head out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew looks a little disappointed but waves goodbye good naturedly from the living-room, unwilling to change back to let you out. You lock the door and close it and head home. Well at least Andrew is getting some immediate use out of these things! You have a useless mask (well, nearly useless), two blank ones that still need a lot of polishing... and a wad of cash? OK, so not a total loss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning you bound upstairs, giving only a cursory \"I'm home!\" to your mom before dashing upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening you get next to no polishing done. If it isn't Robert annoying you it's your mom wanting to get you to be involved with the church more, or your dad demanding you do your chores. Luckily no-one sees what you're doing, but it's still frustrating. In the end you go to bed early and set your alarm for 1AM. Dashing out in the dead of night you unlock the Clubhouse and start polishing in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost stay too long, but manage to get home before everyone gets up in the morning. Tired and irritated you spend Saturday morning doing more chores (did this household really make this much trash in a day?) but by mid-day you manage to head out and again go to the Clubhouse to polish. Watching TV while polishing the two Masks on your knees is very tiring. You can't alternate between arms and they ache like mad. Plus, nice as it is in here it is a little claustrophobic. Though it's tiring you get both masks mostly done by the afternoon, but are way too tired to continue. You rest a little before heading home, making sure to lock up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Sunday (after church) you head back and pick up where you left off, but it's way too stuffy for you in here right now. The masks look mostly done. Only two days of work, but very intensive two days. Maybe you can take them in public? It'd be nice to get some fresh air, but would it be safe? Well, who knows about them anyway? It's not as if they'll work until their polished fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile you head to the park, leaving the belts behind and deciding to focus on one at a time for the last little bit. It's a sunny day at least, a little too hot for the clothes your wearing actually, but you don't want to go back and change now. Sitting at a bench you set one Mask on the table and start burnishing the other Before mid-day you have one finished and swap over, watching wispy clouds drift across the sky as you polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARROOOOooo-up!\" comes the plaintiff bark, cut short and you turn in time to see the mask you just finished melt into the forehead of a large Doberman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo!\" you leap over to the dog as it lays unconscious on the ground. \"That's not possible, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have leaped up at the shiny mask and knocked it off the table and onto its face.<br>\r\nGlancing around you don't see anyone searching for their dog so wait in silence for the time to be up. What if it's longer for a dog? What if the thing can't scan a dog and stays like this forever! What if...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you see the Mask return, is that slower than before? You think so. There was absolutely NO mention of animals in the book. If this isn't what the mask was designed for, who knows what the results will be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of slowly emerging it is free and you grab the mask and run, not wanting to be around the dog when it wakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart is pounding when you get home, collapsing on your bed. You put the nearly polished mask away and stare at the dog mask. Yep, in the crystal finish you can see the image of that Doberman. It's recorded the body of a dog! Wait, could that actually work? Could you BECOME a dog? Oh this is getting weirder and weirder.</span></div></div>",

It's just too tempting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strip this time, not wanting to risk damage to your clothes or you in the process. Laying on on your side on the bed you bring the mask up to your face and slowly take a deep breath and press it home before you can second guess yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PAIN!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou writhe around on the bed in panic, searing bolts of white hot lead pouring through your face and into your body. Luckily the mask covers your mouth so muffles your screams of terror, otherwise your mom or dad might have burst in while you were changing! You aren't thinking about that though, the mind numbing agony is high on your list of things to be concentrating on, but it doesn't last. Your body seems to take much longer, as much as a minute or more before the mask fully melts into you and your body succumbs to unconsciousness but eventually you do. While you sleep your body distorts and shifts till a Doberman is laying on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsciousness returns in a painful haze, but thankfully it's receding. Will you have to go through that again when you take the mask off? Suddenly panic fills you. TAKE THE MASK OFF! How can you say the words that remove the mask? You're a DOG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thump you roll off the bed and land on the floor. Oh this is weird. You feel like you're in a monster suit, twisted like a pretzel. Rear legs are... tricky. Like standing on your toes the whole time, but also the front legs; balanced on your fingers... er paws. Twice you fall over to your side but eventually to stay upright, if a bit wobbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you can stand pretty well... you collapse to the floor! Struggling you fumble your paws up to your face and press, trying to grip your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrroo Ruff!\" you bark, trying to say the words, desperately. You repeat it twice more and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pain!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it's not so bad. Perhaps, like Andrew, you're getting used to this. It's just worse when it's not a human body! You still writhe around on the floor in pain, but surprisingly don't faint.<br>\r\n\"Will?\" comes your mother's voice as you shakily pull the mask from your, now human, face. \"Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y.. Yes mom,\" you manage, and struggle under the covers to hide your nakedness, but she doesn't come in. Relaxing you try to let the memory of that swell of agony subside. Would you do that again? It was easier taking it off, hopefully next time to put it on it wouldn't hurt so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later you wake, realizing you fell asleep without noticing! The clock says 4PM, you've slept three hours. Still a little of the day left. You hide the dog mask next to Robert's and take the nearly polished mask out. You head out with the intention of going to the Clubhouse, but instead head into town. You aren't sure where you're going at first, then realize what it is. The Zoo is nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling you idly polish the mask while you head in. Do you really want to waste another mask on an animal? There are all sorts of things you could be doing. At very least get a girl body to fondle at night. Still you find yourself wandering around the Zoo trying to see if any animal sparks your imagination.</span></div></div>",

The head of this huge snake is not as big as you'd have thought given it's bulky body. Would the mask work if it can't fit on the creature's face? Hmm, well this one is the biggest snake here and it's face is maybe the size of a toddler's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were only passing by the Reptile house but suddenly had a thought. Snakes are incredibly strong. Thinking back to Lester you wondered if you could deal with him. Walking in you thought better of it, after all after you do attack him, having him talk about being squeezed by a snake might get people into checking for weird things at the school, if anyone believed him that is. You don't want that much attention. As you looked around at all the various snakes in here you imagined squeezing the hell out of him, then realized it would do you little good. After all he wouldn't know it was you doing it, and if he DID know... you'd be in even worse trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought brings you to an abrupt halt. Could you really kill Lester? OK he has given so much pain to you and seems to revel in it, you know he is going to go on to being evil outside of school... but kill him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in at a large puff adder, this species venom could kill. Could you really do that? But how would you dispose of the body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you saw the Anaconda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you could get a mask on it. If it works it would be child's play to... deal with Lester, and then... eat him? Would that work? It would sure do away with the evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more you peer in at the snake the more you like the idea. You've never liked snakes much, but not really disliked them either, and now with your new perspective you can imagine being inside a snake's body and the thought of sinuously moving around like that is definitely interesting. It's face is dark, greens and yellow-green mottled patterns, and honestly you kind of like it. It looks... serene somehow. Unfortunately it's in a large tank with a sealed hatch. You can see a lock from here. Caleb is better at this than you, but... You get out your tool kit, originally for electrical repairs but you've added some finer tools and picks, and peer around. The room is dark and you are fairly sure no-one is looking. Wait, what about cameras? Again you peer around and can't see any. The Zoo is seriously under funded but would they really have no cameras?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne final check and you step up onto the ledge, reaching up to the high hatch. Why is it so high up? Hmm, maybe so the snake doesn't get out as easily when it's opened? The lock is simple and snicks open seconds later. Easier than the tumblers to the girl's locker rooms! You get out the mask that you finished polishing as you were wandering around the Zoo and hold it over the snake's head. If you drop it and miss, or the snake dodges away you won't get it back! Quickly you pull out a power cord you were going to use at the Clubhouse and loop it loosely over. Easily you lower it down, planning on swinging it over the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Snap!* the snake's head shoots up, snaps at the lip of the Mask and pulls it free of the cord!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" you whisper, as the snake nibbles it, then drops it. Wasted! How are you going to get it now! You're not climbing in there with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare unbelieving as the snake's head pokes around the mask, then wriggles under it. It must have covered something it wanted. With a jerk the Mask sticks, it works! The snake starts thrashing around, then slows, finally stopping at the mask melts in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let the door pull-to, but not lock, and step down from the ledge. You've got ten minutes or so, maybe longer. You think the dog took a bit more than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's incredible, and you really can't believe that it worked, well you haven't got the mask to try out yet, but so far it's working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple wander through, peering in at the snakes and you nervously look at your watch, then at the Anaconda. The time's up and the Mask hasn't reappeared! They leave and you dash to the tank. Nope, still no Mask. Fretfully you cast about, hoping something hasn't gone wrong. Another ten minutes go by and you are about to bail out of here when a slight blue glow comes from the snake's head. Quickly you get on the ledge and open the hatch and lean in. You reach down and grab the Mask just as it's finished emerging, the snake still asleep. Pulling back you hear the hatch click as the lock engages and you look at your prize. Yep, the image of a snake head is there, body trailing below out of sight. God damn it worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, you keep reminding yourself. Can't get your hopes up yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's with great trepidation that you head out, almost heading for the clubhouse, but you are tired after all the tension back there and there aren't any beds in that basement. It'd be private but really uncomfortable. When you get home your Dad is out late at 'The Company' but your mom greets you pleasantly. She's still watching her soaps on the living room TV and doesn't really seem interested in chatting. Thankfully. You just want to sleep, but are intoxicated with the idea of the snake Mask.</span></div></div>",

This is so freaky! A snake. What's next, a Shark? An Eagle? Now there's a thought! Wait, are there any bird's heads that would fit the mask? Even closely? Hmmm probably not. Bummer, it'd cool to fly like a bird, or rather BE a bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdly you pick up the fixing solution and nervously paint the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's done. Now to test it. You strip and hop on the bed, holding the Mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUm, yeah. Test it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you're still staring at the thing, wondering if you'll ever have the courage to put it on. Have you wasted yet another Mask? Laying the Mask carefully on your bed you go back to the book and leaf through what you can open. No matter how well you search, how carefully you translate, there is no mention of animals at all. Just 'people', or 'corpus' which does mean person or body, or several other things but not human. It could have said 'hominis' or something close which WOULD mean human or body or person, but it uses 'corpus' Is that on purpose? Being generalized to make the magic work? Who knows how this stuff works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh you close the book and turn back to the Mask. You can't put this off... OK, you can, but you aren't going to. This is just too fun an idea. OK, you don't want to, but you want to. It's gonna hurt, but it will be fun, and at least you know you can get back to human again. For the next few minutes your mind whirls, thinking contrary thoughts on the whole thing. Finally you shake your head and try to concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you pause, staring at the Mask's surface, the image stored within. Can you really...? Yes you can do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gritting of teeth you lay on the floor (the bed isn't nearly big enough for the Anaconda!) and bring the Mask to your face... and you pause. Last time it was so painful you thrashed around. If you were still thrashing as an Anaconda the piles of stuff around you room would go flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know it's an excuse, but use it to delay things as you tidy up (first time in months!), pushing things under the bed, up on the top of cabinets etc. Eventually you have a nine foot space around you, probably enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more you lay on the ground and nervously bring the Mask up. This is it! With your heart racing and your hands shaking you bring it up to your face and press it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor seconds nothing happens and you begin to wonder if it worked after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P***A***I***N!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is worse! MUCH worse! Agony sears your veins, your head threatening to explode, and thankfully you pass out quickly this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes plop open blearily. Damn what were you dreaming again? Something funky but you can't quite place it. It was a snake you think but... You try to shift and feel hardness beneath you, but when you try with more effort to move, something feels... wrong. Your arms are numb, and your legs! Twisting in shock you look down and... YOU'RE A SNAKE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt comes back to you, the dog, the Zoo and your final test, along with the blinding agony. Blinking you stare at yourself. It worked! Shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor minutes you just stare at yourself in amazement, not sure whether to be happy or not. It does feel cool, but not what you expected. Hmm, maybe try to move? Snakes have that whole rippling movement thing, their belly's shifting in ripples, dragging them along. Can you do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to slither, undulating your belly, but it's hard just to move. After a while you can slowly and carefully move your body, but that slithering thing seems beyond you. Instead you move in a kind of press, lift maneuver. Is that how sidewinders move? You don't think so. Maybe you don't have snake instincts? This is more the way an engineer might think of for a snake should move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels crude, but you manage and shift and crawl your way about your room. Your vision is in black and white and your sense of smell seems mostly based on your tongue. Very weird! OK, maybe it's not your tongue but something in your mouth that the tongue brushes against. After checking your body is much longer than your room is wide, maybe twice as much. That makes you a little over seventeen foot long, maybe twenty tops. Big certainly, but big enough to eat Lester? Well shows you've seen on TV picture Anaconda's eating animals bigger than humans, but you'd have to test this. How?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, Mom has a 20lb turkey in the kitchen on the counter. It's bigger than your snake head, not as big as person but it would be a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nudge the door open with your muzzle and try to hear if your mom is still in the living room. It's tricky, you can't really hear very well. Do snakes have ears? It seems easier to hear, at least deeper notes, when your head is on the ground. Maybe it's the vibrations through the paneling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're sure she's still watching TV you wriggle out, awkwardly without slithering, and try to get down the stairs. This is a challenge! You could change back, walk down, then change again, but the pain when you change would be hard to hide in the kitchen, even though there is more space there. No, just head down and deal with this now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral times you feel coils slipping and almost tumble down the stairs. This is hard! Why couldn't the Mask record the snake's instincts? You should be able to do this effortlessly! You've seen snakes navigate far more awkward conditions than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering up the hall at the bottom of the stairs you see the light of the TV going, she's still there, and you turn to the Kitchen. Up on the counter is the turkey. Your head is smaller so it looks totally huge from your perspective. It's out of the wrapping thankfully, sitting in a pan. You position coils beneath it around a table leg to catch the pan and use your tail to nudge it off the table, positioning your head, wide open, beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a little clunk as the pan hits the table leg but it seems quiet. The Turkey slams into your jaws and you desperately try to swallow. Halfway in you feel a deep cold seep into you and realize it wasn't long ago she took it out of the freezer! It's still partially frozen! Damn it! You're too far gone now though and swallow heavily, feeling lots of little teeth fold out to grip it. Some times they don't fold out and it's awkward. You haven't quite got the hang of this yet. The turkey doesn't seem a stretch for your new body, and soon is working it's way easily down your throat. That feels kind of cool, though Lester? You imagine someone struggling while you do this and wince. You'd have to deal with him first. Are you really a killer though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the melting meat oozes nicely down into your bulkier body you ponder that... but are interrupted by a slam. DAD'S HOME! OH SHIT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around in panic and try to figure a way out of this. The front door is too close to the stairs, he'd notice if your dashed that way. You could try the Kitchen window, but that might make a lot of noise. You don't want him coming in and seeing a giant snake wriggling out the window!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could take the Mask off! You don't have much to lose now!</span></div></div>",

Is that your dad calling to your mom? It's now or never, he'll probably be in here soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrap your tail around your face and pull, hissing the words, but nothing happens. You try again, levering against your lower jaws and nose. It doesn't work! Twisting and wriggling you try for something closer to the 'brow and nose' grip that the book proscribes and heave, yet again hissing the words. Finally you feel it give and you tense waiting for the pain explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you faint dead away, and when you wake up Dad is leaning in over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son Son! Will are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning you sit up. Yes, you're human, but where is the Mask?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I think so Dad. What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me, I found you naked in the Kitchen. I don't think your mother would appreciate it so I hauled you into my office. What were you doing in there naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou use the echoes of the pain to try and fake expressions of anguish to cover your nervousness. You don't want him to know about the Masks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I went to bed and... Oooh, I don't feel so good.\" This is true. You have a heavy cold lump in your stomach. The turkey! Glancing down you expect a huge bulge in your belly, but it's flat. What the heck?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never sleep walked before son. Is this on the up and up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'd *gnnn* make this up? Oooh god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad carries your groaning body upstairs quietly, and as he goes through the downstairs hall you glance towards the kitchen. There is the Mask! Under kitchen table! Oh god, you can't tell your dad about it, but to leave it there... You'll have to risk it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lays you in bed and tucks you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets not mention the sleep walking to your mom hmm? I'll tell her you don't feel good. I think we've got some Nyquil somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying in bed you ponder if this could have gone much worse! You've got a lump of ice in your stomach, your dad thinks you are sleep walking, you've lost the snake Mask downstairs and are coming down with a cold or something from the turkey (you guess) and don't have the energy to go grab it. What if someone puts it on! Oh god!<br>\r\nThere is nothing you can do about it though, and you just shiver and cough through the next few days, fading in and out of consciousness, your mom being as overprotective as ever. You get pretty sick of chicken soup until by Thursday morning you start to feel a little better. The lump of the turkey is still there but it's long since melted. Will you need to eat again soon? Who knows? That's one hell of a meal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy night time you feel a little better but fake still being ill. Your mom insists you are starting to come out of it so you guess you aren't as good at faking it as you thought, but she says you might be OK by Saturday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne AM comes and the alarm you set goes off. Everyone is asleep and you creep out of bed, stiff and sniffling, but OK. Dressing in slacks and a t-shirt you tip toe downstairs and go into the kitchen with trepidation. Peering under the table you curse voluminously, but quietly. The Mask is gone. Honestly you didn't have much hope it would still be there, but you just wanted it to be. Couldn't life be straight forwards once?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, who has it? Mom? Naww, she'd have asked you about it. She'd have asked everyone in the house about it. Dad? Doubtful. Why would he root around under the kitchen table. Robert? Oh god Robert!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's a pain, but he doesn't deserve to be turned into a snake! At least not without knowing how to change back! You creep upstairs again to see if you can figure out if Robert did find it.</span></div></div>",

Did you find a mask downstairs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grins evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, did Willsy loose his itsy bitsy masky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guess he still thought you were pretty out of it as he doesn't react quick enough when you pin him hard against the wall by his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off Robert! This is serious. You could be in danger! You didn't try the mask did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks like he thinks your nuts, but with a twinge of nervousness. It's obvious you're serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you dick, but you won't get it back now. I sold it to Umeko today.\" he says with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat and you step back. The shocked look on your face gets to the little punk somehow and his expression falters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... you sold it... to Umeko?\" you manage weakly. \"Oh shit. Oh shit shit shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's a fucking mask! What the hell's up with you?\" He manages weakly, but your terror at the situation is obviously infectious, he just doesn't know why the thing is dangerous, and you'd like to keep it that way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert, go back to bed, if mom asks I went out for some fresh air cos I started feeling better, OK? And for you own good you shouldn't mention the mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment he looks belligerent, but your expression of seriousness at the last bit seems to get to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" he says weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me Robert, you don't want anything to do with the damn things!\" and you grab a coat and shoes and run out into the night. Umeko's family lives quite a ways off so it takes a while, but you run the whole way. Gasping for breath you lean against a streetlight and peer up the driveway to Umeko's house with terror. Police cars are there, lights flashing in the night and the family is up and seems panicked. And there is no sign of Umeko in the group there in front of the house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" you gasp, trying to get your breath back \"Umeko? Why did you have give it to Umeko you little shit!\" you whisper to yourself vehemently. Robert would pay for this! From a distance you glance at Umeko's window and find it open with an officer peering in cautiously with a flashlight. He doesn't seem to be trying to open it so it probably was already open. She got out the window? Where would she go? Where would... oh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dash down the street and out of the estate. It's a short dash to a little copse of trees around a creek and you slide down the bank awkwardly. This was where Umeko taught you to kiss, one of her 'special places' she said, where she came to get away from the bustle of family life, though her family is much saner than yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umeko!\" you whisper \"Umeko! Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dash around, splashing up and down the creek bed looking for hollows that a huge snake could fit in. Suddenly you notice that a log you've passed twice here twitch. You stop and get a little closer. Leaning over you peer at the... yep it's a snake. It's the snake in the Mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umeko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt jumps, the head coming out of the water with a splash and peering at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god I found you Umeko!\" you say and kneel before her \"I'm gonna kill Robert! Just stay still, keep calm and we can get this sorted out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently you reach out, but she pulls back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, I'm trying to turn you back. Oh damn, you can't understand me can you? Sounds are all weird for a snake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead you just ease in slowly and press you fingers gently to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry Umeko, this is gonna hurt.\"</span></div></div>",

Thankfully she faints pretty early on, but she still moves and twitches through the change. You put the mask away and drape your coat over her as she becomes more human, though you can't resist taking a glance before dropping it over her. Don't think like that now! She's shivering in pain and tension even in her sleep as she finally becomes the Umeko you know and... care about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a few minutes but she does slowly wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umeko? Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlearily she sits up, then grasps for the coat desperately as she blushes, covering herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I should have thought to bring extra clothes for you. When I catch Robert I'll kill him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... it's OK Will.\" she says, gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown and look into her eyes. OK, Umeko always was adventurous and probably the most sane friend you've had but can she really cope with the weirdness of this that easily?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're OK with this?\" you say, and are surprised when she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I could have done without the pain. Oh that hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, like fire in the veins isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly stares deep into your eyes, a probing questioning look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you've been a snake?\" You nod, and she grins weakly \"Wow, This was your mask right? Robert told me he'd bought it at a second hand store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he must have guessed it was mine or maybe saw me polishing it, and decided to sell it to you to piss me off. It worked! That prick is in so much trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think, wait a minute.\" she says, then turns around, shifting the coat behind her and putting it on and zipping it up. \"Sorry, that's better.\" she smirks at your expression. Obviously you think it was better before. \"Anyway, don't blame Robert. How could he know it was dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but he stole it, sold it to someone else. It seems sometimes like all he does is look for ways to piss me off!\" You lean back into the grass and groan. \"At least you're OK. I thought the police might have found the snake and... I don't know, carted you off to the Zoo or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, tore up my clothes though, but after I realized what had happened... OK, quite a while after that, I had to get used to the idea, I ate the remains and fled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you think it would have been better for my mom to walk in and find my shredded clothes there and me missing? She'd have had a heart attack! Best she wonder about the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You managed to think that through while still getting used to being a snake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was maybe a couple of hours after the... transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umeko, how are you taking this so calmly? You were a SNAKE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Look Will, I've always kind of liked snakes. My dad took me to a Zoo when I was little and I kind of took to them. You see the other kinds made fun of me because I was different. There weren't any Asian kids where I was. At the Zoo people treated the snakes the same way they treated me, scared and interested at the same time. It just kind of connected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up and lean over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad I got to you before anything bad happened. We've got to figure out a way to get you home without your parents knowing what ha... what? What is it Umeko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko was blushing and looking rather nervous. What had he said?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you didn't actually get to me before anything happened, though I can't say it was exactly bad.\"</span></div></div>",

You've never seen her quite like this before. She's always been a close friend (barring intrusions from Robert) but she always seemed... just friendly. This is intense. You can feel her hand warming against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... was easy.\" you say cautiously \"It just slid in, I could feel the teeth gripping it, but they didn't work all the time. You know the little flopping ones up top?\" she nods grinning \"I think you have to focus to get them to dig in. But even without I managed. You know, to swallow it.\" at this she gulps and licks her lips nervously. \"Um, aaa... and then felt it... slide down my throat. It felt, slack, but the cold seeped out about then and.... it... *gulp* Went in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now?\" she says, pressing her hand more firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was three days ago, it's melted now, but it's still there, I can feel it. A solid, lump as big as my... head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand had been rubbing gently on your belly as she stared intently, when it bumped the tip of the bulge in your trousers. Suddenly her eyes go wide and she jumps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I... Of course. Look we'd better get back.\" And she jumps up, pushing to make sure the jacket was low enough to cover her hips. \"Come on, we'd better hurry if the cops are there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, that was sudden. How come she hadn't realized he was aroused by all that? Until she touched it... and it freaked her out? As you dash on behind her bare foot run you wonder if you're missing something. Did you do something wrong? Suddenly Umeko comes to a halt and you skid to a stop beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, there they are. Looks like the police are nearly finished. Maybe we should wait for them to leave then you can get me some clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder. Obviously you kind of like the way she looks now and. Wait, you can see her odd expression, fixed and set teeth. Is she looking at you out of the corner of her eye? Waiting for your reaction?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umeko? What am I missing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she seems genuinely perplexed. \"It's pretty simple. You dash in, grab some clothes, I dress claim I was... I dunno, out star gazing or something, it's all one big mistake and I can relax. What's to miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squint at her carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I mean your reaction back there? What did I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? No I... Will, this isn't the time for this. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, but you will explain it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks very nervous now and there is a long pause before she answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O... OK, I guess. Look not now, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and keep watch with her. It's tempting to 'accidentally' snuggle closer to her, but this is Umeko. She's obviously freaked out here and you are part of it somehow. Normally you'd make every effort to be close to her but not against her will! You want to find out what is up here and getting her pissed at you for... whatever, wouldn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that the cops look nearly done they take another half hour to finish talking to the family and leave.  Apparently they didn't want to take anyone in for questioning or anything, well you guess it's like they say on cop shows. You can't do a missing persons report until they were, what was it? 48 hours missing or more? Something like that. Either than or they got everything they needed already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko makes you wait a little longer just to be sure then nods and points to her window. You DO know which is hers by now but just smile and creep off. She gave you a list of clothes that were similar to what she was wearing when she... changed. Thus those clothes are missing and what she'll be expected to be wearing. She seems to be thinking of a lot of things you haven't, nuances that escaped you. Well she knows about the masks now, or at least one mask, so maybe she can help you figure out how to use these things? Maybe even with a plan for Lester! Um, maybe not. You seriously doubt she'd go for killing him, or that you would frankly. You aren't sure you could go through with it if you tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the dark area beneath Umeko's window you reach up and thankfully find no-one has bothered to close it yet. Carefully you hinge it wide enough to climb in and reach up.</span></div></div>",

You understand why Umeko couldn't just come in here to get her clothes. If she was caught they'd wonder why she wasn't dressed. Let alone if she was caught outside coming in wearing only your jacket! But it still feels wrong that you should be here to take the fall if someone does burst in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever no-one does. You get everything, including her panties (definitely worth the trip!) and slip back out the window. A short dash away and you slide down by Umeko again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, here's everything.\" you say, handing her the knotting ball of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrright.\" she says picking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was in a rush OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins, somewhat back to her old self again and then stares seriously at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is customary for the guy to turn round about now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, sorry.\" you manage, and turn away, somewhat reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of clothing sliding over her body alone get you aroused again, then they stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Will? Back there when I was changing from snake to person again did you sneak a peek?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to come up with a convincing way around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh,\" she says after your significant pause. Dumb dumb dumb! \"Look, maybe this had better be now after all. This is going to be difficult for me to say, OK? Oh, you can turn round now Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to see her dressed in a green blouse and black pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going to be difficult to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifts, getting comfy as she crosses her legs. You recognize the signs of delaying the inevitable. You do it all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gay.\" she says abruptly, her expression rigid, her eyes not meeting yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it fits<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\" you say sourly, then see her angry expression. \"Sorry, not.. I mean. Oh shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe presses her fingers to her eyes sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really think I'd missed your various overture with me over the years Will? Trust I'm well aware you like me, more than like me! I can't return it. I do like you, but... oh this is going to sound corny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a friend?\" you manage weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not 'just' a friend Will. You're the closest friend I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you don't have a girlfriend? I mean a real girlfriend. You know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she says quietly \"Never had that luxury. How many lesbians do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely. That's how many chances I've had to meet girls of a like mind. *sigh* Look, I'm flattered, kind of but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait, but what was all that back there then? I mean I thought you were coming on to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she looks nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was just... the snake stuff. Like I said I REALLY like snakes.\" and she pointedly stares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh!\" you say simply, then smile. \"So I should put the mask on then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko's face freezes, and she gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah, *ulp* ma.. maybe later.\" She stares down to the mask in your hand \"That change... the change into a snake... it hurts, really hurts. You'd?...\" at this she stops whatever she was going to say. \"Look I've got to straighten this out with my parents. Were can we meet privately later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her directions to your clubhouse and tell her you'll bring the mask when you get there. Her face looks strained at that but she smiles and says she'll meet you there tomorrow morning before school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, my mom still thinks I'm sick. Well I'm not 100% but I'm good enough now, anyway, I'll be off school tomorrow, can you get off too and meet me there in the morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ponders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dad won't like that, and he WILL find out. But I might be able to get out of just English class at eleven, that way I've got an hour of class, then lunch time to spend in the 'clubhouse'. Should be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod enthusiastically as she waves and heads off</span></div></div>",

In the morning Robert stares at you oddly throughout breakfast. He's never not sparred with you, it's kind of freaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Will, all better then?\" you mom asks as she passes cereal bowls around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still feel off, but much better. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and pats your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, but you aren't going to school today.\" Robert grimaces at this and you try to restrain your grin. \"You need to get your strength back. That was a bad case of flu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Short for flu huh.\" Robert mutters quietly, but your mom pretends not to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal passes in quiet and your dad looks between you and Robert with questioning glances. He at least notices Roberts behavior. You guess you aren't sparking off a row either so you're out of character too. He doesn't say anything though and heads off to work with a few well worn goodbyes, but does give you a pointed look as he leaves. Obviously he wants to talk to you about this later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch Robert in the hall after breakfast before he goes to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to let you know, Umeko is alright... now.\" you say quietly. \"But it was close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are those things?\" he whispers fiercely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings? Plural?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to get involved Robert, trust me. But they...\" damn! You've admitted there's more than one mask! Well, you guess Robert must have seen you polishing the other two or something before. \"...they're really dangerous. Don't mess with them Robert. I don't want to lose you.\"<br>\r\nHis eyes go wide at this and for once he has nothing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go up to your room leaving him at the bottom of the stairs staring after you. Somehow you don't think this peace with him will last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy nine thirty in the morning you have the various things you need together to take to the clubhouse. You're planning on moving all the Mask construction stuff there now, including the book. It certainly seems safer. Sneaking out of the house you glance briefly at Andy's place and wonder what he's doing right now? Has he got the details of his 'death' worked out? Damn your life is going crazy the last few weeks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you head out and do some quick shopping before heading to the clubhouse. You arrive early, unlock and dump the pile of stuff in a corner. You have snacks, a few solar rechargeable lamps, an inflatable bed (OK, you knew that was too much. She isn't going to go that far, but you couldn't help yourself!) and some sheets. Quite a load and was awkward to carry the five bags down the basement steps, but you spend the last half hour straightening things up a little in here, clearing out some more space around the battered table that you and your friends played cards around before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later there's a quiet knock at the door and you bound up the steps and open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ume..ko?\" you say as she brushes past you quickly, pushing the door shut after her. She's blushing fiercely as she dashes down the steps and collapses into a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you OK?\" you manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fine. I'm fine. So... you got the mask right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, no beating about the bush apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I got it.\" and you pull it out of your jacket pocket. Her eyes snap to it instantly and go wide as she licks her suddenly dry lips.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I... I don't want you to think I'm a freak!\" she's shivering now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why would I ever think that? You aren't a freak Umeko!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that now,\" she says, then turns to stare at you again, her eyes once more piercing \"But what if I asked you to eat me? Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink and her eyes flick down to the mask, then back to you pointedly. She hasn't even asked how or why the thing works! Isn't she curious at all about that? You lick your lips, now probably as dry as hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. The, snake thing. OK, that's cool. I'm... er... really eat you? But that'd hurt wouldn't it?\" You were thinking of what you were planning to do to Lester. You WANT it to hurt! \"I'm not gonna hurt you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no I'm sure... Hold the teeth up, and, be gentle? Look we can try and I'll just tell you to stop if it hurts, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't work, as a snake the ears are wrong or something, it's really hard to make out words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she says, getting a fierce look on her face, \"Then I'll tap your nose... muzzle, er whatever, three times, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle and sit down opposite her at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, OK, but what about after that? You can't want to be... eaten eaten? I won't do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! For gods sake, I don't want to die!\" then she lowers her voice. \"Snakes can throw up stuff easily. Even if you can't, just relax and I'll crawl out, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wants this, and she's still shaking slightly, hands fiddling anxiously in her lap (it's a low table).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umeko? You really want to do this? Now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, definitely. And you'll really... go through that change for me?\" she means the pain of turning into a snake. Well, it was easier, slightly, changing back. Maybe you're getting used to it. As long as it isn't any worse than that you think you can put up with it... probably. Heck this is for Umeko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure. I'm cool.\" you say, putting on a real mature voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea how silly you sound when you do that?\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you manage intelligently. \"I was just trying... to...\" and you grind to a halt as she stands up and unbuttons her blouse. \"Uh, Umeko? What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you really thought I'd let you eat me, tear up my clothes then I'd have to wear spit covered, torn clothes to school? no thank you! Just... don't get any ideas, OK?\" and she turns away as she pulls her blouse off, shimmies her skirt down, and after a distinct pause (and blush spreading over her body) slips her underwear off then unhooks her bra expertly. She's still shaking, and you can't help stare at her naked rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you.\" she says, still facing away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh the mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... your clothes, right? You don't want to tear them up like I did.\" She says, resolutely keeping facing away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. This is odd. This is almost one of your fantasies about Umeko... but in that she most definitely was facing the other way with a much more open eager look on her face. She doesn't 'like' you like you, but at least you know she's going to like this. She really wants to be eaten!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pull your clothes off, with the obvious pole in your pants hindering things a little, but soon are stripped down. You pick up the mask and lay down on the floor, making sure there is as much space around you as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'm ready. Now Umeko? The mask sinks into the face, kind of melts, then takes a little while to fully change me. I'll be unconscious mostly likely, but I guess you know that from your own experience.\" she shivers at the reminder. \"Just wake me when it's done, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I really appreciate this Will. You don't know what this means to me. I won't forget it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's scary, but Umeko's naked body enticing you on you slip the mask up and press it to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PAIN!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god! The sheer agony tears through you and you can't believe you did this willingly! You think, that it is slightly better than the first time. But not by much. You scream, muffled into the mask and writhe around on the floor, and feel Umeko's hands on your arms as you struggle. A few moments later you faint away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you swim back to consciousness and look up at Umeko... naked Umeko. Naked Umeko leaning over you! OK, she's in black and white but she looks absolutely fantastic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo awww aye?\" comes the muffled call from her. Oh right, the ears thing. You think she's asking if you are all right, so you lift your head and nod briefly. Her smile fills the room, and then she hugs you. Suddenly you find you have two erections, surprised at the sensations, as Umeko presses your snake head between her breasts tightly. You had no idea snakes had two?!? That is so weird! They feel awkward, short and squat, but probably larger than your own given the snake's bulk compared to a human. Flat ended? Well fuzz ended would be more accurate maybe. But they feel weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko continues to hug you, saying something that reverberates about but it unintelligible. You gently lift your tail up and wrap a little around her to squeeze her gently, she looses your head for a moment, and you peer up out of her cleavage at her face, eyes closed in bliss. She really gets into this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she's all serious and pushes at you. Obligingly you pull free of her (a sigh as your head plops from her chest) and she says something, then lays down on the floor, toes towards you. She's really serious about this!</span></div></div>",

Really eat her? Well, she said she'd be OK, and You trust her. If she's spent her life hooked on snake stuff she'd have read up all about them, right? She'll know what she's talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnhinging your jaw a little in practice (and seeing Umeko gasp a little at this as she lifts herself up on her elbows to look at you) you shift those tiny needle teeth in and out, getting the feel for them. You're pretty sure it'll be easy to hold them back. It takes a bit of conscious effort to pull them down. anything that is different from the human body doesn't seem to come easily, but at least you can do stuff with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, you're ready, you think. Staring up at Umeko's feet you wriggle forwards awkwardly and lay your head in front of her. She obligingly pushes her feet down, toes to your nose. You try to smile, but the muscles aren't there, and you sigh. With a wriggle of your head you unhinge again and edge forwards. Umeko is breathing hard now, flushed and excited obviously, as your mouth slides around her feet, not even touching them. Her toes hit the back of your throat and you gently close your jaws on her. You look up into her needing eyes... and swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko catches her breath and gasps as her feet pulse into your throat, toes wriggling slightly. She shifts on her elbows, shimmying her butt forwards, lifting her knees. Then slowly she straightens her knees out, pushing her feet down your throat. You relax and swallow as gently as you can, and are surprised at how good this whole experience is. You were mainly doing this for Umeko, she obviously loves it, but she does taste very nice, kind of sweet and musky at once, and the feet of wriggling feet in your throat is weird... but nice. You could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking your jaws from side to side you work up her calves as she pushes on, straightening out fully as you reach her knees. Suddenly you realize you're staring up her body... and her hands are buried in her crotch, busily stroking away. Fuck that looks hot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInadvertently you gulp heavily, a tight squeeze dragging her towards you on her butt. Rather than looking pained though, she seems even more turned on, and grunts in response to your muscles working on her. OK, so swallowing isn't sexual for you, though it is nice, this whole scene before you is an incredible turn on! You fumble with your tail, flicking around to one of those twitching pulsing dicks sprouting low down your body and wrap it around. It's clumsy like this, but as she strokes herself you do likewise, watching her hips get sucked closer to your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your nose closes over her rapidly twitching hands she screams and jerks, you gulp again, heavily as she seems to like it, and the ripple of throat muscles ooze her in. You're pretty sure that snakes don't normally eat prey this quickly, but with her helping like this it's going pretty fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shudders hard, quivering inside you. The movement deep with your body is kind of cool, especially when you know it's her! Imagining her sexy body... INSIDE you, is pretty intoxicating. Kind of an ultimate dom thing. You pull a loop of your middle body (quite a way from your rapidly pumping cock) up around her shoulders and push, easing her in as she can't help much now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis goes a little slower, but as she slips deeper she comes again, screaming once more as her hands twitch hard inside you. You're close yourself, though these snake things are weird. They feel like they're inside out or something, and something makes you think that they normally don't come this quick. Maybe your human side getting the better of your body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaws press between her breasts. For a moment you stare up at her bliss covered face through the valley in her bosom, then you yawn again and suck them in. It takes a few gulps, but feeling her breasts INSIDE your mouth is enough. You've wanted to fondle them for years and now! You grunt and jerk, spasming your self as you swallow hard. There is a slight yelp from Umeko as her head plops into your mouth and is sucked in. Then you are collapsing on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later you realize she is in you... and probably suffocating! You yawn and crack, and find curiously that you can open your throat while still breathing. Muffled gasps come from inside you, you think pleasant sounding ones. She's OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh what a relief! For a moment there you worried for her.</span></div></div>",

You start a kind of rippling motion... but she suddenly jerks in you, not pleasantly. Muffled words come that you think are 'not yet' or something close. She wants to stay in there? Well you aren't going to let her stay in long. Who knows how long it'll take before your stomach starts to... deal with her? Well that turkey is still mostly in there you think, though you can't feel it right now. Has she bumped into it? Oooh, that could have been messy! Anyway, the turkey lasted a while in your human stomach, not the snake one. You don't want to risk leaving her in there too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm around a little, hearing giggles from inside you as she bends with you. You're careful not to flex too much around her. This could be fun, and her laughter is infectious. She squirms some more and can feel the soft lumps moving inside you. You have Umeko in you. God that's weird. Just imagining her sexy naked body... in there. You suddenly find your snake lips next to your weird looking penises. Okkaay! You can blow yourself like this? Tentatively you try, but it's not much fun. Snake lips are not agile. Typical! Finally you can bend like this but it still won't work. Curling your tail around one of them you sigh, imagining the look of Umeko wriggling inside you, her breasts jiggling, squeezed, her bum pressed by your insides. She is really cute and seeing her naked like that... You start to pump once more, then are surprised to hear a shuddering gasp inside you. She beat you to the punch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she recovers from her third you finish your second and then collapse to the floor, feeling Umeko pant inside you. She mutters something unintelligible and you hope it means she wants out. You aren't waiting any longer, you don't want to hurt her in there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wriggle you start to try and throw up. Despite what Umeko said it seems hard to get started. You hear pleasant sounding moans from within you as your body squeezes and ripples around her, then little gasps as it pinches a little too much. You can't stop now though, got to get her out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving, something clicks and with a gasp she starts to shoot outwards, way faster than she went in. You can feel a twisting sensation and try to go with it, bending your neck and upper body back and forth to push her out.<br>\r\n\"sseeeee!\" she gasps as her head plops free, then makes a squeak as her boobs plop out wetly. Her hips pinch a little, coming up so fast, but she oozes out in less than a minute, her bending her legs to help you draw her feet out. She mutters thanks (you think) and strokes your head softly. Then she pauses, bites her lip for a sec, then leans in and kisses you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, but try to go with it. It's... weird. You can't flex your lips, shift or anything, but she obviously likes it. Smiling in your head you slip your snake tongue into her mouth instead and hear her giggle, then suck and play with it. Her mouth tastes really nice! Finally she breaks the kiss, blushing fiercely. Then she leans in and taps your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, time to change back. She turns away, looking wistfully over her shoulder at your snake body before rubbing off all the spit off her with a bed sheet and brushing her hair. You smile, then it falters as she starts to dress. You get one VERY cute view of her gorgeous butt before panties, then skirt covers her once more. With a sigh, and without really thinking about it, your tail curls up, grabs your forehead and nose and pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiss hiss hiss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pain!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not as bad, but still it catches you completely unawares. You were too busy watching Umeko dress herself. The writhing agony lasts long enough to see Umeko dash over to you, her bra covered chest bouncing delightfully before you faint away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to you are in her arms,  she looking down at you anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will, are you OK?\" she asks softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, damn that's a kicker, but it's getting easier... slowly. Was that... OK? Was it good enough for you?\" You ask, peering into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes bright red at the change in topic but doesn't drop you. You peer out of the corner of your eyes at her bra clad chest but try desperately to remain in eye contact with her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... yes... Oh yes. Thank you Will. You have absolutely no idea how long I've... well lets say the dreams didn't live up to reality. That was much better than I'd dared hope!\" Then she bites her lip and wriggles. You think her elbow touched your rock hard erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sorry about that.\" you manage, blushing yourself now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK Will. I know how you feel about me. It's... weird but I think I can cope with that. You know, you thinking of me like that. But you do understand I don't feel the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except when I'm a snake?\" you say, then kick yourself. Not the right thing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closes her eyes and sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, yeah, you as a snake does turn me on. But... knowing it's you in there is... wrong. Look, I'm not sure I'd be OK with... that. Let me think on it, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, she's considering it? Sex with a snake? Damn! Straining you don't say anything. You don't want to make her mind yet. It's probably be the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes you reluctantly sit up. The view down there was good. But with her obvious dislike of your... maleness, you do feel awkward being naked in front of her. Maybe this is how she feels when she's naked in front of you? Weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, well it's getting late.\" she says using the sheet to dry her hair some more, then brush it again. \"I can manage without lunch and if I get out pretty quick I think I can get back to school in time for History class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I'm fine. I've already had lunch!\" and you lick your lips. \"Tasty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko goes bright red practically instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Um, Yeah. OK. Um.\" and she nervously puts her blouse on. \"I'm... glad you... enjoyed it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, but it weakens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, yeah it was a lot of fun, but... I think you get more out of that side of it than I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way,\" she says, looking over her shoulder at you as you get dressed \"I'm glad of that. Not sure how I'd feel about you getting aroused by my being eaten... OK that's silly, I know you...\" she looks down at your groin. \"Well I heard what you did while I was... in there. But for some reason you getting turned on by the ACT of eating me... that might be too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can respond she heads up the steps, but pauses at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe not.\" she says back at you, then quickly leaves, shutting the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHEEEIT! She... she might... Oh my god! Wait, she never even asked about the Masks? She could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a thought hit you. She's a Lesbian. You can make Masks. You can put an image of a girl into a Mask. YOU COULD BE A GIRL FOR HER! Wouldn't that be better than a snake? Well, seeing her reaction it's possible it isn't but... You're pretty sure she would love it! For that though you'd need more masks! *sigh* More buffing! This is getting to be a grind! But the results would be worth it!</span></div></div>",

It has her smell on it. You realize you're falling for.. .her... wait, Lisa?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop and think for sec. When was the last time you even thought about her? What about Eva? Maybe now would be a good time to finally talk to Eva about Lisa? It still would hurt, but knowing Lisa definitely doesn't want anything to do with you might actually be freeing now... maybe. Damn your head hurts! And even if that happens Umeko... she doesn't like boys. Even if you make a girl mask for her would she actually want to be with you? More than just... sex? Even if she wants to do that! You realize you may be falling a bit deeply for her at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit shit shit!\" You fall in love and it's with a Lesbian! God can you get anything right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes sting, images of Lisa and Umeko flowing behind your eyes, but eventually you rub them and sit up. This is no good! You've got to get a hold of yourself! You blow your nose, clean your face somewhat, then head out and buy another $200 worth of mask materials, enough for two more masks. In the afternoon you do the task of making them, then hold two new gray masks ready for buffing. Again you stare at the books next spell. Not now! This is way too important to worry about new stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacking stuff up in a bag up and hiding the Mask making equipment in a corner you head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been Will!\" your mom says when you arrive \"I was worried about you! You need to stay in bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know mom,\" you say as she feels your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feel hot son. Come on get to bed! You've got the weekend to recover from this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing you relent and head upstairs to bed. She tucks you in and for once you let her. You aren't a kid any more, but right now you have other things on your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet dreams William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night mom. And thanks for taking care of me when I was sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and closes the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning you set your alarm for midnight. It's 2:30PM now, so you should have enough sleep time. You drift to sleep with dreams of a naked Umeko running ahead of you as a snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake in the dark, still hearing your brother messing around in the next room as you slam your hand down on the alarm. OK, people are still up, but you can buff masks at least, even if you can't head out without bumping into someone. You grab the masks from your jacket and the buffing cloth and start to work on them, strapping them to your knees again. It's getting like a rhythm now, and while you buff you fantasize about Umeko. Not all of it with her naked either. She's always been a kind of down to earth girl. Not Tomboy certainly, but... wait, as a Lesbian shouldn't she be a tomboy? Was she hiding that side of herself? Maybe you just don't know enough about all this stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of hours you take a break, waggling your arms about to get the blood flow back, then throw on some clothes and head downstairs. Who could you record? One obvious one would be Umeko herself. What would she think about being with her own body? Might freak her out too much... although given what you two have been doing lately you're not sure what WOULD freak her out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe someone else? Um, but who? Eva? You know her of course, but not very well. You could ask Caleb to help with that, but he's already been reluctant about the whole thing. Getting a mask on her... ooh! How about a merge of her and Umeko? While you open the fridge and get out a glass of orange you ponder it. With a merge like that if you ever get caught in the mask there wouldn't the awkwardness of explaining what Eva was doing there. Or the danger of bumping into Eva when you are in the Eva mask! Not likely, but who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou practically hit the ceiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAD! God, don't do that!\" you say, your heart thumping in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I guess you're feeling better then huh?\" He says, he's acting a little odd, and what is he doing up this late? It's 2AM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah, said so yesterday at breakfast.\" he nods and taste a sip of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will, come into my office, we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh, this sounds serious!</span></div></div>",

There was way more there than just a job, you know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head upstairs and start buffing masks once more, now while you try and ponder what Caleb has been up to of late. Hacking again maybe? Or was he trying to make Nitroglycerin? No, that wouldn't peak the company's interest. Would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you nervously let it drop and think back to images of Umeko. You find yourself remembering what it was like to... eat her. Somehow the whole thing was sort of dream like, but so real. The feel of her skin in your mouth. Her taste on your tongue. Her wriggling sexy movements as she slid into you. Damn you're getting hard just thinking about her... or the experience. You're beginning to wonder if you do like this, despite the oddity. No, really it's her you like, but feeling her that close, that sensuously. Damn it was nice! You now know every inch of her body intimately! At least with your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it the masks are half done and you stare at the clock. It's 5 AM! Well, you slept a lot, so you carry on, trying to finish them off tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't make it, sounds of breakfast preparations start when the masks are 3/4 done. Still a lot more than you'd hoped. You relax and feel your arms throbbing. 'Wax on, Wax off.'  Heh! This is certainly building arm muscle for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you think you've recovered from your polishing you head downstairs for breakfast. Like every Saturday Mom is making Bacon, the smell of it filling the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rob.\" you say idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dick.\" he says back softly so mom can't hear. Ah, he's getting a bit back to his old self again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down and wait for the bacon as Dad comes in and nods to you slightly. Reminded of last night again you ponder what's up with Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, Yours extra crispy Robby.\" and she puts out everyone's bacon. How does she always manage to time it just for when everyone is ready?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast is a bit more friendly than usual, though Robert is still a little withdrawn, compared to normal. He dashes out as soon as he's finished, not waiting for Dad to assign chores. Sighing, and without complaining as usual, you simply start bagging trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice dear, don't forget the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad however stares at you. Yeah, you aren't exactly behaving normally are you. Well you're rather preoccupied right now, and besides you don't need as much time today to finish the masks as you thought. You're in a good mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrash takes about an hour, but only because you're going slow, wandering about Umeko the whole time. After that you head out, but where to go? Umeko's? That would be cool, maybe you could finish the Masks and show her... herself, or something. But you have become real curious about Caleb. Maybe you should head over there first, then see Umeko tonight? Maybe you could even get Eva on a mask first and merge it with Umeko then before fixing it tonight.</span></div></div>",

Just in case you need more to explain things. You hope she takes this well. Should you bring the book? Well you have to head to the Clubhouse anyway to pick up some fixer to make the mask permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting in you close the door behind you, then wonder about getting a deadlock bolt on it? You could lock it from the inside then for added privacy. You might need that soon. Grinning at the thought of you and Umeko in here you head down. It's still a bit of a mess from yesterday, and the sheet is still there on the table. Feeling really stupid you sniff it. Yep, Umeko smell! God look at you! You're like love sick puppy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath you focus and gather up the Book, the fixing solution (not that much left, have to make more), and a brush. You grab a bag and shove all that plus all the masks so far made in and head out, locking behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a long walk but you head off whistling. Things have certainly... changed these last weeks. Mostly for the better. When you reach Umeko's house you're thankful that there aren't any cops there and head up to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey!\" comes from the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko is in t-shirt and jeans over there, seemingly surprised to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" she says as you head over to her, \"best not head to the house. I'm not exactly popular in there right now. Having you over might make my parents get some odd ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you too Umeko.\" you say, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Will! Come on, it's nice to see you too. I just... well it was a bad night. My mom was... well she was still crying this morning. Dad was furious, blaming me! And I couldn't tell him the truth! I haven't lied to them in... well, a very long time! I said I was checking the stars and lost track of time, I'm not sure they believed me. I think they think I'm seeing a boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean! That way, not... *sigh*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, you're pretty sure if her parents knew what she was doing with 'that boy' then they would be even more horrified!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want to head to the clubhouse? It'd be private, and there are a few things I need to explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda hoped you would. Yeah, lets go.\" she grabs a bag and heads out with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the clubhouse you drop the bag on the table and open up. You should have thought you'd be coming back here. You didn't need to lug this stuff around! Never mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the snake?\" she says idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her eyes go wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo, no I mean you were going to explain the snake... but... I guess later... maybe?\" She grins at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn just the thought of that is getting you hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, better sit down this is a lot to take in.\" you wait for her and you to sit across the table once more and get started. You decide to go the whole hog, explain everything, the book, the masks bloody thumb print and all and she is looking a little pale at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so I managed to get the Mask off the snake and get out of there. Man I thought it was going to stay stuck on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then,\" Umeko said softly \"You tried it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dog had been weird, but the Snake was worse, but I have to admit after a few goes it is getting easier. Later Dad caught me downstairs, after the turkey thing, but I changed back in time. I don't think he knows anything about that, but damn doing that hurt! Maybe eventually I'll get used to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places her hand lightly on yours on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I really appreciate what you put yourself through for me. I know what that felt like!\" she leaves her warm hand softly on yours for several seconds, peering into your eyes before lifting it and leaning back. \"But now the whole deal with these Masks... you say you're sure this wasn't supposed to work for animals?\" you nod \"And you've only tried your brother?\" again a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses and bites her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'm curious. Could I... Could I try him out?\" You blink and look down into the bag where the Robert Mask is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. guess. But you can't have it outside here. I don't want Rob to get in trouble, and being in two places at once could make a lot of trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods as you hand her Robert's mask. She turns it over in her hands and peers into the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that looks like Rob. Oh this is weird. And it hurts less?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it doesn't really hurt exactly. It's weird and you get knocked out, or at least feel drowsy, but not as bad as with animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, could you turn around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and do as she asks, hearing the rustle of clothes behind you. Damn you wanted to see her again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Stay turned around, I'm going to lay on the floor and put the mask on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear step away from the table and sit down, then nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMmmm!\" she gasps and you turn without thinking and see her naked there, just as she changes. God she's beautiful... then, she isn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umeko?\" you say, leaning over... your Brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh my... head?\" she says and coughs. \"Oh the voice will take getting used to!\" Then her eyes go wide as her hands go down to her waist. \"Oh fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, Robby's got an erection, and Umeko seems scared of even touching it, but also thrilled about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you like?\" you say to her when she's calmed down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yep, I think so. This feels so different.\" You grin and she/he smiles back at you. It's weird not thinking of Robert in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so... I was wondering Umeko?\" you say awkwardly. \"Would you be interested in... making a... Mask of you? For me I mean. Well for you but for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it Will!\" she says, interrupting you as she looks flushed again, weird on Robert's face. \"I... don't know. That's a lot to take in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stare down at Robert's erection and burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Chuckles* Yeah, I think I'll pass on that Umeko. You don't know where Robert's been!\"</span></div></div>",

I could hear that much.\" and she blushed once more, but her eyes didn't leave her new toy. \"OK, well, it's... what? Good? I don't know what to say. Fucking good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both laugh at that, then she wraps her hand around it, licks her lips and pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! I like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is freaky! It's your brother for god's sake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, now I know how you feel. Umeko. You mind if I turn my back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe/he grins up at you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sure, as long as you don't mind me doing it! I gotta try it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, a little weakly, but pat her on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, I'll just be over here.\" and you sit down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes are... weird. Listening (you can't stop listening, despite wanting to!) to Umeko whack off. When she finally comes and screams... OK, you've head a muffled version of that before. Now you know what some of the sounds from your brother's room have been. TMI!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Pant* Oh OK, *gasp* I'm done, for now!\" and you turn to see Umeko/Robert standing against the wall grinning at you. \"I guess I have to take this mask off for you to.. what, scan me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess. Even if it worked on you now, it'd be an image of Robert it stored.\" And you really aren't sure that would work anyway. It doesn't exactly say as much in the book but there are hints about it, using the term 'once' where it really isn't needed, implying only one mask... maybe. Oh this is all so we...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*EAAAARGH!*\" Umeko grunts as she pulls at the mask. \"Ungh, a little help here? It's not coming off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try pulling at her/his face as she says the words, while you go over them in your head, checking she's saying them right, then 'PLOP!\" it comes free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger back as she changes, twisting and wriggling, collapsing against the wall but not quite fainting this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!\" She says, clutching her head. \"You're right that does feel weird, but no pain at least. I guess...\" and she stops, then hands rapidly cover her gorgeous chest and crotch. \"Will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what am I supposed to do? I was helping with the mask!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around and holds a hand behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S.. so give me the blank mask OK? I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seriously consider doing just that, but you can't do it. You could catch her of course but it wouldn't be right not to warn her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that won't work.\" you say as you stare at her fantastic bum. \"When the mask melts in to scan you, you always seem to fall asleep and collapse. You're out for like ten fifteen minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the whole time you'll be staring at my body?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Umeko? I understand I think, but if thats the case, why were you so open when I was a snake? I was still me inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know it's not... right, but with you in that body it just feels wrong. Hey could you sit there and watch me... do what I did when I was Robert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, as Robert no. It's too freaky, but as another guy, me maybe. I think I could do that for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do that... wait what? No I wasn't asking you to...\" her body blushes again, still facing away. \"I meant that you couldn't watch, just the watching I was talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do that. But my brother? I'll pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko looks over her shoulder at you with an odd expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, just... give me the mask and your jacket. I'll lay down with it over me, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\" You say simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding her the blank mask and your jacket you turn around and let her get settled. when she signals she's OK, you turn, just in time to see her put the mask on. As always it melts into her, her body shuddering under the jacket, then she's quiet and the mask is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuarter of an hour later the mask re-appears and you are tempted... oh so tempted, to peek under her jacket when you pick it up, but you manage to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah! Different.\" she gasps as she wakes up, and sees you painting something on the mask. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It fixes the mask, lets you use it.\" and you paint the last bit in, \"There, all ready. You might want to close your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it bright or something?\" she says, clutching the jacket to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I'm stripping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right of course.\" and she closes her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said you might want to, not have to.\" you whisper to yourself under your breath, a little disappointed that she didn't want to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" you say, laying down yourself, \"I'm about to put on the mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usual swirling twisting in your body, the usual... when did this get 'usual'? This time you manage to stay awake and pant on the floor, and then stare down at your own body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" you whisper, and then regret it as Umeko opens her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're done? Wow, you ARE done! Oh my god!\" and she roll up, forgetting the jacket, falling to the floor as she peers at you. For a moment you feel as awkward as she did earlier with her staring at your body like this, but... no you aren't going to do that. You bite down on the nervousness and sit up yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you like?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning she looks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I like... oh,\" and her face falls, \"You mean 'like' like?\"</span></div></div>",

I do want this, for quite a few reasons.\" she says and you calm down a little. \"One, I've never been with a girl before and I REALLY want to! Two, I trust you, I know you I've been with you for so long that I feel I can... well, open up with you like with no-one else. and Three? Well, I do like you Will.

I think, like this, I can do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't love me?\" it comes out of your mouth so fast you can't stop yourself and Umeko's almond eyes go wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lo... wait.... You Will? Oh my god!\" for a moment she leans back, breathing hard, obviously thinking things through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... really...\" she starts, but you interrupt her before you can second guess yourself. You take her hands in yours and lean in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Umeko, I love you, deeply and with a passion! I've never felt like this for anyone before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even Lisa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hurts and it looks like she regretted saying it to when she saw your reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E... even her. Umeko. This whole thing is weird and intense I know, but I've always felt very close to you, now more so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than when you ate me?\" she says with a slight grin, which then disappears. \"OK, I know not the time to joke. It's difficult. Put yourself in my shoes. What if Caleb had these masks, he made himself into a girl and then confessed his undying love for you. How would you react?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, that is kind of... disgusting? Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it would depend on how cute a girl he was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gapes at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious.\" you say softly. \"He is my best friend, but you and I are more.

Then she leans back with a longing look plain on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I know this is a rush... but can we fuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh and hug her back passionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly Umeko, but ungh, you probably have more experience with the 'software' than I do.

With another body, not Robert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be weird! But for her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" you say, and pull back a little and kiss her. That surprised her but she responds momentarily. It lasts maybe a minute, but seems like an age!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I could get to like this!\" she says, giggling and you gasp as her hands firmly cup your rump. \"Mmm, nice. Hah, I can make you blush!\" and she squeezes more and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep! Hey, watch the thumbs!\" You say feeling her thumb prodding between your butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like that? Sure?\" and she does it again \"REALLY sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's nice but, what is she getting at? Then a thumb pushes harder and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"he.. HEY!\" You gasp, feeling your sphincter grip her thumb as it slides inside. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said I should show you how to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do this a lot?\" and you nod down your back towards your rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face gets a little less enthusiastic and her thumb stops moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yeah?\" she says nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" you say, smiling again, \"just checking. But I'm not sure it's what I'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles again, now she's sure you aren't angry at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not sure? Want to find out?\" and she moves her thumb slowly in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning you lean against Umeko, the tightness getting you rather hot. That actually feels good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um M.. maybe?\" you gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins and you feel her pick up the pace, then other fingers fumble against the front of your body, around your crotch. Sighing you feel her work you from both sides, teasing just above that slit down there, getting inside the folds. She's working round this tender nub inside, but not touching it. It's like fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U..Umeko! Oh god!\" and you collapse against her, her thumb jamming tight inside, and her finger slipping into the wetness in front. The feelings are utterly incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya you'd like it.\" she said as you panted on her shoulder. \"Let me show you something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes you back, to lay on the floor looking up at her. Then she turns around and knees astride your head. You get a wonderful, up close look at her rump as she bends over you. Hands fondle your hips, then between them as her thighs straddle your face and press down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too close to it, OK?\" she says, her breath on your groin, \"It's too sensitive to touch directly. Work around it, like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes go wide as a lithe, moist, squirming mass of flesh oozes into your sex, then back up and across the folds above it. Again her tongue teases around, but not quite touching that nub. You guess that is what she's talking about. Then she pulls back briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can join in any time Will.\" she say and wiggles her butt at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy do you! You grab her rear firmly, loving the feel of her warm flesh against you, and pull her down, licking at the folds, hearing the moans, feeling them more, as they reverberate through your bones! Damn she's good! You try to keep up, but she kind of gets away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour, four orgasms for you, two for her later you are sitting up, laying against her panting, the back of your head planted between her breasts as she  strokes your nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm! Oh you can keep doing that all day Umeko!\" you say and she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of wondered if I'd ever get to do this. Fantasizing is one thing, but this is much better! Thank you Will, you have no idea what this means to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no charge. Trust me I'm enjoying this as much as you are love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twitches at that last comment, but seems OK. She doesn't stop tweaking your nipples at any rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will?\" she says a few minutes later \"I have a favor to ask of you. A pretty big one actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, shoot.\"</span></div></div>",

Very definitely a male one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle, then frown as you start to see where this is going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Umeko? Are you sure? There might be... well isn't the mask we've got good enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd really like a female mask, or better yet two female snake masks!\" and she cups your breasts with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, um, well there might be a problem with that. Our Zoo only has one Anaconda in it, male. Um, I think I saw another snake there... I mean another big snake, but not an Anaconda. I think it was a Rock Python? Not sure if that was female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, could we make two masks of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan from her ministrations and hear her chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are really really distracting. In a good way that is!\" You wriggle your head more firmly between her breasts and hear her moan. You can't resist reaching down and slipping a hand under her butt, her helping, and teasing a finger back there. You know she likes it after all. While you are playing with her rosebud you continue \"But that Mmmm! Could be a problem still.\" One of Umeko's hands keeps up the work on your chest while the other strays south between your thighs, \"Oooh yes, just there! I *ah!* I only have one remaining.. *gasp* blank mask. Making another would.. Would tak.. take t.. Ooh shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands on your chest had already got you hot, this tips you over the edge. You come hard and feel two of your fingers jam up her ass.

Well, one mask would be good for now I guess. Can we do it tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting you sit up, looking back at Umeko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight? Get the mask on the snake tonight? Um, I'm not even sure the mask will work on a Rock Python. The head is a little smaller than an Anaconda. The snake is about the same length but less bulky.

But maybe you can help with making sure no-one interrupts me while I get the mask on it?\" she nods enthusiastically. Her grin says it all. She really wants that mask! \"OK, sure I'll do it Umeko. But, can we snuggle a bit longer first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just snuggle?\" She says coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giggles and moans that follow last quiet a long time. By the time you both dress it's one in the afternoon. Then, after you remember to undress, take off the Umeko mask, and dress again it's about one thirty. That was fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Umeko? You're sure about this?\" she nods and smiles \"Right then, lets get to the Zoo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a little busier today than the last time you were here. You guess they have more business on Saturdays. You wander around the Reptile house and are a little worried that it's so full of people. Then you find something else to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, miss?\" you say to one of the staff \"What happened to the Rock Python?\" and you point to an empty tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she's not here right now, she's having a medical exam across the ways.\" and she points out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that answers two questions. One it's female, but the one about where it is is unfortunate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A medical exam? Is is painful?\" you say, trying to draw her out a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't worry they treat them very well here. We have our own in house veterinary building next to the administration block. Don't worry she'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back to Umeko and give her the bad news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" She groans \"How can we get in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still want that particular snake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you said smaller one's would be less likely to work, right? I don't see many around here even close to Anaconda size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, lets at least check the place out first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the reptile house you head over as directed and find the veterinary building. There are two buildings backed onto each other by the looks of it, the front is a front office or work place, probably where they do medical tests, surgery etc, and behind it is a larger, lower, concrete building. It looks like that is one huge room, maybe where they store animals? There is a guard outside and you wonder why they need one? You guess someone might want to steal animals... especially rare ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou motion for Umeko to wait here and walk over to the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, could you tell me where the Rock Python is being checked out? In the main building?\" and you point to the front structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah think so,\" the bored looking guard says in a drawl. \"I think it were a regular check up or som'it. Be done soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the guard you see the large, badly lit room, cages filling half of what little you can see of it from the access way. You wonder if there are any other interesting animals in there you could scan or are the cages occupied at all? You can't tell. Well, you can't do anything about that now. Umeko wants that one particular snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You say and leave the bored look guard to his magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard?\" You say to Umeko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we got to get in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go round to the painted front building, looking more like a store than a veterinary building. Keeping away from the front in case anyone sees you the two of you start checking windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! I can see her!\" Umeko gasps as quietly as she can. \"Give me a boost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab her foot and heave and she pushes open a swinging window and crawls in. Once in she leans back and leans out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'll help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two of you you manage to get yourself pulled in through the small window, but it's tight. The room looks like an examination table and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Click!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see the window shut. Just idly you try to open it... and find it's locked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! We're locked in!\" you whisper to Umeko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, get the mask done quick, while it's unconscious!\" she says. You hardly think that is the most important thing to worry about right now, but oblige, dropping the mask on the sleeping snake's head. For a few nail biting moments you wonder if you were right and it's too small, but it fits and melts in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, that'll work then. I take that mask when it's done, you take the Anaconda and we can slither out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her askance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, two things. One, How could we slither out the front without anyone noticing? And two I don't have the fixing solution with me! We can't use that mask till we get it home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko looks crestfallen, but ponders while the two of you wait for the mask. Cautiously you go to the exit and watch to see if anyone is coming, but it looks clear at the moment. Although the front of the building looked flash, this looks a little primitive. The walls are nicely finished painted concrete, and the interior walls look nicely done, but the ceilings look like cheap polystyrene sheets and the floors are wide wooden slats. There are even spaces between the planks! You wonder how many people have lost things through that floor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's coming back!\" she hisses at you and head back from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough the mask finishes emerging and you pick it up, Umeko practically brimming with excitement. Now how to get out of here?</span></div></div>",

When you get to the corner the rooms are different. They look like windowless storage rooms, but with cages in them, most unoccupied, some occupied. You see a door at the end of this stretch of corridor and things look up... right up till it starts to open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Umeko whispers and pushes you into the nearest room and pushes the door to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Clack!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't like that noise.\" You say in the pitch blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Umeko fumbling with the latch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, it's locked.\" she says softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is a small room, no-where to hide! Did you notice that all those doors were left open? Sooner or later someone will notice this door is shut and investigate. Then we get caught! What'll my dad say?

Putting a mask down to the floor you can catch flicker of light from under the door and can just barely make out which mask is which. You hand her the snake one and take the Umeko one yourself, closing everything else in the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only when you put the Umeko Mask on you remember the pain of using the snake mask. You should have offered to... *Gnnnn!* the twisting and adjusting grabs at you and you collapse, slowly filling out into Umeko's wonderful shape. By the time you've recovered you can hear hissing gasps next to you. Reaching out you can feel the Anaconda... feel Umeko wriggling there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I should have thought of that. You shouldn't have to go through that pain. I could have been the snake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when snake jaws ease over your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you could have said that 'cos you WANTED to be the snake?\" you say weakly as she continues, holding her teeth back, just sucking you in. Your dainty, Umeko hands slide into the jaws of the Anaconda which pop apart and spread wide up over your forearms. Pushing in in can feel the warmth of... wait no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYanking you pull out quickly, and briefly feel a flick of pain as one of her teeth comes down. But she controls it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Umeko, but it can't be hands first. I'd suffocate! You hear me? SUFFOCATE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think she understood and so you lay on the floor, point your toes towards her and giggle in her voice as her muzzle nudges across your thighs, finding your feet in the dark.</span></div></div>",

Wriggling you push in, pressing into the back of her throat. You can fe...OOOH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko's tail just nudged between your thighs! She twists in a bit and.... Oh god! It's big! Somehow she wriggles writhes and twists it in. You are wincing, but it mostly feels tight, not actually painful, she's being careful. Still it's a good deal larger than what normally fits in there and takes quite a bit of shoving on Umeko's part to wedge it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheeeeiiit!\" you groan, the sensations as she licks and swallows your calves makes you moist enough that the tail finally hits bottom. With a wriggle it begins to twist and shove in there, driving and turning, sending you through the roof! When the orgasm hits you her jaws are nearing your thighs and you can feel her chin nudging between your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing down from the heat of pleasure, and finding your snatch unfortunately empty now, you gasp when her nimble little tongue works into your backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEP!\" you gasp as she probes you for a few delightful seconds before pulling free and swallowing again. Gently you ease deeper and deeper, the pressure and squeezing of moist flesh DOES feel nice, but you don't think it would get you off by itself as it seems to for Umeko. Still she is loving it and it is very comfy so you wriggle in, gently helping her where you can, prizing yourself in between her jaws. Wedging your elbows in she gulps them down beside you and then you sigh when she hits your chest and waddles that in, eventually swallowing it down. You gasp in pleasure... then, as the enclosing flesh arounds you starts to be pretty much all encompasing your instincts rev up. Starting to panic as you feel her jaws cleave in on top and bottom of your head you jerk a little. You can't see it thanks god, but you can feel the moistness enclosing you and the panic rises. She's really eating you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N..no!\" you say weakly, you drained by the orgasm. \"I.. Umeko! I *Mpphh!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's too late, her jaws close and she swallows one last time, easing your body into her. You feel her shudder, and realize she just came from eating you! With desperation you force your panic back, trying to regain control. When she opens her jaws, leaving a passage for you to breath through it's a little easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god.\" You moan \"That was, different!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're inside Umeko, completely, just like she was in you before. Twisting a bit you can feel the silky wet flesh in here squeeze over your nipples and it IS nice. Still... Snakes still aren't your thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CLACK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko twitches and light floods in down her cracked open throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's in here?\" comes a voice from outside. \"Whell shit! HARRY! Who let George out of his case?\" You can't hear the reply from up the corridor \"Well he's here, in bay 5, happy as can be.\"..... \"You're kidding me? Well who's this geezer then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly you see a face between Umeko's jaws as he bends down, flashlight in hand, then her jaws snap shut. Oh god! You aren't one for claustrophobia normally, but... this is nasty! Shivering despite the humid heat inside her you hear the talk outside muffled by Umeko's flesh and you can't quite make it out. Every now and then Umeko opens her jaws and lets some fresh air down for you, but she isn't letting you out. You guess it isn't safe yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm? Wha?\" you shudder awake, in moist, dank, squishiness and almost have a panic attack. You feel curled up awkwardly. You fell asleep? In Umeko? Is she twisted around somehow? Oh god, how long have you been in here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thunk*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComes from outside and light streams in. Peering ahead you can see out of Umeko's jaws up to... bars? Are she in a cage? Beyond the bars is a dusty floor, the same as in the room you were in with wide slatted wood that... Wait is that writing? A tail taps the dust. Yep, it says, scratchily, 'Cant get door open'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" You gasp in Umeko's voice, and tail stops twitching. \"OK, I got it Umeko. Um Where are.. no scratch that, tell me later. Tip your head up, I need to see the door lock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view shifts as her head and neck goes up and to the left. The bars are part of a cage, and you can see the frame of a door with some kind of latch. It isn't a simple flick up kind though, some sort of twist lock. Umeko's tail can't curl tightly enough to grip it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big is the cage Umeko? Could you throw me up? I could unlock it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tails wags left to right in front of her. No go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Ungh!* It is tight in here.\" you say, and feel a shiver around you. You didn't think reptile's shivered? Isn't that just mammals? \"Um, maybe I can reach up. Open your jaws and I'll see if I can reach it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko twists a little, your body bending inside her, as she curls her head closer to the lock. Then she opens her mouth and throat wider. It's still tight in here, your hips and shoulders particularly squeezed, but you manage to wiggle your right arm up against yourself and extend it up Umeko's throat. You're quite a ways down but luckily your hand just reaches beyond her jaws. Fumbling you reach through the bars and grasp the twist lock and try to undo it. It's tricky, with your arm blocking her throat you can't see what you're doing. It takes several minutes to do what you'd normally manage in a few seconds. Finally you hear a click and the door swings away from you. You can feel the tension ebb from Umeko's body around you and she wriggles forwards and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gulp, SQUELCH!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOooh!\" You gasp, your arm swallowed down, and your body too a little ways as she frees herself from the cage. Thankfully she doesn't keep going. You have no idea how far down in her body a snake's stomach is. Are you already in it? Also, how long have you been in here? Panic starts to rise once more as you realise where you are and what normally goes on in here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep a hold of the panic and grit your teeth while Umeko stretches and relaxes. Her jaws widen again after a minute and you peer down at the floor once more through her throat, her tail scratching away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'sorry    you OK?' it says in staggered letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I think so. It's a little tight, but comfortable. I'm just worried at being inside you so long.\" Another shiver from her. Well you can't blame her, you're scared about what might happen to you too. \"OK, now we're out of the cage throw me up!\"</span></div></div>",

Relaxing now you know you are not going to be a REAL dinner date for Umeko you try to enjoy this... and it is kind of pleasant. Feel her moist, warm body squeezing around you... wait, aren't snake's cold-blooded? Why is she warm in here? Mmmmm! OK, that's better than nice! Uhhh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooch!\" You grunt as pressure jams tight on your shoulders, and you stop your inching forwards. \"What's up Umeko?\" she wriggles, and then tries again with the same result, your shoulders pressed tight against what feels like a constricting ring. It feels like muscle and flesh, not bone. Why isn't it giving to let you out? She was deeper than this in you when you swallowed her and she came out fine. Heck, it can't even be difference in meal sizes as you are wearing the Umeko mask so you're the same sized meal she was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Umeko gives up and her throat opens to a view of the dusty floor again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Will!  cant get you out. help!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting from the exhertion of being squeezed (rather pleasantly mostly) you try to think what to do and force back the panic rising once more. It's hard not to think of what is going to... what might happen if you stay in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, OK, we'll think of something!\" you manage, and are amazed your voice didn't crack. \"First, can you get out of here? Are we still in the Vet building?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'out back i think' she scribbles 'theres window by guard. Ill try sneaking out'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, be careful, and remember your sense of hearing is bad as a snake, or at least different. What you hear isn't what he hears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tail bobs up and down in agreement and she starts moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!\" You gasp as her undulating body squeezes you. She stops instantly. \"Oh, er, it's OK Umeko, just kinda caught me by surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts off again and you restrain a moan as the ripples move along you from head to foot. OK, you could REALLY get used to this! A short time later you realize that she's moving just like a snake, exactly what you tried to do when you had the mask on, and failed. Well, you guess she had quite a bit of practice at this when she fled her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly your body bends back as Umeko lifts her head and neck upwards. It's uncomfortable but Umeko is going slow and trying to be gentle. You wriggle a bit, then as she moves further upwards you straighten out a little, bending more in the lower back and legs. Through a brief crack as her mouth opens ahead you see a small window high on a wall. Then she's undulating again, first rippling over your chest wonderfully, then something jams against your shoulders. You bump, then it presses harder as Umeko tries to fit through the window. She goes slow, but you aren't sure you'll fit by the feel of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting Umeko squeezes in and you grunt as you feel yourself driven deeper into her slightly. You daren't say anything as the guard might be close by, so bite your lip and try not to squeal as more ripples ooze over you. Just as you are about to give up you feel something tight go past your shoulders. There are a few more tight spots, but it doesn't halt her this time and Umeko wriggles through the window. Bending once more you feel her settle slowly to the ground and coil loosely in a big circle, large enough that it doesn't curl you too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her mouth you get a scent of fresh cut grass and the view out of her maw of her tail pointing at the wall about fifty yards away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Umeko, go for it.\" you say, your voice ragged \"But please stop for a rest on the other side, and find some dust, dirt or something to write in on the other side. I might need to ask you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes are total bliss, a constant, slow ripple over your whole body. It's like a complete body massage, and thanks to wearing the Umeko mask it is very erotic too! Unfortunately she does reach the wall and stops undulating to rear up to it. From the feel of it she has to maneouver over quite a few obsticles and it feels like it's maybe ten minutes of climbing up and down before she is on the ground again. The climbing was, interesting, but not a patch on the massage before hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You OK Umeko?\" you say, your voice a little more solid now. Her mouth cracks again and her tail wags up and down in view. \"Good. See if you can find somewhere to hide, preferably where you can write to me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute of pleasurable slithering later and she's curled behind some bushes, her head over some dirt. You fumble with your feet, grabbing the bag with yours and Umeko's clothes in it, among other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Umeko, could you try to relax a bit? I'm trying to get at my phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tail bob says 'yes' and you try to push the bag up with your feet, twisting and bending around to attempt to reach down and grab it. It takes a lot longer than you'd like, but eventually you heave it up as far as you can (you certainly can't get it beyond the lump of your breasts) and fumble it open. A few tries find your pants inside and grab the phone from the pocket. A flick and light illuminates your surroundings from the cellphone's display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, gazing at the moist pink prison you've been stuck inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice view,\" you murmur, \"but could use a few curtains and drapes.\" was that a shiver?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, to work you've got at least one phone call to make! First is an all important one. Your parents! You see on your phone that it's 6:45PM. On saturday they would expect you to let them know if you're late for dinner. Now you've got to tell them you won't be home tonight! You don't know if you'll get out of here in time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a breath and wriggle your hand up to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later Umeko.\" you say to your own body, and only after wonder what the real Umeko thought about that phrase. This stuff can start to stretch your brain after a while!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull, say the requisite Latin phrase and yank the mask off, feeling the shudder run through you and the weirdness ripple through your body. A few moments later you are Will again. Thankfully you didn't drop the cellphone in the other hand! Tucking the mask back into the bag you flip open the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom.... yeah, I know.... I'm, well I'm going to be out with Caleb tonight.\" You pray you can contact to Caleb before your mom rings him! \"Yeah, a science project... no nothing from school, just our own stuff. No, No mom! I wouldn't do anything dangerous! I know. I love you too. Take care!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the phone with a sigh you go to the next task, figuring what to do to get you out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umeko? Do have any idea how to get me out?\" a tail shake; 'no' \"Damn! Well, maybe you could head to the clubhouse. I'm pretty sure I've got some antacids there. It's not far, but as a snake? I'm not sure how long it'll take to get there.\" You pause, considering the other phone calls you were considering. \"There is another option. We could call someone for help.\" you feel her jerk at that. \"I know, but... there is someone else who knows something, though not much, about the masks. You see I sold a mask to Andrew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts scribbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'you what?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Early on I needed money for materials, and he needed legs. I merged our faces to make a mask of a new person for him. With it he can walk again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'ok, I understand. why didnt you tell me'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"um, I guess I didn't think of it?\" you manage weakly as you get a few spasmodic squeezes from her, you guess this wouldn't be good place to piss off Umeko from! \"He doesn't know much about them. I told him I found out about how to make them online, but the website is gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'he believ that?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes?\" you say awkwardly. You guess it does sound kind of stupid like that. \"He seemed to. Look he's already grateful to me for giving him the ability to walk back, he hasn't pushed about if I know about anything else other than masks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'what else?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I haven't read ahead yet much, actually the book won't LET you read ahead much, but I haven't tried the next spell. I'm actually kinda scared. These masks are powerful enough. What else is in there?\" you shake your head \"Anyway, Andrew knows the masks exist even if not about the book. We can tell him I made a snake mask and you put it on ... and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I ate you accidetly?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could swear she hissed a laugh there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK... awkward I know, but... we need to do something! If we get Andrew's help he's going to have to know what's happened. Can you stand him knowing you ate me?\" Oh that sounds so weird on so many levels... this could give you a permanent head ache just thinking about it!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Um, that is something you can help with though. When you come could you bring some antacids? A lot of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you want ANDREW to come?\" he says frostily. Oh yeah, this is 'Freddy' not Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out by the Zoo on 17th Street, East exit, outside the gate. Um... look for something weird and... don't be surprised and... think of what you know and some odd possibilities... OK?\" hey, you can be cryptic too! Serve him right... though it might just make it more difficult for him to help you. *sigh*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure.

You're guessing he took longer to get the mask off, get his wheelchair into his SUV (Which he insists on calling a truck for some reason) than actually driving here. His Blue 'truck' pulls up across the street and he gets out on the lift. Soon you can see him as Umeko tracks him, framing his wheeling form in the view from inside her maw. When he gets close you ring him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Andrew, go up to those bushes up ahead, and try to relax. There is NOTHING dangerous there, OK? Promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't even answer, just nods and wheels in your direction. This is it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he gets within a few feet Umeko gently lifts her head from the foliage and opens wide, your hand sticking out and waving calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JEEE... I mean, oh god! What have yo... Who...?\" He sighs and collects himself for a moment. \"OK, which one of you is Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Umeko, told you he was smart?\" you say, she just hisses around your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling it back inside you settle back while Umeko slides back into cover, though Andrew can still see her from where he is you think. Tricky to tell from in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" you say up Umeko's throat \"It's like this. The... snake here is Umeko, and yes, she ate me. But she can't seem to throw me back up. Can you think of a way to get me out of here?\"</span></div></div>",

You wriggle and squirm, pushing the bag upwards. Now that you're male again it isn't hard to get it up past your chest into her throat, but coughing it up is tricky.

Hey, it's not as if you haven't seen her naked... though you guess it IS Andrew as her... yeah, that would be a bit icky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" comes Andrew in Umeko's voice \"I can do this, I can do this!

It's a little  late for dinner in your book, your family usually eats around 6:30. You wonder about it idly, and then ask Umeko about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dad insists. he work late often and want family together for meal.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that sounds cool Uncle Scott, I mean your Dad, sounds like he wants a good family. Why don't you get along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'oh, this my fault?' she says, a little erratically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't mean...\" you say, awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'sorry, old argument.' she scribbles, then shakes the tray blank. 'Dad wants family bad, mom too, but Dad forces it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forces?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'he doesn't raise voice, doesn't hit, he just insists. a lot' she shakes the tray again 'he doesnt like to not have his way. doesnt listen'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh. Yeah Dad can be a little like that too sometimes, but generally he's OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know.

Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko is obviously feeling awkward right now so you let it drop and you have a drink of water, and she has a drink, thus bathing you in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA  little later you spend a couple of hours watching a soppy movie that you wouldn't have touched with a 10ft bargepole before, but Umeko recommends. It's actually better than you expected and you actually find you're enjoying yourself, more for knowing you're watching it with Umeko than for the movie itself. You think at the end that if Umeko had tear ducts she'd be crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find both of you not saying/writing anything for a while, just a kind of awkward silence. She manages to swallow a bottle of antacids (you have to open the bottle inside!) and she curls up in front of the radiator in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to think of something to say, something that might make her feel better, but the day has been really complicated, and find yourself drifting off to sleep again.</span></div></div>",

No panic, no fear. Weird. For maybe half an hour you rest, listening to her heart beat around you, her moist insides pressing against your skin... Hmm, you wonder why you don't have bed sores or a rash or something? You've been in her for a long time... well, partly in the Umeko mask, maybe that lessened things, switching back and forth. Still all night in a (admittedly comfy) very wet place probably should have left you a little worse for wear. You aren't even itching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you feel Umeko start to shift, twitch, then finally raise her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\" you say in a gentle, tender voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world jerks around you and shudders, ripples going over you. Whoah, you thought you were being gentle about that, but you must have caught her unawares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, Uh, you OK Umeko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little shifting, the sound of the salt tray shaking and her mouth yawning before you, light streaming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Im fine. Good morning.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise that wasn't just surprise. Again it was her reacting to the thought of you inside her. Maybe Andrew was right, maybe the reason you couldn't get out was because unconsciously she doesn't want to let go of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umeko? I know these last few days have been weird, but I'd like to ask you a serious question.\" You pause, trying to arrange your thoughts. \"You know how I feel about you. From all our time together I was already close and... OK, yeah I wanted to be with you anyway, but the last couple of days have made me want more. As I said, I love you Umeko. I know, me as a guy you can't love, but I think I've made my mind up. If you want me as a girl, as a snake, or anything else you've got me. I'll make any mask you want and... honestly there is one last thing. I know I have to get out of here to avoid getting turned into lunch, but can I come back? Please? Being inside you has been fantastic. You have no idea what it's like in here when you slither around. You're going to have to show me how you slither just so I can show you what that feels like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough your speech Umeko was still. Now she shakes the tray and shakily writes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Will. you dont know how much means to me.' shake 'I wish there was way you could sleep in me every night'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love that!\" you say chuckling, and she shivers around you again. \"But your parents wouldn't want you out at night and mine would start to wonder. I might make it for a couple of nights a week tops, but doubtful more than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'deal!' she writes, and her tail slides into her own mouth, coming to rest in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you don't know what she wants, then you realize she has no hands. This is her version of a handshake! Smiling you wriggle an arm up and take her tail lightly and shake on it. After her tail leaves you wriggle up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'what you want for brekfast?' she scribbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, how about we just do it simple. Bacon would be nice but I don't think even with my arms sticking out we could do breakfast properly. OJ would be fine. But would you mind just having water? I really don't feel like an orange juice bath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments she pauses, just laying there not answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umeko? What's up?\" no answer. You're just about to ask again when she breaths in and *SQUEEEEZE!* \"OOOOHH GOD!\" You grunt as muscles heave down on you. It's not as fun in your body as it is in Umeko's, but still it's nice, even though the massage this time is a little rough. Again you hit a ring of muscle as  you head up, but it seems to be twitching. And as you hold your breath she squeezes you against it again and again and... *Pop!* and your shoulders are oozing up Umeko's throat! You're heading out! It takes quite a while and you try not to shift too much, not wanting to make her swallow again. The light gets stronger, her jaws yawn past you and you finally see her tongue brushing your face as her lips move down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Umeko!\" you gasp feeling the pressure all around your lower body. As your hips reach her jaws she studiously avoids the rigid pole with her tongue, but soon you are easing your legs from her throat and laying on the floor, panting. As soon as you get your breath back you turn and lean over to her. \"Thank you, and I meant what I said. Any time you want a snack I'm available!\" then you lift her snake head up and kiss her on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while she goes with it, then suddenly she pulls away, her tail coming up to her face, gripping her eyebrow and nose and... oh! She hisses three times, pulls and... nothing. She blinks, tries again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're saying it wrong?\" you say and lean in, grip her face the appropriate way and say the phrase and pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HIIISSSSESEEEAAAARGGGGHHH!\" she screams, her changing body falling into your arms as she writhes. Yes you have a hard on as she becomes female once more, but you try to ignore it, holding and soothing her as she undergoes the painful transition. Finally she is panting in your arms, human once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home.\" you say softly, and kiss her. She doesn't respond as enthusiastically as you'd like, but she doesn't stop you either. She even smiles at you with a very tired looking face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Andrew has some clothes here somewhere for us.\" you say, helping her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a while to find something that fits her, but you do. At least she doesn't seem to be nervous being naked around you any more, and you aren't as all fired up to see her naked now. You need her, but not in that way. At least not only in that way! You still love the way she looks but it kind of feels... natural now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will, thank you. For... so many things.\" she says as she finishes pulling on a t-shirt and slacks, about the only things that will fit her. As you finish dressing she comes over and hugs you \"I wish we had my mask right about now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be a fitting start to the day! But I could always use the snake mask if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's obvious she's tempted, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'll give him a rest for a while. Besides I'm famished, haven't had a meal... a meal I could digest, in ages. lets get breakfast then try to find out how Andrew made out last night.\"</span></div></div>",

Andrew sighs in relief \"Then I need to get out of here! Oh god I hate being young again! This isn't like the movies, I like my freedom for god's sake. How do kids make it with all the rules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, trying to avoid bursting out laughing.

Bring me back a pitchfork OK?\" Andrew just blows you a raspberry before you hand the phone to Umeko. As she takes the phone you get the impression she wants to say this in private so before she can 'look meaningfully' at you you head out, saying over your shoulder... \"So, I'll get you that OJ for you Umeko, now I'm not in the way down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you head back in with her drink, and one for yourself, the phone is hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be over in about an hour.\" Umeko says, though you raise an eyebrow at this. The trip would only take fifteen minutes. \"He's got to persuade my Dad to let him out for the day. That'll take a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. Enough time for breakfast anyways.\" and the two of your head to the kitchen to make some bacon and toast... quite a lot of it for Umeko. Apparently she was REALLY hungry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, take it, keep it, burn it!\" Andrew says as he comes in, as Freddy, shoving the Umeko mask into your hands. \"I don't care, just keep it away from me! Oh god, teenage girls! Bah!\" and he storms off upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, welcome back?\" Umeko manages weakly by your side to his retreating back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK, I'm sure he'll calm down later.\" You say, almost going to put an arm around her waist, then pause and think better of it. \"Here, this is yours I believe?\" you say, handing her the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko stares down at it, peering into the holographic image of herself in the mask, glinting in the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... it's yours Will.\" she says quietly \"But can I get one of you in return?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis floors you for a moment, then a grin slowly spreads across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of... me? Is this going where my, admittedly smutty, mind thinks it's going?\" you say, and see her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just nods, still blushing. You gently lift her face to look her in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this for... well, you by yourself or... with me and...\" and you wave the Umeko mask idly.</span></div></div>",

You know it felt weird with Umeko in the Robert mask before. How much more weird is it going to be as her, with her as YOU!... She bites her lip as she sees you seriously considering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can handle it Umeko, if you're gentle with me.\" and that at least gets a giggle out of her. \"But first we need to get to the Clubhouse and 'fix' the Python mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmeko's eyes go wide at that and you suspect she'd actually forgotten about it! She nods enthusiastically and is about to just head out. You grab her arm and shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First lets get our stuff back. Andrew still has my bag with our old clothes and stuff... and the unfixed mask. Plus I want to thank him for the diabolical living hell he's just walked through. I mean, living as a kid again! Shock horror!\" and you both chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you head upstairs and knock on his bedroom door and hear him tell you to come in. Inside he is out of his Freddy mask and in his wheelchair again, in front of a computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted our bag of clothes back...\" and Andrew sighed, grabbed it from the back of his wheelchair. It was up here the whole time? *sigh* He tossed the bag to you and you nodded back to him. \"Thanks. Oh and also to say thank you Andrew, we owe you big time for all this! Saving us from the Zoo and what you just went through\" You say he stares at you with a strong frown and nods slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy do you ever owe me!\" He says, and melodramatically shivers. \"If I ever go near that house again I'll probably break out in hives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppress a grin and try to remain calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does a blank mask sound? As recompense?\" you say calmly, waving good bye to a thousand bucks. Hey, Umeko is worth it! \"I'll give you a pot of fixer and you can make it of whoever you want, a mix I'd suggest, like before. You go as someone else and... well, identity theft has nothing on this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew's face starts to calm, the irritation draining out of him, but leaving him looking at you oddly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will, this last week or so, have you been on drugs or something?\" You peer at him and he waves his hand. \"I'm serious! You aren't exactly known for... well, how can I put this. Generosity? Forethought? Thinking with something other than your...\" Andrew pauses and his gaze slips to Umeko who bites her lip. \"...hormones?\" he finishes lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... well, you know. This is big stuff Andy.\" you say, beginning to realize you have begun to think bigger lately. When did that start? With the book? Why? \"I... I just want to do something right, I guess. Hey, what're you worried about, you'd be down another grand otherwise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't complaining Will. Thanks, just if you see William Prescott say hi to him for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle and mutter something about making him a blank mask this week and out of his room. You dash into the bathroom while Umeko goes into the spare room and dress in your own clothes again, leaving the 'loaners' from Andrew here. Going back out on the landing you meet up with Umeko and head downstairs. Half way down the stairs you stop and stare at Umeko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I changed these last few weeks Umeko?\" you say carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns and looks at you seriously and pauses for quite a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly... yeah.\" She says, some nerves showing in her face \"You've kind of grown up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! I've been grown up! I ain't a kid!\" you say, but manage to remain somewhat calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I mean. Before you'd have really blown your top over anything I said like that. Now, you seem more able to deal with stuff. Not as over emotional as you used to be.\" you raise an eyebrow and she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that was the line guys said to girls about emotional outbursts or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, get me a Will mask and we'll see if it holds true there huh?\" she says and heads downstairs, then calls over her shoulder \"Before, during and after!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy!</span></div></div>",

Everything looks good, seems Blackwell didn't follow you here before or something. You pat the book, but right now really don't want to go into something new. There are other things on your mind right now, and something specific on Umeko's! A gleam is in her eye as she gets the Python mask out and uses the pot of fixative on it carefully, though you do notice a slightly shaky hand with the brush. With a lick of her lips she puts the pot down and lifts the finished mask up before her, inside facing herself, and gazes at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK... a little privacy Will?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn away then hear the rustle of clothes, then the squeak of a chair that she moves out of the way so she can lie down. A brief sigh, then a stifled scream when she puts the mask on. Wincing you keep away while she changes, the sound of thrashing limbs, then thrashing tail, coming from behind you, grating teeth sounds blending into hisses before finally subsiding. About twenty seconds later there is a tap on your shoulder and you turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Umeko is... different. The anaconda was bulky, thick around and with a fairly large head for a snake, about 8 or 9 inches long. It was also only maybe twenty foot long. The Python is thinner, a fair bit longer (25, 30 feet?) but the head is thinner and a little shorter, maybe 6 or 7 inches long. You're surprised the mask worked on it actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Umeko.\" You say, smiling at 'her' \"So, the new suit fit well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can't grin of course, but makes a fair imitation of hissing a laugh. You wonder if Pythons can hear better? She has her head lifted up level with yours as her body slowly curls around you... and then you see a mask in her coils, which then hoist it up from the floor in front of you. Ah, she wants you to change too huh? You take the mask and look into Umeko's eyes. For some reason this snake seems... more sensuous than the other. It's a lighter color, a mottled mid and light green mix all over rather than with dark green, light and yellow stripes, but it's also the shape, longer thinner, and the head is also somehow more feminine. Perhaps that is more to do with the species than the gender, but what ever it is it works. A coil loops lightly up, across your back and over your shoulders lightly, rippling slightly across them. She taps the mask before you with her snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He, OK Umeko, I get the message. Hurry up and change huh?\" She hisses as you bring the mask up before you.</span></div></div>",

Oh, somehow you'd figured she'd want the snake? Well, this is more your thing certainly. Sitting down (though Umeko doesn't uncoil from you, just flows with you) you just unbutton your shirt, undo your trousers (and slip your underwear down a little inside to be sure) and take a deep breath before putting the mask on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usual discomfort, and something more, flows over you as you change. A few seconds later, while you are still recovering, you feel Umeko draw the last of your clothes off and realize that is why it felt odd. Umeko had lifted you off the ground in her coils and stripped you while you were changing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah! Um, thanks.\" you say in her voice. Her slender head bobs into view over you and nods back, then settles comfortably between your breasts as her coils wrap around your limbs, flexing and rippling over you. There is even a tight coil behind your head, supporting you like a pillow. It's actually rather comforting. She seems insistent on wrapping  around you, but lets you pull your right arm free and you reach up and stroke the side of her head, just poking out of your cleavage. That in itself is an odd thought, but you're starting to get used to the idea of having cleavage. She wriggles contentedly in there as you stroke her, you moaning in sinc with her motions. That feels good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what seems like hours you literally float on a sea of Umeko Python, her body massaging you all over, she even slips her long tongue into your mouth at one point, though snake kisses aren't all they could be from your point of view. Not mobile enough lips. Stroking her head, now back in it's cleavage abode again, you smile down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm,\" you moan as a coil wriggles around your rump slowly. Her motions are getting a little more insistent and you think she is getting a little horny from the rubbing of her head in there and the way a length of her tail is pressed between your legs. You just like the feel of her all around you and let her go as she pleases for now, and the massage continues, a couple of coils lifting up from the side and looping over your breasts gently and starting to ripple, as if she were slithering, kneading the supple flesh tightly. \"Oh now THAT is good!\" you moan, then moan deeper as the length between your legs presses harder and ripples too.</span></div></div>",

You sit up and meet her eyes with your's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want a mask of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs all that she asks for, it's not a request you can refuse, as you take a look at your body, you smile at her, she laughs, and you know immediately that it's what she wants. The laugh after she asks for something is her way of blowing it off, trying to sweep it under the rug, you've know her for a long time, and you are her, you hold her hand gently, she stops laughing, almost shocked by your sudden change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can, I mean you let me make one of you, so it's only fair!\" You tell her, shattering the odd wall of laughter she placed between you. She smiles an incandescent smile, latching on to you. Kissing you and squealing as she does this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU SOOOOOO MUCH WILL!!!!!!\" Umeko screams in joy! Literally trying to kiss her face off your body. \"I mean I felt so weird not being able to like girls, and then you became one! Or well, you became me and then I got to expirence it finally! Now if I become you we can finally understand each other! I mean am not going to ask for sex as us! But you know maybe we can find a girl we can get a mask of to at least see what it's like!!\" She speaks, slowly getting more and more excited. As the planning and utter delight reach a critical mass, your phone goes off, cathing both of your attentions, you pick it up, quickly anwering it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" You say, suddenly remembering who is speaking your words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umeko?\" Your mother questions, sounding slightly relieved. \"I was worried about Will. Thank god he's with you, can you hand the phone to him?\" She asks. Umeko is giggling at your predicament, the akward conversation of playing your cousin with your own mother now under way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry auntie, he is helping my friend moving some stuff, I asked if he could help us without sending you a message!\" You quickly say, Umeko suddenly sending daggers at you with her eyes. \"They went to get some pizza while I cleaned up some of the furniture. They should be back any mintue.\" You finish quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, tell him his supper will be waiting for him when he gets back if he is still hungry.\" She says joyfully, relieved that you're safe, strange as it seems to hear from another person's perception. Your mother talks to you for quite a bit about love and other things, but soon you begin to understand, maybe she treats Umeko like a distant daughter. Not as strict your relatives treat her under their household rules, but like she isn't a stranger to being an outcast at all. The conversation hits a powerful note when she says the final set of words. \"Umeko, I know you're different than what your parents want, but if you need anything am here for you.\"she speaks with a strong sense of motherly love, a little shocking to hear from her, then it hits you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My mom knows Umeko isn't in to guys!!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis revaluation shocks you, to the point where Umeko takes the phone and sighs off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell Will!!!\" She says looking concerned for a moment, her face trying to not show the concern for your sudden change of attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ume, my mom knows your a lesbian.....\" You tell her, not trying to be blunt, by using a nick name she hated. She even pauses, sort of taken back by this, she looks at you, blankly staring at her own face, until the words she puts out are a simple<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.... Shit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe return home is greeted by your father not being to happy about you being home after nine, yet happy you helped family. Your mother sits with you at the dinner table as you eat asking about Umeko and her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she tall?\" She asks, being quieter than normal, you know how to deal with it, but you need to ask her straight to her face. It's not easy, but it has to be done, or else it would be weird to dance around the subject, so you choose to says it bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umeko isn't into her friend, she just hangs out. Plus she isn't into girls like Umeko.\" You say bluntly, just like you were told to do by Umeko. Your mother smiles, she stands up to approach you, embracing you with a very tender hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am glad you're able to be her family and friend William. I know your dad's part of the family is a bit more religious than most, especially his brother. He was the most out spoken about our relationship when we started getting serious.\" She tells you as she lets you go and gets a glass of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you mean?\" You ask, the curiosity of your mother now being on the rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never told anyone this, but my hometown is filled with people dedicated to a very isolated belief. It praises illusion's, truth, lies, understanding one another. My mother, your grandmother was very much into it, it's part of the reason you don't see them too often.\" She relentlessly tells you, looking down at the cup of water.  \"I was the priestess' daughter, so it was expected of me to go into the faith, but I wanted to see the world, then I met your father.\" She looks happier, beaming fondly over the memories going through her mind, the look on her face being on of pure satisfaction. \"I was made to do a lot of things against people who were different. Not racism, but just for being different, I learned later about how amazing people can be, especially when your father snuck me out of the town. All the way to Texas, it's where we made it official. Point is I didn't look back once I left that prison. It's okay for people to be different, and am glad you don't hate Umeko for liking what she likes.\" She says with a brighter smile, looking at with proud eyes. \"Even if you had the biggest crush on her, more than Lisa.\" She teases as she leaves, leaving you with a strong blush on your face as you finish the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're up till one in the morning preparing a mask, not the full treatment, just the basics. You can't risk starting a house fire when your this sleepy. Still as you look on, the way your mother spoke about the place she grew up in, you can't recall it's name, but you know of it. It's a very bothersome feeling, but you push it aside and finish the mask before it gets it's final treatment for your face. The thought of you being so close to Umeko like this, maybe there is something about these masks that you don't fully understand? Maybe it's worth going deeper into the book? You're unsure of it, there is an eerie feeling encroaching from it, like the book is somehow, deceiving you. You hold it in your hand trying to turn the pages past the other pages, some are blank, others are gone, some are scribbled with barely readable words. The leather almost feels like it's breathing, like a child in your hands, or a shark. You hold above your head, curiosity gets the better of you and you begin to type in some of the words scribbled on it, and look at the strange markings. The search is long into the night, it's sunrise when are able to stop, but you have discovered a lot more about the book, more than you wanted. The ruins on the leather praise gods of deception, trickery, cunning, silver tongued devils, assassin's, druids, sorcerers, and, all manner of spirits. The book from what you can tell originated in Europe, somewhere before the dark ages, the runes are from the oldest of alphabets used by shamans and druids. You print everything you can find about it. The list of god associated with anything of it to who my have had it, at some point, you begin to think Alistair Crowley may have used it, or have knowledge of it. It's past seven when your obsession ends, the mania leading you to run your hands over the computer screen and papers of many names, but only a few stand out. It's too perfect not to match it the runes have it traced back into Gaulish, the ancient druidic letters lead you to Taliesin and Gwyyddion, Shapeshifting gods. Yet in runes, Loki is seen, even more confusing, the words are more than insane ramblings, they are incantations, of some sort, the words don't flow right. They created a blend of ancient celtic and elder runes, some are even from Greek and Angelo Saxon times. You don't even have time to process it, but as you barely chant, the starnge words, the book vanishes into thin air! You jump back falling onto your bed, knocking the chair spilling papers off your desk, a cup breaking in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WILL? Is everything all right??\" Your father calls, a little confused by how early you're up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah am fine, just rolled out of bed!!! Literally.....\" You finish as he opens the door, looking confused by the mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.... Get dressed, go have breakfast, normally you aren't even up this early. I'll take your brother too school, your mother is going to see my sister today.\" He sighs in disbelief. \" I swear she makes more money by keeping that stupid fortune teller gig, and it goes directly to her head.\" He mutter as he walks out. When he's gone, you examine you hand, something feels off, like there is more weight to it now, or it's being held by something...... \"CLEAN YOUR ROOM BEFORE YOU GO ANYWHERE TODAY!!!\" your father shouts from the staircase. You say nothing, but recall the letters in your head, trying to word them out, in a flash, dull and a strange ghost flame, the book appears. You place it down, trying the words spell again, the book disappears, or hides itself.... Now you know a little actual spells........ You get into the morning routine of a shower and have breakfast, you aren't speaking much, but processing the information, the things you can barely translate about the book, maybe it's more than just masks, maybe your on to something. As you leave the house, searing sensation attacks your right hand! You check your hand, to see a small mark, it's a mask tattoo almost branded perfectly to your  palm. </span></div></div>",

I've never actually been with a snake that big in person before. It'd be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, try not to freak out! Try not to freak out.

I've got a clubhouse in the old basement.\" she nods as you give directions to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure you bring that mask Will.\" she says and the two of you head up the creek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the house the cops are gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I can manage from here.\" Umeko says quietly \"Pretty sure I can grab some clothes from my room then come in from outside and say I was out stargazing or something. My window is still open isn't it?\" she says squinting at the side of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was earlier when the cops were here. Are you sure Umeko? I could help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you've done enough. Thank you. Besides I really don't need help dressing Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's your turn to blush!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't mean....\" and shes laughing. OK it was pretty funny. You join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you tomorrow night.\" She seems on the verge of saying something else, and looks nervous about it, but then changes her mind and just starts creeping over to her house. You stay there till she at least gets into her room without being uncovered. You guess she'll change then go out the window and come in the front door. You wouldn't want to be her then! Her dad is nice, but you've seen him in a bad mood! Not fun!</span></div></div>",

It doesn't exactly HAVE a face. Would the mask even work? You are just trying to visualize what it would be like to be that, to be that flexible, twistable... problems though. They live underwater. Would you have to build some sort of Aqualung for fish? Um, well not fish. What is an Octopus anyway? Reading the information plate you find it's a Mollusc... no a Cephalapod. That last name rings a bell, you've probably heard it before, but aren't molluscs shellfish or something? Weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, miss?\" you ask a lady nearby with a Zoo uniform. \"Can Octopuesses... er Octupi? Can they move and live out of water at all? You know hold their breath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can survive for brief periods out of water but can't support themselves up out of water. They are strong, but without a skeleton tend to collapse out of the supporting buoyancy of water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting your lip you thank the lady and return to watching the creature. Would you even be able to control those limbs? Under water it would be fun and lithe and limber... You wonder if there are any girl's who have a fetish for Octopi? You can't actually get the courage up to ask the lady if they penises. You'd probably be fobbed off with a pat answer and shooed away or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctopus, Hmmm, the plate says their skin needs water for moisture. You've heard that they had similar trouble transporting dolphins and things. Have to keep them wet. Would Octopi be easier? The moisture thing would be tricky but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you go wide eyed and almost burst out laughing. You remember a TV show where an Octopus squeezed through a tiny opening. Could you... fit that entire body into... into a girl's pussy? Holy shit! What a thought! You're sure that would be moist enough, though you'd still need to breath, water or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou end up heading home ponding how to build a aqualung... or would that be an atmolung? Aerolung? Aerogill? Probably based on the fish tank aerators you've seen, but with their own power supply. You'd need a small reserve tank of water to aerate, circulation equipment, flexible rubber grommets that would seal over an Octopi's... um, lips? Vents? You'd really have to do some research on this.</span></div></div>",

A scientist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you don't know any scientists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Caleb is kind of like one. He's a hell of a lot more science-y and math-y than you are. He even has the look: Long face, beaky nose, droopy lips, and tightly curled hair cut short into a scalp-hugging rug. Put him in a lab coat, and he could play Egon Spengler in a high-school production of <i>Ghostbusters.</i> But even geekier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you call him up. \"Hey, we're getting together tomorrow after church, right?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't got church,\" he retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, you godless fuck.

What kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" he says, and the line goes dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you text him. He doesn't reply.

Long enough for me to cum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So after the end credits, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb flips the bird in your face. \"I was concentrating on something else, and I turned it off after spackling the computer screen. Do you watch your pornos past that point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" Stephanie Wyatt mutters as she strides past you. \"Keep it to the locker room, you pervs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty-six-double-deez!\" Caleb shouts after her. \"She had thirty-six-double-deez, and I paused the video when she popped them out, and I pinged her right between them with my spooge!\" He grabs his package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie shoots him a murderous glare over her shoulder, but doesn't veer or break stride otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can talk to Stephanie that way?\" you mutter at Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you just hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't fucking believe it. She scares me.\" You shake your head in jealous wonder. Stephanie Wyatt plays for the girls' basketball team, and has thighs she could probably use to crush your head like a brittle walnut, if you were ever bold enough to put your head between her thighs. You'd probably lose an arm-wrestling contest with her, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she looks <i>fucking great</i> and <i>great to fuck</i> in shorts and polo shirts, which makes her even more intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to stop giving a shit, Prescott,\" Caleb says. \"Like it matters what she thinks of you. So what did you want to talk to me about the other night that was so fucking urgent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to know if we were going to hang out after church yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, I guess not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you do instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Jacked off twice between Sunday School and whatever time you guys sang your last hymn. Mm.\" Caleb stretches. \"It must suck for you, only getting to spend one morning a week with your wood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Stephanie, wait up!\" you yell after her. \"This perv won't shut up about his pecker!\" But she's too far ahead, and of course you didn't really mean it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was the crisis?\" Caleb asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No crisis. But did you ever turn your phone back on again? I couldn't ever get you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb checks his cell with a frown, and runs his thumb over the screen. \"Okay, I'm hooked up again. Apparently I didn't miss anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did want a chance to show you something, get your help with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what? Your\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So fucking help me, Johansson, I will punch you in the face if you shove your cock into the conversation again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwww!\" That's from three girls. You're passing into the breezeway that runs in front of the gym, so it's crowded with other students. Caleb laughs asthmatically as you sputter at the girls. But they just return your flannel-mouthed apologies with dirty looks and shrink back against the wall until you're past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice sounds as you exit the breezeway into the small quad on the other side. \"Yo, where the fuck you guys been?\" Keith Tilley asks. He's hunched up, and he darts fearful glances over at the gym doors. \"I've been dangling over there with my dick hanging out\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Tilley,\" Caleb sneers. \"No one wants to hear about your genitalia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith's jaw goes slack, and he turns a wounded expression from Caleb to you. \"What's his problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He only wants to talk about his own\u2014\" You glance around, but there aren't any girls about. \"Penis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb nudges you hard. \"Never mind, Keith,\" he says in a kinder tone. \"What's <i>your</i> story? You look like you're about to shit yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you would too if Javits came into the place you were working, the day you were working, and ordered three dozen donuts from you, and fucking <i>winked</i> at you after picking them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Caleb is nonplussed. \"Did Seth do that? That's good news, isn't it? Sounds like he's forgiven you for being, well, <i>you.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck is that supposed to mean?\" Keith snarls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. You tell me why he's so spastically opposed to your existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Keith's hands explode into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it must just be <i>you.</i> Anyway, when did this happen? His coming into the donut shop and offering to suck you off, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just piss off, man!\" Keith turns and sprints off around the front of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, look at that fucker fly,\" Caleb sneers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your problem today?\" you demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't got a problem, Will.\" Caleb's tone is serene. \"I'm just feeling, I dunno. Contented with the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're pissing everyone else off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen: \"Porn.\" You say that one word and stop in your tracks. \"It's the porn, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb arches his eyebrows. \"If you're asking if I'm well-satisfied with what I watched the other night\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's on account of the porn you gave to Walberg for the time capsule. Isn't it? You smug son of a bitch.\" You feel the blood rushing up and over your scalp as Caleb's shit-eating grin just widens. \"You've got a chubby for yourself because you think you're so goddamned clever! Because fucking Walberg let you put <i>porn</i> in the time capsule, and he's going to let you write a <i>god-damn fucking term paper about it!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb clasps his hands behind his back and rocks back and forth on his heels, thrusting his pelvis in and out. It looks like he's air-fucking the administration building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou and Caleb both have Mr. Walberg for first-period Sociology, but you refuse to talk to your friend in it. He doesn't seem offended at your cold-shouldering him, though, and he takes it with good grace when in English you tell him you'll be eating lunch with Keith instead of him. \"I'll just hang out with Carson and them,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd how do you know that Keith won't be eating with you and Caleb, as the three of you usually do? Because in second-period word Keith said you'd have to make a choice because \"no fucking way\" was he going to \"break bread with that cocksucker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure, Caleb's being a dick today,\" you tell Keith when you settle down with him in your usual spot behind the school at lunchtime. \"But it'll wear off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's usually that way, Will,\" Keith says. \"More and more. He thinks he's better than us. Where is he now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating with Carson and James, I think he told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, you see? Those two\u2014\" Keith muffles his dark mutter by shoving a thick sandwich into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with Carson and James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuthingk,\" Keith says. \"Sept'ay ack tall\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swallow that shit, then talk. What is that, anyway?\" you ask, for Keith's sandwich looks a lot more appetizing than yours. He doesn't answer, though, and just keeps chewing. \"Anyway, Caleb's just fucking pleased as piss with himself. You heard about our time capsule project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith rolls his eyes and shoves his sandwich back into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you <i>trying</i> to eat that thing in one mouthful? Christ, come up for air. But you know we had to bring something in for that dumb time capsule in Walberg's class. And Caleb brought in a thumb drive full of porn. He was so fucking smarmy about it, like he thought he was getting away with putting in a Kleenex of his own cum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause. Now that you think about it, <i>that</i> should have been what you put in. You bet you could have gotten away with it, too. <i>It's a DNA sample, Mr. Walberg, so scientists in the future will be able to clone me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it would have been better than what you <i>did</i> contribute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddhid you put in?\" Keith asks, and smacks the bread that's still caught in his teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind. But Caleb put in porn, and then shat himself when Walberg said we had to write a paper on what we put in. Wanted to dig up the capsule and replace his\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this story come with a T-L-D-R?\" Keith picks at his teeth with a fingernail. \"It needs one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. \"Fine. T-L-D-R, Walberg let him get away with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pft. Yeah, well, that doesn't make it right what Caleb was saying to me this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSo your two best friends still aren't talking to each other when school ends, which leaves you with a choice as to which friend to experiment on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf either. Because maybe you can find a stoner after school. They probably wouldn't notice if something funky happened during the experiment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's no point in finding a victim\u2014er, a <i>test subject</i>\u2014until the school has cleared out a little, so you camp out in the library with some homework. There's lots of students in there, too, and you watch from under your brows as they wander in and out of the stacks. A lot of them look familiar, and you know a few of them, like Howie Baylor, by name. But there's plenty of others who you don't know, and who by their looks will be sophomores or freshmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, one of those would make a good victim. Someone <i>small</i> who can't fight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept that the library is a place you like to camp out, which makes it exactly the kind of place you're likely to run into your victim\u2014 er, <i>test subject</i> again. Particularly if they're in the library when you pick them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you pack up your stuff and head out into the school proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThere's still lots of foot traffic, and as you lope through the halls you peer inside the classrooms. Almost all of them have a teacher inside\u2014like a queen bee in a private chamber inside the gigantic hive that is Westside High School\u2014and a few still have students. But in most of them it looks like group work going on\u2014after-school club meetings and such like that\u2014so you continue on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go out the back of the school to eye the athletic fields. The tennis players are practicing inside their cage next to the gym; the track people are out jogging; and the girls' softball team is on the baseball diamond. The two big athletic fields are crawling with football and lacrosse players, looking like giant, colorful, hunchbacked beetles. No solitary victims to be had there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou circle the gym and come back in through the breezeway that separates the gym from the theater. On a hunch you look inside the latter. Laughter breaks out as soon as you put your head through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you're offended. Then you realize the laughter isn't directed at you. It's coming from the risers along the left-hand wall, far down toward the end. There's a cluster of a dozen kids down there\u2014a mix of guys and girls. As you watch, one of them stands up and calls down to the stage, which is dimly lit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, love,\" he drawls, and now recognize him as the very gay (and very out) Charles Hartlein. \"Think you could do something about the sofa so James doesn't trip over it when he makes his entrance?\" He sits down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later a blonde guy come out on stage. His handsome face is a stony, expressionless mask as he pushes a sofa around. \"Back!\" Charles calls. \"Back! More! To the right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about James comes down and tries it,\" the blonde guy yells back. Someone calls from backstage, and he glances over his shoulder. But what that person says and what Charles says is lost in the crosstalk, and you don't stick around to see what comes of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you return to the main school building, where you glance inside the cafeteria long to see that there's no one in there but cleaning staff. You're about to return to the library but make a U-turn instead and duck into the Tutorial offices. Half of them are closed; two of the open offices have a tutor inside; but inside the last is a girl sitting at a desk and writing in a notebook. There is no sign of\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at the name plate on the door as you knock, and the girl looks up. She's quite cute. \"Is, uh, Ms. Johnson here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looks at you like you're an idiot. \"No. Do you see her in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, is she around?\" The girl just shrugs and bends back over her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you're tempted to grab her, out of spite and because she's available. But your position seems too exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass the library again, and turn into A wing when you hear voices. They're coming from Ms. Heaney's classroom, and you spot a trio of girls\u2014but no teacher\u2014when you look inside. They have their cell phones out, and are giggling and gossiping. You catch a few references to Nirdlingers (the department store) and Starbucks, and it occurs to you that you might find some vic\u2014 Some <i>test subjects</i> in town: alone in a coffee shop booth or in a changing room at a clothing store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you're clomping through the halls to your locker, head down, wondering how the hell you're going to get someone alone, when you stop dead with an epiphany. Slowly you take half a dozen steps back until you're looking inside the open door of a classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Mrs. Hoagland's room. She's working at her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's, like, a hundred classrooms in the school, most of them with a single teacher at work inside. You'd like to try the mask out on someone who doesn't know you, and who certainly couldn't get you in trouble. That ought to rule out using a teacher as a test subject. But the teachers seem like your best chance of getting someone alone. </span></div></div>",

You're going to have to put it onto someone's face\u2014that much is obvious\u2014but how are you going to talk someone into doing that? And if you can't talk them into doing it, how are you going to force it onto them? By mugging them with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you need to get someone alone, which is a pretty good reason not to go looking in the theater or the library; and though that girl in the tutor's office was by herself, she was obviously waiting for the tutor to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, as dangerous as it seems, your safest option is to try the experiment on a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one of the teachers you currently have. You don't want your fingerprints on whatever happens. For the same reason you shouldn't try it on a teacher you had last year, or the year before. Maybe one of your freshman teachers wouldn't remember you, but that still seems to risky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, you probably shouldn't try it on a teacher whose room is in a wing where you currently have a class, for they might remember you if they see you struggling through the hallways between classes. So that rules out an English teacher or a math teacher or a science teacher\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits you. You know <i>exactly</i> where to find a teacher who doesn't know you and will probably never see you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou flinch at the sounds: the slap of shoes on the hardwood floors; the bang of a ball hitting the basket's backboard; the hoarse, shouted curses, echoing off the bleachers and rafters. The horror of your freshman and sophomore P.E. classes comes washing back over you even before you step from the gym foyer onto the court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's afterschool practice, but they're playing a full-on game, five against five. A full contact game, too. As you watch, Gordon Black, the hulking team captain, wheels with the ball and knocks Jonas Martin clean off his feet and out of bounds. But Black doesn't pause, and drives down the court toward the basket on your end of the gym. Three opposing players rendezvous to block him, but he explodes past them, like a semi blowing through a roadblock of police cruisers, and hoists the ball through the basket. Jeremy Richards\u2014who used to be your friend back in middle school, before a growth spurt went to his head\u2014retrieves the ball, and the players race back down to the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch for another minute, then let your eye drift up to the bleachers opposite you. There's maybe two dozen students sitting there. Most of them are occupied with their cell phones, but they lift their eyes occasionally to watch the practice. There are more guys than girls, but the spectators that count (assuredly!) are the three cheerleaders sitting halfway up the bleachers at the half-court line: Chelsea Cooper, Kendra Saunders, and Gloria Rea. Chelsea is at the very center, naturally, for she's not only the squad captain, she's also dating Gordon Black, and that, you suppose, makes her the queen of the school. She's snooty enough to be royalty, anyway. The only times she's ever looked at you is to sneer, and it's a tired sneer, too, as though she resents even the effort to put you in your place with a look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit!</i> You've been staring at her and her friends too long, and they've noticed. To your horror, Kendra, her eyes still locked on you, leans over to whisper to Chelsea, and she looks up from her phone stare at you. You lower your eyes and fight the mortifying blush you feel stealing up your neck and face. You hope she doesn't decide to do anything about this social faux pas. There are plenty of stories of her siccing her brutal boyfriend on people who have offended her; and Gordon Black\u2014all six and a half feet of him\u2014is the jealous type anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your head ducked, you hurry to where you were going: the offices of the P.E. coaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're on this side of the court, inside the wide mezzanine that separates the gym's two full-sized basketball courts. You pass through a doorway and hook a right. Before you stretches a narrow hall, with office doors, like the entrances to rabbit holes, on either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few doors are closed: Coach Tesla, Coach Stokes, Coach Porter. Coach Acuna's door is ajar, but when you knock softly and push it open you find it empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the next door down is wide open. \"Coach Schell,\" says the name plate on the door, but you concentrate on the woman behind the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd well might you concentrate on her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf the PE coaches are men: grizzled and hairy when they aren't grizzled and balding. The female coaches, in general, aren't much better. Coach Tesla, for instance, looks like an old bag lady, and has the face and voice of a bullfrog. Coach Carter was probably once a real looker, but twenty years of hard sunlight have turned her skin to stiff leather. But Coach Schell ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she immediately reminds you of Chelsea Cooper. She could be Chelsea's older sister. Or an older cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's in her twenties, you'd bet, and her oval face is framed by dirty blonde hair that falls to her elbows. Her eyes are dark green, and her unblemished skin glows a light gold. She's wearing a tight blue t-shirt under a jeans jacket\u2014a large, neon-pink backpack rests on her desk, so it looks like she's getting ready to leave\u2014and her large breasts strain against the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must be a new hire. You surely would have noticed her your freshman or sophomore years, when you had to troop out to the gym for P.E. classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up before you can knock and the door, and if she's caught you gaping at her, she pretends not to notice. \"Yeah?\" she says, and her eyebrows go up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh ... Uh ... Hi,\" you squeak. All the bearings in your brain seize up. Now that the moment has come, you realize that you have absolutely no idea what to do or say. Your face starts to burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, found this thing,\" you stammer as you swing your backpack around and set it on the desk. The coach's eyebrows rise further; she probably thinks you're about to have a stroke or something. \"Uh, I found it out ... Uh ... There.\" You wave your hand in the general direction of New Jersey. \"And I thought maybe someone should, uh, look at it? Say what it is? Maybe you know whose it is?\" With fumbling fingers you get your pack open and yank the mask out. Your bag falls off the desk, dumping books and papers all over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a lost and found,\" she says. But you ignore her, and drop the mask onto the desk and dive to retrieve your stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do you?\" you gasp as you scoop your shit together. Your heart hammers at your breastbone. \"I guess I could drop it there. But I thought maybe you, uh, might know whose it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dammit, dammit, dammit,</i> you think to yourself as you work. How the fuck are you going to talk her into putting the mask to her face when you can't even get your tongue to work right? As for jumping at her and putting it on her yourself, even to you that would feel like one step short of rape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pull stuff together, you're aware that she's fallen silent, and you sit up and peek over the top of the desk, to find her holding the mask and examining it curiously. \"It's, uh, like a Halloween mask,\" you croak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a look. \"No eye holes,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure there are,\" you blurt out. \"It's transparent. Behind the eyes. You have get it up real close to your face,\" you add as she cocks a skeptical eyebrow at you. \"Seriously, I freaked out when I noticed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brow furrows and her lips twist into a skeptical smile. But she raises the mask up and peers into it. \"It doesn't look translucent,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to get it close.\" Sweat pops out all over your body, and you rise into a crouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls it closer to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a hanging moment you do nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you reach up and shove the mask at her. It and your hand meet her face with a hard blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mask vanishes, and you stifle a yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt went into her. By God, it went into her! There's no other way to describe what happened. You pushed the mask onto her face and it ... sank through the skin and bone and went right inside her. Like pushing a grape into a bowl of Jell-O.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept it didn't leave a hole or indentation behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her eyes crossed and she face-planted right onto the desk. After staring at her in mute horror for a solid minute, you finally had the presence of mind to slam the office door shut and lock it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now pacing the narrow space in front of her desk. <i>Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck!</i> What to do? Panic? You're already doing that. Call for help? Get the school nurse? And tell them what, that you punched her in the face with a magical mask? That you were passing on by and you found her like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is still alive, at least. You checked her for breathing and a pulse, and she's still got those. Her eyes are open, but unseeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you run away? No one saw you come in. If you could get away without being seen, then someone would find Coach Schell and take her to the hospital and no one would know you had anything to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept you and your conscience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did you fuck up? Maybe you weren't supposed to put the mask onto her face. But what else were you supposed to do with it? Why couldn't that dumb book have clearer instructions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe\u2014and this really feels like you're grasping at straws\u2014it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do, and if you stick around you'll see it all turn out okay.</span></div></div>",

As you watch, its glow dims and fades away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your heart in your throat you gingerly pull it out. You check long enough to see that she's still breathing\u2014and she is\u2014then force the mask back into your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not going to waste time counting to ten again, and flee the office, lingering just long enough to make sure that the door latches securely behind you. On trembling legs you trot down the hall, then sprint out of the gym. No one stops you, and if anyone sees you, you don't see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's a few hours before you're able to find out what you've made and done. As soon as you get home your mom sends you out to pick up some groceries; then on your return you are dragooned into helping to prepare dinner and to set the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your dad then corners you with an ultimatum: Are you going to apply for that job at Salopek?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd dearly love to say \"no.\" Aside from wanting to maximize your free time, it sounds pretty awful. Salopek is an engineering company\u2014aerospace of some kind, but you pay as little attention to your dad's work as you think you can get away with\u2014but you're not qualified to do any real work there. From what your dad has said, it sounds like it would be a lot of grunt work: delivering mail, sorting packages, maybe cleaning up some of the engineering bays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that mask you made consumed almost all of the cash you had on hand. If you have to buy any more stuff, where are you going to get the money? Your dad is unlikely to give or lend you any right after you tell him you're not going to take that job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you tomorrow?\" you ask. \"I want to talk to Caleb first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Caleb got to do with it?\" he asks. His eyes narrow. \"Something to do with that chemistry experiment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" <i>Damn. He remembers that stink you made up in your room when you made the mask. But of course. He remembers every stupid thing you've ever done.</i> \"He was just talking about maybe he wanted it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he need the money more than you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, even though you know that Caleb\u2014who lives with his single, working mother\u2014could use the income more than you. \"Let me just talk to him. We'll flip a coin or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince after the words are out, for it sounds like you've just said you'll take the job if Caleb won't. But your dad only grunts and orders you to wash up for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it's not until after eating and helping to clear the table that you finally get to the mask and the grimoire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're astonished\u2014and more than a little disconcerted\u2014to see that there's been a change to the book since you last looked in it. An light oval patch, almost like a stain, has appeared on the page with the spell on it, and at first you wonder if you'd carelessly set a plate or a glass on it at some point. But then you recognize that it's about the same size and shape as the mask. With a prickling anticipation, you lay the mask on the page. When you lift it, the page comes away with it, and turns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take out your cell phone, and sentence by sentence, and word by word, you translate the passage of Latin on the other side. It's a set of instructions for finishing the mask, and after you've set down a crude translation\u2014and fiddled with the precise wording\u2014you settle back to see what you've made, and what you can do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt confirms that the mask has now \"absorbed the form\" of the person you set it on, but it still doesn't say if it's only the face or the entire body. But it now adds that the mask has to be \"sealed\" before it can be used. If you don't seal it, but lay it against another face, it will absorb that form as well, and merge it with the first form to create a new one. The additional abbreviation \"Etc.\" suggests to you that this process can continue indefinitely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how do you \"seal a mask\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to the next page\u2014it looks like a new spell. It begins, as the first spell did, with what looks like a set of ingredients, followed by instructions and a sigil. Some translation work shows that you have on hand all the ingredients already\u2014it's much the same stuff that went into making the mask\u2014and that it has to be burned as the other stuff did. Your heart sinks as you imagine the stink it'll make. You decide to put off making it until tomorrow, after school, when your dad won't be home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try turning the page, though without much hope. And yes, it's stuck firmly against the pages that follow, just as the previous pages had been. It looks like you'll have to perform this spell before you can unlock. That's another reason to get it done tomorrow afternoon: so you can see if the spell that follows will require lots of new ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving exhausted the book, you pick up the mask to see what, if any changes, have come over it since your adventure this afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first glance, it looks the same. It's still the color of a cloudless summer sky. It still has highlights playing over its surface. But now those glinting highlights don't shift as you turn the mask this way and that, and as you study them they seem to form a pattern. They gleam just under the surface, and follow the curve, so that it looks like there's another face inside the mask, whose chin and cheeks and nose and lips fit against those of the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't recognize it, so you can't be sure, but it looks a little like ... Coach Schell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book says it would copy her form. Does that mean that this is her face inside it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div>\u2028\"Suppose I got you that job at my dad's work,\" you say to Caleb the next morning as you're hanging out before classes start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, are you the hiring manager out there?\" he retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me finish! Suppose I got you that job. You know, if I told my dad you'd be perfect for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you said you were going to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did I\u2014? Shut up!\" You glare him. \"If I got you that job, would you lend me some money? Give me, like, your first paycheck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyebrows arch. \"This sounds suspiciously like you're angling for a kickback.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only asking for a loan! I need some money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb rocks backward on his heels. \"Look at it from my point of view, Will,\" he says. \"If I was a bank\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a bank, man. You're supposed to be my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the principle I'm talking about. Oh, but hey, speaking of principal,\" he says, \"if I lent you this money, would you pay interest on it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even got any interest in talking about this anymore, cocksucker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Then you don't get a loan. I've got a use for that money.\" He rubs his hands. \"If and when I can get my hands on some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peers down his nose at you. \"Loan me a hundred and I'll tell you my business plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flip him off, and that's all that gets said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou race home from school and hurl yourself into your bedroom before your mom can catch you. Rapidly\u2014for you'd gotten up early to set out the ingredients for the spell\u2014you assemble a little work area in front of the open window. For good measure, you fetch an oscillating fan from the hall closet to blow the stench outside. You mix the ingredients together in a bowl, set them on the sigil, and stick a lighter into it. It bursts into a low flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no ghastly stink comes rolling out as before. Maybe you did something wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flames dance and lick  up all the ingredients. When they snuff themselves out, a thick slurry is left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you pick up the bowl, the fan blows the page up and flips it over. You set the bowl aside and snatch up your cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, after translating two pages and doing a little online research, you have discovered two things. First, that you have now made that sealant, and if you apply it to the mask you will be able to put it on and transform yourself into \"the exact image\" of the person it copied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond\u2014and this preys more on your mind, for your dad will be home in a little while\u2014you're going need at least fifty dollars to buy stuff for the next spell.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>According to the instructions, the stuff you made has to be applied to the inner surface of the mask\u2014brushed on, like paint. You're in the garage, searching for a brush, when the door goes up and your dad slides the family SUV in. By the expression on his face, you can tell he wants to talk to you, and you can bet what it's about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talked to Caleb,\" you blurt out before he can say anything. \"He's got something else lined up, so he's not going to apply for that job at your work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn. Time to improvise.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also talked to Keith,\" you say. \"He said that it looks like there's going to be an opening at the donut shop where he works. I think I'd rather work there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad stares. \"A donut shop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's something, right?\" You flush. \"Anyway, the way you talked about it, the job out at your work is\u2014\" You veer away from the phrase <i>a lot of scut work</i> as your dad's lower lip turns down. \"Like, mail delivery and stuff, right? Manual work? And I know Keith, I'd be working with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad snorts. \"Salopek would look better on a resume.\" He turns away with a frown, then turns back and takes out his wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need a haircut if you're going to work in the service industry,\" he says as he takes out a bill. \"Get yourself one.\" He hands you a twenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sweet!</i> That's twenty dollars toward your next purchase!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, on the way back up to your bedroom with a small paint brush, it occurs to you that your dad will want to see results from that twenty dollar investment. Which means you <i>will</i> have to use it on a haircut, not on magical supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're called into the kitchen to help with dinner before you can get any work any more on the mask, and after eating you decide to be a good boy and get your homework done. Besides, you suspect that you won't be able to do anything\u2014not anything really fun\u2014with the mask until after everyone has gone to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you struggle through your Calculus homework and push deeper into the selections from <i>The Iliad</i> for English. For Career Planning you go online to visit a couple of corporate websites as part of an assignment, then get distracted by YouTube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your eye never wanders far from the mask resting atop a pile of books at the corner of the table, or from the bowl of sealant atop your dresser. What will happen when you seal the mask? Probably nothing. What will happen when you put it on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've dodged experimenting on yourself thus far, and briefly you consider ambushing your brother with it and forcing it onto him. But there are too many risks there. Seriously: The only thing worse than if it fucked him up in some magical way would be if it worked perfectly, for then you'd have to explain to him\u2014wouldn't you?\u2014how you managed to turn him into a twenty-something female P.E. coach. Or, at least, gave him the face of one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo your pulse races while you do your homework\u2014which itself might be a first\u2014as you try not to think about the experiment to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, at around ten, when you've finished all your homework and exhausted the possibilities for goofing off online, you pull the mask and the sealant toward you. The latter is a thin paste, and it goes on quickly and smoothly when you apply it to the interior of the mask. It clears as it dries, so that the luster of the mask is undiminished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hide it in your sock drawer and search for other ways of wasting time. You make a couple of trips downstairs, ostensibly to check the refrigerator, but really to keep an eye on whether your parents seem headed for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even after the downstairs lights are off, you hold back, for Robert's light remains on under his door. You wait quietly in your own room for almost half an hour before you hear him in the hall bathroom, brushing his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot until well after eleven do you make your own trip to the bathroom, to brush your teeth and clean your pores. Even then, to your mounting irritation, you see that Robert's lights are still on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it's not until midnight, when you make another quiet trip to the bathroom, with the pretended intention of getting some Kleenex to blow your nose, that you're satisfied that the house is entirely quiet. But maybe not asleep? You watch some videos on your cell phone until an alert tells you that it's twelve-thirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you get up and retrieve the mask from your sock drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou haven't given any thought, up till now, about where you would test the mask out. Here in your bedroom? In the closet? Locked in the bathroom? Now that the point has come, you decide that under the covers is the place to try it. There's a locked door between you and the rest of the house, and it's dark. But even though blankets and sheets are little added protection, you'd be glad of an additional veil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb back into bed with the mask and nestle under the covers. At the last moment, you twitch your boxers off, in case they interfere with the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this very late moment it occurs to you: If this is a full-body transformation, you're going to lose that very important organ you keep in your boxers. For a moment you hesitate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, fuck it.</i> You pull the sheets up over your head and bring the mask up to your face. You're already stifling under the covers, and when you slide the mask onto your face it's too much. You suck hard at the mask\u2014 trying to pull oxygen into lungs that are suddenly starved for air\u2014and reach for the mask. But your arm is paralyzed, and so is your chest. You feel your eyes bugging from their sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great weight seems to drag you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you seem to bob to the surface again. You suck in a hard breath and bat the sheets away. You sit up, your heart hammering in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the room is unchanged from a moment ago. A distant streetlight casts its milky glow through the curtains on your window, and your desk and books are a humped shadow in the corner. You kick at the sheets and blankets and try to get your bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mask. You put it on, and you almost suffocated. Where is it? Did it slip off? You glance around, blinking into the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lank limb, like a hairy tentacle, falls across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shriek and bat at it, and bounce off the bed. Things like fingers, but soft and limp, grope weakly at your shoulders. You tumble to the floor and scramble across the floor, trying not to scream, and bang your head against the corner of your dresser. Stunned, you fall to one side and catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long you lay like this, you're not sure. But at some point it penetrates your addled brain that there's something heavy resting on your chest\u2014a weight that is trying to slide off. It's when you look down, and notice that your breasts have swelled up into great, fleshy balloons, that it finally sinks in what has happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body has changed. You've acquired a bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when you reach up to your head, you find that those tendrils\u2014those hairy tentacles\u2014are locks of thick, bouncy hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My God! Breasts? Long hair?</i> You put on a mask that copied Coach Schell and now you've got\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scramble back into bed and feel about the sheet. The mask is gone\u2014you must be wearing it, somehow\u2014but you find your cell phone. With trembling fingers you turn the camera on yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven by the dim light of your twilit bedroom, you recognize Coach Schell's face on the screen. Her eyes are wide\u2014but so are yours\u2014and she breathes raggedly through a mouth that hangs open\u2014but so do you\u2014and her hair drapes in her face, as it does in yours. You push your hair back, and so does she. You swallow again and compose your features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have her face. And you have her hair and bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even before you check, you are certain that you have her\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shift the camera to your left hand, and slowly put your right hand under the covers. You grit your teeth as you explore, down the side of  your stomach to the place where your legs meet your hips. There's a patch of hair there, which is to be expected, but it feels shorter and curlier. You wince as you probe further down and in and\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's nothing there. No shaft, no member. A cold sweat breaks out all over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you probe and push you find something else. A slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, Jesus!</i> The phone slips from your hand. You're Coach Schell <i>all the way down and inside and out!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub the spot, but it is cold and unyielding. Aren't those tissues supposed to be soft and tender, aren't they supposed to burst into life when they're touched?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it only works that way when their owner isn't freaking out. And you are most definitely freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nFor a very long time you lay in your bed, gently touching and stroking yourself here and there. Mostly you hope to stimulate yourself into something pleasurable. But part of you, you can feel, resists. Maybe it's because you're in your own bed, and are terrified of being discovered. Maybe you're just mortified by what you're doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after half an hour or so, you decide that you've learned enough of what the mask can do, and that it's best to beat a retreat. You put on the desk lamp and\u2014while trying not to look down at yourself\u2014you retrieve the grimoire. There's an incantation that you have to recite to get the mask off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when it comes off again, you know nothing more until morning.</span></div></div>",

Something tumbles from the bed to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night's adventures come rushing back, and you fall to the floor to grab the mask back up. It looks undamaged, and you hastily shove it into the bottom drawer of your dresser. \"I'm coming!\" you shout, even though your mother has ceased battering at your door, and you hop from foot to foot as you slide into your boxers again. <i>It's good to have a cock again,</i> you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you add, <i>But I still want some breasts to play with.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that'll be for tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou take one of the fastest showers ever and race to school with a Pop-Tart between your teeth and your hair still sopping with water.

Geoff Mansfield smirks at you and Kelsey Blankenship rolls her eyes. <i>Cocksucker,</i> you mutter under your breath. <i>Sloppy bint.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb also smirks as you fall into your desk. \"What, did you take your shower in a car wash this morning?\" he chortles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, I woke up late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I woke up late too, but you don't see <i>me</i> looking I have to squeeze Lake Superior out of my hair.

You've got a magic mask at home\u2014one that turns its wearer into a copy of Coach Schell\u2014to prove it. There are lots more spells in the book\u2014you're only two spells in\u2014but you can't get to them except by executing them. And that takes money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably you could still get that job at your dad's work, but you've already made yourself look foolish over it. Neither Caleb nor your dad will give you a loan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou haven't asked your other good friend, Keith, if he can lend you anything, and you rectify that oversight at lunch. He just snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need money for?\" Caleb asks. It's just you and him and Keith, together as you usually are, in back of the school. \"You asked me yesterday for a loan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You change your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I haven't changed my mind about telling you,\" you retort. \"It's just a project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have projects,\" Caleb says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith raises his hand. \"I got projects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike and Carlos have projects,\" Caleb corrects him. \"You just hang off  their shirt tails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith turns red. \"I am too part of their channel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis catches your attention. \"What channel? What are you talking about? Mike and Carlos who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith's flush deepens from cherry to plum. \"Fuck you,\" he snarls, and snatches up his lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" you ask as he stalks away, but he just flips you the bird over his shoulder. You turn to Caleb. \"The fuck is his problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His problem is you don't pay any attention. He was talking about his movie review channel he's got up on YouTube. Well, it's not <i>his,</i> it's Mike and Carlos's, as I was reminding him\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know about this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were there when he told us about it, Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Sometime within the last eighteen years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. \"Well, he shouldn't take it out on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go tell him that.\" Caleb stretches out on his side, and pops the last of his sandwich into his mouth. \"Then hit him up again for a loan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's your last chance, Will. Though if you tell me what this project is, <i>maybe</i> I'll lend you something out of my savings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept Tilley isn't your last chance. There are two more guys you know that you could ask, and after telling Caleb you'll be right back, you dash around to the front of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's how it happens that you spot Coach Schell at her car, in the teacher's parking lot. For a moment you gape. Then you whip around so she won't see your face. Your heart thumps hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you do peep over your shoulder at her. She's tugging a large cardboard box out of the back seat, and it looks like she's having some trouble with it. But she finally hefts it into her arms, bumps the car door shut with her butt, and goes striding off toward the gym. You note the vehicle she's driving: a green Honda minivan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy do you take special note? You're not sure. You just do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you're distracted again when you talk to Carson Ioeger and James Lamont about borrowing some money off them. You don't even plead when they refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou pass the rest of the school day in a thoughtful mood. You need money to continue your research, but you've no prospects of getting any. But it occurs to you during math class that that's not quite true. <i>Will Prescott</i> has no prospects of getting any. Could <i>Coach Schell</i> get any?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, but how? During the thirty minutes or so that you amused yourself inside her mask, you never learned anything about her, except for the shape of her body. Maybe you had her boobs, but you certainly didn't have her brain. You got no impressions about where she lived or who she knew, or even what her first name is. To get any money off her, you'd need more than her .. Well, more than her face. You'd need her keys or billfold, or at least access to them. (But if you had access to them, would you even need her face?) The best you could do is like you tried doing with your friends: Use her face to beg money off the other teachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's not like you could even do that. You don't have any clothes to go with Coach Schell's face, so unless you want to walk around the school naked while panhandling for spare change, you can't even use that mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you're intrigued enough by the idea that during your study hall you log into the school's website to check out her teaching schedule. \"Cathy Schell\" is her name, it turns out, and aside from third-period lunch and a free seventh period, she teaches P. E. classes all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could get some clothes\u2014from your mom's closet, maybe?\u2014then after school, when she's left for the day\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you know what she drives now, so you'd only have to check the teachers' lot for her car to know if she was still on campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014you could wander the school, cadging money off the other teachers, the way you tried cadging some off your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouldn't you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept it still seems awfully risky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you get home, it feels like you've war-gamed out all the possible scenarios without reaching any decisions. You're antsy and still in need of something to do. For a lack of anything better, you break out the mask ingredients and use them all up. The process creates a terrible stink, which you blow out of your window, but also three more blank masks. You make a face as you contemplate the job it will be polishing them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for what? You already have a mask on hand, one that's polished and that's got a face inside it. What would additional masks accomplish? Except ... You could use them to copy and impersonate someone else? An impersonation that would stand you a better chance of getting some money?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heft one of the blanks thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with a sigh you drop it on your bed. Caleb has said he'll loan you some money if you tell him what this \"project\" of yours is. You bet he'd be really eager to lend you the money if you showed him the masks and the grimoire. </span></div></div>",

So after dinner, while helping your mother clean up the kitchen, you broach the subject: \"Mom, do you have any old gym clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks back at you in surprise. \"Somewhere,\" she says after a moment's thought. \"Maybe. You mean like gym shorts or sweat pants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for P. E.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. I haven't worn them in forever. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a girl at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyebrows go up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you continue, warming to the improvisation. \"She needs some gym clothes, and I thought maybe I could help her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no mistaking the light of pitying amusement that shows in her eyes. \"Can't she buy her own? Or if you want to help her out, you should just lend her some money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't got any to lend. And she just needs them temporarily. Or maybe not. I'm not sure.\" Mention of money has given you another idea. \"She just needs some, and I want to help her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think giving her <i>my</i> old gym clothes is the way to do it,\" your mom says, and she seems to be picking her words very carefully. \"She can't buy her own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Money's really tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could go to Goodwill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't that cost money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother cocks her head and regards you gravely. \"I can lend you the money,\" she says gravely, \"and you can lend it to her. Lend it,\" she emphasizes. \"Not <i>give.</i> Even if you don't want to ask her to pay it back, call it a loan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'd lend me the money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs. \"Yes. Let me just finish up in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to tell Dad, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returns you a tight smile. \"I don't think he'd care, but I won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd later that night she gives you three twenties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAfter your mother's loan of money, you rethink your tactics. She doesn't expect you to ask that mythical girl for her money back; so you're pretty sure she's not going to ask <i>you</i> for it back. Or, if she does, she'll wait until after your birthday or Christmas, when you'll get some cash. You don't often ask her for money, and now you wonder why don't try it more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, between the sixty she gave you and the twenty your dad gave you, you've got enough to buy those supplies for the next spell. So that's what you do the next day after school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your relief, the new spell doesn't ask for anything to be set on fire. You just have to coat the metal strips you bought at the hobby shop in some chemicals, then set them in the sigil and run your fingers three times around it. A sheen of light seems to run all over them. Then, with some jeweler's tools, you begin to carve a set of runes into one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes longer than you would like, for you have to cut and scratch deeply into the resistant material. After an hour, you lay the strip aside to do homework before returning to the task. It's nearing on one o'clock in the morning before you sit up and stretch, pop the crick from your neck, and examine the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that there's much to see. The grayish metal gleams brightly\u2014more brightly than before you took it from its package\u2014and the runes, which look like hen scratches, have a bluish tinge to them. On consulting the directions you find that there's nothing else to do, so you lay the completed strip onto the grimoire, count to three, then pull at the corner of the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side is a single line of Latin. <i>Know the mind of another,</i> it translates as. You blink at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you go into the bathroom, where you brush your teeth and prepare for bed. Once between the sheets, you stare up at the dark ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt makes sense. That would be the next step in making a disguise. Copy the body; copy the mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the big worry in the back of your mind about using the mask of Coach Schell. You know nothing about her. Sure, you could use a mask to look like her, and with some money you could even dress up convincingly as her. But you didn't know anything about her, so you wouldn't be able to act like her, and that would make it very tricky to use the disguise to any advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if this metal strip copies her brain the way the mask copies her body\u2014and that seems like the only way to understand that very simple sentence\u2014then you would be able to rectify that omission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are no instructions on how to use the band, but the answer seems obvious enough: Get it onto her the way you got the mask onto her. Through the face\u2014probably the forehead\u2014again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat could be tricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd would you be able to use that metal band and the mask at the same time, to make a perfect disguise? Or could you use only one at a time? Maybe the next spell\u2014which you haven't looked at\u2014will answer the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on the light and get out the grimoire. As you'd expected, the next spell gives no hint of what it will do, but it only uses ingredients you already have on hand, so you'll be able to execute it tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back to bed, and fall asleep to wondering fantasies about what it would be like to be someone else on the inside and the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Do any of you know Coach Schell?\" you ask at lunch the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Coach Schell?\" asks James Lamont, for you talked Caleb and Keith into eating out front with him and his friends, just so you could ask this question. \"What does he teach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She,\" says Yumi Saito, who has decided to join the group today. \"And she's a coach, so she teaches P. E. Dur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P. E.,\" says Carson Ioeger with a snort. \"I was done with P. E. in middle school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you manage that?\" you ask in surprise. \"It's a freshman requirement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I took the requirement, Prescott,\" he honks back at you. \"But I was <i>done</i> with it long before then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you asking about Coach Schell?\" Jenny Ashton says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just curious. I don't remember seeing her around when we were freshmen. Is she new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she got hired a year or two back,\" Yumi says. \"But yeah, she's pretty new.\" She makes a face as she sucks down some more yogurt. \"Still got ideals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asks Paul, but at the same time you say, \"She teaches volleyball, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coaches it,\" says Yumi. \"Yeah. I wish she had charge of the cheerleading squad. <i>She'd</i> put a stop to Chelsea's shit, I'm sure.\" Yumi is a cheerleader, and the many crimes of Chelsea Cooper, squad captain, are a constant topic of conversation with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the fascination?\" Carson asks you. He grins. \"Is she cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you blurt out before you can stop yourself. Snickers run around the circle, and you turn red. \"So I noticed one of the gym teachers is hot!\" you exclaim. \"So what? I hear you get a chubby in Gelding's class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were hoping to get a rise from Carson, you're disappointed. He smiles very serenely and replies, \"Sure I do. Chemistry's a sexy subject.\" Well, science nerd that he is, he <i>would</i> think that. Seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith jumps in at that point to start talking about the teachers that he thinks are hot, and the conversation wanders further off-point from there. But as you're cleaning up and getting ready to go inside, you ask Yumi, in a low voice, what all she knows about Coach Schell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing really,\" she says. \"I've heard good things about her. Kristina Townes has her next period. This period,\" she corrects herself as the bell for sixth period sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou brought that metal band with you to school, but you hold off on doing anything with it and instead race straight home after school. You assemble the ingredients for the next spell and, holding your breath against a possible stink, which fortuitously doesn't come, set it afire in a bowl over the sigil. The result is another thin fluid that\u2014so says the reverse of the page after you've turned it\u2014can be used to glue a metal band into the inner surface of a mask. It says nothing about whether either of them have to blank, or whether they have to be from the same person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back and ponder it a bit. So, you would be able to put a brain and a body together. It sounds like they wouldn't even have to be the brain and body of the same person, though what advantage there would be in mixing and matching you're not sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou study the blank band you've completed, and the mask of Coach Schell. Yes, now you could make a complete disguise of her. If you could get close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's still the trick, isn't it? Maybe it would better to lay her mask aside and make up a complete disguise of someone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you need a complete disguise in order to get further into the book? You turn to the newly unlocked spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks as you study the ingredients with a browser open to study the prices. The last spell cost you forty dollars and change. This one will probably cost hundreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there's a further wrinkle: It calls for four hundred pounds of dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hundred pounds taken from a graveyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is beginning to sound a little like necromancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond the icky fact about where it's supposed to come from, you worry about how hard it's going to be it up and lugging it around. You're built like a scarecrow, and though you suppose that with time enough and willpower you could move that much dirt, it would be easier if you had a stronger physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA physique you could get with a mask?</span></div></div>",

You look at the unpolished masks, and you think about moving four hundred pounds of graveyard earth, and your shoulders sag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, it's going to be tricky getting close to Coach Schell after you basically mugged her with the first mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expend more brainpower on that question than on your homework. But no ideas come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're still thinking about it, in a distracted way, the next morning when you walk into Mr. Walberg's class. A chill passes over you as you thread the aisle between the desks. But that's no surprise: You get the shivers anytime you're near Kelsey and Geoff and the rest of the AP crowd. Even when you were dating Lisa\u2014except she says that you were never dating in the first place\u2014you got a cold, nauseated feeling when they were around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the chill deepens when you fall into your desk next to Caleb. He gives you a wide, smug smile. But not until he speaks does the dreadful penny\u2014in this case a penny as big and as heavy as a millstone\u2014drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you ever figure out why you put a hair dryer in the time capsule?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw falls open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That paper! The paper you were supposed to write for this class, about the item you contributed to the time capsule! It's due today!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you forgot to write it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whip around to stare at the other students, all of whom have neatly typed papers sitting on their desks, ready to turn in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Walberg isn't at his desk, which gives you the narrowest chance of escape. \"I'll be back later. Maybe,\" you grab up your pack and lunge to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later?\" Caleb says. \"Where the fuck are you\u2014? Will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're already out the door and slithering through the crowded hallway. If you can get to the library, to one of the computer stations, maybe you bang out that paper before class ends. Technically, won't Mr. Walberg have to accept it if you get it to him before the end of first period?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, who are you kidding? The old walrus will ding you at least a letter grade, even if he does take it. Which he probably won't. And anyway, if you even had a good idea for that dumb paper, you'd have written before now and wouldn't be in this mess in the first place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you spot Mr. Walberg himself coming down the hallway straight at you. You twist around and start fighting your way back the way you came. With Walberg between you and the library you have to take the long way around, circling around F wing and approaching the library from the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's how come you manage to spot Coach Schell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's coming out of the tutorial offices and is dressed up very smartly in a yellow polo shirt and crimson, hip-hugging shorts that show off her powerful legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegs that you spent the other night caressing, along with lots of other parts of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what you notice now is her ball cap. It's old, worn, and more than a little ratty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike yours, in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop and blink at her retreating back as she turns and strides off toward the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you grab the sides of your head and dance in place. This idea you've suddenly had: It's so brilliant that it hurts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"What's with the new hat?\" Keith asks when you catch up to him and Caleb halfway through lunch. He points his plastic spork at your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm showing school spirit,\" you reply. You whip off the new cap\u2014the one emblazoned with a dragon's head and the letters WHS, which you bought in the office, where they have a whole room of school-themed items for purchase at outrageous markups\u2014and run your fingers through your stiff shock of hair. \"To go with the haircut I'm getting this weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea,\" Keith says. \"The haircut, I mean. I could give a shit about school spirit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you <i>couldn't</i> give a shit,\" Caleb corrects him. \"If you <i>could</i> give a shit, it would mean\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would mean that I could shit all over it,\" Keith says. \"And I could, too. Is that what you were doing second period?\" he asks you. \"Buying a hat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was writing a paper for first period,\" Caleb answers for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that work? You have a time machine? You write your papers after they're due, then go back and\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time capsule,\" you correct him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, time machine,\" Keith insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He forgot to write his paper for Mr. Walberg,\" Caleb explains. \"So he skipped first period to do that. You didn't tell me you skipped second period too,\" he adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Cos it was none of your business. Anyway, it doesn't matter,\" you grumble. \"He wouldn't accept it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, you didn't even try turning it in, because you didn't even write it, for you were so distracted by your brilliant idea. And when you spoke to Mr. Walberg at the beginning of second period, he told you not even to bother writing it for he wouldn't take it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat put you in the dumps for a little while. You distracted yourself by going to the office and, as a first step toward realizing your plan, buying this new ball cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you gonna do with your old hat?\" Keith asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" you reply, and that's the end of the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBut it's not the end of the plan. You complete the second step during your seventh-period study hall. Then you troop down to the gym with the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, you skirt one of the basketball courts to reach the coaches' offices. This period it's the girls' varsity basketball team that's practicing, and you spend a few minutes watching them. What is it about basketball, or this school, that attracts ballbreakers to that sport? The girls are almost as big and mean and strong as the boys' team, and you turn away before any of them can catch you watching. Stephanie Wyatt might even come over and punch you in the face if she caught you gawking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you'd expected, the door to Coach Schell's office is open, for this is her free period. You're shaking slightly as you approach. You wish you could have gotten someone else to do this part of the job, but you couldn't think of anyone. And besides, given what you're about to do, it would have to be you to make the approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tap at the door. \"Coach Schell?\" you say in a quavering voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up from her desk. It's almost a replay of the other day. The same tawny mane of hair that falls to her elbows. The same oval face with the large lips and the nose that is ... well, a little bolder, a little more prow-like than you remember from before. Her brow furrows, but there's no light of recognition\u2014still less of anger or horror\u2014in her eye as she looks back at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't say anything, though, so you fill the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of the guys from last year put together a little collection for you,\" you say. \"We got you this.\" You hold out the new hat you bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression freezes for a moment, before broadening back out into a patently insincere smile. \"Oh,\" she says. \"How sweet. Um, the guys?\" That furrow reappears in her brow. \"Which ... Uh ... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third period? Last year?\" <i>Please don't ask me for names.</i> \"We're really late getting it for you, but it was just an idea we suddenly had.\" You advance on her desk and hold the hat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beams as she takes it. \"Well, thank you, um ... \" She lapses into a pained silence when you don't supply your name. \"That's really nice of, uh, you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you put it on?\" you ask, and take your cell phone from your pocket. \"They want me to take a picture? To show the guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression turns blank, and the lines around her eyes tighten a little. But she regains her smile, and after pulling her hair back she lifts the cap to her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before she sets it there, she shoots you a quick glance, and in that glance you think you see a glint of recognition. Your heart goes into your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's too late. She's already tugging the cap down onto her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her eyes go out of focus and she face plants onto her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut and lock the door, then leap forward to the desk. Gently you rotate her head so as to get a look at her face. Her expression is slack and her eyes unseeing, just as they were the day you got the mask onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that metal band? The cap has tumbled off and you examine its insides after picking it up. That metal band is gone, but the tape you used to fix it to the inside front is still there. You look around the desk but find nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have disappeared inside her, the way the mask did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're much less concerned about her health this time around, but you still pace the room anxiously as you await some kind of result. After about ten minutes, though, you wheel at the sound of a faint clatter from the desk. The band is now lying there, next to her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoop it up and replace it with the ball cap. Then you scoop the ball cap up as well. Best not to leave any kind of evidence behind. Let her think maybe she hallucinated your visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the school library you sit in a corner and examine the spoils from your raid. The band looks unchanged until you turn it over. You almost drop it when you see the bluish letters that blaze out of it: ROBERTA CATHERINE SCHELL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a low whistle. Looks like it's done its job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now you have a complete \"Coach Schell\" disguise. Except for some suitable clothes. But do you really need them?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This is the second time you've assaulted Coach Schell. Could she track you down in the library? Probably not. But why take the risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, it's Friday, and your last class of the day is only Astronomy. You decide to bail early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the long way around the front of the school\u2014dodging the gym completely\u2014to the student parking lot, and dive into your truck. You take a long look around, to see that you are unobserved, then wedge yourself into the passenger-side foot well, where you will be out of sight to any except the most determined snoopers. You take out the brain-band you got off Coach Schell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you do: A complete disguise will require clothes, and the best way to find a suitable set of clothes to go with a Coach Schell disguise, you figure, is to consult the mind and memories of Coach Schell herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou study the band for a minute before hazarding the experiment. No particular instructions came with the band, but you're pretty sure that you should press it to your face, probably the forehead, the same as you did with Coach Schell. But that's not what causes you to pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you are wondering what exactly is going to happen. Will the band change your mind around completely, the way the mask changed your body? Will you think that you're really Roberta Catherine Schell? Will you freak out when you find yourself inside the body of a teenage boy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr will it work in some other way, like a computer terminal containing her memories that you'll be able to access if you concentrate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the only way to find out is to try it. You take a deep breath, and slap the metal band onto your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's like you've opened a door into your brain, and something very black and heavy heaves itself through and into you. It grabs you and pulls you down into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe world is a blooming and buzzing confusion when you open your eyes, and your head is spinning. When you reach up to steady it, you bust your knuckles on something, and curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heck is going on? Your legs are squeezed up next to your chest, and you feel like you're sitting wedged inside a small, tight space. Your first instinctive thought is, <i>Am I in the toilet again? Fuck, how much did I have to drink?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the world comes into focus, and you see that you're inside a vehicle of some kind. There's a bench here, like a truck bench. Hang on, you're in the foot well of a truck? The hell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that the world is in focus, your mind quickly follows. With a rush of relieved recognition, you see that this is your truck, and remember that you jammed yourself in real good here while experimenting with that\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, fuck. That metal band. Where\u2014?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tight grimace you pull yourself up and onto the seat. No metal band clatters from your lap onto the floor mat, so you shove open the passenger-side door and clamber out. You feel a headache coming on\u2014something is pounding inside your skull\u2014and with gritted teeth and clenched eyes you search the foot well and under the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, maybe the band went inside you, the way the mask did. You rub your forehead. It's slick with sweat, but it feels like flesh, and it pulls away slightly when you tug at it. But if you put it on, why haven't you got Coach Schell's memories?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the foot well and that reminds you of that toilet stall. Your sorority sisters shoved you inside on in the student union, once, when you got drunk off your ass your sophomore year and\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world reels, and you grab your head and catch yourself from toppling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept you are falling. Vertigo seizes you as you feel yourself plunging stomach-first into an abyss. Images rush at you\u2014like the ground rushing up at a skydiver with a failed parachute\u2014and you sink to your knees. There's a great collision inside your head\u2014a crash\u2014the world shatters\u2014then it flies together again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart is banging at the front of your throat when the sensation passes. The world is just as it was before. You are crouching next to your truck in the student parking lot of Westside High. It's eighth period, and you ought to be in Astronomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or teaching Personal Fitness 5c in the gym.</i> A hard tremble passes through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand back up again and look down at yourself. You know what to expect. Strong, tanned legs, probably clad in tight sweat pants. A full bosom. Hair down to your elbows. You see instead the skinny, hairy legs of a high school boy in cargo shorts, and a chest and stomach as flat as a washboard. You pull your hat off and feel at your hair. It is short\u2014well, short for Cathy Schell\u2014and feels in need of a hard beating with a good hairbrush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this body too is not unexpected. For you know who you are. You're William Prescott. But you feel Roberta Catherine Schell's memories clinging about you, like a heavy cobweb. You've only to pluck at a strand, and not only that memory but a host of associations crowd in on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, where do you live? A little house on Cressmore Drive, just outside the \"student ghetto\" area south of the university. You and three of your sorority sisters rented it your last  year in college. When you returned to Saratoga Falls after a disastrous stint in Boston working for an educational publisher, you found it was available for rent again, and took it. Mrs. Langkampf was quite pleased to see you return. You and your sisters were the last good tenants she'd had there ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could get in there, you'd know exactly where to find some of Coach Schell's best clothes. And you do know how to get in there: Cathy keeps a spare key under the birdhouse in the backyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check your phone. Assuming that Coach Schell doesn't take sick and go home early, you've got at least a thirty minute head start on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump back into your truck and gun it for the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nCressmore Drive, like all the streets in that quarter of the city, curls and curves like an \"S\" that's trying to tighten itself into a spiral; you'd never find it if you didn't have Cathy Schell's instincts to guide you. Her house is a little brick duplex with a small yard in front and a small yard in back. It belonged to Mrs. Langkampf's brother\u2014an optometrist who kept his practice in one half while living in the other\u2014until he died (at a young age, she informed Cathy) and left it to his sister. Having a house of her own, Mrs. Langkampf now rents it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou park in the makeshift driveway and glance about. There's a couple of girls walking down the other side of the street\u2014college students on their way home, it looks like\u2014but otherwise the coast is clear. You hop out and trot around the side of the house to the back. A trim little wooden birdhouse sits on a pole just inside the yard. You smile to yourself as you pry the house off and filch the key from the little hollow in the top of the pole. So clever of Thomas to think of making that its hiding place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thomas!</i> There's a less welcome jolt of memories, of Thomas Luna and his hot, bare chest and his meaty arms and his granite-like cock thrusting itself deep inside you as you clench him tightly to yourself and shriek at the ceiling\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head clear of the vivid memory and jump onto the porch. You insert the key, and the lock slides back with a soft <i>snick.</i> Then you're inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step into a small living room dominated by a love seat and a giant flat-screen TV, but you waste no time gawking at a set up that is as familiar to you as your own house. You trot down the short hallway to the bedroom. You whip open the closet door and the top dresser drawer as you mentally dress yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, bottoms and a bra, only one of each, because I'm not going to be camping out inside them for more than a few hours at a time, probably. One pair of jeans, one pair of ankle socks. One polo shirt and one t-shirt and ... Oh, dammit, okay then, one crisp white blouse. In case I want to look pretty when I go out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am going to be going out, right? What's the fun in looking like and dressing up as Cathy Schell if I don't do it in public?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJewelry? She'll miss it.</i> You can go without. <i>Shorts? All up at the school. No, wait\u2014</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dash around a corner into the laundry room, and from the hamper you pull out some blue cotton shorts. You sniff them. <i>Not too bad.</i> A shiver runs through you\u2014it's Cathy's scent on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Anything else? A hair band? Friendship bracelets? What about money? Any cash?</i> No, Cathy will have her billfold at school, and the emergency sugar bowl was empty when she checked it yesterday. She half expected a moth to fly out of it, you remember with a rueful half smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, this'll have to do. Get this stuff and yourself out while you can, Cathy! Er. Will!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou race out the back, lock the door, return the key to its hiding place, and with legs about to collapse from adrenaline overload leap back into your truck. You gasp out a laugh of relief as you roar down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what comes next? It's Friday, and you know where Cathy will probably be: with her boyfriend, out eating and drinking and dancing before returning to his place with him. You know where to go to avoid her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf, that is, you're going to go out in public in this disguise.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cathy Schell isn't a gym rat\u2014far from it\u2014but she does have a membership at the Steel 24-Hour gym up by the other high school. She goes three times a week, every Saturday, Monday and Wednesday. So there's almost no chance of running into her there, even if you didn't already know her Friday night plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the gym seems like a great place to try her face and body out in a very physical way without getting caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you text your mom, telling her you've made afternoon/evening plans with Caleb and Keith, and not to expect you back before your curfew. Then you drive onto the Keyserling campus, to one of the parking garages, and slide into a space in a dark corner on the third floor. There are no other cars around, and no foot traffic of any kind, when you pull from your bag the mask that you've been lugging around all day. You strip off everything but your boxers, then again wedge yourself in the foot well so you won't be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now it's the mask that you press to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<i>Deja vu.</i> For a few seconds it's a replay of earlier as you wake in a confused muddle. <i>Where am I what the fuck how did I\u2014?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the confusion passes almost immediately. You heave yourself out of your hiding hole and fall back onto your truck bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour skin prickles. Your thighs prickle. Your boobs and your nipples prickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my God. The breasts are back.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are round and firm, with tips that point just slightly upward, as though nosing at the air. You gently cradle them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's an unusual feeling, for Will Prescott hasn't got boobs like this to cradle, and Cathy Schell doesn't cradle them this way either. Oh, she examines them often, but in a clinical way, for asymmetries and blemishes, not for the erotic thrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a parking garage is not the place for an erotic thrill either. It is dark and empty, and more threatening. Cathy's memories warn you that this is this a bad place for a young, naked woman only a few years out of college to be. With an involuntary chill of fear, you push off your boxers and snatch up the panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your vulnerability, little ripples of delight run all over you as you pull the tight panties up your legs and snap them onto your hips. Then the shorts. You wrinkle your nose: So disgusting going to the gym in a pair of dirty shorts. Thomas can get away with it\u2014you clench your back molars as you think of his hot breath on your neck\u2014because he's a guy, and hot, sweaty guys are a turn-on. (You clench your teeth harder.) But you like to be fresh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, Will, focus! Cathy Schell likes to be fresh!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept that you're becoming more and more like Cathy as you snap her bra on and pull the t-shirt over your head. Your instincts now rebel against the wardrobe choices you made: You need to be in a sports bra, and in something less sloppy than this t-shirt, which is more of a lounge-around-the-house or doing-some-cleaning kind of wear. You'll have to content yourself with a light, non-strenuous workout this afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is probably wise, as you can still feel some of the tightness from the workout she gave herself yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA workout with Thomas. It's not just in the bedroom that they get physical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dammit, stop thinking about him!</i> you tell yourself as you pull on the socks. But telling yourself not to think about it is just another way of reminding yourself that Cathy's semi-addicted to Thomas Luna and his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo your brain burns with irritation as you look around for the shoes. <i>Where the heck did you\u2014?</i> A groan bursts from your chest. You didn't bring any <i>shoes!</i> How could you have forgotten?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it's too late now to chance a return to Cathy's house, so you slide on your old sneakers. They are too large, and even after pulling the laces tight you feel like you've donned a pair of clown shoes. But they'll have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide over behind the wheel, take a deep breath, and try to calm yourself. You brush your hair back\u2014<i>dammit, you should have snatched up a hair tie</i>\u2014and take several more calming breaths. You close your eyes and let your chin droop to your chest. Your sorority sisters always said you got too excitable, and Felicia taught you this calming routine so you wouldn't spaz out before tests. <i>She taught </i>Cathy Schell<i> that trick,</i> you remind yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course you're about to go out in public as Cathy Schell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Embrace it,</i> you tell yourself. <i>If you're going to do this thing, do it right. You've got Cathy Schell's body, now put yourself in her brain, and put yourself in her place.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cover your face with your hands and take your deepest breath yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you let it out, it's like expelling a ghost. The shoes still flop about on your feet, and the clothes are all wrong for a trip to the gym. Your hair is a mess when you look in the rearview mirror as you adjust it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cathy Schell looks back at you. For now it's Cathy Schell who is looking into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAnd who is Cathy Schell? In this calmer frame of mind, with a short, dull drive ahead of you, you've time to soak in her memories and personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're twenty-four years old, which is young enough to have fun and ripe enough for the means to pay for it. In other words, Cathy Schell has a good job with good prospects that can pay for the drinking and dancing and sex she enjoys on the weekends. Saratoga Falls\u2014to your own personal amazement\u2014agrees with her. It's a big city relative to Martinvale (pop. 3000), the little burg thirty-five miles away where she grew up and went to high school, but not as overwhelming as Boston. No, Saratoga Falls is small enough that she can't get lost in it, but is big enough that she can have the sort of fun she craves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came to Saratoga Falls to attend Keyserling College, where she majored in English and Sports Education. The latter was originally something she took only because she was taking lots of P.E. classes anyway\u2014Cathy has always been an exuberant, outdoorsy girl\u2014but when the job at Diadem Educational Publishing in Boston didn't work out, she fell back on sports when she heard about the coaching opening at Westside High. As the most junior member of the staff, she's stuck teaching volleyball and the freshman and sophomore P.E. classes. But it pays the bills, keeps her busy, and keeps her in contact with high school girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd high school boys. They weren't this cute when she was in high school, were they? If so, why didn't she notice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the drive you toy with her memories of Martinvale, with its stone courthouse and stone bank and Galen's Popular Dry Goods. The little pink house where Cathy grew up, and the middle/high school\u2014ancient even when her mother attended it\u2014with its faint smell of turpentine in every classroom. Pajama-clad sleepovers in the church recreation hall, and the wet kisses and grinding embraces caught outside in dark corners of the church parking lot with football players who'd snuck over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat kind of memory leads inexorably to memories of Thomas Luna. He is much on Cathy Schell's mind since he joined the Westside tutorial staff at the beginning of the year. She was instantly smitten by his dark-haired charms, and the glint in her eye must have kindled something in his, for he was quick to ask her out the day that she stopped in the tutorial offices to ask for some change for the Coke machine. He was new to town, so she introduced him to the gym\u2014he too has a background in Physical Education\u2014and to the rest of the school staff and to the better restaurants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've warmed to Cathy's body and clothes as you stride toward the gym doors, and thinking of Thomas warms you even more. Now you don't even clench your teeth as you think of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have ID, a purse, or even a gym bag as you enter Steel. But Evan at the front desk knows you, and you and he just exchange a wave as you stride through the lobby. You've no clothes to change, so you make a circuit through the various rooms to make sure the coast is clear, then find yourself a StairMaster. That will probably give you the best workout that will let you feel this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yes, within the first five minutes you're giving yourself a wonderful burn, all the way up your legs from your strong calves to your tight ass. You grimace as you pick up the tempo, but it's a grimace of pleasure. So this is what it's like to be in shape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's not long after that that you sense eyes upon you. At first you ignore them\u2014it's not unusual for a woman like Cathy to get stares\u2014but finally you look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's on the StairMaster behind you. He's cute, with short, dark hair and olive skin, with a fringe of beard down his jaw to his chin. There's something Italianate about his looks. Maybe it's his coloring; maybe it's his nose, which is very strong without being a honker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks like he's in college. Hell, he looks like a football player. Cathy's always liked football players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles at you. \"First time here?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate. \"First time on a Friday afternoon,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I haven't seen you here before. You usually here other times?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a free spot in my schedule,\" you say. The gasp in your reply is less from the workout than the exertion of coming up with a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My names's Anton,\" he says. He puts out his hand, but withdraws it when he sees how awkward it would be for you to reach over and take it. \"I'm usually at the college gym. You know.\" He shrugs. \"I'm trying this place out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could shut him down by mentioning you've got a boyfriend.</span></div></div>",

Then Anton mumbles something. \"What did you say?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, 'That's nice'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is,\" you agree. \"I haven't been to Munson\"\u2014that's the name of the sports complex at Keyserling\u2014\"in a couple of years. Not since I graduated. Have they renovated it any?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try talking a little more, just to show the guy you're not pissed at him or unfriendly. But his answers are clipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, you were just looking for a pick-up opportunity,</i> you think to yourself. <i>All the girls at Munson are probably sick of your bullshit, so you thought you'd try it out here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quarter-hour of not saying anything, Anton steps off his machine and wanders away. You give yourself a further five minutes, then give up too. The guy's clumsy stab at picking you up as rather ruined it for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't give up on the gym immediately, though, and hit the showers. It's a happy realization that leads you to them: Here's a chance to get naked, in public, with Cathy Schell's body, in a place where there's only a tiny chance of being caught out. Without your bag and a lock you have to fold up your clothes and leave them on a bench near the showers, and it preys on your mind a little as you let the hot water slide over you: If someone stole them, you really would be up shit creek without a paddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you do your best not to worry about it as you wash yourself all over with the complimentary bar of soap, lathering your thigh and calves and hips and washing under your boobs. When you're done, lacking a towel, you push all the water off as best you can before slipping back into your clothes. You're wet enough, though, that you dispense with the tight underthings, and it's while wearing only the shorts, the shirt, and the shoes that you clomp back out into the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a short one today, coach?\" Evan calls as you pass the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just a short one. Had some stress I wanted to work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear that. Did you want to sign in before you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to?\" You'd rather leave no evidence behind of your visit. \"I don't feel like I was here long enough to count.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan shrugs, and tosses you small wave as you glide out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSo you managed to waste only a little more than forty-five minutes at the gym. It's not even five-thirty as you pull back out onto Twentieth. You've got an alibi set up for five more hours of fun, but what can you do? Cathy herself would like to hit a club. You have just enough money, probably, to get in to one, and after that you'd have to rely on guys to buy you a drink, and after your encounter with Anton you're not so keen on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, as you drive around, your mind goes back to the grimoire, and to the supplies you need to gather for the next spell. You need money for that, though, and you've borrowed from everyone you can possibly tap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cathy Schell could borrow some money, couldn't she? That was an idea you had, to scrounge around the school begging a ten here and a twenty there off the other teachers. Now, with Cathy Schell's memories, you realize that wouldn't be the best plan. Cathy doesn't know that many of the teachers, not that well. And even if she did, you doubt you could collect the two to three hundred dollars you figure it will cost you to buy those chemicals. So where could she\u2014you\u2014get the money?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're passing the hospital when you glance over at the Panda Garden Chinese Buffet. One thought will lead to another, and a few blocks down you dive into a parking lot to make a U-turn and roar back up Twentieth the way that you came. Your idea is a long-shot, but if it works out it'll give you all you need in one big lump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nFifteen minutes later you're parked in front of Thai Won On, a crummy little restaurant in a shabby little shopping center next to the Walmart. But you're not here to get Thai food. You're here for the Tae Kwon Do dojo next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe electronic bell on the door goes <i>bong</i> as you open it, but none of the students in their cotton robes look over. There's a half dozen of them\u2014boys and girls, middle-school students by the looks of them\u2014and they're concentrated on two figures in the middle of the mat. One of them is a boy of about fourteen, you'd judge. The other is a tall, bearded man. He's in black robes; the boy is in white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instructor holds out a padded paddle, and each time he gives a word the student, who is bouncing lightly on his feet, throws up a leg and kicks it. You only know the rudiments of the sport, but it seems to you that his form is very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's something mesmerizing about the spectacle, and you don't break your gaze even after the instructor dismisses the one student and brings up another. Not until you hear your name\u2014\"Cathy?\"\u2014murmured almost in your ear do you spin about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twyla!\" You gasp at the willowy, blonde-haired woman smiling at you. \"You snuck up on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure were into it.\" Twyla Carpenter grips your forearm. Like her husband, she's in a black instructor's robe. \"You just stopping by, or here for a lesson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither.\" You can't help blushing a little. \"But how are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay. Want some coffee? Or I've got some chai tea from next door.\" She gestures you to follow her to a doorway that opens into what looks like a break room. You can't help casting a glance back at the male instructor: her husband, Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe break room is actually an office with a sink and refrigerator, and you take some coffee in a Styrofoam cup and settle in to talk to Twyla Carpenter. Naturally, it takes almost twenty minutes to get the pleasantries out of the way, for Cathy hasn't seen Twyla\u2014an old sorority sister from college\u2014in a couple of months. So although you are anxious to get to the point, you sit back to catch up and reminisce and gossip. You ask about business at the dojo\u2014it's good\u2014and you tell her about your classes at the school\u2014the volleyball team looks like it will do well this season\u2014and you gush about this really hot guy, Thomas Luna, who you've been dating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwyla's eyes flash with sympathetic excitement. \"You and your guy will have to come out with us some night,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be great. Although\u2014\" You blush. \"We're still at the stage now where we like it to just be us, you know, at his place or mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwyla squeezes your hand. \"So he isn't just a crush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, no!\" The words burst out without your even thinking them. \"I think\u2014 No, I don't want to think that far ahead! But you know, there hasn't been anything, I mean, <i>nothing</i> that doesn't make me think, you know, that maybe\u2014?\" You have to cover your face for the furious blush that has come over it. When you think of Thomas, and how hot he is, and how smart and sensitive\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful there,\" Twyla says. \"Remember Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God!\" You make a face. Alex was a guy Cathy met her junior year in college, and she was sure he was The One. Until he dumped her hard for a girl on the swim team. \"I don't think Thomas would\u2014 Look, how are you and Ben?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwyla raises an eyebrow. \"I hope that's not following a thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! But I've told you enough about Thomas. Tell me about Ben.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're still doing great.\" But she shares some mild complaints\u2014he's a bit of a slob, and is a little too forgetful when it comes to doing his share of the chores around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still haven't edged up to the real purpose of this visit when her husband comes in to get some water, and to visit for a few minutes before going back out again for the class. That's when you ask Twyla when she has to be on the floor for a class again. \"I'm done for the day,\" she says. \"I was just about to change when you came in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then if you've got a little while,\" you tell her, \"I've got a really big favor to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwyla\u2014who was always a good friend, even if she and Cathy have grown a little distant since Cathy left for Boston\u2014listens sympathetically as you spin a tale of some emergency dental work you need done. \"Insurance will pay for half of it, but I'm still short a couple of hundred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dentist can't set you up on some scheduled payments?\" Twyla asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn.</i> \"I'm changing dentists after this,\" you improvise. \"I don't want to owe him anything. And I don't want to ask Thomas for the money.\" You flutter your hands. \"You know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you draw a deep breath. \"So, could I borrow it from you and Ben? Three hundred? Just for a month. Two pay checks, and I'll have enough I can\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can spare that,\" Twyla says. She starts to get up. \"I'll get you a check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there a cash machine around here? I mean, it doesn't make a difference either way, I guess, but\u2014\" You make doe eyes at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwyla doesn't seem to like the idea of giving you the money in cash, but she relents and walks down to the ATM with you. You thank her profusely, and after a little more chit-chat you part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou still have the rest of the evening clear, but you have had your fill for now of being Cathy Schell. And you've still got a grimoire to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stores will be closed, so you can't buy those supplies until tomorrow. But cemeteries, where you need to gather dirt, are best visited at night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your family's surprised to see you return home so soon. They're a little disconcerted, too, for you arrive just as supper is winding up, and you fall onto the pork chops and mashed potatoes with the gusto of one who hasn't eaten anything since lunch. Your dad, who seems in a mood to find fault, pointedly asks when you're going to get that haircut he already paid for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This weekend,\" you promise him. \"Tomorrow.\" Well, you're planning on going out to buy a bunch of stuff anyway. You can squeeze a haircut in then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why are you home when you said you were going to be out until your curfew with friends? \"Something came up,\" you explain between mouthfuls. \"But we're getting together around eight-thirty, be out all evening.\" That'll be long enough, you hope, to raid the cemetery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs you unload your backpack, not only of books and papers but of the mask and brain-band you removed before coming home, and the clothes you stole from Coach Schell's house. The latter you fold up tight and stuff behind some old board games high up on a shelf in your closet. Then you settle in with the grimoire to double-check your shopping list for tomorrow's errands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd\u2014what luck, it seems\u2014one of the items you need is a hank of your own hair. You wonder what the barber will think when you collect some of your own hair from off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy seven-thirty the sun has set and you begin to get antsy. You don't want to hit the cemetery until its totally dark, but as you visualize the job to come you realize that you should get some bags to help transport the dirt. Happily, a trip to Walmart to get some sand bags will eat up some time. You take the rest of your shopping list with you, and while you're there you score nearly half of the items you need for the upcoming spell. You hide it all under the tarp that your dad insisted you keep rolled up tight in one of the storage compartments of your truck and return home long enough to rummage a shovel from the garage and toss it into the back with everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, even though there's still a faint wash of light in the west, you head off toward the cemetery. Though, of course, you don't tell your parents that's where you're going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe Masonic Cemetery sits in a little triangle of land between Saratoga Falls, the Acheson township where you live, and the river. It isn't out in the country, exactly, but houses are few and far between in that part of the city, even though it is bounded on two sides by important thoroughfares. Naturally, there are no lights of any kind within its walls, but the piercing mercury vapor lamps from the streets cast an acrid glow over its fringes. After turning through one of the gates onto a wide gravel path, you navigate your way deep into the cemetery to get away from any kind of light. And even after you park, you carry the shovel and box of sand bags even deeper into its park-like grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tombstones march along in neat rows, like tiny teeth poking from the dark gums of the earth. Here and there a larger monument\u2014an obelisk, or a long, arch-like stone marking the presence of a family\u2014interrupt the line. You're not particularly superstitious; nor (judging by what you're about to do) are you particularly reverential. But still you skirt the graves as you circle about in a widening spiral, trying to find a spot that isn't too far from your truck but where you will be best shielded from spying eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you settle on a spot a few dozen yards from where you're parked, where a crypt and some low bushes block your view of Orlando Boulevard. You set a flashlight on a tombstone so that its feeble light spills over the grassy plot you've chosen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou avoid looking at the name on the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start by cutting through the turf in a wide oval, then dig out the grass and cast it aside. Then you get down to the more serious work of lifting out shovelfuls of dry, loamy dirt. You work slowly and carefully, so as not to wear yourself out too quickly, and toss the dirt into a berm that slowly builds in mass and depth. When you've judged the pile large enough to work with, you open up the box of sand bags and start scooping the dirty into them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter packing ten bags, you begin to wish you'd brought a set of kitchen scales so as to make sure that you're getting enough dirt\u2014or too much dirt?\u2014into each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's only a very light wind, which is almost perfect for it keeps you cool without being annoying, and covers up the distant grumble of traffic, which might otherwise unnerve you. You quickly settle into a routine. <i>Shovel out a largish pile of dirt; pack into bags; transport the bags to your truck; return to dig some more.</i> You have plenty of time, and no distractions, to ponder the step that comes after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a step that needs pondering: You're supposed to set this stuff on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, the spell asks you to pile four hundred pounds of graveyard dirt onto a sigil, douse it all with some highly flammable chemicals, and set it a match to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no way you're going to do that at your house, let alone in your bedroom. You're going to need another location. Someplace that a fire and/or an explosion won't get a lot of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah. That should be easy, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only think of one place that might work: the countryside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffolk Wilderness is the only place that comes to mind. It's a nature preserve that encompasses a scrubby wood and a low range of hills southeast of town, just next to the Fort Suffolk military installation. You and your friends don't often go hiking there, but you've been up and down the trails a couple of times. Maybe you could find a deserted hollow someplace, well off the beaten trail, where you could make the experiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd\u2014you cheerfully think\u2014if you put it near the border it shares with the military base, maybe any explosions you cause could be put down to military activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr\u2014it occurs to you a few minutes later\u2014that's exactly the kind of spot that would be quickly swarming with soldiers if you did set off a blast there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you carry yet a third load of bags over to your truck another problem comes to you. How long would it take, and how much backbreaking labor would it be, to lug all the stuff up and down some rough trails, which snake up and down the sides of hills, to a remote place where you could try the spell? Not to mention, what happens if you lose the place after you've hauled most or even all of the material into the middle of nowhere?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the Wilderness would only work if you had people to help you. Some friends. Caleb and Keith, maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you'd have to tell them what it was all about. Show them the grimoire and the mask, something you've held back from doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be so much simpler, you think with a heavy sigh, if there were another place in the country where you could try out the spell. The stupid fuck of it, you reflect, is that even though there's so much more countryside than city, it is so much harder to get to, and you don't know where to find a good spot in the middle of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've moved about three hundred pounds of dirt, you figure, when you take a break and slump to the ground with your back against one of the tires. Your joints are stiff and your muscles ache, and you don't dare stop for too long. But during the pause you let your mind drift. When have you ever been out to the country?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just by framing the question, you come up with another answer: the Bradshaw farm. Sure! Kevin Bradshaw's family has a farm in the middle of fuck-all, and every year for Halloween when you were in elementary school they hosted a hayride for Kevin's classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was a mixed entertainment at best. The hayride itself wasn't anything to get excited about, but the party afterward was usually pretty good, for Mrs. Bradshaw made lots of good desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad Kevin was a bully and a bastard from an early age. The last you heard he was being homeschooled after Eastman High expelled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take out your cell phone and go onto Google Maps. It takes you a few minutes with both the map and the street views to find the Bradshaws' farm. It looks like there's a road that skirts the property, and if the satellite view is to be believed it comes to a dead end near a knot of trees by a small creek that might or might not be on their property. It shouldn't be too hard to set something up there, and it would be hidden from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make no decisions, but let the idea stew in the back of your mind as you return to work. You're getting cold now, and your muscles are groaning. But with gritted teeth you get the last of the sandbags packed away and stowed in the bed of your truck. You cover them over with the tarp and start the drive home. You notice that your truck handles more sluggishly with the load, and you take the turns very carefully. You'd dearly love to stop off at a convenience store for a cola and a candy bar, but the time is getting close up to your curfew, so you drive straight back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way you come up with another possible place to chance the spell: the basement of the old elementary school a few blocks away from your house. True, it's public property, and an enclosed space\u2014probably the worst place for a fire. But it's close by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the last time you checked, you had a key to it.</span></div></div>",

I won't forget, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks too surprised to be skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you're out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYour first stop is the old elementary school a few blocks from your house. And in this case \"old\" really does mean <i>old.</i> It's a tall, imposing two-story building with a bell tower at one corner, built in the 1930s or something or like that. It was closed before you were born, when a new school was built south of the village, and part of the old building was converted into a community recreation center. You've never been inside, that you can remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part of the school want, fortunately, is on the opposite side from the community center. There, in an otherwise blank wall, is a long line of windows, screened by weeds and long tufts of grass, that peek up just above ground level. A sloping pit is cut into the ground at one end of this line of windows, and a short set of concrete stairs lead down to a heavy metal door that's secured with a latch and a heavy lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's your lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was your lock last year, when you put it on the door. You'd been exploring the school grounds and feeling more than a little destructive. On finding that door, went off to get a crowbar and used it to pry the latch open. On the other side of the door was a short set of wooden stairs leading down into a dirty and cluttered basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a huge basement, cluttered up with old desks and tables and chairs; with tall bookcases and dark, heavy cabinets; with globes and old sinks and pommel horses, and even a floor-to-ceiling mirror in a tarnished gilt frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rummaged around the place, opening drawers and peering onto shelves and finding nothing but dead insects, old paper, and piles of dust. You rearranged some of the furniture to open up a spot where you could put some squeaky old desk chairs\u2014the kind that roll around on cast-iron wheels\u2014and opened up a tunnel into a cranny near a back wall. Then, when you were grimy and hot and tired, you went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came back a little later, though, with a lock of your own and hung it on the door. You put there, originally, just to disguise the fact that someone had broken in. But a few weeks later, when you returned, you found it still on the door. You watched for a few weeks, decided that the groundskeepers and maintenance staff had mostly forgotten about the basement, and showed it to Caleb and Keith. You made it a kind of \"secret clubhouse\" for a little while, and last Halloween you and your friends even spent the night there, drinking whiskey and trying to tell ghost stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you mostly forgot about it. You haven't been back since Christmas, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you park on a wide patch of ground next to the basement door and descend the steps. You found the old  key in your dresser drawer, and when you put it in the lock it snaps open easily enough. You loose a low whistle. It's been a year since you swapped out locks\u2014and the staff <i>still</i> haven't tried to get in the basement?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend about twenty minutes exploring it again, and clearing off a large conference table. You wish you'd remembered this place before\u2014it would make a dandy spot for making masks. Then you move down the sacks of dirt you got from the graveyard, and the other supplies you'd picked up at Walmart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it's in to town\u2014first to get some donuts and coffee, for you're ravenous\u2014then to a couple of specialty shops to pick up those things you couldn't get at Walmart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's a little after two o'clock before you return home from your various errands. Your dad orders you to take your cap off, and grunts a reluctant approval of the hair cut. At least your bangs are out of your eyebrows now, and most of your ears are visible. You scooped up most of what got chopped off\u2014telling the hair dresser that you're saving it for a \"project,\" an explanation that she only shrugged at\u2014and put it in a baggie along with the other things you picked up. It's all still in the back of your truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're not home to pick up the grimoire for transport to the basement. Instead, you prop up on your bed with it and a newly purchased sketch pad. You flip open to the spell, eyeball it closely for awhile, then begin to copy the sigil onto a fresh page of heavy parchment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got the idea for copying it out while at the military supply store next to your dad's workplace. You went there to pick up some fuse cord, and the clerk\u2014who gave you a rather fish-eyed stare, you thought\u2014wanted to know what it was for. You gave him a story about wanting to set off some model rockets for your cousins, and how your aunt insisted that little fingers be kept very far from the propellant. You doubt that he believed you, but he didn't put up any further argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after that you got to thinking again about the kind of explosives that you've been buying. You're supposed to pile it all onto the sigil inside the book. But the only thing worse than blowing up the school, in your estimation, is blowing up the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead of using the sigil inside the book, you'll make a copy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd been dreading the work, for the sigil\u2014a circle filled with intricate overlapping whirls and doodads\u2014is very complicated. But once you start, you find the work strangely soothing and satisfying. The lines form very easily under your fingers, and as you concentrate on the original and on your copy it seems to you that the abstract, patterns come to resemble faces and forms: a maze that sometimes looks like a minotaur. You catch yourself smiling as you work; and when you're done and look up to pop the crick from your neck, you find that an hour has flown by with your scarcely noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend a further fifteen minutes carefully comparing the two copies, and are surprised, and a little worried, to find no great errors. But when a second examination turns up nothing, you shrug and take the grimoire and the sketchbook back down to your truck. Your dad is asleep on the sofa, and your mother is knitting, so no one stops you as you go out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basement is as you left it, and after propping the grimoire open for consultation, you begin to assemble this, the most complicated spell yet. You lay the sigil copy onto the conference table and, one five-pound bag at a time, weigh out the spoils of last night's raid in a set of scales you bought before piling them onto the sigil. That takes a tediously long time, after which you douse it all in carefully measured liquids and cover it with correctly proportioned powders. A large pinch of your hair you tuck into the middle of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you stick one end of the fuse cord into the mess, run the other end to the bottom of the stairs, and take out a lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause. <i>Jesus,</i> you think to yourself. <i>Am I really going to do this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently you are, for without quite willing it, you flick the lighter and put the flame to the end of the cord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you haul ass like a son of a bitch up the stairs and to your truck. You turn the motor on and back into the street. You drive around a corner, park in front of the school, and wait with the motor running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor two minutes nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut off the motor and, with a pounding heart, trot around the side of the school. Cautiously you approach the open door to the basement. You hold your breath, and look inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dirt is on fire. Great plumes of purple flame billow and smoke off it. There is no hiss, no fizzle, no crackle\u2014just sheets of lavender and violet that shimmy into the air. You put out your hand, then stick it into one of the flames. <i>No heat!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whistle, long and low, and watch, mesmerized, as the fire dances. Then you double-check the instructions you'd cobbled together out of translations. The fire is supposed to burn, and you must relight it when it goes out, until it will not relight again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no indication how long that will take, so you tear yourself away long enough to run home to gather up all the other supplies you've collected over the past few weeks, and transport them to the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire is still burning when you get back, and you busy yourself by setting up a little workshop. When you're done, you sit back and watch the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt burns and burns and burns. You take out your cell phone and check texts and surf the internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nFinally, you can't take it anymore. You've got to do something. Make some more masks. Go hang out with Caleb and Keith\u2014they've been pestering you with texts you've mostly ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo out in public again as Coach Schell?</span></div></div>",

And even though it is giving off no heat, you don't want to leave it alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you pull out one of the three unpolished masks you've got on hand, and one of the three incomplete metal bands. You have no firm ideas about who you might use them on. But with nothing else to do, you might as well work on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, the next spell might ask for a blank mask or brain band as one of the ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope that the fire doesn't burn as long as it will take to polish another mask, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"The fuck you do with yourself this weekend?\" Caleb asks you Monday morning. \"Did your dad ground you on account of the way you fucked up your paper for Walberg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I just did stuff. You know. Projects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou deflect him. \"Where was Keith? You do shit with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh. He's decided he wants to be a YouTube star.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown, then remember that movie review channel he was talking about. \"How's that going?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck if I know. You've got him for that bullshit Film as Literature class, not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not bullshit!\" You flinch when you catch Amanda Ferguson wheeling around to glare at your outburst. \"It's not bullshit!\" you hiss in a lower voice. \"You had Mr. Hawks last year, you think he's gonna make it easy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought it was gonna be easy when you signed up for it last year. You were all, <i>I'ma watch movies all next semester, yo.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Keith who said it. And it turned out to be hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It turned out to be bullshit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flip him off, then hide your hands under your desk when you catch Mr. Walberg glaring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBut Caleb's got a point. You did give him (and Keith, technically) the blow-off over the weekend. So you make a point of saying that you should all eat together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow that metamorphoses into eating out front with Carson's group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's just him and James and Paul, though, and none of them are very talkative. Paul hunches up stares morosely at the passing traffic. You're tempted to ask him when the last time was he hung out with Yumi\u2014it seems to be the high point of his day when she comes out to eat lunch with them\u2014but decide to be nice. As for Carson and James, they seem too preoccupied to say much, and only grunt and murmur when anyone says anything to them. Even when Caleb openly chides you for fucking up on your time capsule paper, Carson only offers the laconic observation, \"Yeah, Walberg's a hard-ass about things like that,\" and goes back to eating his sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for where Jenny is, that only gets an \"Around\" from James when Caleb asks. But a fuller answer emerges halfway through lunch when Carson's phone chimes. He squints at the screen, makes a sour face, and shows it to James, whose face also curls up. When Carson looks up, he finds you staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you wanna make yourself fucking useful?\" he says to you. \"Get something out of my locker, take it to Jenny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know your locker number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty-nine-twenty-three. Combination is four, twenty-nine, ninety-nine. Date of Oliver Cromwell's birth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck?\" Keith exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson ignores him. \"Need you to get my calculus book out and take it to Jenny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she, and why can't you\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's in the gym, which should answer both your questions. Move it, Prescott,\" Carson barks. \"She needs to copy my homework, and I need the book back before next period. Unless you want to lend her a copy of <i>your</i> homework, and I don't know why she'd want a D.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stare back. \"No, tell me why <i>you</i> can't go to the gym yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames answers. \"We've got three good reasons,\" he says. \"Four if Seth's been up in the fuck room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson clicks a ball point pen, grabs your hand, and scrawls on the underside of your forearm. \"Those are the numbers. Jenny'll kick your ass if you don't get her my homework in the next five minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance over at Caleb and Keith. Tilley, who shrank up at the mention of Seth Javits's name, avoids your eye. Caleb openly grins, and falls onto his side and stretches out his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you guys,\" you fume at Carson and James, but you get to your feet. \"Where in the gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The classroom under the mezzanine. Where the coaches have their offices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost fall over. But it's easier to do the errand than to explain why the P. E. offices are the absolute last place you want to visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou wouldn't want to visit the gym anyway\u2014even the sophomore jocks unnerve you\u2014but after your adventure last week you've got better reasons to dodge anyplace that has P. E. coaches in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo all the way to Carson's locker, and all the way over to the gym, you wrack your brain trying to remember Coach Schell's schedule. You know she has a free period during seventh\u2014same as yours\u2014but what lunch does she have? And where does she usually take it? Almost all the memories you had while wearing her brain band have leached away. You only remember her house and workout club\u2014because you visited them\u2014and that she is sleeping with Thomas Luna\u2014because <i>blecchhh!</i> that's hard to forget\u2014but otherwise ... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, whatever the mental equivalent of <i>Crickets!</i> would be, that's what you've got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a lot of traffic between the cafeteria and the gym, and it's traffic of the worst sort: buff guys in athletic shorts and t-shirts, smelling of the locker room. But none of them notice you, and you squeeze into the gym foyer without incident. You creep over to the east court and peer in. Boys and girls, dressed out in exercise clothes, are playing clumsy games of basketball. Off in the corner, Coach Tesla, looking like a frog that has learned to walk upright, watches with a bored scowl on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of relief, and hurry over to the mezzanine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the office doors are open, and these you hustle past. Halfway down you come to Coach Schell's door. It's closed. But you're too nervous to take any solace from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very end of the corridor is a large classroom, out of which drift girlish voices and laughter. Inside are a dozen girls, some sitting at the desks and some of them sitting on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny has her back to the door, and you only recognize her by her ponytail. But Yumi is sitting next to her, and when she sees you she nudges her friend, who turns around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thrust Carson's book at her. \"Here, Carson asked me to bring this to you. See you later.\" You turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait a minute!\" Jenny yells after you, and reluctantly you turn back. She drops into a chair and pulls a notebook from her bag. \"Just hang on, I only need this a few minutes, and you can take it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta get back, I'm eating lunch,\" you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She only needs you to wait a minute, Prescott,\" a voice says behind you, and you wheel. Stephanie Wyatt is giving you a very steady look. \"Your lunch can wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wilt. Stephanie Wyatt is the gender-swapped equivalent to Gordon Black or Steve Patterson. She's a hard-muscled basketball player who has scared the shit out of you ever since you shared a fifth-grade class with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, humiliating as it is, you sit on the edge of a desk and wait for Jenny to finish copying out some of Carson's homework problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversation resumes among the other girls, who you now recognize as members of the girls' varsity soccer and basketball squads. You do your best to dodge their eyes. But you notice one blonde girl, who's sitting behind Stephanie, grinning at you. You hunch your shoulders and turn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, it feels like ants are crawling up and down under your skin. Jenny works very deliberately, and a couple of times she stops to consult with Yumi about whether some of the answers could possibly be right, even after Yumi reminds her that she's taking Statistics, not Calculus. You tell Jenny that yes, Carson did the problems correctly. But she looks skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with five minutes to spare until the bell, she folds Carson's homework back inside the book and hands it to you. You jackrabbit out the room and down the hallway before anyone can stop you. Even when a voice shouts \"Will! Will!\" behind you, you pretend not to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you jump back under the mezzanine when you spot a dreadfully familiar figure crossing the gym court. As you watch, paralyzed, Coach Schell strides across and vanishes around the corner into the foyer where the main exit is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand drops onto your shoulder and you spin around. \"Jesus, you're jumpy,\" Yumi says. \"Didn't you hear me calling you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, was that you?\" you gasp. You glance back into the gym, torn between the desire to make a break for it and terror of running straight into the arms of the coach you've twice victimized with your magic shenanigans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Yumi glances over her shoulder, and tiptoes up to you. \"You noticed Katy, didn't you? She was <i>looking</i> at you,\" she says with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gut freezes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" you say. \"But listen, I gotta go.\" You sprint across the gym toward the side door, and you don't stop running until you're on the far side of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt was some genius prank that Carson and James perpetrated, Caleb explains to you after school, as you walked to your cars. That's why they're being extra careful to avoid the gym. You only grunt and race back to the elementary school. You find the fire still burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit and study your work. The mask is nowhere being polished, but you did complete a new brain band. Should you put it on someone? Or keep it in reserve?</span></div></div>",

My treat?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's ten minutes before she replies: <i>Just you and me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes.</i> Then you add, <i>Not a date,</i> and kick yourself hard after hitting \"send.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Yumi only says <i>Sure</i> in reply, and you agree to meet at The Crystal Cave. You run home long enough to tell your mom that you're meeting friends and you think you'll be eating with them. \"Think?\" she says, and doesn't look happy when you shrug. \"I'll put your portion in the refrigerator if you don't eat it tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThere are lots of bohemian coffee shops in Saratoga Falls. More than seems likely, even. <i>This place is like Seattle,</i> Jenny Ashton once observed, back in your sophomore year. <i>All these kooky little coffee shops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore like Arkham, Massachusetts,</i> Carson replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You mean like in Batman?</i> you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, you sub-literate ape,</i> he shot back. <i>H. P. Lovecraft. Goes with the whole Miskatonic vibe that Keyserling's got going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least it doesn't rain like it does in Seattle,</i> Paul Davis observed, which drew a withering glare from Carson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome months later you found a book of Lovecraft stories in the library, and recognized some of them as really cool horror stories you'd read in middle school. You have no idea what Carson meant by comparing Keyserling College to Miskatonic University. But maybe he was just thinking of all the occult accouterments that decorate so many of the retail shops near the college. Besandwiched, an occult-themed sandwich shop, is probably the most extreme example, but coffee shops like The Flying Saucer, with its life-size mannequins of gray aliens standing in the corners, and The Milagro Beanfield Warehouse, with its murals depicting Native American gods and demons, seem to be competing for the same demographic profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho those weirdos are, you don't know. And even after the games you've been playing with that grimoire, you're not sure you want to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway: The Crystal Cave. It occupies a corner of 100 Twentieth Street, a ritzy building of ruby-red brick, white pillars and lintels over the windows, and a forest green canopy hanging over the sidewalk. It's a prestigious address. There's a jewelry store in the opposite corner, and Arnholm's Used Books takes up the rest of the first floor and all of the second. Luxury apartments (you've heard) occupy the top four floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front room of the Cave has a certain buttery splendor\u2014polished brass and whisky-hued woodwork\u2014but the real \"business\" of the place is in back, behind the barista station and the pastry bar. The main dining room contains twelve booths lining two walls, and ten tables in between. Each of the booths has a weird-creepy symbol painted on the wall, glaring down at the table, while each table has a wire stand holding a card printed with its own creepy symbol. <i>The booths are the zodiac, and the tables are the planets,</i> someone explained to you once. <i>They use those instead of numbering the tables.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive ahead of Yumi and after getting your coffee you settle into a booth. A figure with a bow and arrow looms over your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi bustles in about ten minutes later, looking small and pert and very healthy in a pair of short-shorts, sandals, and a halter top. It looks like summer wear, but then September has been unseasonably warm. The high today reached the mid-80s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter greeting each other and going up front to pay for her drink, you settle back in the booth. Yumi smiles at you expectantly. \"So you wanted to talk?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah.\" You twirl your half-empty coffee cup between your palms. \"I kind of took off fast at lunch, when you were talking to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was someone I didn't want to run into. But you were talking about this, uh\u2014\" You swallow. \"Girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Yeah. Katy Conlee. You know her?\" She pulls out her phone after you shake your head. \"She's on the basketball team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great.</i> At least half your interest evaporates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, five percent, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi scrolls and taps her way to a picture, then hands you the phone. On the screen is a picture of a girl with long, straight blonde hair, dark eyebrows, and a peaches-and-cream complexion. She's in basketball togs, holding a basketball and smiling at the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instantly puts you in mind of a chipmunk, the way her eyes and nose scrunch up over her grin, and her cheeks puff out. If it were a video, you'd half expect her to lift the ball to her mouth and start nibbling on it. Her But if she's a biter, she's an adorable biter, even if she is a basketball player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize her, of course, as the girl who was sitting behind Stephanie Wyatt and laughing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is her? Katy Conlee?\" you say. Yumi reaches out to take the phone, but you hold onto it. \"And why did you want to mention her to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you. She was <i>looking</i> at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking at me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi makes a face. \"Not like <i>that.</i> Like\u2014 Well, it looked like she was interested in you.\" Yumi cocks her head. \"Did you get a haircut this weekend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift your hat and brush your hair out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks nice. You should keep it like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna get a haircut every week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not every week, but more often than you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink a couple of times. Is there a hidden message in what Yumi says, that she's trying to impart? \"Is that why this Katy girl was looking at me?\" you ask. \"Because of my hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. You should ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart ricochets around inside your chest. \"Have you talked to her?\" you gasp. \"Does she, uh\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't talked to her,\" Yumi says. \"I don't ever see her that much. I don't have her for any classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you know her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just know her. Jesus, Will,\" she sighs. \"It's not hard to get to know people. I know <i>you.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug in a way that means, <i>Yeah, but we've had lots of classes together and we have friends in common so we're always running into each other.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to set something up so you can meet and talk to each other?\" Yumi asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath. Your reply\u2014\"Sure\"\u2014comes out as a squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see if I can set up a study group or something. Here, give me your schedule.\" She takes her phone back, taps at it, and returns it to you with it open to a \"Notes\" app. \"It's gonna have to be a big group of us, but that's okay. Just don't be shy with her, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blanch a little, but concentrate on entering your schedule. Yumi nods over it after you hand her phone back to her. \"The film class sounds interesting,\" she says. \"You could talk to her about some of the movies you've seen in it, maybe talk her into watching some of them with you. What's 'limch'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, for fifth period, you've got 'limch.' Oh. It's lunch. Do you have Katy for any classes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? Because it would be really awkward if you do but haven't noticed her before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have noticed her,\" you insist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll see what I can work up.\" She bends over her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you use that as an excuse to use the restroom. She says nothing as you slip from the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the restroom, you splash some cold water on your face and study yourself in the mirror. You look like a dork, you think, with your hair chopped back. Like a squirrel that's been to the barber. <i>Well, fuck it,</i> you tell yourself. <i>If Katy looks like a chipmunk and I look like a squirrel ... What would our kids look like?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch as though slapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the dining room you trudge back toward the booth, then remember the other, and more important, purpose to this meeting, and dodge to the side before Yumi can look up and see you. You glance around\u2014you've the place to yourself, it looks like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you slip the metal band from your pocket and creep into the booth behind Yumi. You get up on your knees and look over the partition. Her dark head bobs as she taps on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take one last look around, then reach over the partition with both hands. You have stretch to get them over her forehead, and her head goes back with a jerk as you pull it toward yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you let go, she falls forward with a hard <i>crack</i> to faceplant on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit!</i> You scurry around to see what the damage is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not much, fortunately. Just a red welt on her forehead. You prop her so it looks like she's dropped her head to the table to take a nap. Then you hunch across the table from her and pretend to be absorbed in your cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Yumi's ring tone goes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to ignore it, but when it goes off again, and then a third time, you pull it over to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Christ!</i> It's from Stephanie Wyatt: <i>u there still?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's her reply to a short ping-pong of texts in which Yumi is trying to set up some kind of meeting with her. <i>DQ at 8</i> is Stephanie's proposed rendezvous point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tap in <i>brb</i> so Stephanie won't wander off, then sit back with a beating heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know where this meeting might be. Is it about you? Would Katy be there? Could you crash it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs yourself, or as ... Coach Schell?</span></div></div>",

Ten minutes pass before it does, and Yumi remains unconscious for ten minutes after that. You're staring into your own cell phone when she does finally raise her head, and you keep studying it\u2014pretending nothing happened to her\u2014as she just sits there, not saying anything either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you say if she asks what happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out you don't have to say anything, because she finally just picks up her own phone and starts tapping at it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou count out another minute, then look up. \"Are we done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" she says. Her cheeks are pale. \"Done with what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talking. I need to get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi bites her lip and frowns. \"I do too,\" she says, but she doesn't stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks, you know, for talking to me about this, uh, stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunts. \"Thank Caleb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs and dodges your eye as she gathers up her stuff. \"He told me you've been acting weird ever since Lisa broke up with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare back, dumbfounded, but she doesn't expand on what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYumi's parting comment leaves you feeling a little hurt and baffled\u2014and feeling none too thankful toward Caleb\u2014but you cool off on the drive home.

Not that you're keen on doing any homework, but you have time to kill, and that will be a productive way to kill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find that the fire is <i>still</i> burning in the basement, and you grimace at it hard\u2014why the fuck doesn't the book warn you about how long the farging thing's going to take?\u2014as you pull out the supplies for the evening: clothes, mask, and brain band. You attach the latter to the former with the glue that you made, then take out your math book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet your eye will return again and again to the mask.

You yourself think you look great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jeans are dark and tight, clinging closely to your thighs and hips and waist. The white blouse is cut to complement your shape\u2014billowing out at the bosom, curving inward over your stomach\u2014and though part of you wants to cover it with the denim jacket that Cathy Schell keeps at the front of her closet, you would fight the urge even if you had it here, for you like the way it blatantly advertises your figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could do with a hair tie, but with a wry smile you acknowledge that you'll just have to manage with your curtains of blonde hair draping down around your shoulders. You tuck a long, heavy strand of it behind one ear, and settle the end so that it falls just over one of your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nose is bold, your mouth full, your gaze bright and direct as you look into the mirror and picture the evening to come. You could do with some make up, but Cathy doesn't wear that much of it anyway. You could also do with a purse or gym bag slung over your shoulder, and you could really do with some identification\u2014it occurs to you that you'll be in a <i>lot</i> of trouble if you get caught driving without a license.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the risks are worth it, and you enjoy the waggle of your hips as you saunter out to the truck. You really do hope that Stephanie and Yumi and maybe a few other girls show up. Coach Schell knows them, and is kind of a mentor to some of them. For once, the relationship between you and Stephanie Wyatt is going to be reversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've known Stephanie since elementary school, though thankfully you have shared few classes with her since middle school. She was a jock-girl from the time you met her; hell, she probably popped out of her mother with a baseball in her hands and a kickball between her ankles. She played on the soccer teams from the moment she was eligible to join one, and played softball and basketball too. She was even one of the best runners and catchers and tacklers at impromptu games of flag football, a fact that shamed you because it seemed like she was the one getting the flag off you every time you managed to get the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's not the fact of her gender that bothers you, or even the disrespect with which she treated you anytime you were on an athletic field together. (Most of the guys were even worse than her.) It's the impatience and disdain she shows you off the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she doesn't yell at you, or call you names, or push you around. She's not a bully like the Molester. It's the <i>severe lack of interest</i> that she shows in you that rankles\u2014the way she ignores you, or looks through you when she does look in your direction. It's like she thinks you're a bug\u2014a bug that's too trivial and stupid to pay any attention to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she does pay attention to you\u2014like she did at lunch, when she told you to sit down and wait for Jenny to finish copying Carson's homework\u2014she treats you like you're still in the fifth grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut\u2014and this is going to be glorious\u2014Stephanie Wyatt looks up to Coach Schell, even though she never took a class from her. The first semester that Coach Schell taught at Westside, she took part in a JV scrimmage on the team opposing Stephanie's. And she skunked Stephanie hard. Stephanie has been in awe of her ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when you walk into the Dairy Queen at a little before eight\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach!\" a familiar voice calls. You look over. Stephanie, her eyes shining and her mouth split into a huge grin, waves at you. You grin and wave back, even as inwardly you seethe. Stephanie Wyatt has never so much as smiled at you, that you can remember. \"You here on a date?\" she asks as you approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just for a treat. What about you?\" You wink at her. \"A date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face shines, but she doesn't blush. \"No, just meeting friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I keep you company till they come?\" You sit. \"Is this a study night for you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Friend of mine wanted to get together. Talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie rolls her eyes, but her grin doesn't fade. \"How's your classes this semester?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, pretty good. You know I'm coaching the volleyball squad this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Lacey told me. She says it's looking pretty good for them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you talk some more about the volleyball team, and it's chances this year, and the players; and all the time you're fighting the urge to look over your shoulder. <i>Where's Yumi?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you talk, you notice Stephanie losing her exuberance. Indeed, an anxious cast begins to cloud over her face, and her talk grows distracted. She starts to glance over your shoulder at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" you ask. \"Are your friends late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? No. I just\u2014\" Her jaw works, and her gaze goes distant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she straightens up. \"You were asking about guys,\" she says. \"Would you be, uh, willing to give me some advice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression tightens. \"Well, sort of. Indirectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ooh! Girl talk!</i> You and Cathy are both intrigued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you can say \"Yes,\" she rears back and her face turns into a mask. You glance back and see Yumi approaching. She smiles and greets both of you, and sits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chatter that follows is friendly but shallow, and it doesn't take long for you to figure out that Yumi doesn't want to talk in front of you, and the atmosphere turns tense. \"I guess I'll go get my sundae,\" you finally say, and move to a nearby table after getting yourself a small ice cream. You're close enough, though, that you can eavesdrop without being obvious about it as you stare out the window at the passing traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi is asking Stephanie in a very discreet and indirect way about Katy Conlee and what kind of guy she might be interested in. Stephanie is noncommittal until Yumi comes right out and tells her\u2014and this makes you cringe\u2014that Will Prescott might be interested in going out with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prescott?\" says Stephanie, and you stiffen all over at the note of disbelief in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. What do you think?\" Stephanie must have made some kind of face, for Yumi says, \"What's wrong with Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's wrong with Will, I guess. If he asks her out, he asks her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think she'd say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. She'd go out with him at least once, probably.\" Your heart thumps at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she know him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno if she knows him or not. Did he put you up to asking me about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talked to him a little. He noticed Katy at lunch, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. Noticing and doing anything are totally different things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem really skeptical, Stephanie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's kind of a light-weight, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You only just restrain yourself form swinging around and snarling something at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tense all over and listen harder into the silence that follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Yumi says, \"What do you mean by that? Just because he's not a basketball player or a football player\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean like that,\" Stephanie says. \"Look, never mind, he's your friend, if he\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir voices overlap in a babble before clarifying with Yumi saying, \"\u2014not good enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say <i>that,</i>\" Stephanie snaps. \"If he asks her out, that's great, if he makes something of it\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie sighs, deeply. \"Has Will ever had a girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause. Your fingers curls into claws. \"He and Lisa Yarborough were going out together over the summer,\" Yumi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought they were just hanging out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what Will thought and what Lisa thought turned out to be two different things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears redden. Stephanie says, \"Uh huh. Well, if he and Katy are going to go out, they need to be on the same page.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that what 'going out' is supposed to, you know, tell them?\" Yumi asks. \"Tell them if they're\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if it's\u2014 Pfft. Look.\" You can almost picture the look of exasperation on Stephanie's face. \"If Will's never had a serious girlfriend\u2014 Like, what happens if he gets scared, just dumps her and runs away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she that fragile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are you worried about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie sighs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" she says when she resumes, \"when I call him a light-weight, what I mean is, he hasn't got any heft. You know? He just kind of bobs along. I mean, he's a nice guy. One of the nicest. But he's so\u2014 I dunno. <i>Rabbity.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a silence, which gives you plenty of time to notice that your heart is starting to sink toward your knees. Then Yumi says, \"And you think that's a problem. You think Katy\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't think Katy's interested in puppy love. That's all. Can Prescott be more serious than that? What was the problem between him and Lisa, why'd they break up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's another pause before Yumi says, \"It was her idea, not his. <i>He</i> didn't want to break up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he on the rebound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. I think he\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore confused babble of voices. You fight the urge to turn around to see their expressions. You hope they don't see yours. You feel like you're about to throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Yumi says, \"He didn't know what to do with her, that's what happened. Lisa got tired of waiting for him to make it serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Stephanie says \"Uh huh\" as though Yumi has confessed something so obvious that it didn't need to be said. \"Just tell Will not to waste Katy's time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to\u2014!\" But the rest of Yumi's words are lost in more cross-talk, until Stephanie raises her voice to say, \"I just mean, tell him that if he's going to ask her out, he needs to be serious. He can't jerk her around the way he jerked Lisa around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi's voice falls to a mutter, but you think hear her say, \"condoms.\" \"Right, that's what I mean about him being a lightweight,\" Stephanie says. \"Does he know how to act with a girl without being a gink?\" Yumi mutters something else, to which Stephanie replies, \"He should have been learning it two years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've had enough\u2014you've had more than enough\u2014and you're about to get up and leave, but you're arrested by Yumi's next question. \"So who do you think is in Katy's league?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus!\" Stephanie exclaims. \"It's not a matter of being in someone's 'league'. I <i>hate</i> that word. I hate that whole idea. Prescott's totally in her league, if he can figure out how to stand up on his own two feet without falling over. Anybody could be in anybody's league if they just\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could he be in your league?\" The mischief in Yumi's voice is unmistakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If wishes were horses,\" Stephanie retorts. \"But it's like he needs a babysitter more than he needs a girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a really rude thing to say, Stephanie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Katy's senior year, and she\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has <i>she</i> ever had a boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been careful. That's why I'm\u2014 Really, I don't have a problem with Prescott asking her out. It's a free country, and boo-yah for him if he does. But there are freshmen guys at school who are more mature than him.\" Her voice rises, so that it echoes off the hard Formica tables. \"I just don't like to see him wasting her time with a lot of fumbling around. Hell, I don't want to see <i>him</i> hurt or disappointed or whatever because he\u2014! He should have been asking her out when they were sophomores. They'd have been perfect for each other, or something, back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, are you saying it's too late for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Stop putting words in my mouth. I\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother babble of cross-talk. Again, you come real close to leaving\u2014this time in tears. Fucking stupid female hormones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who's your idea of someone for Katy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean who isn't a lightweight?\" A silence ensues; you bite your lip. \"Cameron Huber,\" Stephanie finally says, naming the school's quarterback. You can barely keep back a snort of contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gordon Black?\" Yumi asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>fuck</i> no! I mean, he's no lightweight, but there's guys <i>in between</i> Prescott and Black. That's where most of them are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So give me some names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this, a slumber party all of a sudden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just mean, it would help me figure out what you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine. Austin Dougherty. Jeremiah James. Tyler Rawls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone <i>not</i> on the soccer team? What about Marc?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to think through names, you know, in some kind of order. But Marc, definitely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rivera? Ych. Too much of a player.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cole Parker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lightweight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Everyone I know thinks he's cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he is cute. But he's like Prescott, he doesn't know what to do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nFrom there the talk just turns gossipy as Yumi and Stephanie compile a strange kind of \"who's hot, who's not\" list. You're relieved\u2014somewhat\u2014that Stephanie emphatically rejects the swaggering bully-boys of the school: Gordon Black, Steve Patterson, Jason Lynch, Seth Javits, Erik Carstairs, Brian Kelly, etc., etc. And you're thunderstruck when it includes two names you'd never have guessed would win Stephanie's approval: Carson Ioeger and James Lamont.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure, they're smart, they're going places,\" she says when Yumi also evinces surprise. \"You can't push them around. They got confidence. They've earned it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there the conversation wanders, from mutual guy friends to mutual girl friends, to gossip about the cheerleader squad and the girls' varsity basketball and soccer teams. There's some drama going on with the latter, and they have a pretty intense conversation about Marc Garner and Hannah Westrick, and how long their hot, orgiastic relationship can last before burning out. After about an hour, though, Yumi declares she has to go. There's a note of exhaustion in her voice, and Stephanie also sounds tired, but she remains behind after Yumi's gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let a few minutes pass, during which you duck into the women's restroom to freshen up. Stephanie is still at the table, her head bent over the phone, when you come back out. She does a double-take at you when you speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I hope you don't think I was eavesdropping,\" you tell her, and you force a smile onto your face, \"but that was a pretty intense conversation you were having with your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh.\" Stephanie's expression is very tight, but she scrambles to move her book bag off the table, as though to invite you to sit down. \"Yeah, I guess our voices carried. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the decision? About whether that guy should ask that girl out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie's expression freezes, then falls. \"Oh,\" she says, and looks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were going to ask me something, when I was sitting with you earlier,\" you say. \"Advice about a guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie stares back up at you. Her expression has turned haggard, and she bites her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she shrugs. \"It was nothing. Nothing important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing,\" she repeats, and lunges for her pack. \"I should get home. I'll, uh, see you around, Coach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's almost ten o'clock before you get home, unencumbered of mask and clothes, which you've left in the school basement, where the fire continues to burn. You've brought a new brain band with you, though, and because you're done with your homework you have nothing better to do than to carve runes into it while thinking about what you learned at the Dairy Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're chastened and upset, naturally, by what you overheard, but you've got no one to blame for that except yourself. And what really hurts is that much of what Stephanie said makes a certain amount of sense. You cringe when you recall the word she used\u2014<i>rabbity.</i> But doesn't it fit? You do tend to duck and hide when trouble comes along. You've always been jumpy around girls. Ms. Goretsky once remarked on your \"nervous energy.\" Was she just being polite instead of telling you that you've got a bad case of \"nerves\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no reason you have to pay attention to anything Stephanie says, though. It's not like you <i>have</i> to ask Katy Conlee out. You don't even know her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why are you making this new band? Unless it's so you can borrow someone else's confidence and skill with girls?</span></div></div>",

The next morning, on the way to school, you stop by the basement to drop it off with your other supplies. The fire is <i>still</i> burning, and you grimly wonder if you fucked up the spell and created an unquenchable magic flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're fidgety all morning. Should you talk to Yumi? Wait for Yumi to talk to you? Should you go looking for her\u2014and Katy\u2014in the gym at lunch? You chicken out, though, which leads to a surprise eighth period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's your Astronomy class. Stephanie is in there too\u2014the only class you share with her\u2014and she calls your name and beckons you over just after you sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're getting a study group together tomorrow night,\" she tells you. She doesn't smile at you, but her eyes are bright and friendly. \"I need to bone up in here, wondered if you wanted to join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" you stammer. \"What time? Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Municipal library around eight. Dunno if we'll stay there. You got a curfew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eleven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. We might move over to The Flying Saucer instead, see where we go from there.\" She rubs her nose with the back of her fist. \"How are you doing on the quizzes in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough, I think. Got a B on my last one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing better'n me, we could help each other out.\" Her gaze cools as you stare back at her. \"See you then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Sure.\" Too late you realize you've been dismissed. \"Yeah and, uh, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. For thinking of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunts, and with your face crimsoning you return to your desk. You slump there and chide yourself for being so wrong-footed when you had an idea that something was up. But you were surprised that the set-up came from Stephanie's direction. Maybe her talk with Yumi has shamed her into giving you some kind of chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot until later that night, while absent-mindedly polishing a mask, does it occur to you that you should be thinking about impressing Katy, not Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou wake Wednesday morning to find that Yumi has texted you links to some of Katy's social media presences. There are lots of pictures of her with her basketball teammates, both in and out of uniform: at parties, hanging out in classrooms, sprawling on the grass or perched on some rocks out in the countryside. Katy, with her toothy smile and cheerful squint, is the cutest of the bunch\u2014<i>cute as a bug in a rug,</i> as the old expression goes. But she also seems the least impressive, somehow. She looks like the kid sister hanging out with a more mature crowd, especially when set next to Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any chance of us getting together later?\" Caleb asks you at the start of English. \"Keith's making a video tonight,\" he adds, as though that explains why he's so desperate as to ask <i>you</i> to keep him company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a date,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe does a double-take. \"You? A <i>date?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so weird about that?\" you snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's a study date, actually. Me and some other people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snorts. \"That's not a date, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With some girls, so it is! Stephanie Wyatt asked me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She asked you <i>along,</i>\" he corrects you. \"I could go,\" he adds as a seeming afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one asked you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reddens. \"You saying I'm not welcome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. \"Fine. You can go. We're meeting at Madison at eight. But I'm going for the girls, okay? Not for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe twines his hands behind his head. \"So'm I, Will. So'm I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou think about warning Stephanie that Caleb will be along too, but when you see her you just reiterate that you'll see her at the library. She nods and returns to her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nerves play havoc with your appetite at dinner, so much so that your mom asks if you're feeling alright; you tell her a lie about having had a very late afternoon snack. You get some of your homework done after that, then as seven-thirty approaches you give some thought to the study date coming up. Even though it's been twenty-four hours since you were inside Coach Schell's mask, you must have a little bit of a hangover from those hours inside it, for you find yourself remembering, in a vague sort of way, that she was always impressed when a guy dressed up for even a casual meeting. So you spend almost fifteen minutes changing into and out of various shirts and pants, trying to find a look that seems groomed without being churchy, and casual without being sloppy. You finally settle on a white denim shirt and a clean pair of blue jeans. At your bedroom door, in a kind of spasm, you hurl your sloppy ball cap back onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm meeting some guys at the library,\" you tell your parents as you pass through the living room. \"Study group.\" Your dad only nods, but you feel your mom's eyes on your back. She calls your name when you're almost to the garage, and turn to find her hurrying up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppraisingly, she glances you up and down. \"Who's in this study group?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'M not sure,\" you admit. \"Stephanie Wyatt set it up. She asked me along 'cos we're both in Astronomy, and she needs help in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" She pulls at the lines of your shirt, and you flinch under her fingertips. \"Your haircut looks good,\" she says. \"You could brush it out a little. And shave.\" She scratches her chin meaningfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself blush, and almost demur. You should have told her you were meeting Caleb., then she wouldn't be bothering you this way. But her point's well taken, and you dash upstairs long enough to fluff your hair out a little\u2014you still had hat hair from the day\u2014and to scrape some longish whiskers off your chin and cheekbones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, on a thought, you dash into your bedroom long enough to snatch up the mask you were starting to polish and stuff it into your backpack. You can drop it off at the elementary school on your way to the library, and also check on the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're late getting to the library, and find Caleb loitering in the lobby. \"So who are these girls we're supposed to be meeting?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I 'unno. Stephanie's one of 'em. Girl named Katy Conlee. You know her?\" Your heart beats hard despite your attempted nonchalance. Caleb shakes his head. \"Oh hey.\" You point up to the mezzanine behind the periodical section, where Kristy Suffolk's head is bobbing over the partition. \"I bet they're up there. It's basketball players, most of them, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" Caleb mutters, but he follows you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You waiting here for Stephanie?\" you ask Kristy when you saunter up. She's sitting at a six-person table opposite Meghan Velasquez, a rather horse-faced member of the basketball squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hey,\" Kristy says, and pushes out a chair for you. You hesitate and do a rapid calculation. Six people, three to a side, if you sit next to Kristy, that will put an empty chair on your other flank\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you take it, but Caleb promptly parks himself in the chair you were saving for Katy. You kick him hard under the table. \"Ow,\" he says, but he doesn't move, so you kick him again. \"Quit it,\" he says as he opens his bag. \"Watch where you're putting those boats of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty crowded over here,\" you tell him through gritted teeth. \"Maybe you could leave that chair open until someone else shows up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb stares at you. Then his eyes go wide, and his mouth forms a perfect circle. \"Oh,\" he says. \"Right.\" He moves over to the other side of the table, next to Meghan. \"Mind if I sit next to you?\" he asks her. She smiles\u2014a very friendly, very white thing\u2014and inquires after his health. \"I'll be good as soon as the swelling in my ankle goes down,\" he says, and shoots you a grim look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour quartet all share fourth-period English, so there's that to talk about. You're surprised at how cordial the two girls are. Kristy is rather reserved, but she solicits your opinion on the Virgil that you've been reading in there, and listens with evident interest to your opinion. Meghan is much bubblier, and laughs at every dry quip that Caleb makes at your expense. Inside of five minutes, you're wondering why you and your friend have been hanging aloof in Ms. Gladstone's class instead of sitting with these two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie and Katy arrive not long after. \"Hey Will,\" says Stephanie in a tone that's about a hundred times warmer than you've ever heard her use with you before. \"Glad you made it.\" She drops into the chair next to Caleb, which leaves Katy to sit next to you. You look her up and down as she pulls out the chair and sits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's shorter than you would think likely for a basketball player\u2014even a girl player\u2014though she's far from diminutive. Her face is round and pale, though flushed a little, and her eyes shine brightly as she smiles at you. Close up, she reminds you more of a cherub than a chipmunk. Her cheeks are round and dimpled like apples, and her eyes almost disappear when her face rolls up into a smile. \"Hi, I'm Katy,\" she chirps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Will,\" you say. It feels like your heart is sitting on the back of your tongue. \"Um, that's a big book bag,\" you lamely observe of her satchel, which is bulging so hard it looks like the seams will pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got lots of books,\" she says, and starts to unpack it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that comes out is a hardback library book: <i>The Vodou Spellbook.</i> You catch your breath.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You pick up the book. The dust jacket shows a pile of straw with a skull and a cloth doll propped up next to it. The title, in white letters rimmed with black, is <i>The Vodou Spellbook.</i> \"So what's this?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie snatches it from your hand. \"It's mine,\" she says, and she shoots Katy a hard glance as she shoves the book into her own backpack. \"Katy was borrowing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You into voodoo?\" you blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Research.\" Her attitude, so friendly a moment ago, has turned icy. \"For Halloween. Getting party ideas.\" She darts her eyes about the table. \"So what are we working on first?\" she asks. \"English?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one says anything, and a reek of embarrassment settles on the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So maybe we should split up,\" Stephanie says after the silence has turned awkward. \"Will, we could start with Mr. Cash's class. I definitely need some help in there.\" She hauls up her backpack and with a jerk of her chin gestures you to join her at another table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold feeling washes over you, but you stagger to your feet and follow. A numb spot forms around your heart, and when you glance over your shoulder you see Katy watching you go with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie takes you a couple of tables over, and\u2014intentionally or not\u2014makes you sit with your back to everyone else. She unpacks her books silently, and you follow suit. But the third item you pull from your bag isn't a textbook or a notebook. It's that mask. With a small groan, you remember that you were going to drop it off at the elementary school, and clean forgot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that thing?\" Stephanie's question jerks you back to the present. She nods at the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Erm. Art project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No class. Just a thing I'm working on.\" You start to put it back in your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Stephanie darts out a hand. \"Lemme see,\" she says. And since you've always been so goddamned intimidated by her, you let her take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds it up and studies it with a look of concentration, turning it around and over. \"A mask, huh?\" she says. \"It needs eyeholes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're going to wear it,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else would you do with it? Oh, maybe hang it on a wall? Is it like a wall decoration?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I, uh, haven't decided.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty good work. What's it made out of? You carve it or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I, uh, used a mold. It's got a complicated, uh, recipe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you got like a craft book? What's this?\" She points to a spot on the cheek. \"It's got a blemish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's where I'm polishing it. It's supposed to turn blue when you polish it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like with a stone polisher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what? No, I'm just using a, uh, handkerchief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie gives you a very direct stare. \"You're kidding, right? Is that what that book says to do? Use a handkerchief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an old book.\" You feel yourself blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Well, if it was me, I'd use a stone polisher. Or a car buffer. Does it take a long time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Well, do what you want.\" She hands the mask back to you, and resumes unpacking her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAfter that, it's thirty minutes of reviewing the Ptolemaic, Copernican, and Keplerian models of the solar systems. Stephanie tackles it with a grim intensity, but the air between you thaws as you take turns quizzing each other on the material. She gives you a dirty look\u2014though there's a twinkle in her eye\u2014when you show yourself a better master of it. \"Bastard,\" she mutters, but somehow it sounds like a compliment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you switch off, with Stephanie returning to the table with the girls and Caleb moving over to your table to do some Calculus. But he's more interested in teasing you about Stephanie. \"How's your date with her going?\" he chortles softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a date!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what you told me this afternoon. Didn't you come over here to play footsie with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I don't know why she dragged me over here.\" You glance back at Katy, who seems to be in earnest conversation with Stephanie. You hesitate, but decide not to tell Caleb about the real set-up. \"Except to study for Mr. Cash's class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, she was waiting for you to make a move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another thirty-minute interval, the girls call you back to their table, but only briefly. \"We're moving over to The Flying Saucer,\" Stephanie tells you. \"It's boring here. Will, can you take someone? We're going to carpool over, I'll take everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Um.\" You freeze under Stephanie's unwinking stare, feeling like a bird that's been hypnotized by a snake. Your throat tightens and your voice turns very thick. \"I'll, uh, take ... Katy?\" You wrench your eyes from Stephanie. \"I think Caleb wants\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool,\" Stephanie says. \"Meet you over there.\" She swings her pack onto her shoulder and turns away. Meghan and Kristy follow, and Caleb saunters along too. He shoots you a mirthful glance over his shoulder, and you feel yourself blushing to your roots. Your knees are locked, and your feet feel bolted to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you stammer out to Katy. \"I've got a truck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll get us there,\" she says. You notice that her complexion is now more pink than peach. \"You like The Flying Saucer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. They're all okay. They're all kooky. Except for Starbucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starbucks is boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like occult stuff? Is that why you had a voodoo book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Stephanie's.\" Katy ducks her chin, and her eyes dart about. \"I'm not supposed to talk to you about that,\" she says with an embarrassed grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that what she told you?\" You can't help grinning back at her. \"She doesn't want you spoiling some Halloween prank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\" She turns even more pink. \"We should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall in next to her. You're tempted to link your arm with hers, but you restrain yourself as, side by side, you walk out he lobby to the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't share any classes with Katy, so you inquire about her schedule and tell her about yours. Except for her AP English class, her schedule seems even lighter than yours: a junior-level Physics class, a French-for-Reading-Knowledge class, and a basic government class. But she's also taking Plants and Soils. \"On account of my parents,\" she says. \"Can you tell I'm wrinkling my nose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's dark in the cab of your truck, so you can't. \"You don't like it? Do you live on a farm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practically. We own a nursery south of town. CC Nursery and Landscaping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know where that is! I was out there just a few days ago, bought some, uh\u2014\" Too late you restrain yourself. \"Potting soil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do you have a green thumb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly. It was, uh, for my mom. An errand.\" Actually, it was for that spell you've left burning in the elementary school basement. \"So, do <i>you</i> have a green thumb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But my dad still keeps trying to hire me on there. He doesn't want it to be 'chores', he says, so he won't make me. But he really wants me to learn the business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's just like my dad,\" you exclaim. \"Except he doesn't own the place he works, but he keeps pestering me to take a job there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's like a bolt of electricity has gone shooting across the dark cab, and you dart a glance over at Katy. By the dim street lamps and headlights of the traffic, you see that she's grinning back at you. Talking quickly, sometimes at the same time, you commiserate about hectoring parents and their expectations. You're chatting like long-time friends by the time you enter The Flying Saucer, and hardly even notice the amused glances that you get as you join the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no question of \"studying\" anymore, and you all sit around the table with coffees, talking and laughing. You are vaguely aware that Caleb has muted his usual honk, but you're too busy telling Katy about your \"Film as Literature\" class to pay too much attention to the rest of the table. She asks if you've watched any horror movies in there. \"I like horror movies,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's lying,\" Stephanie interjects with a sharp smile\u2014one of the few times at the Saucer that she says anything to you. \"She's just telling you that 'cos she figures you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it's a fun time until the Saucer closes, when you give Katy a ride back to the library. \"I think your friend kind of hit it off with Meghan,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who, Caleb? I didn't notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe titters. \"We should all get together to study there more often.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean at a coffee shop? Or that place?\" One thought leads to another, and you think of that voodoo book. \"You like weird things, like that voodoo book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, that's Stephanie's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't picture <i>her</i> being into voodoo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not supposed to tell you about it, but it's for a prank. You know Hannah Westrick? She's on the soccer team? She's dating Marc Garner?\" Her tone grows more exasperated with each shake of your head. \"Anyway, we're going to prank her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Cos no one likes her. Well, Marc does. Lots of guys like her, I guess, on account of she's, well\u2014\" Katy breaks off. \"Anyway, Stephanie and some of her friends from the soccer team are going to get back at her. Scare her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty relates a vague story of jealousy and wrong-doing. Hannah Westrick came over from Eastman, joined the soccer team, and has been causing problems ever since. This prank is to teach her to know her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're using voodoo on her?\" Your skin prickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not <i>real</i> voodoo on her, 'cos voodoo's not <i>real.</i> Except, maybe, psychologically. But it's creepy, and we want to creep her out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vote on where the story goes next:</b></span></div></div>",

To your delight, the basement is dark, and you have to fumble your way around until you find the flashlight. Is the spell done? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you set a flame to the pile of dirt, purple flames bloom off it again. You grimace with disappointment, and after staring at it for a few minutes, lock it up for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"So are you and Katy going out now?\" Caleb asks you the next morning in Walberg's class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you. No. I dunno. Are you and Meghan going out now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb makes a face but his ears turn red, which tells you that you've scored a hit. \"Are you going to have lunch with Katy?\" he asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Should I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! So <i>are</i> going out with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I told you, I don't know!\" You rub your forehead: this is something you've been worrying about. \"I don't know how to handle this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are interested in her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I guess.\" You notice that your leg is jogging up and down like a jack hammer, and you still it. \"How should I handle it with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snorts. \"How about you just try doing the opposite of everything you did with Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you make a face at him, then glance over your shoulder at your ex- while discreetly flipping your best friend off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could go looking for Katy at the break, but instead you look for Yumi to ask her advice. \"Where are you having lunch?\" you ask her. \"Are you eating with Katy and them? Should I show up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi stares at you, then breaks out in a grin. \"So you had a good time last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" you pant. \"But I dunno what to do next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, look, never mind lunch. Go look for her at her locker, see if she wants to see a movie or something on Friday. If you're really interested in getting to know her better, that is. Are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. \"Sure. But what about lunch? We really hit off, her and me! Shouldn't\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget lunch. I'll bring her around to eat with you guys tomorrow, that'll be soon enough. Oh, and Will\u2014\" She gives you a pitying look. \"Try to cut down on the caffeine between now and then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBut you do wind up eating lunch with Katy. You and Caleb, on your way out to eat next to the Agricultural Annex, bump into her and Stephanie as they come in from there. Stephanie continues on\u2014though with a cheerful smile at you and Caleb; yet another first in your experience\u2014but Katy lights up at the suggestion that she eat with the you. Caleb, after hanging back, announces he's got stuff to talk about with Carson and James, and trudges off; you don't know what's happened to Keith, who is your usual third at lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it's just you and Katy, taking lunch together on the grass behind the school. There's a little talk at the start, a shy, gushing recapitulation of last night's conversations. Talk about how much fun it was, and how you should all do it more often. About parents and their expectations. About the classes you've had so far and the classes to come. You're feeling desperately short of topics when you remember Yumi's suggestion about asking her out to see a movie. You check show times on your phone and find that a new horror picture will be opening on Friday: <i>Cravenmoor.</i> \"That sounds great,\" Katy says. \"I'd love to see it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you actually like horror movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Cos Stephanie said that you don't, that you\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stephanie can go, uh, suck on an egg,\" Katy says. She blushes deeply. \"I do like them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers. \"Oh, right, because you and her and all your friends are into voodoo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're <i>not</i> into it!\" She blushes harder. \"We're just looking for, like, Halloween ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To scare this Hannah girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Right, I told you about that. But that doesn't mean we're into voodoo. It's like putting peanut butter in her hairbrush, something like that. Only creepier.\" She giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know yet, not for sure. Or maybe we are. Stephanie and Anita are in charge of it, they don't tell me much.\" Her brow crinkles. \"Why are you so interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just interested in what you're doing. Would you hit her with a hex for real? If voodoo was real?\" After your experiences with that grimoire, you're no longer sure that it isn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, I don't know. I don't think we'd want to <i>hurt</i> her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You don't? How well do you know Stephanie?</i> you want to ask her. <i>Because if this Hannah girl has pissed off Stephanie, then I think </i>hurting<i> is definitely on the table.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Katy more or less confirms your cynical take when she adds, \"If we wanted to hurt her, we wouldn't be using voodoo. You know, Stephanie wanted to get her drunk\u2014Hannah, I mean\u2014and put her with one of the football players.\" She leans in close. \"Hannah is a <i>total slut</i>,\" she whispers, \"if you put as much as a wine cooler in her.\" She leans back and nods primly and knowingly. \"Stephanie wanted to set it up so she'd wind up making out with some jerk, really screw things up between her and Marc. But Anita told her we couldn't go <i>that</i> far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall onto your side and prop your head in your hand. Katy\u2014with her chipmunk cheeks, her dimples, her peaches-and-cream complexion; her shy, twinkling gaze\u2014does <i>not</i> seem like the kind of girl to act on a grudge, and you rather suspect that she's being swept along in a mob-like frenzy by her friends. \"Mostly,\" she says, continuing, \"I think everyone would just be happy if Hannah quit the soccer team. Or got forced off it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she's so bossy?\" That's the word Katy had used last night. \"But you're on the basketball team, what do you care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty seems to catch her breath, and her eyes widen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it doesn't bother <i>me,</i>\" she says. \"But it bothers Anita and some of the other girls. Because Anita is team captain, and Hannah thinks that <i>she\u2014</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's because you're friends with Anita, that's how come you don't like Hanna?.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure.\" The air seems to be leaking out Katy. \"And I mean, it's not that I don't like her. I hardly know her. But Stephanie and Anita\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't want to push her too hard, so you nod and change the subject to talk about Caleb, and just how well he got along with Meghan last night. She's brightens again at that topic, and tells you that Meghan thought Caleb was really funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou haven't forgotten about the fire; nor have you forgotten that offhand comment that Stephanie made, about using some kind of mechanical polisher on the masks. When you get home after school, you search the garage and are rewarded with a car buffer, still in its box. After telling your mom that you're going to meet up with Caleb but that you'll be back for supper, you sneak it out to your truck and drive over to the elementary school. You find that the fire has gone out again, but with a flick of the lighter you relight it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cursory search discloses a power outlet on the wall near the stairs, and you plug in the buffer. With the base locked between your knees, you crouch on a table and run the mask over the floppy cloth head. It takes longer to polish than you'd like, but much less time than the first mask took: forty-five minutes. You're in a cheerful mood when you return home, so cheerful that you don't even get in a fight with your brother at the dinner table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got thoughts about masks in the back of your mind all evening, even as you try to concentrate on your homework. You now have another mask and brain band combination, and the prospect of being able to make at least one more such combo a night until you run out of materials. You have no idea what plans Stephanie and her friends have for Hannah, but you bet you could use the masks to make trouble for Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why would you do that?  In the first place, this isn't your fight. You don't even know who this Hannah girl is. In the second place, even if you did make trouble for her, how would Stephanie and Katy and them know that you're responsible for it? They don't believe in magic, so they wouldn't believe you if you told them you'd put some kind of a hex on Hannah. And in the third place, you're not sure what kind of a thing you could do to Hannah with the masks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you do have some vague ideas, based on the kind of misadventures you've already had. You used Coach Schell's mask to borrow money off one of her friends: If you disguised yourself as Hannah, you could probably make trouble for Hannah in some way. Maybe like Katy said Stephanie wanted to do, by going out and getting drunk as her and making out with a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr could you use Coach Schell's mask in some way? Maybe barge into one of her classes while disguised at the coach, and yell at her or humiliate her in some way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty said they want Hannah off the squad. What if you got a copy of the soccer coach\u2014not that you know who that is\u2014and used that disguise to somehow scare Hannah off the team?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter noodling around with these ideas, though, you have to return to the main problem: Convincing Stephanie and her friends that you're helping them out. You can see only two ways of doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne is by making yourself part of their conspiracy, and using the masks to make sure they succeed. The other, though, is by telling them\u2014or Stephanie, at least\u2014about the masks and the grimoire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe you can just use the masks to trip up Hannah yourself, and watch what comes next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day\u2014Friday\u2014is electric with anxiety. Not for academic reasons. There are no quizzes or tests or projects to worry you. But the air seems charged, and your brain prickles with static. Every hour or so a spasm runs through you, as though a small, hot spark has discharged at the base of your skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friends notice. \"What are you being a spazz for?\" Tilley asks you in second period. \"Oh, right.\" He lifts his nose to smirk down at you. \"You gotta date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a date!\" you protest. \"I'm just seeing a movie is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With someone. I hear she's got a name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katy Conlee,\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Keith bobs his head. \"She's cute.\" He puts his fist out for a bump. You brush his knuckles with yours, then look away. \"You'll do fine,\" Keith says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just seeing a movie with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you spazzing out?\" A lazy grin spreads over his face. \"Is she spazzing out about it too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour throat and tongue seem to have seized up, so you just jerk your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIf Katy is spazzing out, she doesn't show it when you cross paths with her after fourth. You have another one of those spasms, though, when Stephanie, who is with her, jerks her chin at you with a faint smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna eat lunch with us again?\" you ask Katy in a rush, and ignore the double-take that Caleb gives you. This time he <i>doesn't</i> go off to leave you alone with Katy, and Keith joins you too. You fancy you keep up your end of the conversation, though the time mostly passes with Keith and Caleb getting to know Katy better. Before you part, though, you reiterate that you'll pick her up that evening for the seven-thirty showing of <i>Cravenmoor.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the most \"electric\" moments of the day come during eighth period. You give Stephanie a sidelong look as you shuffle into the classroom and continue to dart her looks before class begins. She's too absorbed in her cell phone to notice, though you'd think the little thunderclaps that seem to be going off inside your skull would get her attention. Dimly, you wonder if you're having a series of micro-strokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gullet and guts grow colder and colder as class unfolds, until they feel completely frozen by the time the bell rings. Your knees don't want to unbend, and they creak when you stand. Slowly you look around to see if Stephanie has left yet. It would be a relief if she has. But she's still at her desk, tapping at her phone with a look of concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glances up\u2014her countenance is friendly\u2014when you shuffle over to her. \"Hey, you going to see a movie with Katy tonight, huh?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Your voice is a croak. \"Um. If you're not busy this afternoon, there's something I'd like to talk to you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Her brow furrows. \"Not about Katy, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Well, not exactly. Actually, um, it's something I want to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of faint alarm comes into her eyes. \"Uh huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around, to see that the room is rapidly emptying, then fall into the seat directly in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" you say in a low voice. \"Katy told me about that voodoo thing you guys are doing. With that girl Hannah.\" Stephanie's eyes freeze, and your heart climbs up into your throat. \"It's something kind of related to that. Not to Hannah, not to her,\" you hurriedly add. \"It's\u2014 Well, you had that voodoo book, and it got me thinking\u2014 So I found this book at Arnholm's the other day. It's like an authentic magical grimoire, really old, got magic spells in it. I thought, if you're interested in using voodoo against that girl, you might want to take a look at it? For ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the expression has drained from Stephanie's face, so that she's staring at you with a look of blank intensity. Then she blinks once, draws a short breath, and smiles. \"Sure,\" she says. \"Bring it in next week, I'll have a look at it\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you come look at it this afternoon?\" you blurt out. \"I mean, I guess next week would be fine, too. But I've got some stuff that I made with it, you could look at those things and it at the same time. You know that mask I showed you at the library the other night?\" you add as Stephanie cocks her head. \"That's something I made with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Well, sure, I got time. What time are you picking Katy up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around seven. If you want to meet me where I keep the stuff, there's an old elementary school in Acheson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The community center? I know where that is.\" She agrees to rendezvous with you there in thirty minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're not sure why you've decided to let Stephanie in on this secret. She's no friend of yours, and you haven't even told Caleb and Keith, who are your friends. The only thing you can figure, as you mentally pull and twist at the question on the drive back into Acheson, is that you want to impress her. There's a good chance you'll be part of her social circle soon, if this relationship with Katy works out. You wonder if you're making her a kind of offering: <i>See,</i> you seem to be telling her, <i>I'm worth knowing, worth hanging out with. I've got stuff to offer.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least now you know why you were freaking out all day. It wasn't on account of the upcoming date with Katy, though that does give you a fluttery feeling in your stomach. It's because subconsciously you knew what you were going to say to Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou beat her to the elementary school by about ten minutes, and she looks past you at it after dismounting from her SUV. Her expression is unreadable\u2014she's wearing sunglasses\u2014but you're struck suddenly by healthy she looks. She's a polished, golden bronze all over, from her bobbed blonde hair to her late summertime tan. Her legs and arms are smooth and strong, and bigger and more muscular than yours. And though you feel yourself hunching slightly in her presence, she has her shoulders back and her chin up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I don't get it,\" she says, and she frowns behind her sunglasses. \"You're keeping that stuff here? Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The basement.\" You gesture her to follow you down the steps, and as you undo the lock and lead her in you give her a summary of your history with it. \"So, I think they've totally forgotten about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" Stephanie says as she looks around the dark and dusty room. \"You got guts, making this place your hideawy.\" She pulls off her sunglasses and wrinkles her nose at the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that the fire has gone out again, but you ignore it for the moment. \"Here's that book.\" You pull it from its lonely spot on a bookshelf and hand it to her. \"It's all in Latin,\" you continue as she opens it. \"I've made a couple of things from it, like that mask I showed you. Oh, and I took your advice on using a polisher.\" You hold up the mask you made last night, and she gives it a brief glance. \"Got it done real fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what kind of things can you do with this. Besides make those mask things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've only got a few spells into the book, because it does this funny thing with the pages. Here, I'll show you.\" She hangs onto the book as you flip the pages one by one. \"I did this spell, and this one, and this one. Now I'm working on this one.\" You point to the pile of dirt. \"That's the, uh, experiment over there. But I'm not done yet. So see?\" You pull at the corner of the page. \"It won't turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Stephanie says as she pulls at the corner. \"Is it glued down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Well, yes, but magically. All the pages were like that before I did the spell. See, it's like the page is locked down. Then you do the spell. Then the page turns loose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie gives you a faint smile from under her lowered brows. At least she's amused, rather than contemptuous, of your story. But her skepticism provokes you into making the final throw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is something I made,\" you tell her as you pull out the one finished mask you have. \"I, uh\u2014 Well, never mind how it worked out this way. But I made this. It's of Coach Schell.\" You hand her the mask, inner face up, so that the coach's name shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie's face drains of all emotion as she takes it, and her eye has turned flinty when she looks back up at it you. But she is clearly curious, for she rubs her fingertip over the surface, where the letters of the coach's name seem to float. \"So what is it supposed to do?\" she says in a cold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a disguise. A mask of the coach. You put it on your face and it\u2014\" Sweat breaks out all over you. \"You should just try it out and see. That's the easiest way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie gives you a hard look. Then she shrugs and puts the mask to her face. She wobbles briefly, and you catch her as she topples forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Coach Schell who you lower onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou leave her there, and go outside to wait. You wish you smoked. You're nervous, and a cigarette would pass the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fifteen minutes pass with no sign of Stephanie, you creep back down the stairs to check on her. You open the door\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA figure at the other end of the basement whirls. It's Coach Schell, but she's in Stephanie's clothes. She's standing in front of the old mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says nothing. Finally, you croak out, \"So, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tense moment passes. Then Stephanie says, \"Okay, first of all, we don't tell <i>anyone</i> about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one? Not even Katy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one. Have you told any of your friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might be fun, having a secret that's just yours and Stephanie's. But she's awfully bossy. Maybe you <i>should</i> tell some others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vote on where the story goes next:</b> {item: }</span></div></div>",

They had it marked for, like, two hundred dollars. But I got it for cheap because, like I showed you, it was like all the pages were glued shut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie barrels past you, and you get a frisson as her skin brushes yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snatches up the book and flips rapidly through the first few pages, frowns at the one that's stuck shut, and grimaces as her thumbnail can't pry any of the subsequent ones open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you tell her over her shoulder. \"At first not even the first page would open. But then I, uh, gave it some blood\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wheels on you, and you snap your own mouth shut. But then she just says, \"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I, uh, cut my thumb and squeezed out some blood and put it on this sigil thing on the front page. Here.\" You flip the book back to the first page, and show her the brownish stain. \"After that it turned loose, and I did the first spell. It, uh, made that mask you're wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the first recipe makes a mask that makes you look like Coach Schell?\" Stephanie demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It's more complicated than that. First, you\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me,\" Stephanie says, and there's iron in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSo you spend the next hour going through each spell, step by step. You don't complete all of them, naturally\u2014you're short on both time and materials. But you describe how to make a mask and a brain band. You show her the tubs of sealant and glue, and describe their uses. You tell her about fetching the dirt from the graveyard for the spell you have going now, and you relight it and show her how the purple flames that flare off it have no heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd\u2014much more embarrassing\u2014you describe how you got a copy of Coach Schell into the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to finish each spell, see what comes next,\" you explain, and you hate the desperate embarrassment that even you can hear in your voice. \"And, you know, I didn't set out to copy Coach Schell. She was just convenient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't tell Stephanie about sneaking into Coach Schell's house and taking some of her clothes, or getting money off her friends, or how you copied Yumi's mind into a brain band and then used the Coach Schell disguise to eavesdrop at the Dairy Queen. Fortunately, Stephanie doesn't press for any details that would force you to confess any of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does draw one really mortifying confession from you. \"So these bands,\" she says while fingering . \"They copy memories? And you got a copy of Coach Schell's memories? Here in this mask?\" You nod in answer to each of these questions. \"So, shouldn't I have her memories now? Shouldn't I be able to remember things that she could remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Your heart skips a beat. \"Don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head. \"Am I supposed to concentrate or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It should come naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" Her tone is sharp. \"You tried them out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" As soon as you say it, you feel yourself turning black with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie gives you a look, but she doesn't look angry or scandalized. \"So like what sorts of things should I be remembering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, everything. Where she lives, where she goes to the gym. Her classes. Her, uh, boyfriend.\" You stare closely at Stephanie, whose gaze has gone distant. \"Getting anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. What's her boyfriend's name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember. The memories don't stay with you long after you take the mask off. He's a Hispanic guy, I know that. He's one of the tutors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, him,\" Stephanie says, then she blinks. \"Really? Does everyone know it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the staff does. I don't remember it being a secret thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. 'Cos I'm not getting anything. I mean, I know who you're talking about, but I don't remember anything ...\" She trails off, and again her gaze goes unfocused. \"No,\" she says with a sigh. \"Nothing. Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty sure. But the, uh, the mask itself works fine.\" You look her up and down. She does look good, especially in Stephanie's clothes, which expose her legs from high on the thigh all the way down to her ankles. \"But maybe I should take it off you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you better,\" Stephanie agrees, and at your direction she lays back on one of the tables. Her eyes flutter as you lay your hand across her brow. You grip her forehead, mutter some nonsensical syllables, and pull. The mask comes away in your hand, leaving the unconscious Stephanie behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her another good lookover, and wonder what exactly you've gotten yourself into by sharing all this with her, then trudge up the stairs and outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's closing on dinnertime, and you've a date after that, so you and Stephanie part thereafter. She impresses upon you again the need for secrecy, and says that she'll want to talk to tomorrow. \"Early,\" she says, which makes your heart sink a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've not much appetite at the dinner table, but no one expects you to have one on account of your going to the show. Afterward, you change into fresh jeans and a shirt and shoot Katy a text telling her you're on your way. It's a pleasant drive up to the Silverplex Cinema, though you feel yourself distracted. You're more pleasantly distracted during the movie by the way Katy keeps grabbing you at tense moments, so that you're nicely aroused by the time the movie is over, and you come real close to leaning over and nuzzling her while end credits crawl, but restrain yourself. Afterward you drive down to The Flying Saucer for a post-cinema snack and to talk about the movie, and other scary movies that you've seen. You part by telling her you'll text her after church on Sunday, to see about getting together to do something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a point of telling all this to Stephanie when she texts you later that night to inform you that you'll be meeting at The Shed, a cafe in the tiny Acheson business district, but she only texts back an <i>ok.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's waiting out front the next morning when you arrive, and she gives you a look as you get out of your truck. \"You drove?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. How did you get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I jogged,\" she says. (But she looks pretty fresh.) \"You don't live that far, Will,\" she reminds you, for you'd given her your address last night. You grimace at her back as she leads you inside. It's an old-fashioned cafe, the kind with a bar at the front with stools, but you settle into a booth in the farthest corner you can muster. Stephanie leans over the tabletop to address you in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I told you last night not to tell anyone about this,\" she says, \"and I'm serious. Totally serious. I mean, my God, can you imagine what people could do with that book? Who'd be interested in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the CIA?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind the CIA. Think of terrorists. Criminal gangs. The kind of illegal shit you could get up to with it is\u2014\" She gives you a sharp look. \"What were <i>you</i> planning to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself pale. \"Nothing! I mean, I hadn't even thought about it. I'm just, you know, curious about what all you can\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Will,\" she says softly. \"Well, anyway, don't tell <i>anyone.</i> Let's just keep this between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, then blurt out, \"What do <i>you</i> want to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rears back like she's been slapped. \"I don't know! I mean, I'm just thinking how we can't let anyone know about it. That's the most\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breaks off and licks her lips. \"So one thing is,\" she says when she resumes, \"is you don't do any more, like\u2014 You don't go <i>ambushing</i> people like Coach Schell anymore. Okay? I mean, Christ, what if you'd got caught?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if the next spell needs us to? Are you saying we can't?\" You feel your heart sinking, for it sounds like Stephanie is going to try to take the book away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can finish up the one you've got going. Any idea how long it's supposed to take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"But as far as doing stuff with the book\u2014 Look, I thought you wanted to use voodoo against Hannah. So I thought you'd want to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" she breathes, and turns pale. She looks away, and her jaw works. You hold your breath. \"Well, like what?\" she says at last. \"Are you saying you've got ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Katy told me you had an idea about getting Hannah drunk, and getting her to make out with someone not her boyfriend. Maybe instead you could, uh, copy Hannah in a mask, then disguise yourself as her and go out in public and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie rears back. But it's like your tongue has a mind of its own, and another suggestion bubbles out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you could gaslight her,\" you say. \"Pretend to be some of her friends, get in fights with her, then they think she's crazy when she calls them on it afterward. Or, you want her to quit the soccer team? Pretend to be the soccer coach, yell at her, get her mad so she quits\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" she says again. She's very pale\u2014haggard, even\u2014and breathing hard. You clap your mouth shut. The moment hangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" she says at last. \"You're the one seems pretty bullish on doing any of these tricks. You wanna do one, fine. I won't stop you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't tell from her tone whether she's disgusted and wants you to recant your suggestions, or whether she wants you to do them and is afraid to say so.</span></div></div>",

But we have to move out of where you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're even less happy when she tells you her proposed hideout is next to Argosy Furniture, which is practically in the middle of the downtown district, and that it would be hard getting in and out of it outside of business hours. But you agree to look it over, and you also agree to move the stuff out of the elementary school and into your truck at least until you can settle on a new spot. On the drive out to the school after breakfast, you tease her on your foresight bringing your truck to The Shed to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe fire is out again, but you ignore the moldering pile of dirt for the moment to concentrate on gathering everything else up. It makes for a jumbled heap: bags and canisters and boxes of chemicals and soils along with the grimoire, the masks, and the containers of sealant and glue. But after transferring all that to the bed your truck, Stephanie crooks a finger at the dirt pile. \"What about that? Think we can move it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? Move the table it's on? The dirt by itself is four hundred pounds, and I don't want to risk messing it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we could start over again?\" Stephanie rubs her nose. \"How long has it been cooking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A week. I don't want to get more dirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie grimaces. \"Thing is, it already looks ruined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give it a hard look of your own. It has changed, and not in a way that suggests it's been improved. The berm has tightened up into a solid, log-like cylinder and acquired a grayish hue; in fact, it now looks more like a concrete support that's been laid on its side. But it is split up the middle at one end, and two other rents have opened farther up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not willing to give up on it yet, though. \"Let's just burn it until it won't burn anymore,\" you say. \"Then we can start over if it's fucked up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie shrugs. You fetch the lighter from the truck, where you'd already packed it, and set a flame to its center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happens. You set the flame lower, and when it doesn't catch, you wave it about, trying to find a spot where the fuel is still damp. Still nothing happens. You glance back at Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme see,\" she says, and takes the lighter from you. She can't get it to fire up either. \"Do you think it's done?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know how we can find out.\" You fetch the book from the truck and hold your breath as you pull at the corner of the last open page. But it doesn't come away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" Again, Stephanie has to make a go of it herself, also without success. She makes a face\u2014showing her teeth\u2014at the book and at the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, lemme try something.\" You take the book back from her and rest it briefly open-face down atop the solidified dirt pile. When you flip it back over, the troublesome page easily flips over. \"You just gotta show it who's boss,\" you tell Stephanie with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great,\" she says, \"but what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run a finger down the newly revealed text. \"This should tell us what it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you read Latin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but that's what an online translator is for. Get out your phone and I'll dictate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBut Stephanie turns out to be all thumbs at typing messages in, so you wind up doing it all yourself while she looks over your shoulder. Word by word, phrase by phrase, it emerges. You have to read it through a couple of times in order to fix the translation so that it makes sense. But when you're done, Stephanie stands back on her heels with wide, staring eyes. \"That can't be right,\" she insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's what it says. And there's only one way to find out.\" You heart is beating hard with anticipation. \"We'll use Coach Schell's mask. Go get it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Stephanie looks too ill to move, so you make a third trip up to your truck. When you're back, Stephanie scuttles away to give you room to hazard the experiment. You sidle up to one end of the thing\u2014the end with the onion-like blob, that looks sort of like a head, you now realize, same as the tear up the middle has created what look like legs, and the rents up the sides have separated out two rude arms\u2014and place the mask on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what will happen; the spell tells you what will happen, despite Stephanie's doubts that you've translated correctly. But it's still a shock when the mask and the thing you made vanish, and Coach Schell appears there in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a perfect replica of her: The upturned face is a little hard to make out on account of the angle you're looking at her from. But the flowing blonde hair; the curves of the shoulder and the bosom; the inward swoop of her stomach and the swelling of her hips; the strong thighs and calves; and the pert feet\u2014it's all as you remember her being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's an even greater shock when she frowns and opens her eyes. She looks over at you, does a little double take, and gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you think it's like a ventriloquist's trick: the coach's lips didn't move when she said your name. Then you realize it was Stephanie. A hand falls on your shoulder and wrenches you around. Stephanie's green eyes are shining hard and her lip is curled back in a slight snarl. \"Maybe you better go wait upstairs,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Upstairs?</i> You gape. Stephanie is trying to throw you out because the fake Coach Schell is <i>naked?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, she's <i>my</i> lackey!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's no one's\u2014! At least turn around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already seen what she looks like, Stephanie! Remember, I told you yesterday that I put the mask on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was\u2014! That was\u2014!\" She stammers and falls silent. Her eyes blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind you, a plaintive voice wails, \"What the hell is going on? Stephanie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie pales. You whirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fake coach is sitting up and covering herself as best she can with her arms and hands and legs. \"What's going on?\" she asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" you demand. It's a stupid thing to ask, but you're stuck for a test question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cathy Schell,\" she says. \"Stephanie, who is\u2014? Where are\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you teach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer frown deepens. \"Westside High. What's with all the\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice is drowned out by Stephanie's and then your own as you all start talking at once. You cut the coach off with a sharp, \"Be quiet,\" then round on Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we have to test it out,\" you tell her. \"To be sure it's doing what it's supposed to do, and how far we can, uh\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far?\" Stephanie echoes. Her voice rises. \"What the fuck are you planning to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! I don't know! It's supposed to be a lackey! That's what the book says!\" You point at the grimoire. \"Put a mask on it, and it turns into the image of the one in the mask and a lackey of the one who made it. Well, it sure looks like Coach Schell, but we should make sure that it's got the lackey part too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is sick,\" Stephanie snarls. \"Look at her! It's practically her! It's not a\u2014 a robot or whatever you thought it was going to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just test it out, okay? Then we'll take the mask off it if it's creeping you out so bad. I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie's mouth spreads into a sharp, wide rictus, but she says nothing. You turn back to the coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly you're at a loss for ideas. \"What should I tell her to do?\" you ask Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up,\" Stephanie orders the coach. But she only stares back with a terrified expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you say, \"Stand up,\" the coach lurches to her feet, her hands flapping to cover her private parts. \"Jesus,\" Stephanie gasps. \"We need to get her some clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll call that enough,\" you assure her. \"Sit back down,\" you tell the thing. \"Lay back down.\" The thing complies, and its terror seems to increase. But the emotion vanishes\u2014along with the face itself\u2014when you lay your hand on its forehead and rip the mask off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie collapses against a table. \"This is <i>really</i> creepy,\" she says in a quavering voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool,\" you say. \"Don't you see what we can do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of lots of sick things <i>you</i> could do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's sick things you could do with it too,\" you blurt out. Stephanie turns a bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" you continue. \"I showed you this stuff 'cos I want us to be friends. I'll let you do something with it, if you let me do something with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vote on where the story goes next:</b></span></div></div>",

That's not something you'd thought of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" she says, \"if you miss out on school, you'll be confused when you go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lackey will tell you what you missed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the same thing, Will. What if something important happens and it forgets to tell you?\" She puts a hand on her hip and gives you a very direct stare. \"And school's not that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not for you,\" you blurt back. \"Do you get hassled in the hallways by assholes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her mouth to reply, then closes it with a snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I bet you don't,\" you continue, and your neck gets hot. \"Maybe you have guys hitting on you, I bet you've got <i>that,</i> but you don't have guys pushing you around or hauling you outside or\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" says Stephanie. \"Who does that to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Molester.

Lester the Molester. <i>Mo-Lester,</i>\" you repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie bursts out laughing. \"That's good,\" she says, \"but\u2014\" She catches herself, and looks you up and down. Her expression tightens. \"Look, I'm sorry you get bullied, but even if you skipped, what would you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang out someplace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not an answer, Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me try it out! We made the damn thing, we should get at least <i>some</i> use out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. You made it, it's your thing. But for now we need to get the stuff moved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lackey's too heavy to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie stares down at it, then looks back up at you with a smile you don't like. \"Go home and get some clothes,\" she tells you. \"Shorts, t-shirt and flip-flops will be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"I told you the thing-a-fuckie would come in handy,\" Will Prescott brags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you didn't,\" you retort. \"I\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was talking to me, Will,\" Stephanie says. \"Weren't you, Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight,\" your doppelganger replies. \"And wasn't I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure showed me,\" Stephanie agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, both of you,\" you growl. \"Concentrate on the road,\" you order the thing that's driving your truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought it was pretty cool at first, when the thing came to life again, only with your face instead of Coach Schell's. It took a couple of hours to get it set up, though, as you'd explained to Stephanie when she told you her plan for moving the lackey. You had a blank mask you could use on yourself, but you had to carve a set of runes into another brain band. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you did that at your house, she used your truck to drive the other stuff out to her dad's store. A little after lunch you met her at the school again with the makings of a complete \"Will Prescott\" disguise\u2014mask, brain band, and clothes\u2014and put them on the lackey. There was a little confusion at first, as the thing upon waking was convinced it was you and that you were it, but it only took a little argument, and the demonstration that he had to follow your orders while you didn't have to follow its, to straighten things out. It pleased you immensely at first as Lackey-Will unhappily did jumping jacks while you gloated <i>Make me</i> when it tried to order you to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Stephanie started taking its side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with the clothes. You ordered it to get into the cheap shorts and shirt you'd brought for it, but Stephanie stopped you. \"You put them on,\" she said. \"Give him the clothes you got on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you want it to <i>be</i> you, right? So give it\u2014him\u2014your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour doppelganger grinned as you buckled under and started stripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen when you demanded the keys from him\u2014they were in the pockets of the jeans he was now wearing\u2014Stephanie insisted that <i>he</i> should drive your truck if <i>he</i> was going to be you. And when Lackey-Will pointed out that it would look weird to see two Will Prescotts in the cab of his truck, Stephanie tried to force you to ride in the back under the tarp before grudgingly allowing you to crouch down in the passenger-side foot well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after you reach your destination, Stephanie tells you to stay in the car while she takes \"Will\" inside, leaving you to fume. It's fifteen minutes before she returns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArgosy Furniture is a giant second-hand furniture store occupying most of a city block in downtown Saratoga Falls. It's a three-story building of weathered brick that's a hundred and fifty years old, probably, with immense bay windows that glint over the sidewalk at the traffic that grumbles past on Borman. Inside, it smells of old wood and musty fabrics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got the other guy through without running into anyone,\" Stephanie mutters at you as she winds her way past dining room sets and living room sets. \"So if we run into anyone, just be yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you grumble back. \"But how'm I to get my lackey out of here for school on Monday? What time does this place open?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten, but your twin and I already set it up.\" You do a double take at her words. \"We'll take him out of storage on Sunday afternoon before closing time. He'll go home and be you, then go to school the next morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where will I be? Sleeping here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you'll spend the night with Caleb, and drive in with him Monday morning. Your other guy will leave the keys to your truck under the floor mat so you can take off as soon as you get to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if Caleb doesn't want me spending the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already set it up. Will texted him and Caleb's okay with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now he's 'Will', is he?\" you snap at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Stephanie flashes you a grin. \"I really like him. He's twice as smart and not half the wanker <i>you</i> are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clench your fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie leads you through an office complex in the back and down a maintenance hallway that seems to run the length of the block. She stops before a metal door and glances around before sliding a key into the lock and opening it. She hustles you through and shuts the door. It's pitch black until she switches on the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a small room, dusty and bare, with three yawning doorways leading out. She pushes you through one and flicks on another light. The room beyond is also bare but for a long table, on which rests the sacks containing your work material. You do a double-take at a stone pylon in the corner: the lackey, disencumbered of a mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is where we'll keep things,\" Stephanie says. \"I'll make you another key so you can get in. If anyone ever tries to stop you from getting back here, tell them you're looking for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did <i>you</i> get a key?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lifted it off my dad, copied it. You're not the only one who likes getting into stuff, you know. Here's your clothes.\" She picks up a bundle from the table and thrusts it at you. \"I'll be waiting outside while you change.\" She's gone before you ask her why it's okay for her to look at your naked doppelganger but not your naked self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nShe wants you to take her home after that, but you're in a rebellious mood. And besides, you point out, if this is going to be a workspace, you should try it out. She grimaces but accedes, and tells you to keep out of sight while she gets a ride from someone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spoke more out of spite than a genuine desire to do some work, though, and after twenty minutes of polishing a new mask, you're bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you pop your mask onto the lackey. His knees briefly buckle before he catches himself. \"Whoa,\" he says. \"Is it Sunday already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's still Saturday. Thirty minutes after you left us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's up?\" His face falls as you thrust the polisher and the mask at him. \"Jesus! Stephanie's right, you are an asshole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she call me that?\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he admits. \"So what are <i>you</i> going to do? Polish yourself while I polish the mask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm going to study up on the next spell.\" You throw the tatty shorts and t-shirt at him, then curl up on the floor with the grimoire and your cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, your twin shuts off the car buffer. \"What's wrong?\" he says. \"Translator won't work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish it were. Instead, you've found the next spell all too easy to translate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's practically a duplicate of previous spell, which made the lackey. There's only one difference: Instead of four hundred pounds of graveyard dirt, it calls for forty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it also calls for a human being. To be set on fire along with everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou doubt Stephanie would go along with that. Maybe this would be a good time to distract her with that \"gaslighting\" idea you had earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vote on where the story goes next:</b> \"<a href=\"\" title=\"\" target=\"_top\">Invalid Item</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a></span></div></div>",

Caleb wants to know what you're doing Sunday afternoon. Katy wants to know the same thing, while Stephanie wants to get the key to the new hideout back from you so she can make a duplicate. You mention to her that Katy is looking for something to do, and she quickly texts back that Catherine Muskov, one of the popular girls at school, will probably be hosting an impromptu party, and that you and Katy should try to show up there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>who else be there?</i> you ask, thinking of possible people to copy for a gaslighting attack on Hannah.

Stephanie's expression remains very taut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thing is,\" you continue after taking a deep breath, \"I don't know this Hannah girl, so I don't know who her friends are, who we could, you know\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep saying 'we', Will. This thing we got going with Hannah, it's not really any of your business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I want to help. Can't I help? I mean, I know I'm not ... <i>friends</i>\"\u2014you gulp out the word\u2014\"with you and your friends. I mean, I guess I'm not. Am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie doesn't reply. The locksmith returns with the key and its copy, and she pays him. Out in the parking lot, she dons her sunglasses, gives you the copy of the key, and looks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's not a club,\" she says. \"You don't have to fill out an application. I'm not saying you're not a friend. I'm not saying anything. But we've got guy friends who aren't part of this, even the ones who know about it. Oh, and by the way, I really wish you wouldn't say anything about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't. I mean, I haven't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunts, scrapes the back of her hand across her nose. You tense as you wait for her to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she speaks again, she just says, \"I'll see you at Catherine's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe Muskovs don't live in the toniest part of town, but they live in a very nice neighborhood in a large house with plenty of parking. That's good, because there are lots of cars on the street when you pull up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door is opened by two giggling girls who are leaning against each other to keep from falling over. They look familiar, but you can't quite place them, and they don't seem to recognize you. \"Oh hey,\" the blonde one says. \"Come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Katy here yet?\" you ask. \"Katy Conlee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's upstairs. Oooh!\" The blonde one seems to see you for the first time, and her eyes go very wide. She grins, and pinches her friend in the side. \"She's upstairs,\" she tells you again over the other girl's squeals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You glance around, and move toward the staircase while trying not to blush. It's hard, especially when the other girl bursts out in shrill laughter a few seconds after your back is turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a broad hallway at the top of the stairs, but it's not so broad that three people, standing in a knot, can't clog it. One is Fred Hildown, a tall, good-natured kid who like Catherine is on the track team. You don't know the other guy, but he's in shorts that show off thighs knotted with muscles, and he's got his deep chest thrown out, so even though he doesn't throw you to the floor and give you a wedgie, you're pretty sure he's a jock. Like Meghan Velasquez, who they're talking to, they're holding and drinking from plastic tumblers. Fred nods at you with a \"Hey Will,\" and Meghan smiles brightly as you squeeze past them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls' laughter floats out of a bedroom, and inside it you find Katy and half a dozen other girls, including Catherine Muskov herself. She's a tall girl with a mane of brunette hair that falls softly to her shoulders, and a calm, merry expression. She's in shorts and a tank top, showing off long, strong limbs\u2014much like the limbs you dreamed about last night, you realize with a start. Just the kind of limbs you'd like to find embracing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's Katy who surprises you with a quick hug. She springs over from the windowsill and gives you a quick squeeze. \"Hey, you found it,\" she says. \"You know Catherine?\" She turns to your hostess. \"You know Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Will,\" Catherine says. Her eyes glint in a friendly way. \"You've been out before, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes flit around the room. You recognize most of the girls, but you never talk to them, let alone hang out with them, for they're of the athletic/popular sort. \"I don't know,\" you say. \"Just haven't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catherine has parties all the time,\" one of the girls says. \"Just start showing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have them <i>all</i> the time,\" Catherine protests. \"But you got someplace I can text you?\" she asks you, \"for the next time I have one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her your contact info, then nervously add, \"My friend Caleb's going to show up, if that's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know why it wouldn't be,\" Catherine says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Katy says, \"I'll take you downstairs, get you a snack or something.\" She squeezes your forearm briefly, sending shivers all over your body, and draws you out into the hall and past that blockade. At the head of the stairs she glances back, then snuggles close to you. \"Is it on account of Meghan you asked your friend out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" You gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great,\" she says, and squeezes your hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAnd it seems pretty great for everyone as the afternoon progresses. Caleb arrives not long after you do, and you and he and Katy and Meghan wind up down in the living room with a mess of other people from school, sprawling on the floor and sofas while the TV shows a football game for the more jock-like guys (who are actually pretty friendly with you) while everyone else consults their cell phones and passes them around to share videos and memes and social posts. It's all tremendously casual, with girls draped across and over guys and guys leaning against girls. So it's nice\u2014though you guess it doesn't mean much\u2014when Katy props up against you and accepts your arm around her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou draw her out in gossip, and because there are several other girls nearby who are part of her and Stephanie's group, you soon get an earful about Hannah and the girls who supports her. Despite Stephanie's chilly attitude, you privately jot down three names of girls who would be promising as \"gaslighting\" impersonations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara Weston is another troublemaker on the soccer team, a rival of Anita Nuevo's, and she backs Hannah in everything Hannah puts her mind to. Anne Starkey is a long-time friend of Hannah's, and was one of the first girls to welcome her to Westside when she made the move. And Jenny Taylor, the captain of the Eastman girls' varsity soccer team, is another good friend of Hannah's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're chewing on this information when Stephanie arrives. Or maybe she's been here for awhile and you've just not noticed her, for she comes charging downstairs. She stops cold, her face very red, when she sees you. To your disquiet, she summons you over with a jerk of her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That thing you were talking about earlier,\" she mutters at you angrily when you're alone in the laundry room. \"If you're gonna do it, do it as Catherine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now have these choices:</span></div></div>",

I'm just telling you that if you do something\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe catches herself, and darts you a piercing look. \"That thing you made. It obeys you, no matter whose, uh, mask you put on it?\" she says. You nod. \"So if you put a mask of Catherine on it, you could make it, um\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if you want it to do something to Hannah, I can, uh\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie nods. \"Then you want to help? That's a way you can help.\" From the way her jaw works you can tell she's clenching her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still hasn't explained why she is now so hot to let you help, and to use the lackey to do it, but you don't press her. But you do point out some of the complexities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I've got a mask made, readyto use, but I don't have it here,\" you tell her. \"I'd have to go get it and come back. And putting it on someone is, well, kind of tricky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Stephanie's voice is very hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like I explained, you have to get it onto their face. Like, uh, this.\" You mime pushing a mask into Stephanie's face. \"And then it knocks them out for about ten or fifteen minutes or so. Like, totally knocked out. They're breathing, but you can't wake them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get the mask off them, wake them up that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, because it goes right inside them. Like, it completely vanishes. You have to wait for it to come out. And after that they're still asleep and it's another ten or fifteen minutes before they wake up. So you have to get them by themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you do it with Coach Schell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself blushing. \"I found her in her office. I showed her the mask and I pretended like I found it. Then I just sort of, uh, shoved it at her. I snuck out afterward before she woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect Stephanie to act shocked, but she only chews her lip.  \"And,\" you add, \"if we're going to send the lackey out, we need some clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you can leave it to me. I'll get the mask done, get some clothes together. When I'm ready we'll meet up at my pop's store and get the thingie ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't have to be Catherine,\" you tell her. \"Katy and Meghan were talking about Hannah, and it seems like there's some other girls\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie shakes her head. \"Let's do Catherine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, any reason in particular?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just pissed me off, is all.\" Stephanie stalks out of the laundry room. A moment later, you follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's closing on five o'clock, and some people are talking about ordering pizzas in. But one thing leads to another, and instead you and Caleb along with your ... girlfriends? is it possible? ... go out to eat at Cluck-for-a-Buck, a local KFC knockoff. There's another couple with you: Or, at least, they're as much of a couple as you and Katy or Caleb and Meghan are a couple, you suppose. Joel Wharton and Mandy Tiller aren't holding hands or embracing, but they seem pretty comfortable brushing up against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel is that guy you saw in upstairs hall with Fred and Meghan. He's on the track team, though he looks more like a wrestler. He's bluff and gruff and has an intense gaze, and you can't shake the feeling that, if he wanted, he could kick your feet out from under you and pin your shoulders to the ground while holding (oh, say) a triple-scoop ice cream cone in each hand without dropping anything. But though he doesn't smile he seems friendly enough. After awhile you notice that he doesn't curse, not even a \"heck\" or a \"darn.\" An explanation, perhaps, emerges over a greasy meal of fried chicken and fries when Katy casually reveals that his dad is the pastor at the Tenth Street Assembly of God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy is the not-blonde girl who opened the door to you when you arrived. She's a softball player, but other than being an athlete she's the opposite of Joel. She has long brunette hair; his blonde hair is closely cropped. She is small and bosomy, with a pronounced hourglass figure; he is burly. She's a smiler, a gusher, a giggler, and a chatterbox; he mostly confines himself to grunted answers. She wants to know all about you and Caleb; he only asks a handful of questions. But though Joel leaves the interrogation to Mandy, he listens with an intensity that suggests he's filing away not only every answer, but even your stammers and pauses. Between Mandy's talking and Joel's listening, you're soon exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gonna head over to my place after this?\" Caleb asks you when the meal's over, and the girls\u2014to your mild astonishment\u2014have excused themselves <i>en masse</i> to the restroom. You stare at him until you remember that you're supposed to stay at his place tonight and ride in with him to school in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have to do that until later,\" you reply. \"Don't you want to\u2014\" You glance at Joel, but he's occupied with his cell phone. \"Hang out with Meghan a little longer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs. \"You wanna hang out with Katy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm supposed to meet up with Stephanie in a little while. Um, a school project we're coordinating on,\" you add as his eyebrows go up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever,\" he says. You glance again at Joel. You're dying to know what Caleb is thinking of Meghan\u2014she seemed to be hanging on his every word over dinner, and at Catherine's she treated him like an easy chair as they shared cell phones back and forth. But you don't want to say anything in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're rescued from an awkward silence by the girls returning. Your company drifts into the parking lot, and when no one can come up with any compelling ideas for an activity, you break up into pairs, with you driving Katy back to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mandy liked Caleb,\" she tells you when you're in the cab of your truck. \"If he's going to ask her out on, you know, a date, he should do it pretty soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe near-wreck you suffer on the road\u2014almost rear-ending the car in front of you\u2014is nothing on the screeching, crashing, clattering collision inside your head. Thought one: <i>Really? People are seriously thinking Caleb and Meghan as a couple?</i> Thought two: <i>Are you telling me this because you want me to tell Caleb?</i> Thought three: <i>Are you telling me this because you want </i>me<i> to ask </i>you<i> out on a date?</i> You mumble something, and when Katy asks you to repeat it you say, \"I can mention it to Caleb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fun today, right? Catherine has people over all the time. So, you know\u2014\" She squeezes your arm. \"You don't have to be shy about dropping in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my usual kind of crowd, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like how not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All kinds of ball players.\" You glance over to find her beaming at you. \"I'm not a jock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a goose, Will. No one cares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet you have to wonder: <i>If no one cares, why did it matter that Mandy liked Caleb?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nStephanie texts you just before you drop Katy off, and orders you to meet her at her house. She's waiting out front, and leans into the cab to press a bulky plastic bag into your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna have to hurry,\" she tells you. \"I can't go with you, I'm stuck here. But tell the, uh, thing, when it's ready, to come out here. Oh wait, you're gonna have to drop it off, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. But I'm supposed to stay over with Caleb tonight, remember? And my twin was supposed to go home instead of me, and go in for school for me tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm. I forgot about that.\" Stephanie rubs her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door opens, and a skinny man in cut-off shorts steps out and calls her name in a sharp voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" Stephanie yells back. \"Look,\" she tells you, \"I'll leave it up to you, okay? Put Catherine's mask on the thing and send it here, or put your mask on it and do whatever. But either way, you're gonna have to hurry. Text me when you decide.\" She pats the side of your truck and hustles back indoors. You stare after her until the front door shuts, then put your truck in reverse and back out into the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nArgosy Furniture looks like it's about to close when you arrive: the showroom lights are dim, and the place feels deserted. But the times on the window tell you that you've got thirty minutes or so. You scurry through the back offices and into the hideout without meeting anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the bag you unpack a mask and a set of clothes: gym shorts, a tank top, flip-flops, and some underthings. The first thing you do is seal up the mask\u2014the brain band is already attached to its inner surface\u2014and study Catherine's name. All you have to do is put the mask onto the lackey, give it the clothes to put on, and you'll be on your way, and you'll have shown Stephanie that you're to be relied upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you can put your own mask on the lackey and have it drop you off near Caleb's house while it goes home for you and covers for you at school. That was your original plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then a variation occurs to you: Send a copy of yourself to stay over with Caleb, and <i>you</i> put on Catherine's mask. That way you and Stephanie are both happy. Why didn't she think to propose that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, right: Probably because she wouldn't like the idea of <i>you</i> inside Catherine's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich means that if you do the latter, you would have to pretend to be the lackey and <i>not tell Stephanie who you really are.</i></span></div></div>",

You spent an afternoon as Coach Schell, after all, and pretended to be her with other people, including Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this feels different. This is a schoolmate, and if Stephanie finds out what you've done ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, fuck it.</i> Playing it dangerous with Stephanie just might be half the fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strip off your clothes and, shivering hard against the chilly air and the cold concrete floor, you stretch out on the ground and drop the mask onto your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy warmth spreads through your limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're woken by a horrible nausea, and you quickly roll over onto an elbow as your guts roll up into the back of your throat. You're shaking all over with cold, and your head spins. <i>The fuck?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brush your hair out of your face, but aside from that you hold very still until your guts have calmed down. But hard goose bumps race up and down your body. It feels like you're inside a freezer. That must be why you feel so sick. Ever since you were a little girl, the cold makes you want to throw up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cradle your stomach and think to yourself: <i>Oh my God, did I just remember being a little girl?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes you did. Because you've now got tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig ones, too. Great bags that hang down, aiming their rock-hard teats at the icy concrete floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, and push back the soft hair that has again fallen into your face. And when you think of what else you've got, those goose bumps harden and prickle all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clamber to your feet and clasp your arms against the cold. <i>Clothes. There are clothes around here, right?</i> The light is gray and dim, and you have to squint to bring anything into focus. <i>Shit. Your contacts.</i> Catherine isn't blind, but she's pretty damn near-sighted. But you find the bag and pull out the clothes. They must be Stephanie's, because you don't recognize them. They're skimpy, too, just some running shorts, panties, and a t-shirt, and no protection against the chill. There's not even a bra\u2014the hell?\u2014and your breasts droop and rub uncomfortably against each other inside the shirt. The sooner you get out of here, the happier you'll be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot until you've dropped the \"Will Prescott\" mask onto the lackey do you stop to wonder how the thing will know to obey you\u2014or if it will obey you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour duplicate does a double-take and scrambles up and backward onto his elbow when he sees you. \"King Hell?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your finger\u2014a long, slim thing with a curved, manicured nail\u2014in his face. \"Listen, I don't want any shit from you, okay? I'm you, got it? I mean, I'm Will Prescott. The real guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" he says, and looks you up and down with a hungry expression. \"I don't know why you want to say that, babe, considering you look like\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm wearing a mask, okay? You know how those work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure.\" He licks his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me take it off to prove it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, neither of us wants that.\" He leans forward and strokes your arm, and you jump back with a little squeal. \"Come on,\" he grins. \"As long as you're looking like that, you and me could at least\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so disgusting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sniggers. \"Ask yourself that.\" Then he laughs. \"Oh come on, boss. I'm just giving you shit. I knew it was you the moment I saw you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" He shrugs. \"Don't ask me how. I just knew. But, uh\u2014\" He stands up, and to your horror you see that his cock is fully rigid and blushing. \"I'm not holding it against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAs he gets dressed, you explain to him what's going on. He smacks his lips over your impersonation plot. \"Wish that was something I could do,\" he says. \"Think maybe we could try that out? We could, like, try putting that coach's mask on me to see if I can wear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe one of these days,\" you tell him as you lead him out of the empty space and lock the door behind you. \"Right now, you just need to remember that, uh, you're supposed to be me and I'm supposed to be your lackey.\" You hand him the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck me,\" he gasps. \"No, seriously,\" he continues. \"Fuck me. If I was your boss I'd\u2014\" He presses up close against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push him back. \"Pretend you've got scruples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind? You're gonna have to be more specific,\" he says, and puts his face into your hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shove him back more firmly. \"You don't want to take advantage of me,\" you tell him, and you hate the prim tone that has crept into your voice. \"You're just going to drop me off at Stephanie's, like she asked, then drive out to Caleb's to spend the night. Oh, and you're going to go in to school tomorrow for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're as bad as Dad,\" he grumbles. \"Go to school and don't have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tries to chatter on the drive out, but you make him be quiet as you try getting more firmly into character. <i>I'm Catherine Muskov,</i> you remind yourself, and that part of it isn't hard to keep straight. It's knowing\u2014remembering\u2014that you're a fake that is going to be the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you woke up in a dark, abandoned storefront next to Argosy Furniture, you tell yourself. You were cold and nauseous and confused. That much is easy to remember, as it it's the truth. But you were even more confused, you explain to yourself, because Will Prescott was leaning over you and leering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No,</i> you correct yourself. He wasn't leering. He was just looking at you. Which was kind of creepy, but\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you knew who he was. That surprises you a little: Catherine Muskov knows who you are, and she knew who you were even before you showed up at her house. She even knows who Caleb and Keith are. <i>What's so funny about knowing who people are?</i> a little voice inside you says. <i>It's not hard.</i> Maybe not for Catherine, you reflect, even if she's got people coming and going through her house all the damn time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're caught short as you suddenly remember the afternoon from her point of view. You showed up uninvited, which felt funny to you, but it didn't seem at all funny to her, since her friends are always bringing random people over to her place to hang out. And it wasn't so random in your case, since Stephanie had told Catherine that you and Caleb would be coming over to hang out with Katy and Meghan, on account of\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie had shrugged at that point, which was just the point that Catherine got interested. \"Katy and Will?\" she asked. \"Did you put them together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just keeping an eye on them.\" She wouldn't say any more than that, even after Catherine has pressed her. So Catherine had found Mandy at some point in the afternoon\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck!</i> Catherine's the one that got Mandy interested in you and Caleb, got her to follow you out to dinner, to talk to you, feel you out, figure out what kind of a guy you (and Caleb) were, to see if it looked like you and Katy (and Caleb and Meghan) would go good together. And the texts she sent back\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel for your cell phone, then grimace when you realize it will be with the real Catherine. It's like having your arm cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay over there?\" Will asks, and you realize you've been groaning and clutching your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" you say, and straighten back up with a sigh. \"Just thinking things through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? What's there to think about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him a sidelong look. \"You and Katy.\" You can't help smiling a little as his cheek pales. \"Go looking for her at her locker tomorrow,\" you order him, \"and ask her to go out with you Friday night. Dinner and dancing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasps. \"I can't dance! You know that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter. She won't care. And besides, on Friday it'll be me, not you, with her, looking stupid on a dance floor. Just make sure that you ask her out, and that she understands it's dinner\u2014your treat\u2014and a dance club after that. I'll set it up so that you'll meet some people out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will? How will you manage that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to reply that you'll just text some people and set it up so you and them will be at Legends that night. Then you remember that you're not Catherine Muskov. \"I'll talk to Stephanie about it,\" you say. \"Speaking of which\u2014\" You reach over tug at the phone in his pocket, and he jumps. \"I should tell her we're almost at her house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nShe's standing out front when the truck pulls up, and your mood darkens at the sight of her. The mood between you wasn't happy when you last parted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't look happy to see you either, and she brushes past you to lean in to talk to your doppelganger. \"Everything go okay?\" she asks him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he replies, and you cringe at how defensive he sounds, and at the way he curls up a little under her gaze. \"Why wouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she going to do what I tell her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill looks between you and her. \"Hey Catherine,\" he says. \"Do whatever Stephanie here tells you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, boss,\" you reply, and give Stephanie your sweetest, most insincere smile.</span></div></div>",

You just have time to say \"Hi Craig\" to her sixteen-year-old brother (a junior at Westside) who is sprawling on the living room couch before Stephanie is dragging you upstairs and into her bedroom. She slams the door shut and turns on you with a feverish light in her eyes. You smile placidly back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how much did Prescott tell you?\" she asks in a husky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" you ask, and fold your arms across your chest. It's the first time you've done this, and you get a thrill at the way they bump against your bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what's going on,\" she says. \"About\u2014\" Her voice turns huskier. \"About what we're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean how you're practicing black magic?\" you retort before you realize what you're saying. The color drains from Stephanie's face. \"I assume that's what you'd call it,\" you continue, having given Catherine's instincts their head. \"Jesus, Stephanie, after what you guys did to Hannah at the party Saturday\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was just to freak her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that makes it better, what you're planning to do now?\" You give Stephanie a disapproving smirk. \"What did she do to you to deserve it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a cunt,\" Stephanie mutters. She wipes her palms on the sides of her shorts and dodges your gaze. \"She comes swaggering in like she's special shit and can just take whatever she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Like Marc?</i> you almost say, but catch yourself. That was probably the comment that made Stephanie mad enough to copy Catherine for this \"prank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything had been going great at the house\u2014everyone was relaxed and hanging out, just the way Catherine liked it. Then she'd found Hannah's Tumblr post, with the photo of the garter snake she'd found in her bedroom. She showed the phone to Stephanie. <i>Which one of you guys snuck it in there?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie flushed. <i>We didn't do it,</i> she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You sure? Seems like something you'd do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot your business, Catherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen why'd you bring </i>your<i> business into </i>my<i> house?</i> Catherine sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Because it's the only time we\u2014 Psh!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine almost dropped it at that point\u2014you can feel her regret that she didn't\u2014but then she muttered, <i>Marc's gonna kick your asses if you're not careful.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like putting a match to a Roman candle. <i>It's not his business either!</i> Stephanie had nearly shouted. <i>If he'd kept his stupid self out of the tryout\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's her boyfriend, Stephanie,</i> Catherine snapped, then added, more in mischief than because she thought it was true, <i>Is that what this is about? You're pissed he's going out with her instead of you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie had turned white, from her temples to her throat, and stalked out, leaving Catherine to wonder if maybe Stephanie really was jealous of Hannah's relationship with Marc Garner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't want to fight,\" you tell Stephanie now. \"I'm not even here, I'm not even the real girl, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you say it, you put your hand out to stroke Stephanie's arm. She jerks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" you ask. It's a stupid question, as you almost instantly realize. \"Oh, it's because I'm not\u2014 I'm not real. Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just really weird,\" Stephanie says. She hops onto her bed, and she still won't look at you. \"Let's just hang out till tomorrow. Then we'll do the thing, and then it'll be over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what thing? Will only told me you want me to stir up some kind of trouble, but he didn't tell me what you want me to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie rubs her palms on her knees. \"I don't know. I'll have to think about it. It'll have to be after school, I'll have to check and see, you know\u2014\" She shrugs. \"What Hannah's doing and what's happening with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what am I supposed to do till then? Where am I supposed to sleep?\" You know what you want: to sleep next to Stephanie. \"What am I supposed to wear?\" You also know the answer you want to that: You want to sleep in the nude next to Stephanie. \"And jeez, Stephanie.\" You cradle your boobs. \"Couldn't you send a brassiere along with Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie starts, and rakes her eyes across your rack. \"I didn't have anything big enough for you. But can't you, like, go in a corner and turn off or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a machine. I don't have an 'off' switch.\" You can't resist adding, with a giggle, \"Just an 'on' switch. Michael knows where <i>that</i> is.\" That would be Michael Allen, Catherine's boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" Stephanie mutters. \"You're disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's disgusting?\" you cry out. \"You've heard me talk like that before. Well, you've heard <i>the real girl</i> talk that way, I guess.\" You gasp at a sudden idea. \"That's what we could do!\" You leap onto the bed, and Stephanie shrinks back. \"We could talk. Tell each other secrets.\" You giggle. \"I could tell you all the things <i>the real girl</i>\"\u2014you crook your fingers around the phrase\u2014\"has never told you, and you could tell me\u2014\" You walk your fingers across the bedspread toward Stephanie's thigh, and she presses herself back, trying to get away from you. \"All the things you never told Catherine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck would I do that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it wouldn't go any further than me. That's why you don't tell people things, right? 'Cos you're afraid they'll spread it around? That's why I keep some things back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Despite her guarded tone, Stephanie looks piqued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth or Dare.\" you suggest. \"Except I'll have to tell the truth. Will told me I have to do what you tell me anyway, so the dare part wouldn't have much of a point for me. But you\u2014\" You flick a fingertip across Stephanie's bare thigh, and she flinches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnh. So tell me something you haven't told me,\" Stephanie says. \"Something Catherine hasn't told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff. Fine. I will. But let's do it like Truth or Dare. We'll take turns. Okay? If it's going to be like a two-girl slumber party\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blurgh. Okay.\" You fall onto your side and stretch your legs out\u2014<i>your long, strong, track-trained legs</i>\u2014and wiggle your toes. \"Danny Russo's brother, Charlie? You know Danny Russo, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lacrosse guy? Hyperactive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's him. But his brother, Charlie, I let him\u2014 Well, I guess you could say I let him tittyfuck me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug in the shocked silence that follows, and try to adjust your boobs, which without the support of a bra are dragging you down. When that doesn't work, you fall onto your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was this?\" Stephanie finally asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a couple of years back. It was before I moved here from Eastman. It was at a party, I had a couple of wine coolers and we wound up in a bedroom. It seemed like kind of a fun idea\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break off as you remember Charlie looming over you. He was shirtless, showing massive pecs and shoulders and biceps. It was early autumn, but he was in shorts and flip-flops (until he peeled them off) and squatted over you, pushing his sausage-like cock between your boobs. He'd cum pretty fast, and left you even more quickly, leaving you to clean yourself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was before you and Michael started\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a long time before that. I never told him. I never told anyone. Except you, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie sucks in a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, my turn,\" you say. You half smile as Stephanie visibly stiffens, and you let her twist as you try to figure out something to ask. You settle on asking her about yourself\u2014it'll seem like an easy, innocent question while actually being something you're interested in. \"Your friend Will, and Katy. Why are you trying to set them up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Cos Yumi asked me to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the only reason? You and him have this 'magic' thing going between you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's something different.\" Stephanie rubs her forehead. \"I don't know how <i>that</i> happened. Will showed it to me. I think he was trying to impress me or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words bubble out of you. \"Why? Do you think he's <i>interested</i> in you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I hope not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the smile fall off your face. \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's supposed to be interested in Katy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all? He's not your type?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs and rolls her eyes. \"He reminds me of Craig, okay. Only stupider. Anyway, I guess it's my turn now.\" She cocks her head. \"Have you ever cheated on Michael?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a moment to recover from the shock of that \"stupider\" comment. You cover it by stammering, \"What counts as cheating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be smart. You know what counts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there was something I did early on, before it was really clear if we were, you know, going to be exclusive or anything. That's why I ask what counts as cheating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes narrow. \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sucked off Luke Richardson.\" That's one of Michael's own friends\u2014they're on the baseball team together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was at another party?\" Stephanie asks. \"Too many wine coolers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, totally sober, down by the river. It was just us, and we were talking about\u2014 He'd just broken up with Sophie Van Den Berg, and I wasn't sure if Michael and I were really a thing. So it's like we were trying to make each other feel good. My turn?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure where to take it. She might get suspicious if you continue to ask about herself. She might also get suspicious if you ask about Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you could you get her to open up more? And if she backed off, if she called for a \"dare\", could you use that as a way to get at least a little bit physical with her?</span></div></div>",

But it's one that could stir her up, get her excited; get her a little rowdy, maybe, and if you worked at it ... a little raunchy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls her eyes. \"What are we, back in middle school all of a sudden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle. \"You play it so close, Stephanie. I have no idea who you like, or even what kind of guy you like. Isn't there anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs. \"Dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan. \"Dares are no fun,\" you pout, \"and I'm no good at coming up with any. At least, none we can do here when it's just us.\" Actually you can think of a dare that would involve just the two of you, but you judge it's too early for <i>that</i> kind of thing. \"So I'll change my question. <i>Is</i> there anyone who gets you all, you know, twitchy?\" You tickle her, and she jumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dare,\" she repeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, there <i>is,</i> isn't there?\" you exclaim. Stephanie, who is already pink, turns a deeper crimson. \"Why don't you want anyone to know? But you can tell <i>me.</i> I can keep it a secret, remember?\" You grin at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie falls onto her back and stares at the ceiling. She pinches the bridge of her nose. She takes a couple of deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she says, \"No. I can't say it out loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" You suck in a sharp breath. \"Is it a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow!</i> If a look could scorch, the glare Stephanie shoots at you would have burnt your face off, mask and all! \"No,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't take it like that,\" you laugh. \"<i>I'm</i> never more than about four wine coolers away from making out with a girl at a party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie's eyes widen. \"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and roll onto your stomach to give her a close stare. \"Go on,\" you say. \"Ask me.\" You grin. \"That's my Dare to you. Ask me who I've made out with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie's nostrils flare. \"Who?\" she asks in a croak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one!\" You loose a gale of laughter into the room. \"Never had a chance! But I would,\" you add more earnestly. It's not a lie, not exactly, you're putting into Catherine's mouth. \"There wouldn't be as much pressure, you know?\" You curl onto your side and hug your knees to your chest. Your bare legs are warm and smooth, and you thrill inside and out as you hug them. \"I figure it would be hot, but alos kind of relaxing, more like a cuddle. Don't you ever want to do that? Just to cuddle with someone? To hold them and stroke them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie's gaze goes distant. \"Nnh. I guess when I think about it I go straight to the fun part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppress a little gasp of excitement. \"Well,\" you drawl, \"I guess it could go on for a <i>little</i> more than just a cuddle. Depending on how fun it was.\" You titter. \"Your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Stephanie says nothing, and continues to gaze past your shoulder. After a few minutes of silence, she stirs when someone downstairs calls her name. \"Be right back,\" she tells you as she hops off the bed. But it's actually closer to a quarter hour, and her mood has cooled by the time she returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSo that's the end of the game, and when she comes back she tells you to amuse yourself on her laptop while she checks her phone. She does join you, though, when she notices that you've logged in to Catherine's social media accounts, and she puts her arm around you as she leans in to run the cursor around the screen as she reads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookit,\" she says, \"Catherine's setting up a thing with the track and baseball teams for after school tomorrow. She'll be busy with them, so you can get together with Hannah then, maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you. \"How would Catherine set it up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a good question, and you mull it for a minute. Then you open up Snapchat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie stops you. \"Hang on, don't do it through Catherine's account. Do it through\u2014\" She wraps her arms around you and taps at the keyboard. \"Here. This is a, uh, second account I keep. For special stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she types, you reach up to lightly clasp and stroke her arm, letting go only when she straightens up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I tell her?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that you want to meet her. Tell her it's important, though, and, uh, kind of sensitive. Just you and her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where can we meet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cherry Brook Bakery. It' just up the street from my pop's store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what am I supposed to do when we're together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you tomorrow. Just send her the invite now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, and lean in toward the laptop camera. \"Hey Hannah,\" you say, speaking quickly so as to squeeze the full message into the tiny video snippet. \"I'm gonna be at Cherry Brook Bakery tomorrow after school, could you meet me there around four, four-thirty? Just us, 'cos it's kind of sensitive. And don't tell anyone. Really.\" You flash a brief frown. \"We need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie grunts over it, and forces you to record it a few more times until she's satisfied that your message will draw out Hannah without alarming her and causing her to say anything to the real Catherine at school. Then you send it. Your co-conspirator is looking a little pale in the face when you stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay,\" you tell her, and draw her into a light embrace. \"I know I was kind of a bitch earlier about it all, but now I figure that if you're going to all this trouble to get back at her, you must a good reason.\" You stroke her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you thought your words would reassure her, you were wrong, for Stephanie looks even more stricken when you release her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nWhen it's time for bed, Stephanie changes into pajamas. She's not shy about disrobing in front of you, and you have to pretend very hard not to be interested as her shirt and shorts and underthings come off. She has strong, smooth limbs, and her flat, taut stomach faintly shows the lines of her abdominal muscles. After she's changed, she hands you a set of flannel pajamas. You pull off the skimpy clothes you've been wearing, enjoying the feel of the cool air on your breasts and hips, but are slow to put the other things on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" you tell her as you unfold them, \"I don't normally wear PJs when I sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you sleep in the nude?\" Stephanie replies as she pulls back the sheets of her bed. \"I sometimes do too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice, isn't it? Just feeling the sheets against you. Do you mind if I, uh\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do whatever you want,\" she grunts as she slips between the sheets. \"Come on, I have to get up early tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you slip into bed with her, with only her pajamas between you. She puts out the light, and for a long while you lay there listening to the sound of her breathing. Your heart works its way higher and higher into your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" you finally croak out, \"when I was talking earlier about ... cuddling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause. \"Uh huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd kind of like it if\u2014 I mean, wouldn't it be fun if\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break off at the long sigh that follows. \"The hell is wrong with you?\" Stephanie mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince, but persist. \"Nothing. But I'm not real. You know I'm not. And\u2014\" You pluck at the side of Stephanie's pajamas. \"It's like when we were doing Truth or Dare. We could tell each other things we'd never tell people, because it can't go any farther than us. Well, we could also\u2014\" You gulp. \"We could also <i>do</i> things that\u2014\" You trail off as your words are swallowed into the oppressive silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to <i>do</i> anything,\" Stephanie says. Her tone is rough and impatient. \"I'm not into that. It doesn't have any appeal for me.\" Under her breath she adds something that sounds like, \"Especially not with a sex doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're exclusively interested in guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you press: \"And even though it's dark in here, you can't close your eyes and pretend that I'm a guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only interested in one guy.\" Her voice is strained. \"And it's pretty hard to pretend you're him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a shot in a million, but you take it anyway: \"It's not your friend Will, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snorts. \"Oh, Jesus. Just shut up and go to sleep. Remember, you have to do what I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nStephanie is up early the next morning for a jog. You'd go with her\u2014a first for Will Prescott though not for Catherine Muskov\u2014but you've no running shoes, so instead you take a very long and soapy shower with lots of time to rub and finger yourself. After she's back and showered, Stephanie gives you a fresh set of gym clothes and also an old iPod Touch that used to belong to her older brother (now off at college) so you can keep amused during the day. She drops you off at Argosy Furniture on her way to school, and you make your way back into the workroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before you're bored out of your skull. With nothing better to do, you pull out mask supplies and resume working on them. Six mind-crushingly dull hours later, you've completed and attached two more brain-bands to two more polished masks. Your only respite comes at around two, when Stephanie texts you with an alert: Her mother needs her to run errands after school, so \"Will Prescott\" will instead be meeting you at Argosy after your meeting with Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do after finishing those masks, you return to the grimoire and study the new spell\u2014the one that calls for a person to be set on fire. You're so bored that you can't help thinking about it, and how you might execute it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd who you might use when executing it.</span></div></div>",

Probably it just wants to, you know, borrow some of the person's \"life force\" or something. Nothing bad would happen if you used, say, Hannah Westrick in the spell. Would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if that were true you could use yourself in the spell instead of someone else. But just because you're sure the spell is totally safe doesn't mean that you're <i>stupid.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kill the rest of the afternoon by prepping the ingredients. Ten minutes after school lets out, you shoot Hannah another little video, asking her to meet you at Argosy Furniture instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Hey!\" You give Hannah a wide smile and put your arms out for an embrace as she gets out of her car. Remarkably, she found a metered parking space on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah puts out her arms, and you pull her into a close hug. She's a big girl\u2014though not in a bad way\u2014and fills your arms. She is very warm, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah Westrick is one of the stars of Westside girls' varsity soccer team. If you\u2014that is to say, Catherine\u2014were forced to confess, you'd say that she's the best player, and by a fair margin too. She's tall\u2014almost six-foot\u2014with strong thighs and calves and a build that manages to seem husky even while preserving an hourglass shape between her large bosom and her wide hips. You wouldn't want to see a girl that size charging across the field at you, whether the ball was between her feet or between yours. She wears her hair, which coils up in tight, frizzy curls, in a long, thick ponytail that trails almost to the small of her back. Her face is wide and flat and handsome. Maybe it's her size, and the mane-like shape of her hair, but there's something cat-like, even leonine, about her visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you got changed in a hurry,\" Hannah says now. She pulls back but continues to stroke your back while smiling into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"Well, you know, couldn't wait to get comfortable. So how was your day?\" You tuck your arm into hers and hold her hand as you lead her into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God. Fuck. Excuse my language.\" She covers her mouth with her fingers as you almost run into a woman her small child just inside the front door. Into your ear she murmurs, \"Would you talk to Dominique Hughes for me, please? I'd talk to her myself, but I can't even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, what's she doing <i>now?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah snorts. \"Look, that shit she pulled at the party was one thing. You know I'm not blaming you for that, right? Where are we going?\" she interrupts herself, and looks around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A place in the back we can talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was wrong with the bakery?\" She looks around, as though she's just noticed what kind of store she's in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more privacy here. You won't mind. It's kind of cozy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hannah stiffens as you pull her along toward the back offices. \"What did you want to talk about anyway?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can wait 'til whenever.\" You squeeze her hand. \"What was Dominique doing, like, today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, you know that headscarf she wore to your party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The red one? Oh my God!\" The words come blurting out before you can stop them. \"If I thought I could pull off a look like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" Hannah squeezes your hand back. \"That's only one of the reasons I friggin' <i>hate</i> her, because she can do that whole exotic gypsy thing\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you notice she wasn't even wearing earrings the other night?\" Still Catherine's thoughts come tumbling out of you. It's easier to give in to her excitement than to stifle and second-guess them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about her earrings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wasn't wearing any. At the party. But didn't it seem like to you she was?\" You cluck your tongue enviously. \"Big, gold, hoop earrings, to go with the headscarf. You know, like a gypsy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't notice, but why are you making a deal about\u2014? Was she wearing earrings or wasn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. \"She wasn't, but it totally seemed like she <i>was</i>, right? It didn't seem like that to you? It did to me. I mean, <i>that's</i> how perfect that headscarf was for her, all by itself it gave her that totally exotic look like you were saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I that's why I hate her. She doesn't have to try to look great. I guess it's that Mexican-Indian look she's got,\" she adds with a cluck of her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is half Hopi,\" you remind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's half hoping she dies in a fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. No, I take it back, I'm not. What is this?\" Hannah asks as you unlock and open the door to the abandoned store front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the place. But what were you telling me about Dominique? What did she do today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. Just irritated the hell out of me.\" Hannah wrinkles her nose and clucks distastefully as you usher her into the dim, dusty room. \"She wore that headscarf to school today, just to spite me, I think. I don't remember ever seeing her in it before, but today it was like every time I turned around I saw her out of the corner of my\u2014\" She trails off. \"The hell, Catherine? Why'd you wanna come here instead of\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I wanted to show you this.\" You pick up one of the masks. \"I didn't want to take a chance on losing it in public.\" You hand it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a mask, silly. A thing for Halloween. It needs some eyeholes punched into it, but otherwise it's, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah turns it over a couple of times. \"Okay, it's pretty cool, I guess. But come on, let's get out of\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it on,\" you urge her. \"I got it thinking it would suit your looks,\" you continue as she looks dubious. \"With your hair\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press up close and put your arms around her to pull at her ponytail, loosening it and pulling the strands free. You're close enough that you can smell her breath\u2014cinnamon. Your lips twitch into a smile. You weren't lying last night when, as Catherine, you confessed to Stephanie that you were only ever a few drinks away from making out with a girl. You'd love to make out with Hannah. To open your mouth and take hers in yours ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let go of her but you don't step back. \"Try it on,\" you say. \"Just put it up to your face.\" You grasp her wrists, and she only lightly resists as you push her hands to her face. \"We'll take a picture and you'll see.\" You titter. \"Maybe you'll look spooky enough we can send it around to freak out <i>Dominique.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat turns the trick. Hannah lifts the mask to her face. It only touches it before it vanishes, and she sinks to the ground, taking you with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou had two good reasons for forcing a blank mask onto Hannah. One was that you wanted to knock her out so you could perform that spell on her. Probably you couldn't have talked her into it! And Stephanie would probably dig having a copy of her nemesis\u2014a bonus on the kind of trouble she wanted you to do anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now you're really glad to have a copy of Hannah on hand. It turns out that spell was a lot hinkier than you were counting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while she was knocked out, you lofted her onto one of the tables, pulled her clothes off her\u2014and found she's got a bush down below that almost's as much of a jungle as the one atop her head\u2014and dumped the rest of the ingredients on her. You almost backed out at the last moment when you went to set a flame to her, for you remembered how long it took to \"cook\" the lackey, and it would be bad\u2014for lots of reasons!\u2014if Hannah Westrick was spread out, on fire, for the next week in the empty storefront next to Argosy Furniture. But then you reminded yourself that surely this new spell wasn't going to be a duplicate of the previous spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the good news is that Hannah wasn't on fire for more than half a minute, if even that. The bad news is that ... the new spell is pretty much otherwise a duplicate of the spell that made the lackey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difference is that it has turned <i>Hannah</i> into a lackey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that's what it looks like to you. You are cold with horror all over as you study her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is the same color as the lackey, for a start\u2014an off-white, like a water-stained marble statue. She is also stiff all over, though maybe her flesh yields just the tiniest little bit when you push a fingertip into her. But from the tips of her toenails to the tips of her hair, she really does look like she's been transformed into a statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it really is good that you've got a copy of her in the mask that you lifted off her face just before you put the match to her. All you have to do is put on the mask, put on the clothes, and Hannah Westrick can go home without anyone knowing anything happened to her. Or you can get your own lackey out here, put Hannah's mask on it and resume your own life. That would be quickest and easiest. And as for what to do with this thing you've made ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump as the iPod touch chimes. It's a text from Stephanie: <i>on my way twshop wehn u redy meet me thre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit!</i></span></div></div>",

But just because you're sure the spell is totally safe doesn't mean that you're <i>stupid.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you put the ingredients together, you try to figure out a way to get Catherine out to Argosy alone. The trouble is that Catherine hates to be by herself\u2014she doesn't even like driving anywhere without at least one person in the car with her, and she prefers to be with two or three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you're wearing her mask as you work, so you're able to use her own brain to fashion a plan that would appeal to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<i>hey this is will prescott,</i> you text Catherine shortly after school will have let out, using the iPod touch that Stephanie left you. <i>heard theres a thing happening after school?</i> Normally you'd never dare send even this kind of disguised self-invite to a girl you barely know, but at the moment you're not feeling very normal. (You smile to yourself as you brush a long, dangling lock of soft brown hair out of your eyes.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes later: <i>Hey Will that's right, meeting at Stewarts Hole. Woohoo. U should come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwill katy b thr?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould be. Ask her.</i> A smiley emoji follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already shot Katy a text asking to meet her\u2014and then texted your doppelganger to get the hell out of school without bumping into her\u2014but you don't tell Catherine that. <i>Xlent will do.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after sending further instructions to your lackey, you stretch out on the table and remove Catherine's mask ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n... so that ten minutes pass in what feels like ten seconds, which is better than killing the time in any other way. You text Catherine with one hand while with the other you peel off the shorts and girl's underwear that Stephanie gave you for the Catherine disguise: <i>hey this is will again im stuck at argosy furniture could u cm pick me up?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another delay: <i>Sure, Michael and I can pick you up.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later\u2014and dressed in the sloppy t-shirt, shorts and flip-flops that Stephanie lent to fake-Catherine\u2014you're loitering in front of Argosy and anxiously watching for Catherine. There's a white pick-up truck parked across the street, and you scowl at the straw-headed kid who pokes his head up long enough to look around. Your doppelganger returns your scowl with an identical one of his own, and ducks back down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn SUV finally pulls up, double-parking with the motor running in front of Argosy. The passenger-side window goes down and Catherine smiles out at you. \"Hey Will, get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you stick your head through the window to address Michael Allen instead. \"Hey man, can I borrow your girlfriend for a few minutes? Promise to give her back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" he asks. He's not a muscle-bound jock like most of the bullies at school, but he's got a broad, deep chest and meaty forearms, a product of working out for the school baseball team. Somehow his scruffy blonde hair, which he keeps jammed under a ball cap not unlike the one you affect, gives him a manlier look than you get from a similar 'do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got my truck working so I don't need a ride,\" you explain, \"and I'm s'posed to pick up Katy. But, uh\u2014\" You turn puppy-dog eyes on Catherine. \"Can I give <i>you</i> a ride out there too? Out to Katy's first, then out to the park?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little light goes off behind Catherine's eyes\u2014just as you knew it would. \"Okay,\" she says, and turns to Michael. \"Meet you out there in a few. Don't let\u2014 Mmph!\" Whatever she was going to say is swallowed by Michael as he jumps in to kiss her. She murmurs something at him after they break off, then slips out of the SUV. You pretend not to notice the quick, hard glance that he gives you before driving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you doing here?\" Catherine asks as she follows you. \"And where's your truck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parking lot back of the store,\" you tell her. \"I was doing a favor for Stephanie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember seeing you around Stephanie much before,\" she observes. \"Or Katy either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt, and keep your answers brief and clipped as you hurry through the store. Catherine's doing exactly what you hoped\u2014she's nipped at the prospect of talking pritavely to you about Katy, and your plans for and about her\u2014but you're suddenly very nervous about what you're doing and what you're going to do, and if it weren't too late to change your story, you might back out. You were a lot braver while you were wearing Catherine's mask, and before you saw her boyfriend flex his fingers around the steering wheel when you asked to \"borrow\" her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, as you hurry through the cold furniture store, you're very conscious of just how skimpy your clothes are. Yes, Catherine, in her midriff-baring sports tee and hip-hugging jogging shorts, is just as underdressed as you, but it looks a lot better on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot until you're fumbling at the door to the empty storefront does Catherine ask again where you're going and what you're doing. \"It's the thing I have to pick up for Stephanie,\" you explain. Your voice quavers; you hope Catherine puts it down to the chill in the air. \"Some furniture. Oh, hey.\" You pretend to have surprised yourself as you pick up the mask you carefully set out on a table just inside the doorway. \"There's this thing here I want to show you too.\" You raise the mask up, say \"Oops\" in a voice that is a trifle too loud, and fall toward her. It splats right into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSo, slamming that mask into Catherine's face turns out to have been a really good idea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assumed it would be\u2014that's why you did it. But your first and only idea was that you wanted to knock her out so you could try the new spell on her. It's not like you could have talked her into laying on a table and letting you sprinkle chemicals over her before setting her on fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was a bit of a gamble on its own. It wasn't one of the new masks that you put onto her, but the mask you've been wearing all day. You weren't sure what would happen if you put it back on her, but it did knock her out long for you to get her prepped for the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now you've another reason you're glad you copied Catherine into a mask. It turns out that spell was a lot hinkier than you were counting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while she was knocked out, you lofted her onto one of the tables, pulled her clothes off her, and dumped the rest of the ingredients over her.

You glance around the dark room, wondering how you got on the floor and where Will Prescott scampered off to, but the confusion lasts only a moment. You rub your face and haul yourself to your feet. You squint at the blurry world and frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you think: <i>My contacts.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a face, and gingerly touch and pluck at the surface of your eyeball. Catherine's used to it, thank God; you yourself have never touched an eyeball directly, neither your own nor someone else's. But it takes you only a few seconds to grimly conclude that Catherine's contacts did not transfer into your own eyes when you put the mask on. So where are they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze falls upon the petrified Catherine Muskov. You bend over her face and peer into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething glints there, something you would have missed if you hadn't looked very closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, holding your breath, you pluck her lenses out of her petrified eyes. They are still pliable, but too stiff to put into your eyes. She didn't bring her book bag in with her, so you don't have any contact solution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you go looking for a restroom and a sink, which you find must off the Argosy back offices. You're rubbing your eyes, lubricating the water-wetted lenses with your own tears, when a voice behind you calls your name: \"Catherine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shriek, jump, and whirl. It's Stephanie, standing in the doorways. \"Jesus,\" she says. \"Calm down. Where's Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are breathing very heavily as you grip the sink behind you, and your heart is beating hard. In a whirl you wonder, <i>Does Stephanie think I'm the real Catherine? Does she know that I called her out here? Does she actually know it's </i>me<i>, and what I did to her friend?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie frowns and snaps her fingers in your face. \"Hey,\" she says. \"You okay? You meet with Hannah yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hannah? Oh God!</i> You let out a deep breath. She thinks you're the lackey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, no, we weren't able to hook up,\" you say in a trembling voice. \"We missed each other or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\" Stephanie puts her hands on her hips. \"We can't try it again tomorrow,\" she mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't?\" you gasp. \"Maybe we could?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where to put you tonight. Shit.\" Stephanie sighs and falls silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't find anything to say, so you jog from foot to foot until she looks up again. \"Where's Will?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I think he's out looking for a parking space,\" you improvise. \"He dropped me off, sent me in here to wait for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's go put you away. We can't have you running around in case someone sees you.\" She gestures for you to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, you realize she's leading you back to the abandoned storefront, where the real Catherine is splayed out on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive steps, ten steps, fifteen steps ... Your mind is a whirl-a-gig of terror as Stephanie advances on the door of doom. Words try to form in your throat, but you can't force them past a tongue that has gone thick and parched. Stephanie grasps the metal knob; a hoarse shout dies in your throat ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knob rattles but refuses to turn. Stephanie jerks at it again, then grunts. \"Got the key?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost faint, but retain enough presence of mind to pat at your pockets. \"No,\" you lie. \"Will forgot to give it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind, I've got my own copy.\" Stephanie feels at her own pockets, then frowns and mutters. \"In my bag,\" she says, and brushes past you back toward the furniture shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab her by the arm. \"Wait, I'll go find Will. We need to get together anyway, right? Be right back.\" Before she can argue, you sprint off back the way you came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you think that your doppelganger must have run off, when you don't see him behind the wheel of the truck. But it turns out that he's just ducked down in the cab, playing a mobile game on your phone, and he jumps as you throw yourself into the cab of the truck. \"Hey babe,\" he smirks. \"Got your thing done? 'Cos if you don't need me now, Caleb is talking about\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need your clothes,\" you snap, \"and your face, too. My face, I mean. Take your clothes off!\" you order as he gapes at you. He jerks into motion as you crouch in the passenger-side foot well and pull off your top and bottoms. You look up when your double makes a weird groan, and find him ogling you hard. His cock is rising like the spar of sailing ship as he twists himself out of his pants. He squeaks as you loft yourself onto him, pressing your boobs against his chest, and he goes stiff all over as you grasp his face, mutter some arcane words, and pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you settle back, there's a blob-like slab of rock bent between the driver's bench and the steering wheel. Your eye instinctively falls to the \"crotch\" of the thing, and are relieved to see that there's no bone-like spur sticking out of the thing's lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou settle back into the foot well, and pull at your own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're woken by an insistent ringtone, and raise a muzzy head to look around. The world is a blur, and your eyes hurt as though they've been scratched and gouged. You rub at them with the heel of your hand, but that only makes it worse. You fumble at the lumpy clothes on the truck bench until you find your phone, wrapped in a shirt. You have to hold it out very far from your face before you can begin to make out the text on the screen: <i>meet me n stor w kee,</i> it seems to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck.</i> You'd much rather rack out in the truck for a few more minutes of sleep\u2014maybe your eyes are hurting because the phone woke you up\u2014but you hustle into your own clothes and hop out of the truck. You squint against the sunlight, and an unexpected car honks at you as you dash across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will!\" a voice shouts, and you spin. A blurry figure trots up to you, and she has to get quite close before you recognize Stephanie. \"Didn't you see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh. Guess I had, uh\u2014\" You look around. Everything is a smeary blur, and you hope the blobs that are moving are people and not furniture. It feels like you've got something stuck in your eyes\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh yeah.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Stephanie says, and she shakes you. \"Pay attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you snap. You desperately want to get back into that bathroom so you can take Catherine's contacts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, Where's Catherine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I, uh, pulled the mask off the thing, left her\u2014 Uh, it, out in the truck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, put it back on her. It. We need to put it back in the storeroom. The place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of it. Listen, just hang on a minute, I need to use the restroom.\" Without waiting for her to argue, you run off, caroming off the corners of sofas and tables as you stumble blindly into the back offices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after you're back out again, you find that Stephanie has vanished on you. With your heart in your throat you check the door to the abandoned store, but it's locked. Your relief is short-lived, though, when you return to the front of the furniture store and find Stephanie leading ... <i>Catherine?</i> ... back in through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got the key?\" Stephanie asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\" you reply, trying not to swallow your own tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The key, Will, to the place.\" She rubs her nose and frowns. \"Catherine went back to get it from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" You pat your pockets, which are empty. \"No, they must have fallen out in the truck,\" you truthfully reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie rolls her eyes hard. \"Fine. Just wait here, I'll go get my set from my bag.\" She turns on her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give the lackey a sidelong glance. It looks just like Catherine, and it's dressed in those same cast-off clothes that Stephanie gave to you, and if that's not enough to settle its identity, there's a greenish tinge behind the ghastly smile she turns on you. \"What's going on?\" she says. \"I feel like I should be down at Stewart's Hole with all my friends, but I also feel like I should be\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, you have a set of keys on you?\" you ask. She pats her pockets, and pulls out the key to the abandoned storefront. \"Trade you.\" You give her her contacts and take the key. \"Go put your lenses in,\" you say as you push her toward the back. \"Close the door and lock it and don't come out until I tell you.\" Your heart is racing, but you think you finally see a way out of this farce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're loitering out front when Stephanie strides back in with a very determined expression on her face. \"Oh,\" you tell her with studied casualness. \"I found my key after you left and I put the lackey back. We're all good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie grunts. \"Except she didn't get to talk to Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was a cock up,\" you agree. \"You want to try again tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we need to just give up on it. No offense, Will, but this magic shit you found is more trouble than it's worth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're actually inclined to agree, but you keep quiet.</span></div></div>",

I mean, here's this thing,\" he says of the mask, \"and a pretty damn good likeness it is too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, it's just a generic face, with a brow and nose and cheekbones and chin and the faint impression of a mouth. Still, it is far more subtle than anything you could have made on your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing is,\" you say, \"it's not good for anything until it's been polished, and I keep rubbing it and nothing happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, like Aladdin's Lamp?\" Caleb asks sarcastically. \"Maybe it's like getting scratches out of plexiglass. You have to rub it forever before it's smooth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, I haven't got time to work at it that hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever said magic would be easy? Look at computers and how much programming goes into them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you volunteering to polish it until it finally works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, let's make another one.\" He starts pulling out the ingredients you'd shown him. \"I wanna see this magic stuff in action.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on,\" you sigh. \"I got in trouble when I made this one. It makes a horrible smell.\" You think a moment. \"Let's do it at the clubhouse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb blinks, then grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"clubhouse\" is actually the basement of an abandoned elementary school a few blocks from your house. Two years ago you found an outside door leading down into a basement storeroom. No one seems to go in there\u2014though parts of the old school are now used as a community center\u2014and you padlocked the door with a lock of your own. You'd shown it to your friends Caleb and Keith, and last Halloween you guys even hung out down there, telling ghost stories and drinking cheap liquor. It's been many months since you've been back, but it would be the perfect place to experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you gather the supplies and take them out to Caleb's car. Your dad's face shows relief as you pull out of the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basement is undisturbed, and Caleb watches as you set up tables and fans under the windows that peek out just above ground, but he stops you before you can begin. \"Lemme try,\" he says. \"I wanna see if this magic stuff only works for the guy who owns the book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo under your guidance he mixes the ash and ice and other whatnot; he leaps back as it smokes and pops; you hold your noses and gag at the stench. Caleb dumps the mix over the upturned mirror and puts the match to it; he picks up the shell after the flames wink out, and it twists in his hand just as yours had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's breathing heavily. \"I said I believed you weren't making it up. But actually I kind of didn't.\" He gulps. \"But now I really do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, part of you regrets he can also do the spells. But mostly you are relieved to have someone to share it with\u2014and to help you decide what to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"You know, if these things work, we could pull some awesome pranks,\" Caleb says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Wednesday, and you're sitting in the elementary school's semi-abandoned playground, each with a mask, polishing away. You'd discovered that intense rubbing at a single spot would buff a mask from a dull gray to a brilliant blue, so you and Caleb have gotten together each day after school to talk, horse around, watch a movie, or otherwise waste time while finishing off the masks. It's tedious work, but when you are done you will have two masks, doubling the amount of fun you can have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except the book's really vague about how they work,\" you remind him. \"I mean, how do we copy people into them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume they're like a mold,\" Caleb says carelessly. \"Like, you get up close to someone\u2014\" He mimes shoving his mask into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's another thing,\" you reply. \"How do we get close to the people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on who it is. Got any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there's Geoff Mansfield for a start; he's been hanging around Lisa lately and it would be nice to ruin his chances with her. There's also lots of guys at school you could pretend to be, so as to get close to their girlfriends: Marc Garner, Ricky Golia, Ethan Nieves\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Jeremy?\" says Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richards? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he's a dick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there is that. Jeremy Richards was one of your friends in middle school, until he hit a growth spurt and tried out for the basketball squad. Now he hangs out with the jocks. He doesn't jeer at you and his other former friends, exactly, but he treats you like you're not cool enough for his company any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we could use him to get close to some other guys,\" Caleb continues, warming to his idea. \"Like, clone yourself as Richards, then get close to Javits and clone him.\" He leans back with a grin. \"Then call Cindy. So hey, wanna come over and suck my cock tonight?\" he says, dropping his voice to imitate the basketball player's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God.\" You close your eyes and put your head back. The thought of that bosomy, willowy cheerleader slurping all over you, even if it's because she thinks you're her boyfriend ... \"But how do we get the original people out of the way while\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb shrugs. \"We'll think of that when the time comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe time comes, as far as you're concerned, the next day, when you stumble onto Geoff and Lisa outside the cafeteria. You instantly take in the scene: Her, gazing into his face with the kind of rapt expression you wish she had looked at you with; him, gazing back with a cool half smile. \"Guys,\" you mutter, and try to dodge past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Will. Have a good weekend?\" Lisa asks with careless grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was four days ago, I don't remember,\" you growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a busy life you must lead,\" Geoff says with light sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hair on the back of your head goes up. \"What're you doing next weekend?\" you ask Lisa; you'll be damned if you're going to let Geoff just scoop her up. \"Wanna see that new CGI movie with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to see a cartoon, do you?\" Geoff sneers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really not into those,\" Lisa says, and your jaw clenches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about golf?\" Geoff suggests to her. \"My uncle has a membership at the country club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can Will come along?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only bring one guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, I don't know anything about golf,\" you blurt out, then mentally kick yourself hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could all go see a movie on Sunday,\" Lisa suggests brightly. \"That'd leave Saturday for something else.\" She smiles up at Geoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll give you a call,\" Geoff tells you. He starts to leave, then pauses to look expectantly at Lisa. She follows him without even saying \"Bye\" to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're at the clubhouse furiously buffing a mask when Caleb catches up to you. \"Got an idea for who you wanna use it on, huh?\" he says with gentle sarcasm. You tell him of your encounter with Lisa and Geoff. \"Jesus, Will, this is bigger than them. You need to expand your thinking. What's a little revenge\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not revenge! It's about saving her from him! The guy's a jerk and she's a\u2014 a fool if she can't see that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs. \"So you're gonna clone yourself as Geoff and act like a really big jerk, so she'll understand that he's a big jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Christ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, don't try giving me advice! It's not like you've been a lot of help.!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" His tone catches your attention, and you look up to find him glowering at you. \"I've been on your side, you know, so don't give me any shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tone suggests there is more here than just anger at the way you snapped at him. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you steadily, and when he speaks he very calm, with none of the stuttering tone he's used before when discussing Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was never into you,\" he says matter-of-factly. \"She just thought of you as someone to hang out with over the summer. But now school's back, and it's her senior year, and she's looking for a real boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's your opinion\u2014\" you say, face flushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my opinion. Lisa won't tell me anything, but I've talked to Eva\u2014you know, her best friend\u2014and that's what she says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Eva is a cunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but that's what she says Lisa told her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Caleb stare at each other without blinking. When you look away, it's because you have to blink back hot tears of rage and humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb leans forward. \"Look, dude. Lisa's not worth it. I know she's pretty and she's usually nice. But there's something missing inside her. It's weird, but she'd be nicer if she were an actual bitch, like Kelsey and them. But she's not really that different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss the mask away. It suddenly seems pointless. If Lisa really is that kind of girl, then who are you to come between her and Geoff? They deserve each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb puts the mask back in your lap. \"So she's not worth it,\" he says. \"We can have fun with other people with these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nCaleb hasn't finished his mask when you meet in the clubhouse on Saturday, but yours is done, and he whistles appreciatively at it. \"So who do we try it on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been giving it some thought, now that the point has come. \"We don't know how they work. It could be dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try it on Geoff. We could do it in the movie theater in the dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it could be dangerous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so I think\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I wont let you throw it away on Mansfield. Let's call Richards.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if it's dangerous, let's try it on ourselves.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Caleb's eyes bulge. \"Are you crazy? We don't know what will happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. It would be\u2014\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can't finish the thought. For if it's unethical to test them on other people, it would be unethical to indulge all the other plans you've been fantasizing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want to be your own lab monkey, go ahead,\" he grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you say. \"I'll try it out, and you watch to see what happens. Jump in if it looks like, you know, something's going wrong.\" Despite your attempted bravery, your stomach flops about at the thought of \"what might go wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he says after taking a deep breath. \"How do we do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around and spot an old cafeteria table under some desks; after clearing it off, you lay down on it. \"Maybe I better take my clothes off,\" you mutter after a pause. \"In case they interfere,\" you add when Caleb looks at you funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basement is cold and dirty, so you're really uncomfortable as you lay back down, naked, on the table. \"Put it on me,\" you tell Caleb as he starts to hand you the mask. \"That's how we'll have to do it with other people, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to make them get naked too,\" he asks sarcastically, but you ignore him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and hold your breath as the mask settles on your face. For a moment you are aware of its cold, plaster-like touch. Then it becomes very warm, and a great weight seems to settle all over your body. Your eyes sink shut and\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" you cry, and raise a hand to your stinging cheek. You are stiff and numb all over, and only with great difficulty do you sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Caleb asks in a trembling voice. His face is haggard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. But\u2014 Jesus, did you <i>hit</i> me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods. \"You've been passed out for ... God, I dunno. A quarter of an hour? Are you sure you're okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt and stretch. The numbness is rapidly fading, but you are still stiff. You look down, and are surprised to see that you are back in your pants. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb swallows. \"I put the mask on you, and it just kind of\u2014 Disappeared. Like it sank down into your face or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods. \"Scared the shit outta me. Your eyes were open and you were breathing, but it was like you were totally comatose. I tried shaking you, but you just lay there.\" He licks his lips. \"So I started dressing you up again, in case I needed to call the paramedics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the mask still inside me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I went to get your socks, and when I looked up it was back on your face. So I pulled it off. You were still out, so I slapped you. That's when you came around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" You stand and stretch, shaking off the last of the stiffness. \"Gimme my shirt, will ya? Where'd you put the mask?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the table. Jesus, I don't want to go through that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it wasn't that bad on my end, really. It felt like something was grabbing my face, and the next thing I knew was back here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the mask. The basement is dim, but even in the gloom you can see it glowing with an uncanny light. But there is something more to it now: as you peer closer, you see that it holds a faint, silvery image. You take it over to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the whole 'passing out' thing is part of the magic,\" Caleb says, and sounding a little more confident. \"You know, to keep the victim from struggling, or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, but your attention is on the mask. There is a silvery face reflected in its surface. As you turn the mask this way and that, you can glimpse the sides and top of a head, and even part of a shoulder and chest. The likeness is hard to make out, but you don't need to recognize it to guess what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ, it's <i>you</i>,\" Caleb says in a whisper over your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you say. And now that you see it, a mix of feelings\u2014of relief and terror and wonder\u2014pass through you. \"Who else's would it be?\" There's a slight giggle of hysteria in your voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Caleb says. \"Let's get out where there's some fresh air.\" He grabs the book and hustles you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the bright, noonday sun you sit on the grass and study the book, which has acquired a faint spot that covers most of the last open page. You lay the mask onto this spot, and the page now turns. You and Caleb crowd together as you look over the newly revealed pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reverse appears to contain a continuation of the spell that describes how to make the mask. This makes you nervous; why is the book hiding information from you? The next page, meanwhile, seems to outline a new spell. The nearby community center has a WiFi hotspot, and Caleb has his laptop, so over the course of the next hour you are able to puzzle out the new information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out the reverse of the earlier page only gives some additional information on how to use the spell, revealing that a mask will continue to \"absorb\" new body images each time you lay it upon a face, and the new faces will be melded with the old ones, thus creating new faces. (\"So that's if you want a disguise without looking like someone else in particular,\" Caleb suggest.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make the mask work as a proper disguise, though, you have to \"seal\" it. That's the subject of the next spell. You have all the ingredients on hand for it, and about thirty minutes later you've covered the inside of the mask with a thin, paint-like lacquer; and you've also turned another page in the book. But the follow up spell looks a lot more complicated, and you can't really figure out what it's supposed to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Caleb end up staring at the mask you've finished together. Neither of you say anything for a minute. Then Caleb speaks for you both: \"Well, it's ready to go. Shouldn't we try it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod curtly and start to take it from him, but he resists. \"Maybe I should try it out. I mean,\" he stammers, \"it wouldn't make much sense for someone to disguise himself <i>as</i> himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's got a point. At the same time, your heart start races, for he's basically proposing to use the mask to turn himself into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBack in the basement, he takes off his clothes and lies back on the same table you'd lain upon. He gives you a quick thumbs up, then gently lowers the mask to his face. It instantly vanishes, as though it has sunk into his skull. Despite what he'd told you of when you put the mask on, you gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an instant you are uncertain who you are looking at: It's Caleb, but it's also someone else. Then with a shock you recognize it as yourself laying there: Lank and undermuscled, with a fading summertime tan from the torso up and the knees down. The thick thatch of straw-like hair sticking out at weird angles and the long single hairs on the chin and upper lip and cheek bone. Knobby knees and elbows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are vastly reluctant to touch him, but the sight of him lolling unconsciously, with head rolling and mouth hanging open, is too much. \"Hey,\" you say, and shake him. \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unh,\" he says, and his lids flutter open. He stares up dully at you, then blinks sharply into focus. He looks left and right out of the corners of his eyes, and slowly sits up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once he's up it's even worse, for the resemblance is subtly but horribly wrong. You stomach twists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what's wrong,\" he asks. \"What happened?\" Gingerly he touches his face. <i>That loathsome face.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" you croak. \"You look almost right, but\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\" The person who is not quite your twin pales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" you say, and pinch rather than tug him to his feet. You lead him over to a floor-length mirror that must have once stood in the gym. Caleb regards himself with wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" he murmurs, and rubs his cheek. \"It's you. <i>I'm</i> you. But you're right, it's not exact.\" Puzzlement and fear wrestle for control of  his face. \"Maybe you didn't polish it up right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I did.\" You lean in, looking over his shoulder. He glances at you in the mirror, and freezes. His eyes dart between his reflection and yours. Then he bursts out laughing. \"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is laughing so hard he bends double. \"Oh fuck, you're such an idiot! We look exactly alike, you moron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said yourself\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I was looking in a <i>mirror,</i> you maroon!\" he shouts. \"I'm used to looking at you straight on, not in a fucking mirror. And you're used to looking at yourself in a mirror, not straight on. <i>That's</i> why everything looked off. Here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls you back over to the mirror, to point at your twin reflections. \"See, they're exactly the same!\" And now that you look, yes, his reflection and yours are indeed a perfect match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes dance with amusement as he runs his hands over his transformed arms and studies his fingers. \"No one could ever tell the difference between us!\" He runs them slowly down his chest and his stomach and his hips and\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that,\" you snap. \"Don't play with that. It's not yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is now,\" he retorts. \"Or, at least, this copy of it is.\" But he does stop flipping it around. Instead he puts his hand to his throat. \"Is my voice the same as yours? It sounds different to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't sound like mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we don't know what we sound like. Does it sound like my old voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. That seems like it would be everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you got my memories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowns thoughtfully. \"I don't think so. Must only copy the physical body and not the mind. But that's good enough for a start, I guess.\" His eyes glint. \"Gimme your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can go back your house as you, you dope! If I can fool your family\u2014\"</span></div></div>",

He might as well have your clothes. Your fingers go the hem of your shirt\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, you snap out of it. \"What the hell are you planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, I wanna see if I can fool your family with this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you wanna do that?\" Even you can hear the squeak in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you, paranoid? It's just a quick trip to test it out. I won't get you in any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnh. I dunno, this is getting into kind of a creepy area. How about you take that thing off now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, here's what we do,\" he says, warming to an idea. \"I'll go back to your place. If I don't set off any alarms, I'll come back here with a sleeping bag for you. You can spend the night here, and I'll spend the night at your house. I'll even call my mom, and tell her I'm staying at your place. Which I will be, kind of,\" he laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what am I gonna do here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish off the other mask. Then we'll use <i>it</i> on <i>me.</i> On Monday we'll go to school as each other. That'll be awesome!\" His eyes dance excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really getting into this, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. That's the whole point of a thing like this, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about his plan bothers you. \"I thought you wanted to use the other mask on Jeremy or someone like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,\" he admits. \"But I can't just disappear, you know. Someone has to pretend to be me while I'm pretending to be you. And here's the thing,\" he hurriedly adds. \"If you're pretending to be me, then you ask around about Lisa without people thinking it's <i>you</i> asking about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said there's nothing to find out. And anyway\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stammer to a halt as he grins. You don't like the grin. You hope that's not the kind of grin that <i>you</i> turn on people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing is, though you hate to admit it, it's a good plan he's got: a safe way to test out the masks and what you can do with them. But you still feel like you're getting the short end of the bargain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thrust a finger into his face. \"If you're going to pretend to be me, you have to do my homework.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he says cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't fuck it up, either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't. If I can do your handwriting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have to polish your own goddamn mask. I finished <i>mine!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have to bring me out my laptop and some DVDs. No horror movies.\" You glance around. \"It's going to be spooky enough down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Spooky'?\" he laughs. \"Ooh, maybe I can bring you down a Great Dane and you can solve some mysteries. But sure, I'll bring your shit out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you acquiesce and start disrobing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's a very long time before he returns with the supplies, and you fill the time first by finding an electrical outlet and then by shivering on the floor. \"Yo, <i>me,</i>\" Caleb chortles when he comes back down with his arms full. \"Here's a wad of stuff for your campout.\" He drops a big, soft bag onto the floor, and sets the case for your laptop on the desk. \"Everything seems okay so far. But who's the Chinese chick at your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Chinese chick? Oh, fuck!</i> You forgot that Umeko would be over there to practice with your mother. \"That's my cousin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks amused. \"Your cousin is Chinese? Damn, there's a lot about your family you should tell me before\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here's one thing. If you call her 'Chinese' to her face she will kill you no matter what you look like. She's Japanese. In fact, give me\u2014\" You grab at his shirt, and there's a struggle before he pulls away. \"If you fuck things up with her for me\u2014!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, she's my cousin. She was an orphan, and my Uncle Scott and Aunt Mary adopted her when she was a baby. Her name is Umeko. Memorize it, asshole! U-M-E-K-O!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright! What's so important about her that you're getting so pissed off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I like her, that's what's important about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, so you like\u2014 Wait.\" A devilish grin spreads across his face. \"Do you like her, do you <i>like</i> her?\" He waggles his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself crimsoning, and that's all the warning Caleb needs to dodge you again when you grab for his throat. \"She's really cool, okay? I like hanging out with her, so don't do anything to piss her off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep saying that, and I won't\u2014 Hey, you want me to set something up with her? I can be Mr. Smooth, and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>God</i>! No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll hide in your bedroom until she goes away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want, Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme my fucking clothes back so I can\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, he dodges you, and runs up the stairs. \"Too late, your understudy's escaped,\" he laughs from outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dashes off, and with a roar you slam the door shut on yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAt least Caleb brought you a well-thought out care pack. Besides the sleeping bag and computer, he also brought you some supper\u2014cold chicken, beans, some pickles, and a couple of rolls\u2014and pajama bottoms. There are also DVDs to watch. But you're not keen to start them up immediately. Isn't there anything else to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm.</i> You eyeball what's left of the supply pile. It looks like you have enough for one more mask\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept you've run out of ice. Unless ... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's an ice machine on the other side of the school, next to the old cafeteria, which is still used as a community center.  There's even a couple of Coke machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all you've got are your pajama bottoms. Cocksucker Caleb took his own clothes with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, fuck it.</i> You've seen people running around in less than these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll up the legs of your PJs so it looks like you're wearing baggy shorts, and creep out of the basement. The sun has gone behind a cloud and a cool breeze has sprung up, so you shiver both from cold and from nerves. But there is no one in sight, and on bare feet you scamper and hop your way over grass and a blacktop to the corner of the cafeteria where the ice machine is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt costs money to get ice out of it, but you pay inside and it works on the honor system, so the doors to the giant cooler are unlocked. Still, you feel guilty stealing, so you don't lift an entire bag, but just rip a bag open and take out a few small blocks. You shut the door and turn around and\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit.</i> Up the street, so close you can recognize them and they can recognize you, are two of your brother's middle school friends, sitting on their bikes and staring straight at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare back for maybe three seconds, then turn away. <i>Christ, what should you do?</i> Well, you can't go back to the basement, lest they follow you. But you've no place else to go. So you walk in the opposite direction, turning your back on them and walking quickly toward the corner of the school opposite the basement. It's a long trek, then you hang a left to cross an even greater distance along the length of the school. You take that part at a run, and fight the urge to look over you shoulder at any pursuit. You finally hop around the last corner and hustle to the basement door. You scramble down the steps, toss the ice away, and slam the door shut behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what if they followed you? What if they snoop around, trying to figure out where you've gone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's lots of places to hide, luckily, what with all the furniture and bookshelves. You hurl your wadded-up sleeping bag over a standalone bookcase into a hidden corner, and shove your laptop into a drawer. But there's no time to move the fans or the other equipment. You scramble over desks\u2014banging your toes\u2014and drop down into a hidden crevice. There you wait, trying to control your breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoices outside, whose words you can't make out. Then\u2014<i>Oh God!</i> The basement door opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Lookit this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shouldn't be in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert's brother shouldn't be in here. D'you think he is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where else could he be. But come on, this is\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is cool, that's what this is. I bet he hasn't got permission to be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggles. \"He's hiding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Maybe he isn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he is. Lookit, it's all messed up in here. Lookit all this crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't any of our business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it's fun.\" Footsteps crunch. \"He's hiding back in here somewhere. If we catch him\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he catches <i>us</i>\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickers. \"Hey, let's go get Robert, bring him back here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, as long as we get out of here before\u2014\" The rest of what is said is lost in a scramble of feet. The door slams again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God damn it!</i> You don't have your phone, so you've no way to call Caleb. And what will they think if they find \"you\" back at the house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, that might stop them.</i> Or it might provoke them into coming back here and making a bigger search for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make another fast circuit, cleaning up. You hide all the rest of the supplies and equipment inside desks, and fix yourself up a better and more comfortable hiding place in a far back corner, where it will be hard for them to search. If you make it look like the mysterious occupant has left, maybe they'll leave too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept they'll have seen the lock, and if they come back they'll see that it is still open.</span></div></div>",

Much more time passes, and all remains quiet. Tension drains away slowly, to be replaced by boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light outside has grown dim when you hear the door open. A soft voice: \"Will?\" You say nothing. \"Will, are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back\u2014 Hang on. Ow!\" You bash your foot again as you try to squeeze around the highest wall of your improvised fort. A face like yours watches boggle-eyed as you emerge. \"What happened? Some of Robert's friends\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I heard! What the <i>fuck</i> were you doing outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went to get some ice! I thought I could make some more masks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you got spotted\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit! They chased me in here, I barely missed being found! What happened at the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fucking farce! So I'm in the living room talking to that cousin of yours\u2014 Oh, and I think she likes me, we're really hitting it off\u2014 Okay, okay, I'll tell you later. Anyway, we're talking, and then these two dipshit kids come piling in, breathing hard and laughing, and they take one look at me and one of them yelps. And the other one's, like, Didn't we see you over at the elementary school just now? And I look at 'em and for a moment I think I'm gonna shit myself, 'cos why would they say that except they spotted you. But I only say, Noooo, and then he says, But we saw you getting ice and you were half naked and you looked right at us! And I look at them and then I look at your cousin, and she laughs, and I say, No I've been here all this time. Which isn't exactly true, since I did come back out to\u2014 Shit, where's your stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hid it after they went. But what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, they were all, But we saw you, and I was, Pfft, no! You saw someone else, and they got freaked and went to find your brother. And Umeko was, Who are they, and I said, Eh, friends of my brother\u2014 Hey, I'm real proud of that, I didn't say 'Friends of Will's brother.' And then them and Robert came out and they looked at me funny for a minute and went away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they still there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they left. I waited until Umeko left too, and then I came over here.\" He frowns and looks at the door. \"Crap, I hope they're not hiding out there watching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should lock me in in case they come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not locking you in. That's a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if they come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if there's a fire? Just go back and hide wherever you were. You're okay, and I gotta get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing with everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine. I haven't talked to them much. Only to Umeko. She's really cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you said. You weren't coming on to her, were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Anyway, she's gone, right?\" You hug yourself nervously. \"Just don't fuck things up with my parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so worried. Me, I can't wait to see how I do. This is so cool. We're gonna eat in fifteen minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God,\" you moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, I won't make any trouble for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't set any impossible standards for me, either! If my dad thinks I've become civilized or something, it'll <i>really</i> be hard when I go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to throw the mashed potatoes at your brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt is rapidly growing dark, so it is too late to make another mask, even if you got more ice. You find another electrical outlet near your \"nest,\" so you leave your sleeping bag there and move your laptop to join it. You settle in for the evening with some movies before going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake early\u2014too early for Caleb to be up, certainly\u2014and kill the morning by breaking down camp and rearranging furniture: It's either exercise for warmth or huddle in your sleeping bag. You create a little hidden tunnel back to that hiding place and rearrange the supplies. The WiFi hotspot is back on, and you get on the internet, and when that palls you rewatch one of the movies from last night. It's not until ten-thirty, and you're wondering what happened to Caleb, that you remember that today is Sunday and your parents will be dragging him to church. You settle in to be bored until twelve-thirty or one o'clock at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily you fall asleep again for a little while, or else you'd probably go crazy from boredom, for it's almost two o'clock before there's a soft knock at the door, and it scrapes open. \"Will! You down here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'you think I'd go out again after what happened yesterday?\" you call as you scramble back out. \"Where the fuck have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I got back as fast as I could. We went to church and then your dad took us all out to eat with your aunt and uncle and cousin. She had that duet in church with your mom today, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. Can we just get you changed back? I'm sick of being cooped up in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but you know, I got you set up on a date with Umeko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze. \"You <i>what?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Well, not a 'date' date, I don't guess. But a coffee date. You're supposed to meet her at The Crystal Cave at five.\" He puts his hand under your chin and tries to shut your gaping mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when you find your voice you can only sputter: \"I didn't ask you to\u2014! It's not your business to\u2014! You were just supposed to go to my house and not get caught or make problems!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I make a problem?\" he asks. \"You're not two-timing your cousin, are you? Or two-timing someone by\u2014\" He jumps away. \"What's the deal, Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"deal,\" of course, is that he's got you into something that sounds like it's <i>more</i> than just two relatives getting together, and you don't think you can handle that. Aside from the fact that Umeko still intimidates you a lot, there's the fact that she's your <i>cousin</i> (at least by adoption) and that's a whole weird area that you've tried to avoid while still enjoying her company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Caleb has to say it: \"Do you want <i>me</i> to go on this date for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a <i>date!</i> It can't be! She's my <i>cousin!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're not blood related, unless there's a whole <i>other</i> area to your family you haven't told me about. And if you're nervous about being with her, don't be. Just be yourself, like I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you weren't being yourself, you were being me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude.\" He looks at you pityingly. \"Based on what I'm seeing here, if I was being you with her, I'd've spilled food all over myself and got my arm stuck in a toilet. Just relax. So don't be 'yourself'. Be <i>me</i> being <i>you.</i>\" He grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab his face. \"How do we get this thing off you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou have to look it up in the book. It's simple, actually, but it takes a little practice. There's a string of nonsense-sounding syllables you have to chant three times while gripping Caleb at the temple and pulling at his face. It knocks him on his ass for a few minutes, and it takes him a moment after he wakes to recover his wits and his strength, but otherwise his time inside the mask doesn't seem to have changed him. \"Is there anything I need to know?\" you ask as you dress. \"My mom or dad say anything, ask me to do anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think so,\" Caleb says. \"Mostly it was just 'set the table', 'take out the garbage', 'don't talk with your mouth full'. Your mom tried talking to me at one point about something, but I told her I had to do some homework. Oh, I didn't, by the way. It kept coming out in my handwriting.\" And when you're both dressed and back to normal, he asks, \"So, I got that other mask polished. You wanna finish it up so we can swap places at school tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You finish it up if you want. I'm going home to see what the damage is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no damage!\" he calls, but you're already running up the stairs to the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's right this far: If there is any damage, it isn't apparent when you arrive. Your dad's laying down for a nap and Robert is off in the neighborhood with his friends. Your mom is in the living room, doing needlepoint. Nervously, you land on the sofa opposite her with your phone. If someone would have noticed anything, and had anything to say about it, she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a minute she does speak, and puts her finger exactly on what you were afraid of: \"You sure hit it off with your cousin this weekend,\" she says mildly without looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" You swallow, and cough when you swallow down the wrong pipe. \"That was fun at lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your aunt Mary even paid you a compliment when we were in the parking lot. She said you were looking very nice in your suit, and that you probably had lots of girls chasing you at school.\" Just the trace of a smile shows on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stiffen all over, including, to your dismay, in your cock. You also blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't heard you talk about seeing Lisa recently. How is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh fuck! Lisa!</i> You were going to call her to set up that movie date! Billion-to-one against Caleb having done that for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were talking about seeing a movie today,\" you say. \"In fact, I need to call her.\" You scamper upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sounds distracted when she answers, and you have to remind her about the idea of seeing a movie. But she's willing, and suggests a five-fifteen showing of a new art picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're supposed to meet Umeko for coffee at five.

Five o'clock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geoff's picking me up,\" she says, and you grimace. \"But we'll meet you at the theater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Terrific.</i> You feverishly ponder the logistics as you call Caleb. If you were picking up Lisa, you'd need your truck, and Caleb would have to be the one to meet Umeko. But he can take his own car to the movie theater, and it wouldn't look funny with Umeko if you drove up in your own truck\u2014 \"Caleb, dude, can you help me out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got that date with Umeko, you know, but I just made another for the same time with Lisa. Can you cover for me on that one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a long pause. \"Wait. You want me to go on a date for you? With Lisa? <i>As you?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Now that you've said it aloud, it does sound really presumptuous and burdensome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he laughs, asthmatically. \"So 'cos I did such a good job setting you up with your cousin, you want me to set  you up good with Lisa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! <i>No!</i> I just need someone to cover for me with Lisa while I'm with Umeko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't want me to set up anything with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Just show up, show my face, so she doesn't think I'm, like, rolling over for Mansfield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Okay. So if I have a chance to set you up with her later, just the two of you without Mansfield along, I shouldn't do it.\" There's a glee in his voice that you hate, and you imagine stretching an invisible arm across the miles to Force-choke him where he stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just cover for me and don't fuck it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like yesterday with Umeko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" You tell him where and when he's supposed to meet Lisa and Geoff, and hang up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nUmeko smiles brightly at you as she gets out of her car. \"You look comfortable,\" she says as she glances you up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You glance up and down your own frame. You're in your usual costume of cargo shorts, t-shirt, and white ball cap jammed down over unruly hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs. \"I just mean you're out of your church clothes. You looked really nice in them today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, don't I usually?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs as she opens the door. \"Maybe I just noticed today. You seemed to wear them well.\" Her smile widens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little sweat breaks out on the back of your head. \"Mom told me that Aunt Mary said something like that,\" you mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She knows a good-looking guy when she sees one.\" That makes the back of your head break out in a rash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou order coffee and find a table in the back, and you rack your brains for something to say while setting up the sugar and the milk and all the other crap that goes into getting coffee ready. Umeko sucks on her plastic stirrer and leans back with a lazy, mischievous, meaningful smile. \"So, where were we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where were we what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At lunch, we were talking about biochem. I thought your dad was going to pass out from shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Biochem? Caleb, you cocksucker!</i> \"Yeah, I kind of surprised myself,\" you stammer. \"You know, I don't even remember how we got on that subject?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were asking me about my classes at the university. I told you what I wanted to study, and then we were off at the races. But you didn't tell me how <i>you</i> got so interested in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, I'm not, not really. Meaning no offense\u2014\" You blush as she laughs. \"I'd just been talking to my friend Caleb about it, and he told me some things, so I was just parroting them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty good as a parrot. You sure <i>sounded</i> like you knew what you were talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. So, um, what else are you taking?\" You're desperate to get off that terrifying subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately most of the subjects she's taking are terrifying. Besides the chemistry, math, and other science classes for her preferred major, she's taking an English Lit class and a history class. You can't show off in them any more than you can show off in the sciences, and you're reduced to a lot of stammering questions about topics on which you've nothing to say. Umeko doesn't cool, exactly, as the time wears on, but she seems to grow a little puzzled, especially after she switches to asking you about your own recent studies and interests, which you can't answer without staring at your hands while twiddling your fingers. By the end, her smile has a gentle knowingness that you like a lot less than the mischief it showed at the start of the conversation. \"Today was fun,\" she concludes, when you're walking back outside. \"All of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fun for me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little too fun,\" she says, and doesn't explain what she means. \"I'll see you next Sunday, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drives off, but you sit in the parking lot with your forehead resting against the steering wheel for a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nCaleb calls you at around eight. \"Yo, I'm at the clubhouse, you should come out so we can switch and have some <i>fun,</i>\" he sings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's got the second mask polished and sealed with his face in it when you get there. \"So how was your date,\" he grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was fucking lost! You were talking to her about biochemistry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were talking about current findings on lipids. How lost could you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know what a lipid <i>is!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pales, then laughs. \"You're shitting me! I tried keeping it as basic as I could, since I knew you'd be\u2014 Alright, I'm sorry!\" he says as you lunge at him. \"Did you at least have a good time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Because I set you up on another date with Lisa. Just the two of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops. \"How? When?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tuesday night, at the city library. It's a study date, I guess, but you'll be working on your papers for Walberg. And no <i>Mansfield</i> there to cramp your style, you sexy beast.\" He nudges you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you swing that? He's been like fleas recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he's fleas on Lisa, what does that make her?\" he retorts. \"But I did it by talking about your dad's work. Salopek, and everything you they do there, and how fascinating it is, and how you want to work there\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's <i>you,</i> not me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how about that? You'd think I wanted a job there. Speaking of which, I'm gonna talk to your dad again tonight, since <i>you</i> won't.\" He jabs you in the chest with his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just keep forgetting. Anyway, I don't like bothering him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you won't forget tonight. I'll see to that. Come on, get your clothes off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou let him change first, back into your clothes and mask, since it seems like a good idea that one of you be awake during each change. Then it's your turn to lay out on the table. You drop the mask onto your face, and a sensation like warm, liquid gold spreads over your body and sinks into your limbs, your joints, you bones, your brain ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb. Hey, man. Caleb!\" Someone is striking your cheek. \"Come on, you chem-loving cocksucker,\" he calls. You open your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that,\" you say, and slap away the kid with the tangled-up grin and scarecrow hair. \"And stop calling me\u2014 Oh God, I guess I am now, aren't I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up. Your body doesn't feel that different when you move, or seem that different when you look down at it. Still skinny and bony. You hold out your arms and look at them. Less hair on the forearms, but what there is stands out more. The fingers are longer, as are the finger nails. You scratch at your head, and the short, tight curls feel like a rug that's been attached to your scalp. \"If you don't want your mom to yell at you,\" says your friend, \"you better get dressed and get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe underwear is gross, but once it's on you forget it as you pull on jeans and the short-sleeve button-up shirt. Tennis shoes are last. The two of you take a joint look in the mirror before leaving. It wouldn't seem that strange\u2014Will Prescott and Caleb Johansson staring into it\u2014and it isn't, except that Prescott's reflection doesn't mimic your actions, and Johansson's reflection does. \"See you tomorrow, <i>Caleb,</i>\" your friend laughs. \"Parking lot, so we can\u2014 Hey, write down your class schedule tonight so you can give it to me tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get into the remaining car, but sit for a moment after the truck has driven off. <i>Very strange sitting behind the wheel of this car.</i> You put on the dome light and take the wallet from your pocket. Caleb's shit-eating grin dominates the driver's license photo. You hold it up next to the rear-view mirror, and practice that grin until you can do it perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Yo, Caleb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn\u2014not quite instinctively\u2014at the shout. Will, driving slowly through the parking lot, waves to you; you wince as he swings the wheel around and parks crookedly. You trot over to meet him. \"I got a schedule for you,\" you tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ditto, but we got a problem. My chem class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit, that's right.</i> \"And it's with The Nutcracker, too. Is it alright if I ditch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He takes attendance. And it's mostly lecture, so you might be okay in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it would be worse if I fucked up, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs, and apparently leaves it up to you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had Mr. Gelding\u2014a.k.a. \"The Nutcracker\"\u2014 your freshman year, and you've no desire to sit in another of his classes, under your face or any other. Especially a class, like AP Chemistry, where he could really humiliate you if he wanted. Your friend doesn't argue when you demur on attending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you have first period together, and walk into the school together\u2014skirting the gym so you don't accidentally run into the bully-dominated basketball squad\u2014but separate inside since your lockers are in different hallways. You're exchanging one set of books for another when a figure materializes at your side. \"Yo,\" says Keith Tilley, lounging against a locker and jutting his chin at you. \"Whadja do this weekend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilley is your other good friend, the third of your three musketeers act. Or maybe the half in your two-and-a-half dudes schtick. He's kind of a dweeby loser, to be honest. Right now, for instance, he's trying to look really cool by gazing down his nose at you from under hooded eyes. But it just looks like he's suffering a weird ocular condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" you snort. <i>What would Caleb say?</i> \"I tried getting together with Will a few times, but he was being weird over Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith blinks\u2014eyes not quite synchronized with each other\u2014and his head lolls to the side. \"I called your house Saturday, and your mom said you were spending the night at his place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck, you forgot that was the excuse he gave her.</i> \"Yeah, well, sometimes I tell her that when I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Don't tell me you were gettin' bee-zay witcha girl.\" He leers in a way that makes your stomach turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was, Keith, I wouldn't tell you.\" You slam the locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sniggers. \"Think you learned your lesson from Prescott, huh? Blah-blah-fuckity-blah-Lisa-blah-blah. But I'll tell you this.\" He jabs you in the shoulder with a pale finger. \"When a girl breaks up with you, you'll be moaning as much as he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot me now.\" You wriggle free from him, and move down a different  hall toward Walberg's class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remind yourself to think of him as \"Will Prescott,\" lest you make a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill is loitering near the door, and does a little double-take as you come up. You suppress the urge to wink or smirk or give any other sign that something is up; from the flickers that pass over his face, it looks like he's doing the same. And that leaves neither of you with anything to say or do, except go inside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's begun to fill already. Geoff and Lisa are in their seats, and so is Geoff's butt-buddy Martin Gardinhire. Kelsey Blankenship and Brooke Galloway are buzzing with each other. Through the other door enters Laurent Delacroix; he drops into the desk in front of Kelsey. You shuffle into your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill pokes you in the shoulder. \"The fuck are you doing, Caleb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at him, then glance around. <i>Oops.</i> This is your usual seat; Caleb typically sits in the next row over. \"Sorry, Will, haven't had my coffee yet.\" You move over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of taking his seat, though, Will goes over to Lisa, bending over her desk and talking quietly to her. You tense all over. He looks so calm and confident, even a little smug, and it gnaws at you from the inside. <i>Of course he can be so calm with her, he doesn't give a fuck about her, probably he's laughing on the inside because of the way he's leading her on!</i> You glare and glare at him\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice that Mansfield is also giving him a dark look. In fact, his eyes seem locked on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mansfield,\" you blurt out before you realize it, and with a jerk of his head Geoff looks over at you. \"You scopin' out my man Prescott? You think he's sexy or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColor shows in Geoff's cheek, and he turns his back on Lisa and Will, leaning over to mutter at Gardinhire, who gazes back serenely in your direction from behind those stupid shades that he never takes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn around you catch Laurent staring at you. You return his gaze evenly, and he breaks into a grin. He leans over to say something to Kelsey. She turns, and gives you a brief, slit-eyed sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, what do you care what that stuck-up bitch thinks? You made the captain of the wrestling team laugh.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalberg starts the class, and then you can be bored without having to pretend to be Caleb-being-bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAfter that comes Caleb's AP Calculus class with Mr. Kowalski. You've got Kowalski for your own (non-AP) Calculus class, so the class doesn't feel weird; and although the material is quite an advance on what you're getting in the other class, it's not entirely beyond your comprehension, either. The only bad thing is that it's stuffed with AP twats\u2014Mansfield and Gardinhire again; also Anthony Kirk and Ricky Golia and Brent Pruitt. But Kowalski dominates it with his lecture, so there's no interacting with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen comes AP Chemistry, and you take the long way around to the library so that Gelding won't spot you. You were planning to spend the time sketching a paper that Walberg assigned for Friday, but when you walk through the door you spot Eva Garner sitting by herself in the middle of the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and her sister Jessica and brother Marc are triplets: non-identical, of course, but Eva and Jessica look enough alike that they wear their hair differently so as not to be commonly mistaken for each other. Eva wears hers in a short, blonde bob, and she is absent-mindedly brushing it\u2014though maybe \"batting it lightly with a brush\" would be more accurate\u2014while staring intently at nothing in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have much to do with the Garner siblings: Eva and Jessica are cheerleaders, which puts them at least three social levels above you, and Marc is both a soccer player and AP stud, which earns him a place in two of your own bad books. But you and they have friends in common, and they're usual civil when they deign to talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore to the point, she's one of Lisa's best friends. And as your best friend pointed out, \"Caleb\" is someone she will freely talk to about your ex-.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you drop into the chair across from her. \"How's the cheerleader business?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you blankly, then lifts the corner of her upper lip in a quick sneer. \"I don't wanna talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like Chelsea was in fine form today. C'mon, you can tell me. Who was crying by the end of practice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna\u2014 What do you care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't. But it's something to talk about. Oh, hey, speaking of things I don't care about but it's something to talk about, Will went on a date with Lisa yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that movie? Tss. Geoff was with them. So you might as well say he went on a date with Geoff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, how pathetic is <i>that?</i>.\" Your guts clench, but you press on with the pretense of being unsympathetic to your own cause. \"So if Will and Geoff were on a date, who was Lisa there with? Is she really serious about Mansfield?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" She looks you up and down, curiously and carefully. \"Will didn't tell you it was a group thing at the theater?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. He's delusional or embarrassed, I guess. He's all fucked up over her. I mean, never mind people crying because of Chelsea. You should see <i>him</i> crying because of Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth falls open. \"Is he <i>really?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Red Alert! Reverse and full astern!</i> \"Well, not literally. The dude doesn't <i>cry.</i> But he's all twisted up. Me and Tilley are ready to throttle him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well. It's not like there was ever a chance between them. I mean, I like Will. I guess. But if he weren't so immature, if he didn't dress like he's still in fifth grade\u2014 I mean, that's why Lisa likes Geoff, you know, he\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you tune out behind a haze of anger while she rattles off about Mansfield and all his amazing qualities. His smarts, his ambitions, his good taste; the hard work he's putting into his classes and his prep work for college; his acumen on art and literature. Apparently you're able to maintain a poker face throughout, for she never falters in this recital. \"Fuck, maybe <i>I</i> should go out with him,\" you say at the end. The jibe earns you a look. \"So why are you letting Lisa hook this amazing fish,\" you ask. \"Why aren't you angling for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa's more his type,\" she says, and shows a trace of discomfort as she says it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying you're not? What, does Geoff look down his nose at you because you're a cheerleader?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns on you with a gasp of outrage. \"That has nothing to do with\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe you're not allowed to chase him? Isn't Yumi always complaining about how Chelsea tries running you guys' love life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea can kiss my\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe Geoff isn't good enough for <i>you?</i> It seems like I always see you with the basketball players, Eva.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off, Caleb.\" She starts to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's fun teasing her from under another face, where <i>you</i> won't get the blame, but you don't want to run her off. \"Look, I'm sorry,\" you say. \"I know you're not a snob like Chelsea and her crew. But after what you said about Geoff, I'm curious. Who <i>is</i> your type?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't got a 'type',\" she loftily declares. \"That's horrible thing to say. I like\u2014 Well, I'm not looking for a type. A guy has to come to me, and then I'd decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying <i>anybody</i> has a chance with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not just <i>anybody,</i>\" she sputters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who <i>would</i> you rule out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't rule out anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So <i>anybody</i> has a chance with you!\" you conclude with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as soon as you say it, you get the idea, the perfect revenge on Caleb for the way he humiliated you with Umeko and Lisa.</span></div></div>",

Or that you'd actually go on a date with anyone if they asked you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you asking me on a date?\" she retorts, and her tone suggests she thinks she's trapped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you instantly reply. <i>Wow! It's amazingly fun to ask a pretty girl out when your own ego isn't on the line.</i> \"Go on a date with me, Eva.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a <i>dare?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me. Do you <i>dare</i> go on a date with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't tell if she wants to yell or laugh. Maybe she doesn't know herself. \"I'll take up any dare that you\u2014 I don't kiss on a first date,\" she hastily interrupts herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. We'll get together, get some coffee, talk or maybe watch a movie together on an iPad, and if you touch me I'll scream.\" You grin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs at that. You lean back in your chair, and let the boner that's been creeping up on you lift triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. When?\" she demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight. Seven o'clock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at each other. The funny thing is that she actually looks relieved, as though she feels she's met a challenge. Why anyone, especially Eva Garner, should feel relief at accepting a date proposal from Caleb Johansson baffles you. But her eyes glint and her cheeks dimple, and she holds your eye steadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she leans forward and cups her chin in her hand. \"I'm not a <i>snob,</i>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mirror her pose. \"I didn't think you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why'd you have to say all those horrible things about me before asking me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What horrible things did I say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About how I wouldn't go out with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought that was a horrible thing to say? Here's a horrible thing to say. Ahem. Imagine\u2014 Close your eyes. Imagine <i>Keith Tilley</i> asking you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brow darkens. \"That's not nice, Caleb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God. Are you saying you'd have said 'yes' to him too? Boy, <i>that</i> makes me feel special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would depend on how he asked me,\" she says. \"I liked the way <i>you</i> asked me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that? What did I do that was right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It just was.\" She peers at you. \"It made me see you a little differently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Well, I don't wanna jinx it.\" You pick up your bag. \"Seven o'clock at your place, right? See you tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep Caleb's backpack at crotch level as you stand and turn, lest she see your erection, and at the doors to the library you adjust your pants so it won't be so noticeable to anyone else. But you remain stiff all the way out to the portables, where you squat and ponder the curious turn things have taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Wanna go eat in a corner, talk?\" you ask Will as you leave English class together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you got something you wanna talk about? I was gonna go eat with Carson and them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. Grab Tilley while you're at your locker, let's make it fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang you're looking for is out front in the corner of the quad between A wing and the library. Carson Ioeger, James Lamont, Paul Davis, and Jenny Ashton form its core; occasionally Yumi Saito or even Cindy Vredenburg will join them. But today it's only Carson and Jenny and Paul, and even the latter keeps looking around anxiously, as though searching someone out. \"Hey, mind I join you?\" you ask as you sit on the grass with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Prescott?\" Carson asks. \"You fighting with him again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Him and Keith'll be along in a minute. When do I fight with Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" He takes a bite out of his sandwich. \"What happened to you in Chem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't feel like going. And fuck me, but it paid off. I went to the library instead, and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone lightly kicks you, and you turn around. Will grins and drops next to you. \"So where's Lamont?\" he asks the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess him and Ioeger are fighting again,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't fight,\" says Carson. \"We just sarcastically question each other's manhood when our disagreements become unbearable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to know where he is,\" Jenny says. She grabs some chips from Carson, who grabs some of them back. \"Him and Yumi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it James who's usually asking where <i>you</i> are?\" Will asks. \"And Davis who's always asking where Yumi is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's supposed to be coming,\" Paul says, raising up on his knees and looking toward the cafeteria again. \"But maybe she got stuck with Chelsea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man,\" Carson sighs, and rolls onto his back. \"If I had some superglue I'd definitely arrange to get stuck to Chelsea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you had some superglue you'd get your hand stuck to your cock,\" Jenny retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" says Keith. \"I wonder\u2014 If you got some superglue on your cock, could you get it stuck inside a\u2014\" He cries out as Jenny whaps him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something for you to Google, Tilley,\" says Carson. \"I can't imagine you finding out any other way, since you're unlikely to find yourself in any danger of getting your\u2014\" He breaks off as Keith reaches for him, but you and Will pull Tilley back. \"But that reminds me,\" Carson says, turning to you. \"How goes your time capsule paper for Walberg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" you drawl. Will maintains a poker face. \"I can't tell you how much fun it is write a paper about porn for school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you writing about porn?\" Jenny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you were off with Cindy that day,\" Carson says. \"Go on, Johansson, tell Jenny why you're writing about porn for Walberg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we please not use 'Walberg' and 'porn' in the same sentence?\" Will asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because you're jealous of my idea,\" you dismissively reply. \"Yeah, so, Walberg had us bury this time capsule last Friday?\" you tell Jenny and the others. \"For my contribution, I put in a bunch of porn on a thumb drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he <i>let</i> you?\" Jenny gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb had something to say about that, but you don't remember what it was, so you just shrug. Will takes up the story. \"He told Caleb that if he wrote a good paper on it, he'd let it go. So he's writing about the obsolescence of technology and the evanescent nature of standards of beauty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, who's writing the fucking thing,\" you demand, and shove him. \"I'm writing about the obsolescence of technology and the ever\u2014 evern-green\u2014\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long is the time capsule supposed to be buried?\" Paul asks in a worried voice. \"Because, you know, in ten years, let alone a hundred, I don't think they're going to be able to recover anything off a thumb drive. The technology will be\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will be obsolescent!\" Will cries. \"That's the fucking point!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson and Jenny exchange a glance and a grin. \"Sounds like you really are jealous of Johansson's paper there, Prescott,\" Carson says. \"What did <i>you</i> put in the capsule?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hair dryer,\" he says. Howls of derisive laughter from Carson; guffaws from Jenny; a tittering snort from Davis. \"Go ahead, laugh. Sure, I only put about two seconds thought into it. It's fucking Walberg, what do I care? Still\u2014\" He grins at you. \"I'm writing my paper on Wednesday at the library, and <i>Lisa's</i> gonna be there too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Ioeger say with carefully studied cruelty. \"What takes Lisa and Geoff Mansfield to the library on Wednesday evenings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly reach over to hit him, but catch yourself in time. Will does it for you, though. \"She's going with <i>me,</i>\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up where Caleb would have if he were in his own shoes instead of yours: \"You mean the way you went with her to that movie yesterday? In Mansfield's back pocket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I admit, that was pretty pathetic of me,\" Will says hotly. \"But I pulled it out. It's just gonna be her and me on Wednesday, like old times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd have congratulated Caleb for playing it right, but he had to use the word \"pathetic.\" Why should you reward the guy for that when you can go on that date tonight with Eva Garner in his place?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Caleb's after-lunch schedule is pretty relaxed: a study hall, then Statistics and AP Physics. The latter two are completely over your head, but you figure Caleb can handle the material even if he misses it, and you sit through them with a glazed smile on your face, anticipating the date to come with Eva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you're so distracted that when the final bell rings you don't notice what you're doing, and as you stand up you trudge on someone's foot and fall back into your seat. You start to apologize, but your voice dies entirely when you see who it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Steve Patterson, and he stops and turns his six-foot, six-inch frame on you. From up where his eyes are to down where you're sitting: It's bad enough when you're standing in his shadow, but it's terrifying to sit inside it. His icy gray eyes lock onto yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of this, you try to stand up, but he leans in close, and you fall back into the chair. You look around nervously, but no one says anything as they shuffle out. No one so much as looks in your direction, and most have their heads down. <i>A room full of Caleb Johansson-like nerds and Brent Pruitt-like preppies, and </i>you<i> have to step on the foot of the one alpha-jock in the class.</i> Even Mr. Krohling, oblivious as ever, is strolling toward the classroom door after erasing the board. Your only consolation is that Patterson can't stand here forever. If nothing else, he's got after-school basketball practice to get too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, he doesn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly, it occurs to you that, as you're looking like Caleb, you'd be perfectly safe pissing him off by trying to shove him out of the way. But you'd still be the one getting hurt when he threw you across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can outwait him, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter six seconds, a sense of burning humiliation sets in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shift the desk sideways. He follows, wedging you back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit and wait and look anywhere except at him. Isn't he getting as bored? Can't you catch him off guard? And why are you being such a chicken-shit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, right.</i> Because of the time he and Gordon Black, the captain of the basketball team, held James Lamont upside down in the bathroom, stripped him of his clothes, and redressed him with shirt and shorts swapped, so that he had to go to class with his arms straight up in the air and his head emerging through the crotch of his shorts. And about nine thousand similar incidents that Patterson was on the giving end of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you can stand it no longer, and twist the desk violently to the side by ninety degrees and leap to your feet before Patterson can move to block you again. You grab your bag and wheel for the door\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a hard shove between the shoulder blades sends you sprawling on the floor, and your bag opens and spills its contents across the tile. Patterson stands on your butt and walks up your back, and when he steps off next to your ear he gives it a little tap with his toe. Then savagely he kicks your bag into a corner. From under your brows you watch his tennis shoes disappear through the doorway into the hall. You're still pulling your stuff together when Mr. Krohling returns. \"Good heavens, Caleb, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tripped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you still doing in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanging out with a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou thought you had an unspoken agreement with Caleb to meet him at the elementary school, but he's not there when you arrive. And since\u2014as \"Will Prescott\"\u2014he's got the key to your padlock, you can only wait until he either arrives or replies to your texts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's not quick about either one, but he looks pleased about something when he does pull up. \"Just got back from Salopek,\" he says. \"I finally got to put in that application.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" you say. Then the penny drops. \"Wait a minute, I don't want that job! You're the one who\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't put it in for you, I put it in for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But as who? If you're looking like that\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told them I was putting it for a friend. I picked it up, went around the corner to fill it out, and brought it back. So relax.\" He grins. \"Perfect end to the day, huh? I can't believe it. <i>No one</i> caught on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they? You look just like me, I look just like you\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're both dipshits dipped from the same shit pile,\" he grins. He tosses a key to you. \"Get the door open. I'll go around the corner to get us a bag of ice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we can make some more masks. You were going to do that Saturday night, weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but do we need to now? Don't you think this is enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough for what?\" He slaps you in the chest. \"We were going to prank people! And look how easy it is. I bet all we have to do is show up as them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we'd have to try to act like them too,\" you protest. \"I know how to act like you, but I don't know how to act like, well, whoever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, I wasn't even trying to act like you at the end. Come on, get things set up while I get the ice. We'll make some more masks, then switch back and go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, let's do one more night and day,\" you say, thinking of tonight's date with Eva. \"Like, just to make sure today wasn't a fluke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want you skipping Chem again,\" he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, that's right.</i> You think quickly. \"So, how about we switch back just for third period tomorrow. We'll do it in the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna get caught in the bathroom during a break,\" he says, turning white. \"Remember what happened to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. You've got Kowalski second period, right? He won't care if you're tardy, and I know Hawks won't mind, so let's skip second and do it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb kicks a little more over it, but finally agrees. You'll both wear jeans tomorrow so that you only have to change t-shirts and shoes when you make the hand-off. Then at lunch you'll make another switch, back into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the basement, you find that you've only enough ingredients to make one more mask. \"I got a little bit of money I can toss into the project,\" Caleb says. \"I'll pick up some more stuff tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many more of these do we wanna make?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figure at least three,\" he says after a moment's thought. \"I wanna try a couple of different body types, see if there's a limit. I mean, you and I are about the same size and shape, but is there a limit we can't go above, or below? Is there a body structure we can't use because we're the wrong shape? There's a lot of variables to consider. So.\" He ticks off on his fingers. \"We wanna big guy, like Richards, and a little kid, like five or six years old. That'll give us the size range. Also a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Seriously?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pft, yeah! I mean, aside from the experiment, finding out if it'll give us all her equipment\u2014\" He sniggers and lightly fondles the air in front of his chest. \"Wouldn't you like to play with some of her stuff, just to see what it's like to have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself redden. Also, stiffen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think those are the three big tests.\" He chews his lip. \"I suppose we could try getting one on an old person, to see if age makes a difference. And if we could find someone who was missing an arm or a leg, that would tell us about missing appendages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't the girl's mask tell us that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinks. \"Oh, right.\" Again he fondles his breasts, but this time in a speculative way. \"The breasts can be an expansion,\" he muses. \"And the dick can be an amputation. But what about <i>adding</i> an appendage? If we put one of our masks <i>onto</i> a girl, what would happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'd freak out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from that. Would it generate a new appendage on her? This is really fascinating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, Spock, but let's finish up. I don't want your mom getting mad at me for being late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou clean up as best you can for the date, using what clothes Caleb has: a white long-sleeve shirt, some slacks, and some loafers. There's no point brushing your hair, since it is so short and wiry and curly that it never looks disordered. You smile at yourself, and sink a little inwardly. With his big nose and functional hair and gangly frame, Caleb has a classic \"engineering nerd\" look to him. But fuck it, that's no impediment to having fun while wearing it. Any screw ups you make on the date will be blamed on him. Not that you want to screw up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you look nice,\" Eva says when she meets you at her door; Marc, who answered your knock, hides a smile and looks away. She herself hasn't dressed up much: blouse and jeans and shoes of the type she might wear to school when trying to look good. She smiles a little ironically when you open the passenger-side door for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour conversation at the coffee shop is low-key and causal and relaxed: You tell yourself you're just two friends hanging out, but you lean in a little more intensely toward her so that she'll know you're interested in more than just the talk, which is gossip about teachers and classes and common friends and common enemies. She has lots of nasty things to say about Patterson, for instance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one name feels conspicuous by its absence: \"Will Prescott.\" Eva seems to get along well with Caleb, but you've never felt comfortable with her. As the conversation progresses, you feel a strengthening urge to drop your name into the talk and see what she says.</span></div></div>",

Instead, as a near approximation, you steer talk onto Paul Davis. \"Why do you want to know what I think of Paul?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he has a crush on Yumi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So shouldn't you be asking be asking Yumi what she thinks of Paul?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not here,\" you reasonably point out. \"Anyway, I'm interested in <i>you,</i> not Yumi.\" She smiles at that, though maybe a little tightly. \"But it's a situation where you've got this guy, Paul, who's crushing heavily on a girl who's a cheerleader. You're a cheerleader. So what do you think when you see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's my being a cheerleader have to do with it? Honestly,\" she mutters. \"Anyway, lots of guys crush on cheerleaders. And it's not so easy or great, you know. You don't hear some of the things that get said to us, or the looks we get, in the hallways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like it, even from an attractive guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes them <i>not</i> attractive, at least to me,\" she says. \"Though I think Chelsea likes it, because she knows she doesn't have to put up with it. If someone says something really nasty to her, she just has to tell Gordon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna talk about Chelsea.\" Another confession that draws a smile from your date. \"And I don't want to talk about the random guys in the halls. I want to hear about Paul and Yumi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes narrow over her smile. \"Why? Did he put you up to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you snort. You put your chin in your cupped hand. \"Like I said, here's a guy who's really keen on a cheerleader. Personally, I think she's out of his class, but\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not\u2014 Why would you think that?\" Eva exclaims. \"He's kind of cute, and he's smart. He's got a good personality\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so? I think he's kind of drippy. And he's such a beta even the betas think he's beta. I mean, Ioeger and Lamont are his friends and even they push him around mercilessly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carson and James aren't betas. Being an alpha doesn't mean you have to be on the basketball team. Even nerds have alpha types.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh. \"So if Ioeger and Lamont are alphas, what does that make Steve Patterson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sociopathic asshole. Him and Gordon both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight,\" you say. \"You look at Paul mooning after Yumi, you don't think 'That's pathetic, look at him, that drippy little loser getting a hard-on for a cheerleader'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I <i>don't!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder how sincere she is, for though she sounds quite insistent, her face is flushed as though she's been caught in a lie, or in a lie that she ardently wishes were a truth. \"So what <i>do</i> you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2014\" She looks away, and the expression of embarrassment deepens on her face. \"I feel kind of sorry for him, because I know she's not interested. And it's obvious that she's not interested but she's trying to spare his feelings, but he won't take the hint. And I feel sorry for her because he's being such a puppy dog about chasing her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you wouldn't think it weird if she <i>did</i> like him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I mean, it would be her business.\" She snorts softly. \"I'm sure Chelsea would try to make it <i>her</i> business, because she's always\u2014\" She catches herself. \"But I don't see anything\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops in mid-sentence, probably because she's just caught onto the way you're staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the only problem you see, really,\" you say, \"is that Paul doesn't realize he hasn't got a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that. I don't know if he's got a chance or not. But it would be better if he said something clearly, so Yumi could say something clearly, and then they could go on, either together or, you know\u2014\" <i>Or much more likely apart,</i> she refuses to say. \"He's just trailing her around, hoping that she'll get worn down or tired of pushing him away, and make the first move. That way he doesn't have to do any work or take any risks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do <i>you</i> want the same thing from guys? To take a risk and jump in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says nothing immediately, but returns your stare with a steady gaze of her own. \"They'd have to know that it <i>is</i> a risk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you wouldn't be offended or grossed out or go 'Euggh, euggh, get away from me you slimy horrible thing, stop raping me with your gross fantasies!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva recoils in shock, and looks highly offended. \"Oh God, do you really think I'm like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But if I try to imagine myself asking Kendra or Gloria or Cindy\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck,\" Eva exclaims. \"Kendra and Gloria. Yeah, with them, same as with Chelsea. Cindy wouldn't be like that, though.\" She snickers. \"Of course, if you asked Cindy out you'd have <i>Seth</i> to contend with\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't think you were like that either, but I wanted to make sure,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd because you are talking from under Caleb's face, and are doing this for him, you are entirely calm when you speak next. \"Because I really like you, Eva, and I'd like to go out with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns pink again, and very slowly a smile appears on her face. \"Isn't that what we're doing now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean steady. Like boyfriend-girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face is now shining, whether from embarrassment or pleasure or simple awe at your forwardness you can't tell. \"Shouldn't we go on a series of dates first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make you a deal,\" you say, feeling more and more emboldened by your lack of fear. \"Trade you a series of dates for a kiss tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns her head and looks away, but can't stop smiling. \"I told you, I don't kiss on first dates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we won't kiss on the second, third, fourth or fifth dates. I'll trade those for one tonight. And after the fifth date I'll ask you again about going steady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hangs fire for a long time. \"Alright,\" she finally says, still blushing. \"We'll give that a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've long since exhausted your drinks, so it seems like a good time to wrap things up. You lead her outside to the car, but before reaching it you pluck at her hand. She turns and you move in close. There's a moment of hesitation, and then your mouths touch lightly. You don't press things too hard, but you get a good taste of her lips, and you think she gets a good taste of yours. \"Mm,\" she says after you part. \"Maybe we could have a few kisses on the next few dates. \"We could call them lessons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take her home and walk her to the door, and have a pleasant but contact-free parting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"I got something I need to talk to you about,\" you mutter to Will the next morning during first period. \"So let's skip second, if you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got something to talk about too,\" he says. You wonder a little at that. Does he have something to say, or is  that just the \"countersign\" for your arrangement to meet and swap shirts and faces?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to chase him out of the room when the bell rings, for he leaves at a smart pace, and only catch up to him at a water fountain. He glances around, then leans in. \"We'll do it in separate restrooms,\" he says. \"C wing for me, D wing for you. Take off the mask, then we'll meet in C wing to change shirts and shoes and bags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I gotta talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. I set you up for another date with Umeko, tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you set up something with Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for tomorrow night. This is so you can get an idea which one you want to pursue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I need to talk about something more important with you, so after we change we need to skip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't skip Calculus. I'm already a day behind. Can't it wait for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. You might run into her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widen. \"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eva Garner. I set <i>you</i> up on a date with <i>her.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes pop. \"You <i>what</i>?\" He grabs the front of your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want the details, you better pick between me and Calculus, because if you bump into her\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks around wildly, then hauls you off toward the double doors leading outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"I thought you'd be happy,\" you protest. \"It's Eva Garner! And you kissed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You</i> kissed her!\" he shouts back, and shoves you. You bounce off the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're hidden in the cluster of disused portable behind the school, which is where people go when they want to be alone. There's a group of lonely-in-a-crowd types down at the other end, but you managed to find an abandoned corner where you can talk quietly. Whether you <i>do</i> talk quietly is another question, as Caleb seems really freaked out by your confession. \"That's why you didn't want to switch back last night!\" he snaps. \"You wanted her all for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so I set it up for you!\" you retort. \"You're over the hump, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And set me up to fail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you did to me with Lisa and Umeko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is Eva Garner!\" His expression\u2014filtered through your face, of course\u2014mixes ardor and horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Do you want to leave her to me? I seem to be doing real good with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushes you against the wall and shows his teeth. \"We can't just take over each other's lives <i>permanently!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want me to fuck it up with her for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glares, but his expression turns thoughtful. \"We're set up with some good-looking girls,\" he says. \"And we want a mask of one. Listen, you go on that date with Eva, but I'll interrupt\u2014as you\u2014and get a mask onto her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll make me look like an asshole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then I'll go that date with Lisa for you, and <i>you</i> get a mask on <i>her.</i> Then <i>I'll</i> look like the asshole.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Neither of Caleb's plans appeals to you, but you have to admit the utility of what he's proposing: getting a mask of a pretty girl to experiment on. You don't want to be the one who looks like an asshole, though, so you say that you'll ambush Lisa (while in Caleb's mask) while he's on that date with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems all set, until\u2014 \"Shit, how are we going to get a mask polished up in time for tomorrow night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I got an idea. I was watching TV with your dad\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing <i>that</i> for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He invited me to! I dunno why you're always complaining about him, I'm getting along with him fine. Anyway, I see a commercial with this guy buffing his car. You know, with one of those hand-held things? So I figure, why won't that work on the masks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, maybe because it's not magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a rhetorical question, dumbass. Anyway, we used all kinds of industrial stuff when making these, I bet this'll be no different. So your dad has one of those buffers, and I'll take it over to the clubhouse this afternoon. And while I'm doing that, you know my money stash in my dresser? Take it and go buy some more stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe rest of the day passes without excitement, with you and Caleb briefly switching back to normal during the middle of the day before switching back. You don't even try to act in a Caleb-like way, and no one remarks on any odd behavior on your part or on your partner's. The rest of the day slides by smoothly, though you work harder at taking notes in AP Physics, lest Carson and James\u2014who are also in there\u2014catch you slacking. You're also careful in there because of what happened with you and Patterson yesterday. But he ignores you, during and after class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you run back to Caleb's house, pick up his money, and buy those supplies: enough, you estimate, for the two more masks that Caleb thinks you need to finish the \"experiments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check it out,\" he says when you barge into the school basement, and waves a mask at you. The front side is almost completely free of impurities; he hasn't started work on the inside curve. \"That was only after forty minutes. Shit, I'll be done here in time for dinner.\" He looks through the sacks you brought. \"You should come back over here at seven, and try to make up at least one more, maybe two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh, I'm probably gonna have a play date with Tilley.\" You relate a short conversation you had with Keith during second period, in which he complained of being ignored. \"If we want to keep him out of our hair, we gotta do a better job keeping him happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, that's a reasonable sacrifice,\" Caleb says. \"I'd do it myself, but, tch, I've got that date with Umeko tonight.\" He winks slyly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a twinge of jealousy, one only slightly relieved by your memory of the date with Eva. But you say nothing. He then gives you the homework that \"Will\" needs to do, and you give him the homework that \"Caleb\" needs to do, and part for the evening. Tomorrow will be another day like today: as each other until third period; as yourselves until lunch; then as each other for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith does call you, at around six-thirty, with the suggestion of getting a burger, but \"mom\" is almost done fixing supper, so you put him off until seven-fifteen. That's when he picks you up, and you drive around for an hour, talking about nothing in particular and with him none the wiser as to who you really are. At least it shuts him up about you and \"Will\" avoiding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe next day, at third period, you're back as yourself, but skip third period to see if Eva is in the library. You're curious to see how you act around her when you're being yourself, and to see how she treats you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you almost turn around and leave when you walk in. Eva is there alright, but she's not alone. Chelsea Cooper is with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooked at objectively, Chelsea Cooper might not be the most beautiful girl in school. There are girls who have better hair and cuter faces and svelter figures and more prodigious assets. Most of them also don't have the kind of personality that frightens dogs, horses, and small children. But Chelsea Cooper combines a social position (head of the cheerleading squad, dating the captain of the powerful basketball team) and a character trait (utter ruthlessness) that make her the \"most popular girl\" in school by universal if maybe not heartfelt acclamation. And these she also unites in a physical package that, if surpassed in detail by others in the school, is probably the most lusciously well-balanced. Her tangle of blonde hair sits atop a baby-cute face with large, blue eyes, an upturned nose and bow-like lips. She is short and compact and strong with muscles that are firm and round in just the right places: butt, thighs, and calves. Her torso has a vase-like shape whose bowl-like pedestal is balanced by large, firm breasts. She wraps it all in tight clothes that leave little to the imagination even while she daunts male admirers with a tilted chin and distant gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right now she's sitting next to Eva Garner, lazily drawing an emery board along her nails. If you didn't know Eva\u2014and if you weren't friends with the guy Eva has decided to give a shot to\u2014you wouldn't dare sit at the same table with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you've also learned to be brave over the last few days. \"Hey Eva,\" you say as you pull out a chair. \"Hi Chelsea,\" you add as you sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva greets you by name. Chelsea stares at you blankly, as though she can barely focus on you. \"Have you talked to Caleb yet today?\" you ask Eva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before you can reply Chelsea inserts herself. \"Tss,\" she says, and rolls her eyes. \"Are you a friend of his? Oh, why am I asking? Look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why don't you look at me?\" you hear yourself blurting out. And she does, with a double-take when you add, \"Or do you think you'd go blind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says nothing, but focuses on you a little more intensely. Eva's lips whiten. \"We were just talking about Caleb,\" she murmurs, and avoids your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Really.</i> \"I just wanted to be sure he didn't chicken out,\" you tell her. \"Don't let him, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea, again: \"You like pushing your friends over cliffs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pushing him where he doesn't belong,\" she says, and points the emery board at Eva. \"You heard what she said. We were just talking about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside you snaps. Or maybe you've lost an inhibition. But it comes out without your meaning it to. \"Are you saying my friend's not good enough for your precious little high school clique?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea smirks lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying that, even though my friend is smart and funny and he's going to amount to something because he isn't a shit-for-brains dumbass gorilla like the one you're fucking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smirk vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck is <i>your</i> boyfriend going to do, get a job breaking cinderblocks with his forehead? Is that how low you think you rate? Or maybe you just figure on riding Gordon's cock until you graduate, then you'll find some Wall Street racketeer, shake your boobies at him\u2014\" You unwisely demonstrate. \"And move into a big house with a pool boy you can fuck when your husband isn't home.\" You run out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea says nothing. She doesn't move and she doesn't change color. She just stares at you. But you look at Eva's face, and decide it's best not to make things worse for her by staying, and push off. At the library door you glance over your shoulder, and see that Chelsea has gone back to lazily scraping her fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nDuring the break before lunch, you and Caleb separate, as is becoming customary, repairing to separate restrooms to change into each others' masks. It's begun to get a little boring, since absolutely no one is noticing the switch. Maybe this shows you've been hanging around each other too long\u2014you're too much alike\u2014and as you exit the restroom you're thinking maybe this should be the last day of the switch-offs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all those vague speculations instantly evaporate as you're lifted from behind into the air. A strong hand has seized you by the belt, and another one closes like a vise around the back of your neck. As you yelp and wave your arms and legs, you are hustled aloft toward the doors leading outside. Students dive out of the away. Well, most of them dive. A lot of them jeer and whistle at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBones crunch as your captor batters the doors open with your face and chest; then the portables loom ahead. A pod of sophomores scatters. You have lots of time to soil yourself in anticipation of the impending climax, for you're being led to the very back, where no one can see. When you arrive, you are slammed face first into one of the portables. \"Now, you little fuck,\" a voice growls in your ear. You tense as the hands release you. Then\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Will, snap out of it and help!\" Wincing, you look behind. Caleb, white of face, is standing over Gordon Black, who is sprawled on the ground. \"We gotta hide him before\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing I could think of!\" He brandishes his open backpack. \"I saw he had you, so I ran after and jumped him and got one of those blank masks onto his face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. \"You\u2014? Oh, Jesus, let's get out of here! When he wakes up\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When he wakes up it's gotta be as someone else,\" says Caleb with a desperate ferocity. \"The only way we continue living is if he becomes one of us, and one of us becomes <i>him!</i>\"</span></div></div>",

He tries pulling Gordon, but he might as well be pulling a semi. \"We gotta hide him before anyone calls the paramedics, before the mask comes out of him\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you even put a mask on him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just help me, goddamn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, straining every fiber, you and Caleb somehow get Gordon through the portable's narrow door. The inside is dark and dusty, smelling of old wood and sweat and paper and\u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ, Dane and his stoner friends have been using this place as an opium den,\" Caleb mutters. \"Thank God they were too high to close it up right when they were done.\" He drops his share of the burden and hops over to shut the door. But he leaves the lights off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you tell me what we're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're trying to keep you from being killed,\" he says. \"Or did you want Gordon to paint the outside of this portable with your guts? Jesus, what did you do? He's never come after <i>us</i> before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mouthed off to his girlfriend,\" you confess. \"She must have sent him after me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant. What a clusterfuck. Anyway, I saw him carrying you along, so I followed and used a mask on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the blanks? What were you even doing with it here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna pass it along to you, obviously, to use tonight. We can't do that now, though, and we can't leave him like this. If he was out to hurt you before, he'll be out to <i>kill</i> you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But <i>you're</i> the one who\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't know <i>that</i>! But he knows <i>you</i> were there, so that's why we gotta put your mask on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me, man,\" he says as you stare back blankly. \"He's going to be looking to mess up Will Prescott good and hard, and you know how good he and Patterson are at messing people up without getting attention. It's not like we can go into a witness protection program. You will spend the rest of the school year losing weight, hair and sanity. He'll sic that giggling psycho <i>Lynch</i> on you. We just fucked up his ego, you think he's just going to let that go? But if he wakes up and discovers that he <i>is</i> you, who can he hurt?\" Caleb grabs and feels your bicep. \"He won't have the upper body strength. Meanwhile, you'll be hiding out as him, which will make you doubly safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll think I'm a fucking wizard who stole his body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like that's not the truth? So what's wrong with him thinking it? Who can he tell? Who would believe him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He might buy a gun and shoot me! Or worse, he might go back to my place and piss off my dad! It's not like with us pretending to be each other! He hasn't got a reason not to fuck up my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, it'll only be for a couple of days, until the weekend. We'll let him get good and freaked out, then we'll talk to him and promise to change him back. But we'll also tell him that he has to treat you okay afterward, or else we'll switch him with\u2014 I dunno, Grossie Gutierrez.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wouldn't <i>have</i> too, you fucking moron! It's called a <i>bluff,</i> and after finding himself in <i>your</i> body he won't dare call it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd argue some more, but a glow catches your eye, and your sphincter tightens to see the mask has reappeared on Gordon's face. And that decides it for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go find another open portable,\" Caleb says, and thrusts his bag and Gordon's mask at you. \"You'll hide and change in there while I take care of him in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe portable next door is also unlocked, and Caleb tells you to undress there and wait. He packed the sealant in his bag as well, so while you sit, shivering, in a creaky old desk, you paint the inside of Gordon's mask with the lacquer. You're about halfway done when Caleb comes in to collect your things and to dump Gordon's. When he comes back a few minutes later, he finds you contemplating Gordon's clothes. \"Why aren't you in those yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause, truth to tell, you're a little daunted by them; they remind you of the scale of what you're being forced to do, because they are made for a guy who is at least half a foot tall than you, and who even at that height is built on a much more massive scale. Leaving aside the underwear (ick) there are the red cotton athletic shorts that are as long as your torso; a gray muscle shirt whose hem would likely drop below your butt; flag-like ankle socks and canoe-like athletic shoes. They all have a stink on them: the stink of alpha jock/bully. \"Move it, Will,\" Caleb barks. \"I just put your mask on that fucker, and he's going to be waking up before you do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop behind the teacher's desk at the front of the portable, and Caleb hands you the mask. With a deep breath you press it to your face. The world dims and darks, and you sink backward into a viscous sea of nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're grunting and snorting and swallowing as you wake, as though you're emerging from deep water. That is what it feels like, and even when you are out of it there is a fog in your head. You shake it loose and sit up stiffly. You can't see much, but\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour knees are enormous. You're used to your own skinny ones, but these are round like coconuts; and instead of sticking out like a knob that joins shank and thigh, these are firmly embedded between meaty thighs and calves. Fuck, they actually look like joints in a well-built limb\u2014a leg\u2014and not like a knot of rubber bands connecting two sticks. And your feet seem very far away. But when you sit all the way up and stretch toward them\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your astonishment your arms actually go that far, though you have to bend almost double, putting your face to your knees. You pull and stretch, and it feels very good. You sit back up again and draw a deep breath, and your chest keeps filling and filling and filling. You rest a palm over one pectoral: it's a thick dome of meat, as big and firm as the weight on a barbell. You roll your shoulder and experimentally flex a bicep; a great bulge swells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over the top of the desk. Caleb is at the window, peering out through a crack in the Venetian blinds. Slowly, quietly, you get to your feet, and sway a little when you're up, for it's like you're standing on top of a step stool. You can see the crown of Caleb's head from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor creaks beneath you. Caleb glances over, flinches back. \"Jesus, you scared me,\" he hisses. He peers at you. \"Are you in there, Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where else would I be? Have you seen\u2014? Has Gordon come out yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Maybe he's getting dressed or freaking out.\" His attention wavers between you and the window. \"Well, you look like you've got everything,\" he says. \"So how about getting dressed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's the matter of a minute, though you take it slowly: underwear, shorts, shirt, socks and shoes. Wallet and keys are on a desk; you slip them into your pockets after briefly contemplating Gordon Black's dead-eyed scowl in the driver's license. You pay as little attention to Black as you can, but it occurs to you now that you've never seen him looking happy. Which is funny, considering what a big man he is on campus, and how he has a hot girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb has a fearful expression as he gazes at you. \"Christ, you look just like him. I can barely keep from shitting myself just to have you looking at me.\" He does a double-take at the window. \"Sh! There he is!\" he hisses. You step to the window, but can only barely make out the figure that has crept from the portable across the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's you\u2014Will Prescott. He's bare-headed and hunched over, and he looks left to right before stepping out of the door to the portable. His expression is tense\u2014freaked out, really\u2014and he scratches his cheek, then looks down at his fingers with loathing. Gingerly, he lofts his backpack onto his shoulder, hangs his cap on his hair, and as though treading on egg shells creeps back toward the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give him a few minutes,\" Caleb says. \"Then I'll go out and circle around and catch up to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to tell him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, not right away. I'll tell him I heard about Gordon\u2014you\u2014hauling him back here for a beating. I'll play it from there depending on what he says. If he tries faking it through as you, I'll help him without letting him know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who's going to help me?\" you ask. This was always the flaw in Caleb's plan. \"I don't know jack shit about Gordon Black. His classes or where he lives\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be scary,\" Caleb says. \"You're making a good start on that. You know what he drives, though. Maybe you should ditch school entirely, go off and get acquainted with his shit. You probably don't want the other guy spotting you right away.\" You don't reply, and he doesn't wait for you to decide. \"Okay, I'm heading out. Call me tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swings his pack onto his shoulder and leaves, abandoning you to your new situation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's no way you're going to head into Gordon Black's life without preparation, but that doesn't mean you have to ditch school. So you just raise the blinds to let some light into the portable, and squat in a desk with Gordon's backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're surprised at how neatly his notes are organized\u2014more neatly than yours. Times and period numbers aren't recorded, but he's got Spanish, Psychology, US History, Career Planning, and something called CAD Technology. You've had the history class before; it looks like he's taking the beginning Spanish and psychology classes; you also have that bullshit \"Career Planning\" class on your schedule, with the same teacher, just at a different time. So at school, the challenge is going to be the mysterious \"CAD Technology\" class and Gordon's athletics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit.</i> You've got Gordon's body, but not his memories. But what about his basketball skills?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance out the window at the sound of loose chatter and shrill laughter. Dane Matthias, Adrian Semple, and Karl Hennepin come into view. Dane wobbles toward the portable across the way, but Karl opens the door to yours, and his eyes lock onto your face. You say nothing; he says, \"Oh, shit,\" and slams the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeads bob outside, and Semple catches you watching through the window. Like Hennepin, he looks quickly away. He and the others disappear into the other portable. You return to Gordon's bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his wallet are about twenty dollars in bills. His cell phone has a dozen or more numbers in the address book: two obviously belonging to his parents; one belonging to Chelsea; most of the rest belonging to people you associate with the basketball team: Steve Patterson, Seth Javits, Jeremy Richards, Jonas Martin, Luke Bennett, Darren Green. Etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return everything to his bag and ponder. What do you know about Gordon Black, and what do you need to find out? You know where he lives, and you know what he drives\u2014a very incongruous classic VW Bug, orange in color\u2014and you know what some of his classes are. He's dating Chelsea Cooper, the cunt who got you into this predicament by taking your teasing so personally. He captains the basketball squad, and you usually see him hanging out with Patterson and Lynch and Javits and Chelsea. He has basketball practice before and after school. He shoves people around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't know his schedule and you don't know where his locker is and you don't know its combination. You don't know if he has a job or where he works. You don't know anything about his family life or how he acts when he's alone with his friends. You don't know his hobbies or his likes or dislikes. You don't know if he plays any musical instruments, or if he has any mechanical aptitudes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh yeah.</i> He also has access to a loft over the gym: the fabled \"fuck room\" where he and a privileged few can hang out and do God knows what but all can guess. You pull out the lanyard with Gordon's keys on the end. House keys, car keys, keys to padlocks, and keys that look like they go to special deadbolts. At least one of these can get you into the loft, and you've a strong desire to see what's up there. And it will be a safer spot than this portable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wedge Gordon's ball cap onto your head\u2014backward the way you've always seen him wear it\u2014and sling his pack onto your shoulder. It has at least as many books as yours, but it feels much lighter. You duck outside, glance to see that the coast is clear, and trudge off toward the gym. The ground seems very far away, but you don't stumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings as you're walking along, but if Caleb has done his job right, the real Gordon should be on the other side of the school building in one of your classes. You pass the tennis courts and natatorium and approach the gym at its side entrance. The floor is empty, but students are coming and going through double-doors at the front. Your gut clenches when you recognize some of the basketball players leaving, including Patterson. <i>What did you miss?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stairs leading up to the loft are to your left, by the folded-up bleachers, and they creak beneath your feet. At the top, around a corner, is a small landing with a wooden door. The white paint is badly peeling from it, and it has an old deadbolt up high, near your shoulder\u2014what would be eye level to anyone but a Goliath like Gordon. You fish out the lanyard and test a few keys before finding the right one. You push the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loft is fairly narrow, maybe twenty feet deep, but it runs all along the side of the gym. Wooden beams support a ceiling that slopes down to a line of windows just below the rafters, which are so close\u2014and you're so tall\u2014that you probably could palm them without having to raise yourself on tip toes. The floor is a jumble of big wooden crates and cardboard boxes; of broken-down gymnastic equipment; of metal pipes and other hardware that's been thrust into corners. There's an open space in the middle of the loft that has a couple of gym mats laying out; they are ripped in spots, showing yellowed stuffing. Nearby is a dorm-size refrigerator, its black cord trailing over to a wall under the window, and an open cardboard box. A garbage sack contains some old pizza boxes and beer cans and bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeer? You kneel at the fridge, and find it contains three six packs. It's a cheap brew, but\u2014 With a transgressive thrill you crack open one of the golden cans. You sip, and swallow, and chug back half the contents. <i>Cheers, man!</i> You wipe your mouth on the hem of your shirt\u2014as you imagine Gordon would\u2014and give a contented sigh. Before going any further, you close and lock the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snoop inside some of the crates, and only find more equipment, some athletic, some scientific, some simple classroom supplies. The cardboard boxes contain lots and lots of old textbooks, for the most part. The great exception is the open box next to the gym mats. It contains lots and lots of porn, ranging from soft-core to the very, very hard. It also contains boxes of condoms, bottles of whiskey and vodka, packs of gum, and a carton of cigarettes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it's very nearly the clubhouse of your dreams. You sit and lean against a wooden pillar and stretch your legs. So here you are: In the body of the biggest bad-ass in school, screwing the head cheerleader (judging by the condoms), sitting in any teenage boy's idea of heaven. If Caleb is right, you'll have a couple of days to enjoy it before you have to give it back to its rightful proprietor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProvided you don't screw it up somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe tardy bell rings for the last period of the day, and you look up from the porn magazine. Forty-five minutes until the last bell, and then you'll have to see if you can fake your way through after-school basketball practice. Maybe you should leave before then. Would you get in trouble if you skipped practice? On the other hand, does it matter? You can get Gordon into as much trouble as you want, if you're going to be putting him back in a few days. But screwing things up might make your stay here unnecessarily unpleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you temporize, you hear footsteps outside. The door handle jiggles, and there's a soft knock. \"Gordon?\" a voice calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Chelsea?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scramble up, but the lock is already turning before you reach the door. You open it with a jerk, and Chelsea stumbles in. She catches herself against you, putting her hands on your hips, and looks up into your face. She smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost faint. You would climb mountains, slay dragons, put your hand inside a fiery furnace just to have that smile turned on you. It transforms her whole face. For one thing, it gives her dimples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a light in her eyes, a light of adoration and ardor. She gazes deeply into your eyes, and you gaze deeply back into hers. The longer you stare, the more deeply rapt her expression grows. And the more deeply rapt she stares at you, the stiffer your cock gets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, she buries her face in your chest and rubs her face in your shirt. \"I looked for you at Fernandez's classroom, but you weren't there. And you weren't in the library. So I knew you'd be up here,\" she says. She squeezes you gently, and you put your arms around her. \"You must have done a really good job on that little shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Right. So that's what this about. Gratitude for killing \"Will Prescott.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything to him, not really, not what anyone could see,\" you reply. \"I just scared him, made him cry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles. \"Did you? Did you make him say he was sorry? Over and over again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. In fact,\" you add, improvising, \"I made him invent new ways of saying it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you hurt him at least a little bit, pookie. I mean, those things that he said about me.\" She looks up, and her expression has completely changed: Her eyes are red, and she appears about to burst into tears. She sniffles hard, and a little gasp comes into her voice. \"I've never heard\u2014 Anyone\u2014 Say those things to me.\" Tears slip down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it to him again tomorrow, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow.\" She grabs you behind the shoulders and lifts herself up to eye level, wrapping strong legs about your hips. \"Right now, though, I know what you deserve. And I'm <i>aching</i> to give it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stifle a yelp. Caleb thinks he can talk Gordon into leaving you alone after you switch back. But would Gordon really not kill you if he found out that you fucked his girlfriend?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chelsea shudders in your arms, and that shatters the last of your resistance. You step back and sink onto the gym mats. Chelsea kisses the side of your throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what she expects of you. Never mind what Gordon does with her; you still remember the way Eva laughed when you kissed her the other night. Still, you've got to do something? Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tug at the hem of Chelsea's sweater, but she squirms away. \"Not like that,\" she says sharply, and grabs your hands. \"This is for <i>you,</i> pookie, all for <i>you.</i>\" She sits back and grins, and pulls at the bottoms of your shorts. They catch on your swollen cock, but\u2014and this is practically a first in your own personal experience\u2014she doesn't gag at the sight of your obvious erection. She pulls the shorts below your knees, then she pulls your underwear down. She lifts the hem of your shirt, and you help her pull it halfway over your shoulder to get it out of the way. You spread your legs and lean back, and she hunches between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience is warm, and wet and frictive, and she uses her mouth and her tongue and her cheek and her soft palm and gentle fingertips. Trembling spasms run from somewhere deep between your hips up to the peak of the shaft, with reciprocal shivers running up and down your spine. You are, briefly, aware of the comical way you are gasping, opening and closing your mouth like a drowning fish. Your hands, what do you do with your hands? You settle for clenching the back of your head. How and when to come to climax is not within your control, but your terror of doing it wrong keeps pushing the moment back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, either you can't stand it or she touches the right button, but something down there comes into focus: idiotically, a picture forms in your mind of the Death Star's firing sequence. You make some kind of noise, and Chelsea recognizes it as a sign or she reads the vibrations down below, for she unwraps her tongue from its business and takes your cock lightly in her hand, massaging it in time to your spasmodic eruptions. When it's over you lay back, heaving and gasping and wheezing. There are some tissues in the supply box, and she quickly gets you cleaned up. After throwing the tissues away, she drops the shorts over your crotch and crawls into your lap, wrapping her arms around your torso and laying her head on your chest. \"You take such good care of me, Gordon,\" she croons. \"I love you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yikes.</i> And you are supposed to say in reply? Gordon would likely say? \"I love you too,\" you croak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raises her head sharply and stares at you. Her face is so close you can't make out her expression. Then she presses her face into your chest and rubs it hard with her nose and cheeks. She hugs you tightly. And you start to get aroused again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do tonight?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. What do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for a walk up in Sutton Wilderness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or there's the TCK Grill.\" She raises her head. \"You and me and Gloria, and Rachel Burton\u2014we haven't been out with her in a while. I'll tell her to bring someone else.\" She grows more excited. \"I'll tell Gloria, too. We can make it, like, a triple date! Unless\u2014 Is there someone you wanna bring along, one of the guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy as long as you're there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeals softly and wriggles in your lap. \"You are being so sweet today, pookie.\" She puts her head back on your chest. \"Can we just sit here like this until it's time for practice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSitting together doesn't mean sitting quietly, though, for Chelsea prattles on and on. Apparently she doesn't expect you to make any comments, and is satisfied with the occasional grunt from you. It's a lot of gossiping and complaining. Most of the names you are familiar with, but little of it means anything to you. Until Eva Garner's name comes up. \"You know, it's her fault you had do that thing today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was talking to her when he barged in. Just said down, it was incredibly rude, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how's it Eva's fault?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because of what I was telling you about, how she's such a tease. You wouldn't believe it if you saw him, he's even stupider looking than the guy you had to\u2014 Who came in and said those horrible things to me. Anyway, that guy, I guess he's a friend of the guy Eva is stringing along, and he comes into the library and he's telling her she'd better not be fucking around with his friend, and threatening her and stuff, you know? And you can't just do that, that's <i>harassment.</i> So I'm telling him what he's doing is wrong and how Eva, I'm sure she'll figure out she shouldn't tease that other guy. Anyway, then this guy just cranks it up to ten with me.\" She sighs. \"I <i>guess</i> he's trying to be loyal to his friend, I suppose.\" She clucks her tongue. \"Maybe I should just let Eva and whatsisnuts\u2014\" She snickers and repeats the word \"whatsisnuts. \"Maybe I should just let them mess around with each other. She'll get burned good if he's anything like his friend today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know it's a mistake even as you say it, but you say it anyway: \"Well, what if Eva and this guy hit it off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts her head to stare at you. \"That's <i>not</i> going to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes all kinds. You see some funny couples around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes narrow. \"Would you like to see a friend of <i>that guy</i>\u2014\" And it's clear that \"that guy\" is Will Prescott. \"A friend of <i>him</i> dating a friend of ours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's a point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puts her head back on your chest. Then she sits back up. \"If I pointed him out to you,\" she says in a light singsong, \"do you think you could convince that guy it's a bad idea to be seeing Eva? I mean, him and his friend are obviously peas in a pod.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like\u2014?\" <i>Of course that's what she means.</i> \"But if you're right they'll just break up anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm right. But like you said, sometimes you see these funny couples. And Eva's\u2014 Well, she and her sister get these ideas. Gag, it must be because they're twins, they each get only half a good thought. But Eva might get it into her head to make some kind of example by pretending this guy is her boyfriend. Like it's just so cool of her. And then we'd be stuck with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let it go,\" you say stubbornly. \"Leave Eva and this guy alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurt and disappointment wash over her face. \"I don't ask much of you, Gordon,\" she says. \"Like, I don't ask you to do anything about Seth and Cindy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with Seth and Cindy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scarlet band shows across her forehead. \"Jesus, Gordon! It's not like I haven't told you almost five thousand <i>fucking</i> times with them,\" she shrieks. \"If my opinion\u2014 If everything I say to you\u2014\" She gets up and glares down at you; her complexion has curdled. \"It really is in one ear and out the other with you! Except it isn't! Yeah, fuck me!\" She stabs her at her own chest. \"Fuck me for looking out for you! Fuck me for worrying about you!\" Tears spring into her eyes, but she shows you her teeth. \"Well, fuck you too!\" She kicks you savagely. \"And put on some goddam clothes!\" She storms out, slamming the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took all this calmly, for you don't know how else to take it. Anyway, it isn't like Gordon can't be even more enraged at you for getting his girlfriend pissed at him. Not after you let her suck you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whoa, that's right!</i> Chelsea Cooper sucked you off! You put your arm behind your head and relax with a highly satisfied smile until the final bell rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're still in this attitude when you again hear footsteps on the stairs. They sound quickly, far too quickly for you to get dressed again, so it's with your shorts only draped across your lap that Steve Patterson finds you when he comes in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you feel completely naked. Which you practically are, of course. But this is worse. For several seconds you are convinced that he can see through the mask and see who you really are. You don't relax even when he leans against the door jamb. \"Well, look who got laid,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to maintain a poker face\u2014very hard, considering the glacier that's precipitating in your guts under Patterson's icy gaze\u2014and say nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you coming down to practice or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll skip. I actually don't feel good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself, but for God's sake don't tell Chelsea she made you sick.\" He goes back downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your clothes back on, which is good, because ten minutes later, after the noise of practice starts\u2014lots of balls slapping and yelling\u2014the door opens again and Jason Lynch comes in. \"Yo, what're you doing up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when it occurs to you that maybe you should switch masks with Caleb. Let him bloody well deal with Lynch and Patterson and Chelsea (especially since the latter is now mad at you) and these psychos; after all, he's the one that got you into this mess. Besides, you did a pretty good job of playing \"Caleb Johansson,\" and in that role you'd be better placed to guide Gordon through the role of playing <i>you.</i></span></div></div>",

Sure, you've been caught in the bathroom by him, and if he's with Javits when Javits decides to torment Tilley, then Lynch might amuse himself with you. But it's not like he knows your name. You, on the other hand, know well the glint in his eye and his grin: it's like the glint of metal on the tip of an aluminum bat being swung at your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's got that glint now, and you have to strain not to flinch from it. You shouldn't be scared of him: he's friends with Gordon Black and, anyway, Black is almost a foot taller than him.

He pulls out one title for himself, and offers you another, which you decline. \"You <i>must</i> be feeling bad,\" he chortles. You just keep quiet: a strategy that has worked so far today. But finally you are forced into something like a conversation when he says, \"Oh, hey, Fernandez gave us some homework.

You lucky dog.\" He scampers out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he's gone, you quickly take out the phone and call Caleb. \"Hey there yourself,\" he chirps in reply to your greeting. \"Yeah, I got that, uh, that project almost done, you know, for class. I'll call you back in a bit, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but I also wanna\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, later dude.\" He hangs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe Gordon was with him,</i> you speculate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nLynch takes almost fifteen minutes to return, and he's got some kind of a handout for you. He starts to make himself at home, but when you say something about wanting to get a little work done\u2014<i>alone</i>\u2014he retreats with gratifying speed from the loft. On a loose sheet of paper you scribble down some notes on Gordon's life for Caleb\u2014assuming he's willing to take it over for you, at least temporarily\u2014until the sounds from the gym below have quieted. You're on the point of trying to sneak out when there are again footsteps on the stairs, and Patterson comes back in. His hair is damp and there's a flush in his face. \"Fucking slugs,\" he says as he slams the door shut. \"We'll be lucky if Garson doesn't hand us our asses. Are you <i>better?</i>\" he asks sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to head home,\" you say, getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, fuck you too,\" he says as he bends by the refrigerator. \"I do you a fucking favor, so\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a phone call and I have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" He slams the refrigerator shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou worry about additional gauntlets to run between the gym and the car, but things are well emptied out by now. You squeeze into the Bug's cabin and think about where to go. You can't decide, and just drive around until Caleb calls you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nDeep suspicion etches your friend's face. \"Why would you wanna give up a sweet gig like this?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna give it up,\" you say, not quite dishonestly. \"We could share it. Trade days off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? So why don't we talk tomorrow afternoon after school? That'd give you a full day before\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How soon were you gonna tell Gordon what's going on? How did you deal with him today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I caught up to him and dropped some big hints about which classes he was supposed to go to, arranged for him to come over to my house afterward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not at Caleb's house now, but are in the basement of the elementary school. It might be dangerous, being in the neighborhood where Gordon is temporarily living, but it's out of the public eye. \"How was he acting?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real quiet. He didn't freak out or anything, didn't run around trying to tell people who he was, that I could tell. He gave me some funny looks a couple of times, like maybe he thought I had something to do with it. But he didn't say anything much. He asked a couple of questions that were kind of leading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he going to be able to handle it at my house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what you're worried about, that I can't keep him out of trouble? I think I can do a better job of it. You'll just crowd him because you're so panicked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll stick it out here then,\" you shrug. \"Since you don't want Chelsea Cooper giving you blow jobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea Cooper isn't\u2014\" His face falls. \"Is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean 'Did she?' don't you? And the answer is, 'Uh huh'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When?\" he croaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sixth period, up in that loft. I went up there after you left, and she came in. And she sucked me off and then we spooned until the bell rang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb turns a bright red, and his nostrils twitch. \"What's the catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch is that maybe you have to go out with her tonight, with Kendra and Rachel Burton and a couple of guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ain't bad.\" Still, he looks suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. And I even made up a list of all the stuff I figured out about him.\" You hand him that piece of paper. \"And you can probably find out a lot more at his house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't get why you're willing to give it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost come clean with him, that the stress of pretending around Chelsea and Patterson and Lynch was more than you want to handle in one day. But that'll probably only make him more suspicious. Anyway, you <i>don't</i> want to give up the Gordon-gig totally, and would like it back. \"I had a good afternoon,\" you say. \"And I don't wanna hog things. I had my fair share right away. You take things over until tomorrow after school, and then unless you've set up another blow job with Chelsea, I'll take over again for a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there aren't any catches?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only catch I can see,\" you say, \"is that I don't know how we're gonna handle the basketball stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Can't you handle a ball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you confess. \"I didn't have time to find out, and I just told everyone I was sick and sat it out up in the loft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. So I guess that'll be one of my projects tonight, figuring out\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Of course, if I find out you're pulling some kind of double-cross, I'll be in Gordon's body and I'll be able to fuck you up good.\" He opens a desk and takes out a mask. \"Put that in Gordon's bag, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a copy of Chelsea, naturally,\" he chortles. \"I cancelled the date with Umeko last night and finished up the other two masks. In fact\u2014\" He takes out a second mask. \"Pack this too, in case Gordon has a little brother or sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confession about Umeko reminds you: \"What is, uh, Will going to do about his date tonight with Lisa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb shrugs. \"Up to you. I 'reminded' him of it this afternoon, but I don't know if he's gonna follow through. I guess it's up to you whether to give him another push, or maybe pull him back. If you're gonna do anything, though, we better get switched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nCaleb masks and dresses as Gordon, and you get a sense of what he went through when you awoke in Gordon's body: the intimidating size and implied violence that comes with seeing him up close. He sways a little on his feet, and stumbles on the steps as he goes out. Then you drop his mask onto your face. And when you wake, you ponder whether to go see your best friend, Will Prescott.</span></div></div>",

After going back \"home\" and eating with your \"mother\"\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring which you entertain her by talking a lot about school, and about Will and Keith and other friends, and about teachers and assignments: stories not all of which are untrue\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dealing with home life you drive out to the IHOP for some coffee and to do some kind of studying, since it looks like you're going to be responsible for much of Caleb's homework for the rest of the week. <i>Just get through Friday,</i> you tell yourself as you try to make sense of the Calculus. <i>Then we'll have a talk with Gordon after school, give him the weekend to cool down, and go back to something more normal.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope you have a normal life to go back to. Not just with your parents, but with Lisa. That's the \"compromise\" you've made with yourself: after giving \"Will\" and Lisa time to get together at the library, you'll sneak over there to have at least a quick peek to see if they're there and what they're getting up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo way they'll be getting up to what you and Chelsea got up to, you kind of hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't intend to be at IHOP long, but you're there long enough to get caught. As you're bent over one of the harder problems, pulling at your hair, a hand firmly claps your shoulder. \"So this is the secret of your natural brilliance,\" Carson Ioeger says, and slips into the booth across from you. \"Lots of studying and lots of caffeine.\" James Lamont slides in next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're a contrast, if not much of one. Both are tall and skinny, but Ioeger has blonde, frizzy hair that looks unhealthy for often being wrapped under a bandana, while Lamont's hair is dark and only slightly disordered. Ioeger's grin is devilish; Lamont's is tighter, more modest. Both dress down in t-shirts and jeans, though tonight, as a precaution against falling temperatures, Lamont is wearing a blue fleece jacket. Smart guys, both of them, but not in the well-scrubbed, hyper-ambitious style of Mansfield or the other AP snots. Much more like Caleb himself, with whom they share several classes, including AP Physics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's what they want to talk to you about, to your dismay. \"What did we miss in Krohling?\" Ioeger asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, weren't you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look at each other and guffaw. \"So you didn't notice?\" Lamont asks. \"I hope Krohling didn't notice either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you didn't notice: You were up in the loft with Chelsea that hour and Caleb was playing his own part. \"Uh, same stuff as before, I guess,\" you say, and rummage through Caleb's pack for the books and notes. \"But a little more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what was the homework assignment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flip through his notes until you find the physics section, and thrust it at them. Meanwhile, Ioeger has craned his neck to look at the math you're working on. \"Jeez, man, they spike your coffee or something?\" He grabs your current sheet and turns it around. \"What happened to your handwriting?\" He shows it to James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snatch it back. \"I'm just, you know, scribbling things out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that right.\" Ioeger nudges his friend. \"Aren't you the one always going on about how neat Johansson's handwriting is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have mentioned it once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where were you guys last period?\" you hastily ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being sick,\" says James, and Carson keels to the side with asthmatic laughter. \"We'll tell you about it sometime. After we graduate. From graduate school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sends Ioeger into another brief spasm of intense laughter. \"Oh but seriously,\" he says as he straightens up again. \"That reminds me.\" He puts his elbows on the table and peers intently at you. \"How's Prescott doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain races in about six different directions at once but reaches no conclusions. \"Should he be in any trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIoeger cocks an eyebrow. \"No psychological damage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two look at each other. Then Carson leans forward. \"We heard Gordon Black took him off behind the portables at lunch,\" he says quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. That. How did you hear\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, man, there were only about a hundred kids who saw them. You know Gordon, he always puts on a show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will's fine,\" you tell them. \"I think Gordon just put that show on to give him a scare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he do to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't there. And Will didn't say anything to me about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't look traumatized?\" James asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure how to play this; there might be advantages to being \"traumatized\" when you get your life back. \"I dunno. Maybe something <i>did</i> happen. He didn't say much to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey share another glance. \"Obviously it would be best if nothing did happen,\" Carson observes slowly. \"Do you know what it was about? James and I have a lot of experience with Gordon, but isn't this a first for Prescott?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure you want them investigating that whole incident. \"I think it had something to do with Chelsea,\" you say. And you instantly regret it when they high-five each other. \"What was that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you later,\" says Carson, and pushes James toward the aisle. \"After we graduate. From a ten-year post-doctoral fellowship. In Australia. Can we borrow this?\" He brandishes the physics notes. \"Awesome, we'll be over there if you need to pick them up.\" He and Lamont duck into the closed-off smoking section of the restaurant, and through the glass partition you watch as they lean in toward each other over a table, passing a single cigarette back and forth as they talk intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThat blows your concentration, and after checking the time you decide to make that stop to look in on Lisa and her date. You leave without getting those notes back from the other two\u2014through the glass you mime that they can keep them until tomorrow\u2014and drive over to the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front doors of the Saratoga Falls Municipal Library open into a short breezeway and then into a vast, open semi-circle containing the periodicals section; this \"old people's pit\", as you and your friends call it, is flanked on two sides by doors leading into the wings that contain the actual stacks. It's rare to find any teenagers studying in the periodicals section, but you at least are able to survey it quickly to confirm that \"Will\" and Lisa are not there. Then you move into the wings to see if they are in the other study areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of searching, you find them at the very back of the south wing, at one of a set of three tables by a bay window that overlooks a side courtyard. Lisa, looking very pretty in a purple blouse, sits with her elbows on the table and a pencil in her hand. Your substitute hunches in the seat opposite, hands under the table, staring intently at her. His cap is on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly step into the stacks before they can see you, and edge your way around until you are behind the shelf nearest them. From this vantage point you can catch most of what they say without being seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there's little you can hear. Lisa's voice is soft, and Will talks in a low mutter. When your ears adjust, you can still barely make them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill: \"But what are you going to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa: \"Find work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill: \"Like what? What can you do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's voice drops too low to hear, except the word \"teaching.\" Then: \"\u2014taking that career planning class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tss. Bullshit. Only reason I'm in it is because\u2014 There are all those guys out there that know what they're going to do, and how to get to it. And I don't. But that bullshit class isn't telling me anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not <i>going</i> to tell you anything, Will. It's just supposed to tell you how to figure those things out for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour doppelganger's voice dips into a peevish mumble, and Lisa's voice becomes impatient, as they talk about jobs and employment and education and ambition, with Will evincing a mulish and resentful inability to figure out what he wants from life, and Lisa sounding more and more disappointed by these confessions. You are soon ready to flee in horror, but the fascination of the ongoing train wreck keeps you rooted in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're stuck in this attitude when low voices sound behind you. You don't recognize them, though, until they're upon you, when to your horror you see Carson and James walking past. They don't see you, being concentrated on Lisa and Will. \"'Lo you two,\" Carson says. \"Imagine meeting you here.\" Lisa returns the greeting; if Will says something you can't hear it. Voices overlap, so that though they're loud enough you can't disentangle the words. When they do simplify:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"\u2014worried after hearing about you and Black. So what did he do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"I'm sure he's done it to us. Black's ingenious, but even he repeats himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson: \"Did he have Patterson or Lynch with him? Anyone? Then it couldn't have been the Indian rope trick. Any bruises on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill: \"\u2014fucker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson: \"Hey hey, sorry, I won't touch. Is it tender, is that where he\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill: \"He didn't do anything, alright? He just shoved me inside one of the portables.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson: \"No. Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"Did he at least tell you what your blasphemy was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa: \"Will, did you\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"He didn't say anything about Chelsea? Whoa. 'Cos you know that's what it was about, right? What did you say to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa: \"What are you guys talking about? Will, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson: \"Ask Eva, she was there. I just wanna hear Prescott's side of it. Because according to Eva, Will here dropped some major tonnage on Chelsea, and then Gordon hustled him out to the portables and then didn't do anything. Which is pretty damn ballsy of Black if true, since he got a blow job from Chelsea out of it.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's a silence from the group, then a confused conversation breaks out. Lisa's voice rings out clearly: \"This is pointless, and I'm leaving.\" No one asks her to stay, and a minute later you glimpse her stalking away. Then you hear Carson: \"You're basically one of us now, so I'll tell you.\" But though you lean in to listen, his voice drops so low you can't make out the words. He buzzes this way for awhile, with the occasional word from James. Will's voice rises at one point: \"So what have you heard?\" He sounds incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this and that. You don't want to hear it when they've got female company up there being, you know, <i>female company,</i>\" says Carson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the fucking jock talk is pretty boring, though sometimes hilarious. Jesus, the testosterone practically drips through the floorboards,\" says James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the best stuff is when Chelsea is on the rag,\" Carson says. \"Oh man, some of the things she says to Gordon when she gets mad at him. It's always about her, and all the things she does for him, and how he doesn't appreciate her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, he appreciates her for exactly what she's worth,\" says James. \"Gordon might have muscle tissue where his cerebral cortex ought to be, but he's not a moron where <i>she's</i> concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And listening to her talk about her friends.\" Carson laughs. \"Gordon doesn't even say anything about that, just lets her go on and on, blah blah blah. I'd love to see the expression on his face, he's probably so bored by it. But come on, we've told you about this stuff, and we'll show you how to get in if you want. But what did he <i>do</i> to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tense, wondering what \"Will\" is going to say. It's pretty clear that Carson and James have found a way to eavesdrop on Gordon and Chelsea\u2014that's got to be the big secret they were talking about at the IHOP\u2014and you can't imagine what Gordon is likely to say in reply to it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it does shock you when he only says, \"Nothing. He, uh, carried me out to the portables and he slammed me against the wall of one of them. And then\u2014\" Silence. \"Then he shoved me into one of the portables.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long silence. James, when he speaks, sounds very intense. \"Really? Because if he did something really, uh, illegal to you, Will\u2014\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following silence sounds very uncomfortable. And then you only know someone spoke because Will explodes: \"No! Oh, Jesus!\" Then a strange, soft sound, followed by a loud bark by Carson: \"Hey, quit it! You\u2014 Goddamn it, Will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the fuck away from me,\" Will yells. \"Cocksucking sons of bitches!\" More of those soft sounds, which you now recognize as body blows of some kind, accompanied by more yelling by Carson and James. You retreat to a corner behind another shelf, and peek out. Carson and James, moving at a near run, retreat, with James nursing the side of his head. From Will's direction comes a long, choking stream of curses. You edge away, down the side wall, and find a hiding spot, where you sit for ten minutes before carefully venturing back out. You think you make it outside without being spotted; certainly you don't spot anyone you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou spend a sleepless night worrying about the morrow. What will your replacement do at school? How will he act? Will he even show up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide that you'll play it cool with him, treating things as though they're normal, but being patient with him if starts acting like he did last night with James and Carson. You get to the school early, and hang around close to the parking lot watching for your truck. It doesn't pull in until about five minutes before the bell would ring. You saunter out to meet him. \"Cutting it kind of close this morning, aren't you?\" you ask with what you hope is a careless insouciance. Will just gives you a dark look and mutters something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gamble on bringing up the subject of Carson and James: \"Unless you especially wanna hang around with Jenny or Paul, let's just go off the two of us at lunch, maybe with Tilley. I've been seeing too much of Ioeger and Lamont lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks over at you sharply. \"Why do you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? 'Cos it's true?\" You affect a blank ignorance of any other possible reason. \"I ran into 'em at IHOP yesterday. They begged some notes off me and were pumping me about\u2014 Well, about you and Black yesterday. Fuck 'em for being nosy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eye is hot, and his lip is curled back, and he shows his teeth as he breathes through his mouth. It's not a look you're used to seeing on your friends' faces, and you doubt it's one you often show them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I figure they might try asking <i>you</i> about it, and I kind of figure you might not want them to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes narrow. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Do you? They've got lots of experience with Black and them, maybe you do wanna talk to them. But they can be kind of jerks about things, and they kind of pissed <i>me</i> off yesterday while talking about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares at you as you a little longer. \"That's fine,\" he says. \"I'm sick of them too.\" He starts trudging toward the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how was your date last night with Lisa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make any progress with her?\" You nudge him. \"Is Mansfield yesterday's news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says nothing for minute. Then: \"We got interrupted and she left. I don't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop cold. \"You don't\u2014?\" He stops and stares dully back at you. You resume walking. \"Well, shit, man. If you wanna talk about it at lunch\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's a tough life,\" you casually observe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nLisa coos and giggles at Geoff before and after Walberg's class, which would royally piss you off if you didn't have much bigger worries about the guy slumping in the chair the next row over. Walberg speaks sharply to him once, but Will just shrugs and slumps lower in his chair. After first period you give him a little nudge toward his second period class (\"Hope you do better in Hawks's Film class\") and go to Caleb's AP Calculus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames is in there, and he's got a big purple bruise on his upper cheek. \"What happened to you?\" you ask. It must be from Will last night, but you can hardly believe someone with your old body has the capacity to put that kind of mark on someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ran into someone who didn't want to run into me,\" James says without looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't Gordon Black, was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff. <i>No.</i> And I don't want to talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGelding's Chemistry is next, and you're really dreading it, for it will be the first time you've been to it: on Monday you skipped, and on Tuesday and Wednesday Caleb took it back over. But something intervenes before then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go looking for Will, so you can prod him toward the Career Planning class you've got third period, and you've just glimpsed his head in the mass when he abruptly vanishes. There are some shouts, and a girl shrieks. You push forward, fighting a crowd that suddenly wants to be far away from where you're trying to get. When you break through, you see Will, pressed against a locker, with Jason Lynch grinning at him. \"\u2014teach you to talk nice to women folk,\" Lynch is chortling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's bad enough, and your sphincter tightens. But then comes the real surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill goes very red in the face, and launches a blizzard of blows at Lynch: sucker punches to the face, rabbit punches to the torso, even a knee to the groin. Lynch falls back\u2014clearly shocked\u2014and Will chases him, shoving him so that he trips over another student, landing on his back. Will drops atop him and with his fist tries turning the baseball players' face into hamburger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, at that moment a larger figure leaps in: Chris Ratliff, one of the football players, and a very big guy. He yanks Will back and closes him in a bear hug, and he kicks Lynch away when the latter tries to get up. Mr. Gelding, whose room is nearby, comes out, yelling hard. You backpedal,  not wanting to get caught up in it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you only get about ten feet down the wing when you run into a monolith of muscle: Gordon Black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seizes you and hustles you outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"We can't let him out <i>now!</i>\" you yell. In the back of your head you recognize how ridiculous it is that you're screaming at Gordon Black. But the front of your brain recognizes him as Caleb. And you're back in that silly portable, so you're both safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A guy who looks like <i>me</i> just tried punching Jason Lynch's head through the floor!\" you continue. \"And Gordon knows that Chelsea gave 'Gordon' a blow job yesterday, and that James and Carson have been eavesdropping on him! We're all <i>dead</i> if Gordon gets his body back. Especially <i>me!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you can continue as Gordon,\" Caleb yells back. \"Take it, all of it, 'cos I don't want it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna take over 'Will Prescott's' life?\" you demand. \"'Cos <i>I'm</i> not, not until\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let Gordon keep it. You just take over his spot and let me go back to being\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's wrong with Gordon's life? It can't be worse than\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His dad! And Chelsea! And Patterson! I had to fake pulling a muscle this morning because these stupid mitts of his\u2014\" He waves his arms about. \"I don't know how to run them. And maybe you don't care if Gordon fucks up your academic work, but you can't keep fucking up mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the door opens and a cheerful voice sounds. \"Ay! Guys,\" exclaims Dane Matthias. \"I thought I heard voices. You hangin' out here this period? Cool!\"</span></div></div>",

So even as Gordon barks, \"Get out of here, Matthias,\" you grasp Dane by the wrist and draw him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, come in here, glad to see you,\" you tell him, and give him a quick hug and slap on the back. You choke a little as you do so, for Dane smells like he's been burning a field of marijuana the size of Connecticut. You kick the door closed behind him. \"I saw you out here yesterday, wanted to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that's pretty freaky,\" he gasps. \"'Cos yesterday I was thinkin' about\u2014 Something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around his ear at Gordon, whose expression of incredulity and confusion is clear even in the dim interior of the portable. \"You have one of those blank masks with you?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he says slowly. \"One. I used the other to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't we\u2014\" You jab a finger three times at his face, then jab it three times at Dane. \"And then\u2014\" You jab a finger at Dane three times, then stab at your own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon's eyes go very round. \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you guys mind if I call Semple?\" says Dane. His mouth is muffled in your shoulder. \"Him and me were\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tighten your grip on Matthias. \"Come on dude, it's perfect,\" you say to Gordon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDane answers: \"Yeah, but\u2014 Oh, fuck me, I can't reach my phone.\" He wriggles weakly in your grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're out of your fucking mind,\" says Gordon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really, I can't,\" protests Dane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to him, listen how perfect it is,\" you say. \"He won't care where he winds up. And I can hide out as him, and you can go back to being\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Will! Listen to yourself! What about your own life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's already in the shitter! This is a perfect way for me to start over again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDane shifts his head, and his coarse hair rubs against your cheek. \"Hey, who's back there? I love you too, man, but I can't get to my clip\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only do this until we figure something else out,\" says Gordon as he unzips his pack. \"Maybe there's something in the book\u2014 We need to figure out that next spell.\" He takes out a mask, and you release Dane, who turns around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is that somethin' special?\" Dane asks as Gordon advances on him. \"I got some\u2014 I <i>think</i> I got some\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sinks heavily in your arms as Gordon puts the mask onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nA three-way swap follows, conducted at a frenzy. First you divest Dane of his usual costume: a t-shirt; a smelly, moth-eaten sports coat of ancient lineage; flannel pajama bottoms cut off just below the knee; and lace-less canvas sneakers. Then, while Caleb\u2014still in Gordon's form and garb\u2014watches the front door, you pull of Caleb's mask and clothes. Darkness hardly has a chance to enfold you when you're choking and gasping and sitting up: Caleb has pinched your nose shut and covered your mouth with his hand. He hands you a brush and a plastic container of sealant, and you huddle next to Dane until the mask comes out of him. Caleb returns to stand before the door. \"Who did you use that second mask on?\" you ask him as you paint the inner surface of Dane's mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea, of course,\" he says. \"She was mad at me when I got to her house, and she was <i>really</i> mad at me when I left. I thought you said she gave you a blow job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why was she yelling me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember. Something I said or I didn't say. Who were you planning on using the other mask on? I mean, you brought it today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Somebody, if I saw a chance. But then you saw one first. Jesus, Will, you are <i>really</i> fucking people up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You started it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take that tone with me, fucker. Maybe I started it, but I didn't let it get out of control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you did, when you jumped on Gordon. And <i>you</i> wanted to prank people with these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prank people, not fuck up their lives, and <i>definitely</i> not fuck up our own lives by arranging for permanent body swaps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you don't have to worry about that. Your career is okay, except for having missed Gelding's class today. Okay, I'm done here, I think.\" You blow on the inside of the mask. \"You better get out of that thing so we can get it on Dane before he wakes up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb stretches out on the floor down the middle of the portable. You lay your fingers across his brow, and pull. The change\u2014if it's visible at all\u2014can't be seen in the gloom, but where Gordon Black had been lying it's now Caleb Johansson. As he'd done to you, you pinch his nose and mouth shut, and he comes out of the swoon with fists flying. One of them hits Dane, who makes a soft noise, and you hastily slap Gordon's mask onto his face. The change is again invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily dress in Dane's clothes while Caleb pulls Gordon's clothes off and puts his own on. Then, near the front of the portable, he stands before the door while you hunch nearby and put the new mask to your face. Another dip into darkness\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah!\" you exclaim, then yelp as your hand strikes something hard. Caleb grunts. You open your eyes. Caleb is rubbing his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time for apologies. Caleb pulls you to your feet and thrusts Dane's canvas bag\u2014the one he brags about being made of hemp\u2014at you. The stench of burnt weed fills your nostrils as you sling it over your head and settle it on your shoulder. Caleb slaps you on the side of the face. \"Dope it up, man,\" he says. \"Remember who you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you are now Dane Matthias. And barring some unexpected shift in fortune, it looks like you'll be Dane Matthias for a good long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb looks outside first, then motions you that the coast is clear. Instead of following him, though, you dash over to the portable opposite and hide there. You've got a character to figure out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThere's nothing in your pockets except for two half-smoked joints, and you worry that you dropped things back in the other portable. But when you check Dane's bag you find a wallet and keys and a few loose bills. Either Dane has learned from bitter experience, or he just never got in the habit of littering his pockets, but he keeps everything safe inside this bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What else?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo surprise that there's a blunt and a couple of joints rolling around in the bottom, along with three lighters and a book of matches. Two spiral notebooks, containing ... lots and lots of doodles. The best-executed are some closely detailed abstract designs of mazes and spirals, inside some of which are scrawled some unsolved math equations or strings of letters. There are also some attempted portraits, mostly of naked girls, but those are much cruder and all are unfinished. There is no evidence of homework or class notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooks? A US history book, an algebra book, and a paperback sword-and-sorcery book. No clues about which particular classes these go with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cell phone. It has lots of calls in the call list, but only three numbers in its directory: Marianne Matthias, Dwayne Macaulay, and Sandy Rothstein. Lots of selfies, though. Dane's expression is a constant in most of them: wide grin behind a multi-day crop of whiskers, and glassy eyes beneath a tangle of reddish-brown hair. You turn the camera on yourself, as you had with Caleb's driver's license, and practice the expression you find in the photos. \"Hey. Ayy. Aaayyyyy! Dude. Oh, duuuuude.\" <i>What were some of the things he was saying earlier?</i> \"Oh man, I\u2014\" You blink and try again, working for a little more of the puppy-dog you often see in his eyes. \"Oh man, I can't reach my phone, I gotta call Semple.\" You turn your head this way and that, then close your eyes and roll your neck, loosening up. \"Ay, <i>cool,</i> I thought I heard voices in here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's enough of that.</i> You're just wasting time because you're nervous. And you're nervous because\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut off the phone and slump in the desk and try to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let it go, man.</i> You've no idea which classes you're supposed to have, which lunch period you're supposed to be at, what teachers you're supposed to have, which locker is supposed to be yours, or what its combination might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What, like, you think this is a problem?</i> You've seen Dane inside classrooms, so he doesn't spend the <i>entire</i> day skipping. But who expects him to be in them? And who'd lift an eyebrow if you ask them where you're supposed to be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just gotta be <i>baked</i> when you do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dip into the coat pocket for one of the joints, but something flashes by the window outside, distracting you. It's gone, whatever it was, but you hurry over to the window and look out. Across the way, the door to the portable where you left Dane is wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit.</i> Well, it was going to happen sooner or later anyway. But Dane Matthias is now loose in Gordon Black's body. You slip a joint between your lips and pat your pockets for a lighter. <i>Unh. They're in the bag.</i> You glance out the window, torn between curiosity to see what's going on out there, and a desire to stay under wraps should the real Dane freak out at seeing a fake one running around.</span></div></div>",

Let him get settled in to his new body and identity\u2014insofar as he <i>can</i> get settled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou light the joint and suck in an experimental breath, and explode in a hacking cough as the acrid fumes hit the back of your throat. Tears spring into your eyes. It's nearly a full minute before you catch your breath, and another minute before you can take another hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one goes down easier, and so does the next one, but that's all you want to chance at the moment. You pinch out the joint and return it to your pocket; and maybe it's your imagination, but you might feel a little dizzier, a little more disoriented. The harsh smell off Dane's clothes, which had faded a bit as you'd got used to it, bursts out again, refreshed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sling Dane's canvas bag over your neck and onto your shoulder as you step outside the portable. Voices\u2014not near, not far\u2014sound from somewhere in the area. You'd rather know who they are before joining them, so you turn back toward the main school building. At the edge of the last portable you carefully look out, in case the Gordon-disguised Dane is nearby. But the coast is clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump and whirl at the shout from behind. Adrian Semple grins at you. \"Don't freak out, dude,\" he laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSemple is dressed better than Dane, if torn jeans, t-shirt, and jeans jacket can be \"better\" than anything. His hair, which hangs in curls and kinks down to the top of his shoulders, is so dirty that the light brown has faded to something closer to gray. But his eyes are bright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ayyy, it's only you, man\" you gasp, and throw your arms around him in a loose bear hug. \"Where you been?\" You try willing your IQ down by at least forty points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back there waiting for you,\" he points, and takes your elbow in his hand. \"Did you get lost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeaaaahhhh,\" you gasp in your best impression of Dane. \"I heard voices and took a detour\u2014\" Adrian laughs. On a hunch, you decide on laying the predicate for a mutual body swap in case the real Dane should make a scene. \"Did you see Gordon Black around here earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Semple says, and his tone is sharp. \"Why, did <i>you</i> see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think so. It was pretty freaky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, it's only us back here,\" Semple says as you round a corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour people look up from the grass where they're squatting. There's Karl Hennepin, in his skinny jeans and skinny tie, with that stupid fedora. Brad Murphy, with the confused look of someone who's been slapped across the face with a fish and is wondering whether such an absurdity actually occurred or whether he only imagined it. A girl, whose name you can't place, in a sleeveless blouse and sleeveless vest decked over with beads and bangles, whose mischievous smile lights up a cherubic face. And the one who surprises you with his presence: Erik Carstairs, a spiky-haired blonde football player, and the only one with a joint between his lips. He grins at you through a veil of smoke, and hands it over to you. \"Hey, thanks,\" you say. \"I was wanting\u2014\" You close your eyes and tense all over as you take a toke, willing yourself not to cough. \"Awesome.\" You hold it out to the middle of the group, and Adrian takes it from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not cool,\" says Brad. He's turned toward Hennepin and Carstairs, so you can't make out exactly who he's talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter,\" asks the girl. \"Are you having fun?\" she asks one of the guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Hennepin says with a shrug. \"I mean\u2014\" He takes the joint from Semple and huffs from it. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But who's paying for it?\" Semple asks. \"The motel rooms, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be crass,\" says the girl as she takes the joint from Hennepin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point is,\" Semple says, a little shrilly. \"She's the one with all the money, and if she's ashamed to be seen with him\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says she's ashamed?\" says the girl. \"Don't get me wrong, Kelsey's a cunt, but\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" says Semple. \"Her and her friends. If she doesn't want 'em to know\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's real nice,\" says the girl. She takes another hit, and her eyes narrow behind the curling haze. \"Telling your friend that his girlfriend's ashamed of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not his girlfriend, not if she's keeping him hidden inside motel rooms,\" Adrian retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what's not cool,\" says Brad. \"The way she's hiding it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if he's having fun?\" the girl repeats. She hands the joint over to Carstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if it was the other way around,\" Semple asks. \"What if it was a guy who wanted the girl to keep it secret? Oh, and he made the girl pay for everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not\u2014!\" The girl shrugs tightly. \"And if the girl says she's having fun, then why isn't it okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSemple laughs\u2014a whinny like a horse. \"I wonder what Kelsey would say if you asked her that question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'd call it sexism,\" says the girl, \"and she'd call it horrible. Because Kelsey's a hypocritical cunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSemple laughs again, and gestures at Carstairs, who hands the joint\u2014now almost depleted\u2014back to him. But Adrian just gives it over to the girl. She takes it with a mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But man,\" says Carstairs with a leering laugh. \"If Kelsey Blankenship let me park myself in her trunk for a little while, I'd put up with all kinds of cuntery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl punches Erik in the knee, though the football player hardly seems to notice. \"You're talking about Karl's ... <i>lady friend,</i>\" she says lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings, ending third period. No one moves, until Semple looks over at you. \"Are you <i>skipping,</i>\" he asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I dunno,\" you reply. \"What's my next class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSemple and Hennepin both laugh. \"History.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Right.\" There are several history teachers, so that only narrows the range down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSemple's expression grows even more merry. \"You know. Walberg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>shit.</i> Not really?\" Lots of laughter at that. You get uncertainly to your feet. \"I guess I better go, then.\" No one stops you. \"See you guys around. I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou almost turn back or head in another direction when you realize that the real Dane might be inside, waiting for class to begin, but you press on, though watching carefully. You don't run into anyone, and no one untoward looks into the classroom before it starts. You do get kicked out of three different desks before landing in the one Dane usually takes, but your presumption doesn't seem to offend anyone. It does interfere with your sending a text to Caleb, though, saying you want to see him at lunch. He replies that it can't be done: \"Keeping an eye on Will.\" Silently, you concede that should be a priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch you get a quick bite in the cafeteria, and prowl the school grounds, keeping an eye out for the guy who replaced you\u2014Gordon Black as Will Prescott\u2014and the guy you replaced\u2014Dane Matthias as Gordon Black. You don't spot either one, and aren't sure whether to be pleased or not by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the rest of the day in the library\u2014being extremely bored\u2014because you don't get any real help in figuring out your class schedule, except from one unexpected source at the very end of the day, and that comes in a bad way. You're loping through the hallways, looking for someone who might help you get into Dane's locker\u2014if you can even figure out where it is\u2014when a hand catches and tugs you into a room. Mr. Trencher, the art teacher, smiles at you with gentle gravity. \"I missed you today, Dane,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you normally don't skip <i>mine.</i>\" He sounds genuinely disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, I did miss it, didn't I? I got kind of confused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet. You will be in class tomorrow, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. What time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class time, Dane,\" he says, and lets you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a disappointment to you too. You had Trencher your sophomore year, and you liked him a lot, though you didn't exhibit any talent for his subject matter. But that's a lead on another class. Maybe by the end of the month you'll be able to figure out your new schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe encounter with Trencher is followed by an encounter of a much worse sort. You're still roaming the halls when <i>another</i> hand\u2014this one stronger and rougher\u2014pulls you into a classroom. You freeze at finding that it's Mr. Walberg. He glowers at you and raises an eyebrow. You return his stare with a wide-eyed one of your own. Then with a snort he stabs a finger at a desk. \"Sit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait expectantly, but he says nothing else, and a few minutes later he leaves. He's gone quite a while, and you wonder if you can or should leave, but he returns first, and pays no attention to you, but works at his desk. You squirm and look around, and are on the point of asking several times what he wants. But he resolutely ignores you, until after fifteen minutes he looks up and growls, \"If you haven't got anything to study you can at least be still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it dawns on you: <i>You're in detention!</i> With a groan, you put your head on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's an hour before you can go. On the way out you call Caleb, but the talk is short as he tells you gruffly that he's \"hanging out with Will.\" It's beginning to sound bad. And that leaves you feeling in a bit of a pinch. If you hang out at the school, in the company of Semple or others of his ilk, you can likely easily get away if Caleb calls back. But it might be better to check out Dane's house, even though you might not be so easily able to escape it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You don't run into anyone on the way out of the school, so you follow the path of least resistance; it (and you) wind up in the parking lot. But not until you're staring into it do you realize you don't even know which car is Dane's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, there are very few left to choose from; most of the remaining ones look too nice to be Dane's; by examining the key you narrow the range of possibilities down further; and the key fits the lock of the first one you try. <i>Whew!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a rusted-over sedan that's at least twenty-five years old, and out of it rolls an overpowering stench of stale weed, mold, dirty clothes and ... Jesus, did someone take a shit in the back seat or something? You hold your breath as you settle in; then find that the windows won't roll down. So you breathe through your mouth until you get used to the stink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the dashboard are a pair of sunglasses. You try them on and look in the rearview mirror. Hey, you look pretty cool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start the engine. Either it's lost its muffler or the muffler is broken, because it sounds like a cross between a jet engine and a lawnmower. You gun it a couple of times, and the stench of gasoline mixes with the other odors in the cabin. You put it in Drive and\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand on the brake while fishing out Dane's wallet; you check the address on the driver's license; you blink, trying to place the street. With a sigh you look it up on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy. He lives in a trailer park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe car groans and sputters and sighs when you turn it off, and it shudders massively, like a wet dog shaking itself all over You struggle out and onto your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dane! Dane!\" Chirping, excited voices call from the tiny yard in front of a trailer across the way: three half-naked kids, jumping up and down, grinning and waving. You grin and wave back, and hope that's enough for them. They seem satisfied, and don't call anymore as you lope toward the trailer that is apparently to serve as your home base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yard\u2014what there is of it\u2014is overgrown with weeds poking up around bottles and cans and bits of cardboard boxes. You mount sagging wooden steps. Before opening the door, though, you take the precaution of lighting a joint and putting it between your lips. If this isn't Dane's place, the joint will give you a ready-made excuse for walking into the wrong trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door squeaks as you open it. You blink into the darkness beyond, then step inside. Is it the hit you just took, or does the floor seem to slant down in one direction?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're standing in a tiny entry space, with a kitchen to your left, a living room to your right, and a cheap folding table directly in front of you. The kitchen has a refrigerator and a sink full of dirty dishes and some crusted over countertops. In the living room is a sagging, dark brown sofa and a ketchup-colored beanbag; the space between is filled with clothes. Curled on the sofa is a middle-aged woman. You tiptoe up and peer closely at her. She has dark reddish hair and lots of freckles. You decide that between her coloring and the general shape of her features, she must be Dane's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn acrid smell of burnt marijuana hangs in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the kitchen is a hallway, and you explore it, finding a tiny bathroom with an even tinier shower, and two bedrooms. You're pretty sure the smaller of them is Dane's, for it seems unlikely that his mom would be hanging posters of half-naked girls in bondage gear on the walls. A small desk is also covered with school books, papers, and a couple of half-eaten sandwiches. You open the window and toss the latter outside for the birds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as the woman of the house seems passed out, you take advantage of the solitude to explore Dane's room a little more. No computer of any kind; in fact the only electronics are an ancient CD player and some tiny speakers. It sits on a warped chest of drawers, in the top drawer of which is a muddled stack of CD cases. Inside them are shiny CDs, unlabeled except for those few that have \"MIX\" scrawled across them with a thick magic marker. The rest of the drawers hold some badly folded clothes. More clothes\u2014dirty\u2014litter the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep sigh, you settle down to sort through the school work. There's a French I book and couple of trade paperbacks about health and family finances. The papers are covered with half-completed math problems, or the start of essays that peter out after five or six words. Lots and lots of doodles of the spiral kind, though. After putting those aside, you dive into some very messy binders and notebooks, going through them page by page. Slowly, a sketch of Dane's academic life emerges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen\u2014blessedly!\u2014it comes into sharp focus when you find his official class schedule from the start of the year:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">1. Intermediate Algebra -- Simeon<br>\r\n2. Entrepreneurship -- Peters<br>\r\n3. French I -- Henderson<br>\r\n4. US History -- Walberg<br>\r\n5. Lunch<br>\r\n6. Reading for Pleasure -- Gladstone<br>\r\n7. Art II -- Trencher<br>\r\n8. Family and Consumer Sciences I -- Duggan</div><br>\r\nThe sheet also includes a locker number and combination. You sigh with deep relief, and tuck the sheet into Dane's bag. Then, as a further precaution, you take it back out and copy the information onto yet another sheet, which you put in his top drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're feeling hungry by now, and return to the kitchen. The refrigerator contains lots of little plastic containers with little bits of food in them: most of them look like portions of cooked vegetables, and most of them smell pretty rank. You are forced to content yourself with some slices of baloney and white bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also get yourself a glass of water, and the dishes shift, clattering loudly. A noise comes from the living room, and you look over to find the woman blinking stupidly without raising up. She says something you can't make out, so you go over. \"Whatdja say?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubs her eyes. \"Dwayne called,\" she says sleepily. \"He wants you to call him back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dwayne.\" She smacks her lips, and nestles back down into the cushions. You barely make out her last words: \"It's important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, shit.</i> Dane's probably not the type to act on any message given him, even one marked urgent. On the other hand\u2014you tear off another bite of the sandwich\u2014what if it's about food? Someone has to take care of these two potheads, and maybe it's him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who is \"Dwayne\"? And what's his number? And if he wants to find Dane, why is he calling here and not Dane on his cell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dane's cell.</i> You check it again. Sure enough, Dwayne Macauly is one of the names in the call list. You almost touch the call back button, but since he called this place, you grab up the phone hanging on the wall in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line on the other end burrs three times before picking up: \"Yeah?\" answers a sharp voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeyyyy, Dwaaaayyyyne,\" you drawl cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long pause. \"Hang on.\" Indistinct voices. Then a new one, even more rough and rude and impatient: \"Where the fuck have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips. \"I's at school,\" you gasp. \"I had detention with my history teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I give a shit. Come over, I've got some more stuff for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stuff?</i> You don't like the sound of that. \"Uh huh. Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clear the fucking fumes from your brain. My place. Move.\" The line cuts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwayne, whoever he is, does not sound like someone to fuck around with, and it sounds like he doesn't cut Dane any slack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where do you find this guy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky for you\u2014or maybe not\u2014you're able to track him through his phone number. You really don't like the address you find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nDane Matthias may live in a poor part of town, but Dwayne Macaulay\u2014if this is the right place\u2014lives in the worst part: the industrial area on the north side of town. The house are all made of white-washed cinderblock, and most of the windows are barred or boarded over, and the few people sitting out stare with beady eyes as you drive past. Dwayne's address is just like the others: a cheap, weather-discolored shack so small it is practically cube-shaped, with a single door in the middle flanked by two tiny windows. The curtains are shut behind metal bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you make your way up a cracked sidewalk. The door opens before you can knock, and the man who opens it pulls you quickly inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dwayne Macaulay is small and wiry and strong, dressed in dirty jeans and a dirty denim shirt. He looks like he's in his late twenties, and there's a rodent-like cast to his face: small mouth and pointed nose, with a trim, bristly blonde moustache between them. His eyes are dark, and he stares at you with a pinched expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow your doubts, and try putting on Dane's usual blustery cheer. \"Hey man, thanks for calling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flashes the tiniest, briefest of smiles\u2014which does nothing to make him look any more friendly\u2014and gives you a hard clap on the shoulder. Abruptly, he turns back toward a small table. In that moment you glance around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really is a one-room place: along one wall runs a small countertop with a sink under a cabinet, next to a refrigerator. Wedged against the other wall is a low, narrow bed. On the third wall is a flimsy wardrobe and a chest of drawers, atop which sits a cheap TV. A door leads into a small bathroom. In the middle of the room is a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wooden half-crate is sitting atop it, next to some brown paper sacks. Dwayne hands you the crate, and you blink dumbly into it and the small metal briefcase it contains. Dwayne gives you a very meaningful stare. \"You know where to put it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabs a hank of your hair and pulls hard. \"You know where to put it, right?\" he repeats in a much tighter and rougher voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow ow ow! Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, where you put it every month. You do put it in the same place every month, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" That seems like the best possible answer, for what other answer could you give him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I don't wanna any phone calls complaining that you've spaced out on me.\" He stares at you, and when you just blink he grabs you by the side of the head again. \"Am I gonna get a phone call, Dane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'll put it where\u2014\" You blink back tears as he releases you. \"But, you know, just so I don't fuck up, can you tell me where you think I'm supposed to put it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raises his hand again, but drops it when you flinch. \"That's your fucking business. I don't wanna know where you put it. Okay, this is for you.\" He holds up a package wrapped in brown paper. \"See? I'm putting it in here.\" He drops it into one of the paper bags, then drops the paper bag into the crate atop the briefcase. You peek into it, and see lots of cheap canned goods and packaged foods. \"You coming over on Saturday?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2014\" You hesitate, but he makes no move. \"Uh, I dunno man,\" you say. \"Like, there might be something going on with, uh\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he says. His tone is still sharp and guarded, but a lot of the unfriendliness has dropped out. \"Gimme a call if you wanna hang out, though.\" He claps you again on the shoulder, then hustles you toward the door. \"Say hi to Aunt Marianne for me,\" he adds before slamming the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Jesus, Will, what do you <i>think</i> is in here?\" Caleb says. His eyes are wide as he glares at the locked case. \"Same kind of shit as over there.\" He nods at that brown paper package, which is now unwrapped, disclosing a small, tightly packed bundle of joints, tokes, and leaves. It's sitting on a table in the elementary school basement, for that's where you caught up to Caleb after leaving Dwayne's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Dane shares his stuff, but I can't picture Dane as a dealer,\" you object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb glances up at you, and does a slight double take. \"You have a point,\" he says. \"Still less can I picture <i>you</i> pretending to be Dane-who-is-a-dealer. But what did this Dwayne guy say, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to put it where I put it every month, and that he doesn't want to hear any complaints.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb chews on this. \"Well, that's got to be it, right? Dane's not the dealer. Someone else is. And Dane\u2014\" He chews on it a little more, and his tone falters. \"And Dane passes it along to the guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how come this Dwayne creep doesn't pass it along directly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb shrugs. \"Maybe he can't. Maybe he can't get to\u2014\" A light breaks in his eye. \"It's someone at school. That's it, he gives it to Dane, and Dane passes it to a guy at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why go round-about that way?\" you protest. \"Why not just give it to the guy directly? I wouldn't trust Dane to make regular deliveries of toilet paper, let alone-- I don't think this Dwayne guy does, either, the way he was talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. But maybe it's someone who can't afford to be seen with this guy directly. Like, maybe Dwayne's a known distributor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's Dane's ass\u2014<i>my ass</i>\u2014that's in the crosshairs,\" you gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you keep getting into these messes, Prescott?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it wasn't <i>my</i> idea to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it was! You're the one who said, 'Put me in for Dane, coach, that's a safe place for\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in this mess because <i>you</i> put me in for Gordon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>saved</i> you from Gordon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and how's <i>that</i> working out?\" you demand. \"Which reminds me, what happened today, after that fight he had with Lynch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He got suspended,\" Caleb says, and that bit of news causes you to have to sit down. \"Yeah, he busted Lynch's face pretty good, and I don't think he got a bruise on him. Except on his knuckles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>Christ!</i> And what did my <i>dad</i> say? You went to see him after school, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He's grounded, but he didn't tell me much. He's all moody, of course. I tried getting him to see things from our point of view, you know, reminding him of all the shit that the Molester and Chen and Kirkham do to us, and how we're actually lucky we've not run into Lynch and Patterson and Black before\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mentioned Gordon to him?\" you gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I want that fucker to know what it looks like from the other end. He didn't say anything, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're both silent for a bit before you raise the obvious question. \"So what do I do with this thing?\" You pick up the locked briefcase. \"I don't want to take it to school. I don't even know that's where it's supposed to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb takes it from you, and studies it, then puts it in one of the desk drawers. \"All the rest of our shit is here, this might as well stay here too. Until the person you're supposed to give it to comes looking for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cover your face with your hands. \"Oh Jesus.\" Through your fingers you gaze at the workspace where you'd been making those masks. \"Where's the book? The next spell, that's gotta have something in it that can help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on it,\" Caleb says. \"Tomorrow I'll pick up the supplies. I didn't have time today, thanks to all the shit that went down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need any help from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. But try to meet me here tomorrow around five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe evening passes quietly. Dane's mom accepts the appearance of the groceries as though it's a kind of magic that always happens, and in a lazy, dreamy way makes up some cheap noodles with jarred spaghetti sauce. Afterward, she lights up again, and in a casual maternal way shares it with you; you partake while laying in the beanbag, and drift off far further than you'd intended, so that it's nearly two in the morning before you stumble down to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm shrieks you awake at seven o'clock, and after slapping it into silence you lay in bed for almost half an hour, trembling with exhaustion and trying to summon the strength and willpower to wake up. You finally haul yourself up, feeling weak and bloodshot and burned over; your mind is a jumble of gears with broken teeth that don't want to engage. Not even a shower can restore you, and out of desperation you smoke a good portion of a joint\u2014which you find under the sink\u2014after getting out. That leaves you feeling more mellow and human, at least enough to dress. You mix up the wardrobe a little, donning some torn up jeans that are cut off just below the knee, but otherwise stick to Dane's usual t-shirt and shabby sports coat. You stock its pockets with some of the shit that Dwayne gave you yesterday. In the bathroom after breakfast you study yourself in the mirror; you still look too freaked out, even after trying to relax, so you smoke down some more of that joint and slap yourself hard in the side of the head. \"Hey man! Hey!\" You practice a few more of those smiles, using Dane's selfies for reference, and when you feel you've settled into character lope out the door. Dane's mother is still asleep when you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drive <i>very</i> slowly and carefully to school, arriving with only five minutes to spare. With long strides you hustle off toward Intermediate Algebra. No one pays any attention to you, not in the halls and not in the room after you drop into a desk, panting. No one seems to care that you're there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil something big looms in the corner of your eye. You turn. Gordon Black stares at you from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow. <i>Dane Matthias, in Gordon's body, has finally caught up to you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe breaks into a huge grin, and gestures you to follow him.</span></div></div>",

He gestures at you again, more broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head again, more vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clasps his hands in a begging gesture, and turns big puppy dog eyes on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have <i>never</i> seen Gordon Black acting this way. No one has, and heads begin to turn. They also quickly turn away, lest they be caught looking at him acting in this very goofy way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Simeon\u2014a bird-like woman with long, dark hair that hangs to her hips\u2014walks over to him. \"Do you need something, Gordon?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinks at her, and guffaws. \"Oh man, this is so trippy,\" he exclaims. \"You're so <i>tiny!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am,\" she replies in a brittle chirp. \"And you're in the wrong room.\" She pushes at him\u2014which is like watching a bird trying to shove a brick wall\u2014until gets him out the door, which she closes in his face. But still he stares into the room at you through the narrow window, making goofy, pleading expressions. Not until after the tardy bell has rung does he disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nHe's going to find you, of course. He knows Dane's schedule, and he knows where Dane hangs out, he knows all that stuff better than you. He's probably totally lost as Gordon, and will be looking hard for you. So you skip second period and look for a place to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou first try the natatorium, but Coach Acuna kicks you out. Next you try for the weight room in the gym, but it's full of wrestlers. You edge around the back of the main building toward the agriculture stalls, but spot Gordon down at the other end, looking around, so you dive into F wing and skulk your way to the library. Maybe you can dodge him in the stacks if he comes looking in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson Ioeger, deeply absorbed in some homework, occupies a table in the middle of the library, so you drop down next to him. \"Hey, Ioeger, my favorite buddy,\" you gasp, and he looks up, startled. \"You gotta hide me, man, I'm in deep shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Gordon Black, man, he's on the hunt for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson blanches. \"What makes you think I can hide you from big, dumb and dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's always after you and Lamont, I figure maybe you know places to, you know, <i>hide</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes narrow. \"Why's he after you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno! I was just in my algebra class, 'cos, you know, I gotta go <i>sometimes,</i> man, or else, like, I'm gonna flunk\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I look up and there he is in the doorway, like\u2014\" You mime the Frankenstein monster while keeping in your seat. \"And he's all waving at me, trying to get me to follow him. And he's <i>grinning</i> at me, which is like fucked up scary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson stares at you, then guffaws. \"You don't know why he's after you, Dane? Christ!\" He hurriedly looks around, realizing he's raised his voice too loud, then hunches in close to you. \"He's lookin' to score some, you know\u2014\" Now he mimes, taking a hit on a joint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, man! What makes you think that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson looks around again, then pulls you even closer. \"At practice this morning he was as high as, well, <i>you,</i> usually,\" he says. \"You know how the basketball team has pre-class practice?\" You nod. \"Well, I heard\u2014\" His lips tickles as he buzzes quietly in your ear. \"He was totally baked when he went in. Couldn't hit the fucking basket for nothing, couldn't bounce the fucking ball, just kept giggling. Patterson yelled at him or something, but he just laughed at him and went off somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're shitting me!\" Of course, you can easily believe it. \"How'd you hear about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got my sources. And yesterday\u2014 Didn't you see him yesterday? No? Well, he spent a big part of the afternoon with Semple and Gerard, toked up until he couldn't walk, I heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, man, I didn't hear about that. So you think he wants\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't got any, 'cept what I keep here.\" You pat the pocket of your jacket, which is freshly supplied with what Dwayne gave you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So share. You don't want him pissed at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna run into him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson leans back. \"Sorry, man. It's not like I can carry you around in my back pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? 'Cos\u2014\" You fiddle with the zipper on his pack; he slaps you away. Then his expression freezes as he sees something behind you. You turn to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve Patterson\u2014tall, strong, gray-eyed and glacial\u2014has come in. His eyes contract into something as narrow and sharp and cold as an icepick. He stalks over and punches you hard on the side of the head. You yowl and duck, nursing and hiding your ringing skull. From your cowering crouch you watch as Patterson takes Carson's head in the crook of his arm and hustles him into a corner of the library. You can't hear what he says to your hapless friend, but he raises his knee sharply a couple of times, causing Carson to make some very quiet choking noises. After a minute of this, Patterson drops him. You hide your face, but as he passes he grabs you by the hair. You stifle a shriek as he half lifts you from the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay the fuck away from Gordon, you fucking stoner,\" he hisses in your ear. \"If I catch you even looking in his direction, I'll light your cock with a blowtorch and make you smoke it. Stay the <i>fuck</i> away from the basketball squad.\" He shoves you hard, cracking one of your ribs on the side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he's gone, you look up through the wet in your eyes. Carson is still hunched in the corner, breathing heavily and looking very red in the face, but after a minute he struggles to his feet and returns to the table. \"Man, I think we're in trouble,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that right,\" he says, and winces as he sits. \"Now get the fuck away from me, Dane. You're dangerous to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try protesting, but he angrily picks up his stuff and moves to another table, leaving you sadly isolated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt no point during this drama did the other students in the library look up from their work; most of them buried themselves even more deeply in it; and even the library aide had ducked below the counter on some urgent business out of Patterson's eye line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYour dodge trouble during third period\u2014at the cost of skipping Dane's French class\u2014but it catches up to you with a vengeance during fourth. You're making your way toward Walberg's when strong hands seize you from behind and hustle you toward the outer doors. Your first thought is that it's Gordon\u2014this is the way he caught you a few days ago\u2014but you're not lifted in the air. Still, you're not eager to find out who's got hold of you, and just let yourself be carried along. You end up, as before, at the portables, shoved face-first into one of the walls. An agonizing punch to your kidneys drops you to your knees. \"Where's the shit, Matthias?\" an angry voice hisses in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's back there?\" you ask in a bleating voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother punch to the kidneys. \"Where's the shit, Matthias?\" whoever it is demands, more roughly. \"Where'd you put it, you fucked up shit-for-brains?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try turning around, but only get a kick in the balls for your effort, which doubles you over. Your assaulter shoves your face into the grass. \"It's supposed to be under there, you fucking doof! Where'd you fucking put it?\" He grabs the back of your head and slams your face repeatedly into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he releases you, and choking and coughing you turn over to look up. You wipe your eyes, and the figure comes into focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat little hope you had of getting out of this alive dies away. It's Gary Chen, Chinese-American gangbanger. You glance around fearfully, looking for David Kirkham, his comrade-in-bloodcurdling-douchebaggery, or one of their odious little pilot-fish. But it's only Chen at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething thick and viscous is dribbling down your nose. You snort it back, and taste blood. \"Uh, hey man. You, uh, wanna know about the, uh, the shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fell light comes into Chen's eye, and he raises a hard fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! Shit! Don't!\" You raise your hand to ward off the blow. \"I got it, man, like, uh, here?\" From your pocket you pull out the tokes you'd brought to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChen slaps them away, then punches you again. \"I'm talking about a fucking metal briefcase, Matthias. What fucking day is it today? I already gave your fucking cousin his fucking money, so where the fuck is the shit he promised me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, you were pretty sure that's what this is about, and now that you've got confirmation\u2014 \"Oh yeah, I got it, I mean, Dwayne gave it to me. It's just that, uh\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChen pulls his foot back, readying to kick you in the face. But then he's distracted, and leaps around a corner. A shrill cry rends the air. You gape as he drags Adrian Semple back with him. Into Semple he lays double the fury he laid into you, and when you try to move he nails you to the ground with a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Semple stops screaming, he's able to answer Chen's repeated question: \"You know about this? What do you know about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw Gordon out here earlier,\" Semple cries. \"He was digging around under the portable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you notice a loose board by where you're crouching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black?\" Chen asks, and white shows under his bronzed skin when Semple nods.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're pretty sure that Gary Chen can't hurt or frighten Gordon Black\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you're pretty sure he couldn't hurt or frighten the real Gordon Black, and that he knows that he can't hurt or frighten the real Gordon Black, so he wouldn't even try to hurt or frighten the person who's currently walking around acting like a stoned-out-of-his-head Gordon Black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo even when Chen rounds on you with some vicious blows\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fucking moron! You goddamned, cock-sucking ass-for-brains, you let Gordon find where we've been putting the\u2014! You are so fucking <i>dead</i> when I've calmed down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014you don't confess you've got the stuff at another location. Let \"Gordon\" take the blame!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChen has a satchel\u2014the twin of Dane's\u2014hanging off his shoulder, and he ends the conversation (with a curse) by throwing it at your head and stalking away. You and Semple are left to stare wide-eyed at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gordon found your secret stash?\" Semple asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Didn't you say he did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just saw him poking around here.\" Semple takes the satchel from you and looks through it. He pulls out two joints from its depths, then notices another one on the grass. He scrambles around, collecting the ones that Chen had slapped from your hand. \"I didn't know Gary knew about it,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm gonna have to move it,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Gordon was acting real funny yesterday,\" Semple says after a moment's thought. \"He hung out with us yesterday, last period and after, instead of going to practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you heard this from Carson, but you feign ignorance. \"No way! Did he, you know\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSemple nods. \"He got really mellow, started going on and on about Chelsea and all the\u2014\" He swallows around a sudden grin. \"All these fantasies about stuff he wanted to do with her, how he was gonna try doing it with her. It really freaked me and Tim out. We didn't know what to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" The thought of the Dane-run Gordon trying to talk\u2014let alone get it on\u2014with Chelsea Cooper leaves you dazed. Then you get to wondering what Gordon\u2014watching things play out from Will Prescott's point-of-view\u2014would think of Dane's antics in his body. <i>Oh, but Gordon's trapped at your place because he's been both suspended and grounded.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSemple's voice pulls you from this reverie. \"Aren't you supposed to be in Walberg's class this hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Walberg? Oh yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, shit!</i> You hurry off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe makes you suffer, both that period and in detention after school. But at least you manage to avoid \"Gordon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense,\" Caleb says in a distracted tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not even listening! I told you that Gary Chen\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you!\" Caleb says without lifting his eyes from the book. \"Chen beat the crap out of you 'cos you lost Dane's stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then I managed to pin the blame on 'Gordon'.\" You giggle as you make air quotes around the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he's not really paying attention to you. Instead, he's trying to carve some symbols into a piece of metal. You ask him what he's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you high? I'm trying to do the next spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean in to see what he's doing. He's bending over a strip of silvery metal, about an inch wide and five inches long, and trying to carve some lines into it. Apparently they are supposed to be runes\u2014there's a couple of rows of runes on the page he's consulting in the book\u2014but he's having a hell of a time getting it done. Though he's using a fountain pen with a metal nib, the silver band doesn't want to take any indentations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I gotta get home for supper,\" he says after a little while. \"Can I leave this here with you, see if you can get this thing made?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think I can do it if you can't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glowers at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you can, but I'd like you to give it a try. I'll be back in a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell him you'll do your best, but after he's left, your eye keeps returning to the desk where he stashed that metal briefcase that Dwayne Macaulay gave you yesterday. Finally you can't stand it anymore, and take it out and try fiddling with the locks. It won't open. You lay it aside and return to work on the doohickey. You only last another five minutes before you're playing with the briefcase again, with mounting frustration. You hear a noise outside, and quickly return to your work. But when Caleb doesn't come in, you pick up the briefcase again. You end up searching the basement for any kind of instrument you can use to break it open. You find a crowbar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bash the case about hard before it finally bends enough that you can jimmy it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's in this attitude\u2014you levering the briefcase open\u2014that Caleb finds you when the basement door slams open. \"The fuck are you doing?\" he cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh nervously. \"Just, uh, snooping, I guess, into the\u2014\" You indicate the briefcase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I see. But that's not our business. You're supposed to be finishing up that\u2014\" He grabs the case away from you. And as he does so, it flies open. His voice dies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe case is packed tight with stuff like Dwayne gave you yesterday. You feel your eyes bulging. You and Caleb are both silent for a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeezum Crow,\" you murmur. \"What do you think the street value of that crap is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less than you think,\" Caleb says, but he doesn't sound as confident as he words would suggest. He's pale when he looks up at you. \"That's what you were supposed to give Chen? Fuck us, no wonder he was so pissed at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sink back onto one of the desks. \"Wanna go in as Dane for me tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat jerks him back to the present, and he quickly sweeps the briefcase shut and shoves it back in the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you fucked up, you take the consequences,\" he says. \"Anyway, tomorrow's Saturday, lucky for you. How far did you get on\u2014? Oh, Christ, Will!\" He snatches up the metal band. \"I gave you plenty of time to work on it! I even went by your house to check up on you-know-who.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. He's still barely talking to me. He did say that his dad\u2014your dad\u2014did some calling around, found out what a shit Lynch is, so he's not as mad as he was yesterday. I bet <i>that</i> makes Black feel good, learning that his friends are totally despised. But Jesus.\" He sighs over the metal strip, then shoves it into the book and sweeps the book into his bag. \"I'll finish it at my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can finish it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glares at you. \"Apparently you <i>can't!</i> And look how you fucked up Chen when <i>he</i> gave you an assignment.\" He peers at you. \"You're even beginning to <i>look</i> like Matthias.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last remark makes no sense, since you have been wearing a defect-free disguise of Dane all this time, and you challenge Caleb on the insult. \"I mean, you're getting that whole space-cadet look in your eyes. But if you really wanna help, here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes out the book again, along with that piece of metal and a piece of notebook paper. \"Can you at least <i>try</i> finishing this thing up?\" he asks as he copies the down the runes that are supposed to go onto the metal strip. He shoves the paper and the strip at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure, I can <i>try</i>,\" you assure him. You can't stifle a giggle as you say it, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolls his eyes. \"Good. Look, we'll meet here tomorrow. Here, ten o'clock?\" You nod. \"Lay off the weed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBut you don't take Caleb's advice. You've only had two or three joints ever, and you've never been interested in acquiring the habit. But playing the part of Dane Matthias gives you a once-in-a-lifetime chance, you figure, to experiment and have some fun with it. You enjoyed it last night, when Dane's mom got you high; tonight you don't find her at home, so you take it a little more lightly, and only give yourself a really pleasant buzz while slowly trying to scratch the runes into the metal band. It goes slowly, because you keep pausing to groove on the\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck, man, you're playin' with </i>runes!<i> How cool is that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo distracted, you only dimly become aware of a hammering at the door, and when you raise your head it ceases. Then\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM BAM BAM! It's at the window. You twitch aside the curtains, and shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwayne Macaulay is glaring in at you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You recoil from the window. But of course it's no use. Dwayne has seen you, and he doesn't seem like the kind of guy who'll keep politely knocking, even when the door is locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes are clear and cold, and they're set in an expressionless face as you let him in. You bleat out an apology, and your guts feel very cold. But even though you feel very frightened, somehow you know you should be much more frightened than you actually are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's what scares you: Knowing that soon you'll be even more frightened than you are now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Dwayne only says two words: \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, man! I put the stuff where I was supposed to! But it wasn't there when Chen went to get it, and my man Semple, he said\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said he saw someone else fucking around with it,\" Dwayne finishes for you. \"A guy named Black?\"  You nod fervently. \"But how did <i>he</i> know it was there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno! I never told him, never showed him, I swear! He must've seen me put it there, then\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you put it somewhere that someone could <i>see</i> you putting it there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's at fucking school, man, there's people all over the place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwayne studies you evenly, then takes a step forward. You hunch defensively, flapping your hands about uselessly to block the blow you're sure is coming. But he only peers down the hallway toward the bedrooms. \"Your mom here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I dunno where\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I got only three things to say to you, Dane. First is that I'm cutting you off for the rest of the year. No more. You're too far fucking gone. Sober up.\" You nod fervently in agreement. \"Second\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arm blurs, and an agonizing pain explodes through your gut and up your spinal column. You collapse to the floor, unable to breathe, and feel your eyes rolling back in pain. After an eternity during which you try to suck in oxygen through your pores, you raspingly inhale one great gulp. It's like breathing in liquid fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwayne just stands over you as your screaming nerves gradually settle; after a few minutes, you're strong enough to crawl into the bean bag, and huddle on it, looking up at him through streaming tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you wipe them away, he speaks again. \"That was so you don't fuck up again,\" he says. \"I'm not even mad at you, which is why I didn't even <i>try</i> to hurt you. But if you fuck up again, and <i>I'm</i> the one who has to eat twenty-two long ones, I will show you what pain <i>really</i> means. And third\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bends down close to you. \"I told Chen he couldn't kill you,\" he says quietly, \"because you're my cousin. But I also told him he could do <i>anything</i> to you <i>up</i> to killing you. Because <i>he's</i> the one who's out twenty-two thousand dollars. And if he puts you in the hospital, I'm not paying the bill.\" He stand up again. \"So think long and hard about what kind of favors you can do for him.\" He goes to the door. \"Have a good weekend, dude,\" he says over his shoulder, and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nFor almost thirty minutes you lay in a paralyzed stupor. <i>Twenty-two thousand dollars?</i> You cost Gary Chen <i>twenty-two thousand dollars?</i> You are so fucking dead, and you believe that literally, because whatever Dwayne just said, you're pretty goddamned sure Chen won't be able to stop himself from crossing the line between beating you ninety-nine percent to death and all the way there. Not over twenty-two thousand dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need a miracle; luckily, you've got something magical on your side. Against the possibility of Gary Chen breaking into Dane's house, you rip Dane's mask from your face; if Chen shows up, you can pretend to be Will Prescott, who is spending the night with Dane, who went off someplace 'cos he had the munchies and you have no idea where that is or when he'll get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd though you doubt the new spell can help you through this crisis, you hurl yourself into finishing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot until four in the morning, when you hear the front door open and loudly close, do you put out the light and hide under the filthy sheets in Dane's messy bed. You clutch Dane's mask to your chest, listening intensely as footsteps stumble closer. But they don't stop at your door. Instead, they continue to the next bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief, and put Dane's mask on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake again, it's seven o'clock, and the alarm clock is shrieking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"You couldn't have fucked yourself up more if you'd tried,\" Caleb yells at you the next morning. You both flinch from the rattling echoes his voice makes as it bounces off the furniture in the elementary school basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you suggesting I <i>did</i> try to fuck myself up?\" you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just said you <i>didn't!</i>\" He slaps at you in disgust. \"I do you one good deed, saving you from Gordon Black, and <i>this</i> is the mess you make of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it <i>did</i> start with that, didn't it?\" you say, getting angry in your turn. \"He could have slapped me around hard for a few minutes and that would have been all. But now I've got fucking drug dealers trying to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't <i>my</i> idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it <i>was</i> your idea that we pretend to be each other! That's where it all really started to go wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It started to go wrong when you bought that fucking book!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both run out of breath at the same time. And though you're both very red in the face, you also realize that the screaming isn't doing any good. Caleb slumps against the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we were going to turn Gordon loose today anyway,\" Caleb says quietly. \"We could do that, and turn Dane loose too. Then they wouldn't be trying to kill <i>you.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, Chen would just try to kill Dane.</i> And although you'd rather be alive with a bad conscience than dead with a clear one, the two choices are in such close balance that you can't bring yourself to throw Dane between you and Chen. So you shake your head. \"I'd give Chen his shit before I'd do that,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why don't you do that?\" Caleb asks. \"Pretend you hid it somewhere else and forgot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he'll think I tried stealing it, then panicked when the shit hit the fan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb takes the stash from the desk, opening the broken briefcase and staring at its contents. \"Twenty-two thousand dollars, huh,\" he says. \"Man, what I could do with twenty-two thousand dollars. If only we knew how to sell it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nDane's mom needs a ride, otherwise you'd hang out longer with Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's only the start of the day for you. She drags you over to some woman's house\u2014you're supposed to know who she is, but obviously you don't\u2014and spend the next few hours helping the two women clean out a storeroom. Dane's mom, when she isn't stoned, turns out to be extremely perky and cheerful, so that against your expectations you actually enjoy the work; and neither of them insist on making you talk, so you're able to escape just by obeying orders, asking necessary questions, and listening for Dane's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's almost four in the afternoon before you're finished, and can drive Dane's mom back home. She asks what you want for supper, but you tell her you've got other plans. \"Is it a date?\" she asks in a mischievous tone. \"Are you seeing a little girl?\" You only mutter in embarrassment. She laughs. \"You look just like your dad did when I knew him in high school.\" Since you've no idea what happened to Dane's dad, you say nothing to this, but smile tightly. She laughs again at what probably looks like mortification. \"If you don't kiss, I won't ask you to tell,\" is her parting shot when you drop her off at the trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she's inside, you call Caleb, for her teasing has reminded you that <i>someone</i> has a date tonight. \"You still on for your date with Eva?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Date?\" he asks blankly. \"Oh, <i>shit!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you got a date, the one I set you up on, fucker. Are you going? Seven o'clock, her place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh. Maybe I can call her, tell her something came up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly explode from the car. \"You're not seriously going to cancel a <i>date</i> with Eva Garner, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't know how to act with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew how to act with my cousin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's different. I wasn't really into her so I could relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, this is going more or less the way you'd hoped: \"You want me to cover for you? I need a place to hide anyway, since I've got Chen out looking for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says nothing for a minute. \"Yeah, that would work,\" he says glumly. \"Meet me at the clubhouse around six?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSo that's what you do: Caleb leaves his car, along with his mask and his very nicest clothes and what little money he could scrounge up; he departs with Dane's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou search the basement for a little more money; you find none. But you do find another mask. After peering at the image, you recognize it: Chelsea Cooper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an awful, wonderful idea hits you: She's the one who got you into this mess originally. Maybe you could trap her in Dane's mask to take the punishment?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's a crazy idea--trapping Chelsea Cooper in Dane Matthias's mask, the way you've trapped Dane inside Gordon Black's, and Gordon inside a mask of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it's so crazy that--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat it couldn't possibly work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh well.</i> You lay under a desk, grip the side of your face, and pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Wow, <i>you</i> clean up nice,\" Eva says as you lead her out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. So do you,\" you retort. She stops cold at that, but you grin and nudge her, and so she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva always looks nice, but she seems a little more spiffed up tonight. There's nothing especially fancy about her dress: It vaguely recalls a sailor suit, being white with a thick blue stripe around the hem, and with two wide blue strips running up the side of the blouse. But an air of freshness lingers about her: sea salt and ozone and lavender, maybe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were on a date with her as yourself--rather than impersonating Caleb--you'd probably fumble about spasmodically.  But just as you found it easy to relax when you had coffee with her earlier in the week, you find it easy and natural to open the car door for her, and to set the climate controls so that it's neither too hot nor cold, to ask her if she's hungry--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to tell her, as you pull into the street, \"You know, if I'm paying for this meal by myself, we're gonna be swinging by the BargainMart to pick up some Pop-Tarts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe double-takes at that. \"Oh. Well, I wasn't expecting you to, you know, actually, uh--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're offering to help pay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well-- I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh. \"Okay, I'm not actually serious about the cold Pop-Tarts for dinner,\" you say. \"And I can pay for it all if we go to Besandwitched and not someplace really expensive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's fine,\" she says, though her tone is a little uncertain, as though she's not sure there's not some joke hiding behind your words. \"That's actually about what I was expecting. But you know, I can pay for my own--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna let you do that,\" you say firmly. \"I've got enough to pay for us both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But from the way you were talking--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was just me talking. Underpromising and overperforming. I bet Besandwitched sounds pretty good compared to cold Pop-Tarts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, but you can tell this wasn't the best opening gambit to play with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what does it matter? She's on a date with Caleb, not with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBesandwitched--or \"Pentagrams on Rye,\" as some of your friends like to call it--is actually a pretty decent place to eat, despite having the cheesiest d\u00e9cor in town. It's a soup, salad and sandwich shop of good but inexpensive quality close to the university. Its main claim to fame, though, is its being decorated heavily with occult motifs. So you and Eva find yourselves seated by a wall that has an unnervingly immense, man-faced moon gazing down at you, as though it's trying to peer over your shoulders at the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter placing your orders, you rest your elbow on the table and your chin in your hand. \"So Will told me you almost backed out of our date tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't,\" she says indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess he was exaggerating. Well, he always is. He said he overheard Chelsea putting the screws to you about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls her eyes. \"He didn't overhear anything, he invited himself to sit at our table in the library. And I don't care what Chelsea says--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you did. I wish you felt <i>massive</i> pressure to break our date, but you held firm, because you really wanted to go out with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles, but not warmly, at that. \"Chelsea can make all the noise she wants, but she can't tell me what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear it.\" You pause. \"Did you hear that Chelsea set Gordon on him? On Will, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Gordon!\" she exclaims, and her eyes light up. \"No, I didn't hear about that. But oh my God, have you been hearing about what's going on with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt annoys you to see her change the subject like that--you wanted to hear what else she might say about you--but this sounds fun, so you raise your eyebrows in a querying way. And so she tells you the gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's all very fragmented, but the gist of it is that Gordon Black has been acting like he's hopped up on goofballs: laughing and smiling and joking--Gordon <i>never</i> laughs or smiles or jokes, that you have ever seen--and ditching all his usual friends for new ones. \"In the cafeteria yesterday, get this, he was sitting with Christian Knouse and those guys. And it looked like they were all having fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Doesn't Gordon have fun? I mean, usually?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like this, and not with guys like Christian Knouse. He's usually just grumpy, sits around not talking. Jessica says he's like one of those big, frowny Easter Island statues. But yesterday--\" She covers her face with her hands and laughs. \"Well, it all started with Chelsea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't it usually?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I don't guess you know, since I never see you in the cafeteria or anything, but he always brings Chelsea her food over to her, because she's sitting at the table lording it over the rest of us. But yesterday, he sits down with his tray and hasn't got anything for her, and he starts talking to the guys, and Chelsea just stares at him hard, and finally says 'Oh, I guess I'm getting my own lunch today,' because she's this totally passive-aggressive bitch when she wants to be. 'Oh, I guess I'm getting my own lunch today.' And Gordon says--\" She bites her lower lip and grips the edge of the table. \"He says, 'Hey, when you get your tray, can you bring me another chocolate milk?' and goes right back to talking to the other guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said he ate with Christian and them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because of <i>that!</i> Chelsea started screaming at him, and he just stared at her, and his eyes got bigger and bigger, and then he said, 'Man, this is freaky!' or something like that, and she started hitting him in the shoulder. And he didn't get mad or anything, he just looked over her head and said, 'Hey, there's Christian, I gotta talk to him and those guys'.\" And he gets up and leaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did Chelsea do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After she picked her jaw up off the floor, she stormed out without eating. But I guess it worked out or something.\" Her expression fades to one of disappointment. \"We all saw them after school, heading out to the parking lot early, and they were holding each other real close.\" Now her expression turns shrewd. \"It makes me wonder if there's something else going on there, and if Chelsea isn't wondering the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" you ask, though you can only summon up a fraction of the interest Eva is showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you an appraising gaze, like she's not sure you're smart enough to understand what she's going to say next. Evidently, she decides you are, or that she can dumb it down enough for you, for she leans forward to speak very quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, they've been going together for a long time, and Gordon's never been happy around her. And I don't blame him. She's horribly high-maintenance, always demanding he do all this shit without being told to do it, and to do it perfectly. Like, did you know she expects him to give her little presents without knowing that she wants them? There was this one weekend, where they were going to a party--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere follows a tedious anecdote about a string bracelet, an omnivorous puppy, and a cataclysmic argument at Maria Vasquez's house after the first got eaten by the second. \"I heard they actually broke up over it, for almost an hour,\" she concludes. \"But I don't believe it. I think that if he ever does break up with her, it'll be the happiest day of his life, and Chelsea knows it, and that's why she's was acting real affectionate with him after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say nothing for a moment, then confess you've no idea what any of what she said means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean,\" she says, \"that if Gordon finds another girl, she won't be as awful as Chelsea is, and that'll make him happy. And that's such a rare emotion for him it'll blow his mind, leave him acting like he's high or something. Which is how he's been acting, you know.\" Eva tries to look very wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've been telling me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. He's high and he's happy and he doesn't give a shit what Chelsea says or does to him. Like he's basically cut his ties to her. And I think that's what she's afraid of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is what you and your friends have been talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinks. \"Well, not <i>yet,</i> we haven't. It's only just occurred to me.\" She gets a faraway look in her eye, then focuses back on you. She smiles. \"You're so easy to talk to, Caleb, and so <i>smart.</i>\" She grabs and squeezes your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you let her do the rest of the talking through dinner, and afterward, and that seems to leave her very happy, though it leaves you rather more exhausted than excited, even after she lets you kiss her again in the car as you're dropping her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"There you are!\" Caleb exclaims when you open the basement door. \"The fuck has been keeping you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your date,\" you retort. \"And what are you doing here? I stopped by your house but Dane's car wasn't there. It was only a hunch I'd find you here instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'da called, but you have my phone. Give it back. And get out of that mask. We've got a test to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picks up one of those metal strips from the table and hands it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue letters seem to float above its surface, over the runes: CALEB JACOB JOHANSSON.</span></div></div>",

Did you use it to turn the page in the book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally.\" His expression is smug, then turns a little guarded. \"There's just a single sentence on the other side. It translates as 'To know the mind of another'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him. \"You mean, like, mind-reading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or mind copying. Think about it, the masks only copy the person's appearance, but if you really want to impersonate them you have to know everything they know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck, you don't have to tell me <i>that.</i>\" Your knees go a little weak, and you lean against the side of the work bench. \"The whole freaking week woulda been about ten times easier if-- Aw, <i>Christ!</i> Why couldn't we have <i>waited</i> until we had that spell cracked before we started fucking around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's eyes widen. \"The fuck is your problem? Did something happen on that date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just talking about all this shit with Gordon and Dane. If I'd known what to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, will you stop obsessing about that?\" Caleb says. \"Besides, we gotta test this thing first, make sure it works the way I think it will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if it does, I gotta use it to get out of this mess I'm in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he sighs. \"But for right now--\" He chews on the inside of his cheek. \"Look, I'm gonna have to trust you with, you know, getting inside my head, maybe. You gotta put that thing on.\" He points at the strip you're holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me, why am I the guinea pig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the fucking guinea pig here, Prescott! You'll be reading my mind! Anyway, it's not like <i>I</i> can use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinks, and his tone turns extravagantly patient. \"Because how would I know if I was reading my own mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mimic his tone. \"Are you saying you can't read your own mind now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quivers. \"Will you just put that thing onto your forehead? No, wait, take the mask off first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so full of shit and questions tonight? I wanna see if the dingus works by itself, or if it needs a mask too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're acting like the fucking scientist, that definitely makes me the fucking guinea pig,\" you grumble, but stretch out on the table. Caleb does the honors of ripping your false face from your true one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou emerge from an acrid blackness, and with a groan you grind the heel of your hand into your eye. You sit up on your elbows and blink stupidly at Caleb, who is standing near you, watching you carefully. \"Okay, Gandalf,\" you sigh. \"Where's that thingamafuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brow crinkles. \"I already put it on you. I figured I could go ahead--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp, then lunge for him, but yank your hand back at the last minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, you pulled your hand back, but it was like a reflex, like when you pull it away from a hot surface. A little thought is blinking in the back of your head: <i>Dude, this is too weird.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stare at Caleb, that sense of weirdness grows. Your skin crawls, for you've the extremely vivid impression that you're in a wrong place. It's a feeling like you got once when you were ten, when you and your family were visiting relatives in the mountains, and you'd gone wandering around in the woods, not paying any attention to where you were walking. In the nick of time you'd stopped at the sound of something in the bushes behind, and when you'd turned back around, you'd found yourself not three feet from the edge of a deep precipice, into which you might have fallen. The thought had rung clearly in your head: <i>I shouldn't be here, I should be someplace back over there.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very similar thought is banging away in your head now. You draw away from Caleb, but the sense of dislocation only grows. Now the thought becomes <i>I should be over there,</i> where \"there\" is the spot Caleb is standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend's expression is growing alarmed in a way probably proportional to your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of dizziness washes over you, and you hunch over with your head in your hands. A tremble passes through you, and your gorge rises. <i>A presence is coming, a cold and clammy presence.</i> It's behind you, but you don't turn, for with a shudder you feel it in the back of your head. It spreads over your scalp and down the back of your neck and spine and through your limbs, like smoothly dripping, gelatinous slime. The nausea increases as it invades your gut, and your temples throb, like with an ice cream headache, as it covers your head and ripples down your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hard shudder passes through you, rattling your teeth; then your nerves and gut and spirits settle. The invasive feeling withdraws to a tiny point in the center of your skull, where it burns briefly and winks out, but not before illuminating the second soul that now coats the inside of your original soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your face covered and your eyes shut as you listen to this second soul. It doesn't speak, not exactly, but you could put its thoughts and emotions into words if if you wanted to:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My name is Caleb, and I swear by holy fucking Jesus this had better work.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower your hands and raise your face to gaze back calmly at--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt yourself. At a guy who looks like yourself. Well, if you want to be fucking technical, it isn't yourself, it's Caleb, because he's Caleb and you're Will. But that face is also yours--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, hang on a moment.</i> You raise your hands and regard your palms and flex your fingers. <i>Will Prescott's fingers.</i> They seem both natural and alien, at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Caleb's would be, if you got into that mask of him. If you did, you bet you could pass for him exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked smile twists beneath the muscles of your face, and both Will and Caleb agree it would be an awesome thing to try out, especially without explaining things to the guy who's staring at you. \"Where's that mask?\" you ask, and fumble around for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because like I told you,\" you say with exaggerated patience, \"I wanna see if it and the dingleberry can work together.\" You spot the mask at the other end of the table, and stretch to grasp it. \"Now watch closely while I do this, in case--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't say-- Who do you think you are?\" Caleb demands, and his voice is shrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me get this thing on,\" you say unwisely, \"and I'll be Caleb Johansson.\" You press the mask to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou wake again, this time with a feeling of alert anticipation. Of course you know why that is. You're eager to see if the experiment came off. You sit up and raise your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are briefly, very disappointed, for they are your own. You look up sharply at Caleb, who is huddled at the far end of the basement with his face in a shadow. \"Hey, why the fuck did you--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch yourself, and do a double-take at your hands. They're your hands, sure. Then you grin. <i>Sure, they're your hands. Caleb's hands.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you hiding over there for,\" you call as you hop off the table. You look around until you spot the full-length mirror, and strut over to it. You check yourself out, making a few characteristic faces. They come very naturally, and with your own memories you recognize them as perfectly like those you're used to seeing on his funny-looking puss. \"This is so freaking awesome,\" you exult. \"I'm you! Inside and out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow looms behind you, and Caleb appears behind your shoulder. He looks more than a little scared. \"Come on,\" you tell him. \"Why are you looking so freaked out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, because this is more than a little freaky?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't it freaky when it was just the mask?\" you say, and tuck and settle the shirt a little while admiring yourself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was just a mask,\" he says. \"You couldn't have passed yourself off as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was totally passing myself off as you,\" you retort. \"No one was spotting the difference. But I get what you mean.\" You pull again at the cuffs of your shirt, and roll your shoulders a little. \"There's all this stuff inside, like--\" Your lips twitch. \"Like that secret crush you've got on Jenny Ashton--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb jerks back in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" you say. \"Like I said, I totally understand. Of course I do, look at me.\" You grin at your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're so sympathetic,\" Caleb says in very tight voice, \"you wouldn't act nearly as geeked out as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, if I was seriously trying to act like you, by being all freaked out and stuff, that would be even worse, wouldn't it? I mean, come on. I know who I am, I'm not gonna try taking over your life. That's why I think this is cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb hunches his shoulder, but looks a little mollified by your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you wanna stay here tonight while I go home in your place?\" you ask. \"Or I can stay here while you go home. Either way, one of us can start working on the next spell. You were just about to start that, I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going home as Dane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, no. With Chen after him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then: Doesn't this give you a way to save yourself from Chen?</span></div></div>",

Someone who can get you far, far away from anything involved with Dane, Chen, hardcore drug dealers... all of that. You're actually working yourself up into a paranoid mess just thinking about it. Well, you need to stop that. You can't have yourself jumping at shadows. You just need to stay calm and realize that shadows can't kill you... or can they? You shake the thought out. Still you need to get into a better place and that means getting far away from anything to do with drug dealing as you can. That doesn't mean you're going to catch the first bus out of Saratoga Falls but that does mean you need a new identity and one not obviously connected to you, Dane, Chen or anything. No stoners, nobody who seems like they'd partake even a tiny bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're stumped and so you plop yourself onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm just gonna stay here for the night,\" you grumble. \"I can't go back to Dane's, who knows what the fuck I'll find. Maybe the wrong end of a baseball bat or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shit's all here, right,\" Caleb asks and you nod. \"Well that's good for now but what are you going to do? You can't stay here forever and become Basement Boy. People are probably going to come looking for Dane if he doesn't show up after a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think of something, I don't know,\" you say in a tired manner. \"You wanna stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no, camping out in this shit hole is near the bottom of my list of things to do.\" he states defiantly. \"No, I'm gonna head home and get some sleep myself. In my nice safe home in my nice comfy bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you,\" you reply and flip him the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point Caleb tosses something to you and it clangs on the floor. You pick it up to see one of the mind bands and look back at Caleb quizzically. \"Fair's fair,\" he replies. \"You've been digging around in my head so I'm gonna go spelunking in yours. Just take the band off and we'll be good to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh at that. You don't want him, or anyone, in your head but he's right about it being fair. Besides, your nerves are frayed so maybe this'll put you out. With little trepidation, you raise your hands to your face, recite the magic words and pull the mask off feeling a small measure of relief, for once, as the sweet, sweet darkness takes over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Yo, dickhead! Wakey wakey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're roused out of your slumber by Caleb's voice. A light has managed to creep into the basement through the slightly open door but nothing too bright which leads you to believe that it's still early, a theory confirmed when your phone tells you it's a little after seven. \"You're here early,\" you say through a yawn as Caleb shoves a bagel and coffee towards you. \"Thoughtful too. Did my mom replace you or something,\" you ask jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off, I didn't want to leave you here by yourself for so long. I'm surprised I didn't find you cowering in a corner,\" he says with a mix of his usual acerbicness and friendly ribbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that all you came by for,\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, I was just feeling restless I guess,\" he states while rummaging around. He grabs the book and a pad and pencil you've been keeping down here while going over the spells. \"This too, I just want to see what else there is. I took a run through your mind so I know you're looking to get someone else so I figured that there has to be a way in here to show how to combine the bands and mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow nearly fully awake you scarf down the bagel and begin drinking the coffee as the two of you get to work on the book. Nothing new is really needed as most of what it's asking for in materials is stuff you've been using already. You get to mixing it the way the book tells you and once that's done place the bowl that holds the concoction onto the sigil and your finger around three times. A small flash of light emerges from the bowl and lifting it off the page automatically turns. You work to translate the Latin and realize that Caleb's instincts were right. What you've just created is a kind of magic paste that would allow you attach one of the brain bands to the inside of a mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe benefits of being able to do that are obvious. Attach it, shove a mask on someone and you've killed two birds with one stone. Put the new mask on and you're that person in body and mind. You wouldn't even need to be a particularly good actor either. The upshot is this makes getting a new identity much easier. Unfortunately for whoever you switch with you don't have Dane's brain but you figure that'll be their problem, not yours, and that they'll learn--as you did---the need to shape up and how to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitedly you get to work on a new mask; the process of which is becoming second nature at this point. You're thankful that Caleb had the idea to use a car buffer because it makes the job go by so much faster, no longer having to wipe it with a cloth for a day or two to get results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you finish it's mid-morning, maybe a little after nine-thirty, and you've now got a mask waiting to be used in your acquisition of a new home. You then gather up Dane's mask and clothing as well and shove it all into a discarded bag that was used when purchasing supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want to go house hunting with me,\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb just shakes his head. \"Can't, I've got some stuff mom wants me to do around the house first,\" he says. \"If you want we can go looking this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, maybe,\" you shrug. \"But I don't want this death sentence hanging over me so I think I'm going to start my search early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you agree to go your separate ways for now, but not before Caleb forces you to keep him up to date on where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nWestside is not really on your way any place, but you wind up driving it past it as you wander around town trying to figure out what to do. You notice some activity on one of the practice fields, so you pull into the parking lot to see what's up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the girl's soccer team, and you get out for a better look. You don't see the coach around but you've heard through the grapevine that Anita Nuevo, the team captain, likes to run an unofficial practice on weekend mornings when nobody is at school. Coach Puente, you guess, must trust her enough to give her a key and you can probably see why: you've never heard of Anita getting into any trouble or being involved with any of the social hierarchy drama. She seems to, you'd guess, focus on her studies and her team over any of the petty shit. Well that's good, having a good head on her shoulders isn't bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think she'd make a good home but the problem is how do you get her? You never really had an interaction with her before and no way would you be able to get her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you chew over the problem, you are briefly distracted by a shout from the nearby bleachers. A couple of guys\u2014sophomores, probably\u2014in shorts and muscle shirts are lounging there, watching the soccer practice. \"Way to go, Evie!\" one of them shouts in a jeering tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at the field. One girl, a well-built blonde you've seen around but whose name you don't know, is berating another, much smaller girl who is hanging her head and staring at the ground. There's a gathering of other team members around the commotion and Anita steps in to break it up. She puts an arm around the second girl, says something to her, and the second girl heads to the sideline while Anita begins admonishing the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis second girl though holds your interest as she gathers her stuff and leaves the field, heading in the direction of the locker room. You don't know who this girl is, you've never seen her before and couldn't pick her out of a crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreepy as it may be you follow her as quietly as possible until she gets to the gym on her way to the locker room. You watch through the door and once you see her enter the locker room you grab the blank mask out of the bag, enter the gym and take a position by the locker room. Within a few minutes she's exiting and barely has time to take notice of you before the mask is shoved on her face; you make sure to catch her as she goes limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take note that she's tiny: maybe a hair above five foot even if that. Her face is heart-shaped and wavy dark brown hair, pushed back by a cloth hair band, stops at the middle of her neckline. She's small-chested though not flat and slightly on the skinny side. Undressing her, since you'll be needing her clothes, you see a girl that is just starting to develop some vague muscle toning though nothing noticeable unless you're actively looking. Once the mask comes, you grab Dane's and shove it onto her as well as toss Dane's clothes, in a pile, on her as she transforms. Not wanting to see that you gather up her clothes and purse and dash out of the gym and into one of the nearby bathrooms. Inside you hold the girl's mask up and see a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Evelyn Sonia Cummings</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing into a stall you strip out of your own clothes and put the mask to your face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But that doesn't mean you're going to stay this way for very long. Your heart is pounding as you walk out to the parking lot. <i>Fucking nerves, that what it is.</i> And for good reason. You're wrapped up in another person's skin, wearing her clothes, about to drive home to face her parents. You're a brand-new person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you grabbed her in a hurry, having no idea what you were in for. A random assault is no way to pick a new place to spend the rest of your life in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that there is anything obviously wrong with where you've ended up. Your racing pulse calms a little after you're inside Evie's car, settled into the driver's seat, and buckled in. You take a deep breath and grip the wheel, then turn the rear-view mirror to study yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you're not at all bad-looking. Your brown eyes widen as you gaze into them, trying to see the girl you are imitating. She is not unfamiliar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's a sophomore, glad to be out of the freshman class. (As you were.) A conscientious student without being a brainiac about it. (As you imagine yourself to be, whatever your dad yells at you about your study habits.) Someone with a few good, close friends and a wider network of friendly acquaintances. (A bigger net than you cast, but Evie's not a social butterfly.) Someone who got tired of being dorky, and wants to reshape herself into a more popular form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pulls a frown out of you. You remember that feeling from being a sophomore. You remember looking around at the guys who were molding themselves into strong and confident forms. Athletes like Laurent Delacroix and Reece Palendech; rich dicks like Geoff Mansfield and Anthony Kirk. Even Gordon Black didn't start off as a hulking monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon gave up. But now you're back to a spot where you had been, with a chance for a do-over, a chance to take something raw and transform it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there's the final ambition, that one that makes Evie's heart -- your heart, now -- leap like a startled deer every time she thinks of it. It's another feeling you know so well, though with a different pulse and with a different melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It's the yearning to merge her heart with the heart of special someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know who she wants, and you can't help trembling a little when you think about it. It's a delicious tremble, even if you don't feel any real sympathy for it. But it helps you see Evie's face more clearly, somehow, as though by seeing her secret desire you see better the person who has that desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been sitting here too long already -- Evie herself might come wandering out at any moment. You put the image of Marc Garner -- captain of the boys' varsity soccer squad -- out of your mind and start the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAt home, you plop down onto your new bed. Her bedroom overlaps in surprising ways with yours. It's frillier and pinker, and a lot tidier, too. But Evie also has video game consoles -- sweet! -- and anime posters and figurines scattered about, remnants of the middle-school personality she's trying to slough off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no matter how long you stare at the room with Evie's eyes and memories, it never becomes fully familiar. You still have the feeling of being a stranger who is only sitting on her bed. You stretch out and stare at the ceiling, and cup your breasts. (A nice feeling!) You take a couple of deep breaths, then fall into a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nope. You are going to move somewhere else.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder why it is that you can't just settle into a life like Evie's, that is so obviously free of disadvantages. Is it something to do with the masks? Are you always going to feel like an imposter, no matter what mask you put on? Are you just going to keep popping from one mask to another -- from Gordon to Dane to Evie to someone else and then to other people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr is it because you jammed yourself into this life without warning? Would it have made a difference if you'd looked at someone else and said, \"Yeah, that's who I'll be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who would you be, if not Evie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you'll stay in the sophomore class, that much you quickly decide. You made this random leap to get as far as possible from Chen. And though there's no way that he could trace you to Evie Cummings, you'd prefer to make another leap into one of her friends or acquaintances instead of back toward to where you'd been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, you bring up and contemplate each of her friends and acquaintances, both male and female. But you make no decisions, not yet. Evie is supposed to be meeting some friends for lunch, and you'll keep that appointment. You want a good, long, hard look at them, in person, before making any decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"I think it's just Hannah,\" says Melanie. \"She caused a lot of problems for Jenny last year too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's Melanie Heath, Evie's best friend from middle school on. It's you and her and Lindsay Cho and Paulina Nowak having lunch. You let yourself go on autopilot after sitting down with them, and after the drama on the soccer field this morning, Evie's autopilot brought up the topic of Hannah Westrick, the girl who reamed Evie out. She was at Eastman until last year, and Melanie's point is that she made trouble there, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut everyone's got drama to gossip about, even if it has nothing to do with them. \"How would <i>you</i> know any of that,\" you demand of Lindsay when she instantly tries changing the topic to the cheerleading squad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Charles Hartlein is in the drama program too. I mean, he doesn't talk to <i>me</i> specifically but I'm able to overhear things all the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of things?\" The words that come out of your mouth feel like they belong to someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, that's not what's important. What <i>is</i> important is that -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her words fade in your ears before reaching your brain. You're concentrating on her, as though constructing a file:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Cho, Lindsay. Korean-American. Underdeveloped and undercooked. Certainly no competition for Yumi Saito or Lin Pol in the \"gorgeous Asian-American\" sweepstakes. Her glasses don't particularly flatter her, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" -- you want a boyfriend. There's Andy, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMention of Andy Jensen, a friend who doesn't bother to hide his crush on Evie, snaps you back to the present, at least long enough to stammer something about not wanting to \"ruin\" a friendship with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then find someone else,\" says Paulina. She grins as she bites on her straw. \"As long as it's not 'Teh Body'.\" She giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Nowak, Paulina. Polish-American, moved to the United States when she was nine. Still has a trace of an accent. Tall, plays on the girls' JV basketball squad, even though she looks like she's delicate as china. Except in the eyes, which project a strong, amused confidence. Her brunette hair falls to her shoulders. Probably has an interesting life. Maybe <i>too</i> interesting, since her family comes from a foreign country. They own Nowak's Authentic Euro Deli, where you are eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still concentrating on Paulina as the conversation comes back into focus. The topic is boys, naturally. But because you're still looking at Paulina, admiring what is admirable in her while still feeling a deep reserve, you make another connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Weaver, Bhodi. A.k.a., \"Teh Body.\" Indian-American. Mother from Mumbai, father an American businessman who brought her back to the states. Tall and well-proportioned, plays boys' JV soccer. A little gawky, and his head still seems stuck in his freshman year, maybe even his eighth-grade year, because he is incredibly awkward around girls, and easily crimsons when they talk to him. Which they like to, because he has dark, handsome Indo-European features under floppy black hair that falls over his ears and down the back of his neck. He's Andy's best friend, too, which would make it easy to get to him, if you wanted to put yourself under a mask of him. And the advantages of that would be? Paulina, who is very pretty, and who has a huge crush on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're mostly silent the rest of lunch. Before driving home, you stand outside next to your car and let Melanie tell you not to worry about Hannah Westrick, that none of what goes on with the soccer team is your problem, it's hers. You nod along, while memorizing Melanie's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Heath, Melanie. Evie's best friend. Talked her into going out for soccer their freshman year. Moved late last year and now attends Eastman High. She's gotten into shape a lot faster than Evie has, becoming tall and filled out in the places that count while losing all the dumpiness she had in middle school. It's made her confident, too. Evie's actually jealous, especially of her long, honey-colored hair and her amused blue eyes. She's even got a boyfriend who plays for the Eastman's JV soccer team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd be a very attractive candidate even if she went to Westside. But the fact that she attends Eastman -- maximal distance from Chen while still being in the same town, at a school with a much better reputation than Westside -- really makes her look good to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSo those are the kids you have lunch with, and are uppermost in your mind. But they are not the only candidates. There's at least one more, though you contemplate him mostly out of resentment and anger -- Evie's resentment and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Andrew Webb. The kid who jeered at Evie just before Anita sent her to the shadows. A real jerk, but a big guy in the sophomore class. Swapping with him would come with a dividend: cutting him down by putting him in Evie's place. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're going to need another mask, no matter what direction you move in, so you drive out to your old neighborhood. Caleb isn't at the community center, and you almost call him so he can come out and keep you company -- and maybe do a little of the work for you -- but you decide to leave him out of it. He'd probably just yell at you for wanting to make another jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you decide not to tell him what you're doing. Let him think that you made a jump directly into-- Well, into whoever you decide to jump into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich means there's going to be a fourth victim of this mask madness. Gordon into your life, Dane into Gordon's, Evie into Dane's, and someone else into Evie's. You better make this next one count, you tell yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you give it a lot of thought as you cast and polish up another mask. And by the time you're done, you've settled on Andrew Webb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're at a loss to understand why he's the one you settle on, unless it's Evie who made the decision for you. Every time you think about Paulina or Melanie or Lindsay or Bhodi (or any of Evie's other friends) you feel yourself recoiling. What a betrayal it would be, for \"Evie\" to be the one to hijack one of their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would probably also be dangerous. If you swapped places with them, you and they would still be part of the same group. What would you say to the real Paulina (or whoever you shoved into Evie's body) while you were pretending to be her? Probably your victim wouldn't dare try to tell the others what happened, because \"body swapping\" is just crazy talk. Still, even if it wasn't dangerous, it would be danged awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Andrew Webb isn't a friend of Evie's. Quite the contrary. He's a jerk, a bully even, and all of Evie's friends hate him and avoid him. (Bhodi especially. He and Andrew are both in the JV soccer program, and they're always getting up each other's noses.) Andrew is an arrogant asshole who thinks he's one of the really \"big guys\" in the sophomore class, when he's nothing but a shitty little snot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why steal his body and life? <i>To get back at him,</i> you suppose, though you yourself have nothing against him. That's why, you ultimately decide, it's Evie's personality that's making the choice, not yours. But you'll go along with it, because it makes more sense than swapping with one of her friends, and there's no one else you can really think of as an alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the mask, you make the raw metal band for copying Andrew's brain before packing up everything you'll need for the ambush. Then, after making one more quick stop for a vital bit of clothing, you go home, where you spend the evening carving runes into the metal band and affixing it to the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also take along Chen's drug drop, to hide in Dane's car in the morning so the real Evie won't be in so much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou are sick with fear\u2014Evie has the worst set of nerves\u2014as you wind your way through the crowded cafeteria toward the table where Andrew is eating with his friends. They're huddled over their food, laughing and nudging each other, and you have to poke Andrew twice in the shoulder before he turns around and looks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has piggy little eyes and a snub nose, and his upper lip curves easily into a smirk when he's amused. He's amused now, and you flinch at the gleaming leer as he openly looks you up and down from your waist to your brow. His lips part far enough to show one white tooth, which he sucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Andrew,\" you stammer. \"You got a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" He leans over to make room for you. \"Scooch in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I\u2014 I gotta go back to my friends. I just, um, wanted to ask a favor of you? What are you doing after school?\" you ask in a rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe holds your eye as he shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like, can you hang out after school? In the library, with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smirk deepens. \"Need help with your homework?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I just\u2014\" You feel yourself crimsoning all over. \"I just thought we could hang out. Do homework together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron Riggs, who has been openly listening, guffaws. Andrew shoots him a quick, gloating grin before turning back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Evie,\" he says. \"Library. After school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there too,\" Aaron says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you!\" Andrew punches him in the shoulder. Aaron laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and with a sickly grin back away. Andrew jerks his chin at you and smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the table with Evie's friends: \"Wha'd you have to go talk to Andrew about?\" Bhodi asks. He looks disgusted. \"You have a class with him?\" he asks when you mutter something about \"homework.\" You shrug and avoid his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAndrew is ten minutes late coming into the library after school\u2014ten minutes during which you remind yourself that you can always try to hook up with him again tomorrow\u2014and he's looking strong and healthy as he comes swaggering in. He's changed into a red muscle shirt, and his arms are a pink, lightly boiled shade. His white-blonde eyebrows are almost invisible, and his equally white-blonde hair is shorn very close to his skull. <i>Classic bully,</i> you find yourself thinking as you smile up weakly at him. He twitches a chair out with his foot and plops down next to you with his trademark smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got your Geometry homework out, and he nods at it. \"What period you got math?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psh, I got it fifth,\" he says. \"Right after lunch. Rather have it first, y'know, get it out of the way.\" He leans back and twines his hands behind his head. \"But then I couldn't take soccer. I was watching you guys yesterday, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I saw you. Heard you. What you said.\" You feel yourself blushing slightly at the humiliating memory, even though it's Evie's memory, not yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew holds your eye. A faint stink drifts out of his splayed armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, you kind of deserved it,\" he says, \"getting yelled at like that. You know, if you want some extra practice, extra training, I can do that with you.\" He rubs his nose, then puts his hands behind his head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd kinda like that,\" you lie. \"Would you charge me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks startled. \"Like being a personal trainer? No. Only you gotta work,\" he warns you. \"I ain't interested if you don't wanna work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd work. I don't like it when Hannah yells at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff, Hannah.\" He shuts his eyes and shrugs. Another wave of stink rolls out out of his armpits. \"I'd yell at you too, but you'd like it when I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Cos it's for your own good. You don't wanna get yelled at, don't get yourself a personal trainer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can help you with in return? Like with math? To help pay you back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes narrow. \"What kinda grades you getting in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eighties and nineties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psh.\" He looks disgusted. \"I could get grades like that if I wanted to. Not worth it, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a fucking arrogant prick,</i> you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou can only take about thirty minutes of his company before deciding that you really want to get the swap over with. So you suggest driving out some place to continue, away from the school. \"Like the river?\" Andrew says. You delicately counter that you were thinking of something more like Starbucks. He shrugs but is willing, and he leans in close to you as you trudge side by side out to the parking lot. You expect him at any moment to drape a possessive arm around your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour plan almost fails when he bridles at letting you drive, but he finally gives in with a sulk. He wedges himself behind folded arms into the front passenger seat of your car while you busy yourself with the bag in the back. He looks puzzled when you open his door, and his puzzlement turns to mild alarm when you crawl in to straddle him. But he doesn't react further before you cover his face with the blank mask. While he's out, you peel his clothes off him. Luckily, he's dressed out for a gym class in that muscle shirt, shorts, socks and shoes only, so it's easy. In the back seat you take off Evie's clothes and hurl them into the front, then change into an extra-large t-shirt and shorts that you picked up at the vintage clothing store. Only then do you tear Evie's mask off your face, fighting to keep awake as you do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou fail, and you sit up with a start when you wake again. But you must have been out for only a minute or so, for the mask is still inside Andrew. It's not long in reappearing, though, and you catch it before it can fall into his lap. You plant Evie's mask on him, and catch your breath as her skinny form replaces his. With a gulp, you hop back and, with your clothes and supplies, run for Andrew's car. Without bothering with anything else first, you start it with a roar and hurl yourself out onto Borman Avenue. You pull into the first strip center you pass, and park next to the garbage bins behind. Only then do you stop seal up Andrew's mask and make the final change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's with another hard start and a sense of deja vu that you wake again. Your brain aches with confusion, and you dig your knuckles deeply into your eyes. With a snort and a sniff you sit up and look around, trying to remember who and where you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh yeah. The Mellon Village Shopping Center.</i> You pulled in here when\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze. The sudden pulse in your ear drowns out the grumble of nearby traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you reach up and turn the drivers' mirror toward you. Andrew Webb's piggy eyes look back at you from its depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help it. You smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck, I need to go tell Aaron and Elijah about this!</i> you exclaim to yourself.</span></div></div>",

Goof on each other, get each other in trouble. Get masks of other people and prank them, get them in trouble. The ideas practically come up with themselves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, not for a minute are you tempted to follow through. It's just Andrew talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer you stare into Andrew's light blue eyes, the harder the reflection's smirk gets. <i>You don't wanna fuck around with me,</i> mirror-Andrew seems to be telling you. <i>You think I'm just gonna freak out and roll over. Fuck you, whatever your name is. I'm'a come getchu. Maybe I'll be all confused and not know what this shit all is, but I'll come after you and I'll fuck you up and by the time I'm done fucking you up you'll wish it was some other fuckers, the one's you were trying to get away from, that was fucking you up. Just watch if I don't.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look away from the mirror. He's telling you the truth, that kid inside your head with you. You can almost feel his hot breath on the back of your neck. Thoughtfully, you peel off the temporary clothes you put on back at Westside, and pull on Andrew's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore starting the car, you text Aaron and Elijah, to see where they're hanging out. You need to get them someplace where the new Evie is unlikely to find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Fuck me, it's dog barf.\" Aaron grins down at the soft, orange-brown lump that's slowly puddling on his paper plate. \"Cheese covered dog barf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheese-covered dog turd,\" Elijah corrects him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever.\" You grin across the table at them. \"Just long as you remember the rules. All in one bite,\" you explain as you pluck up one of the two \"dog turds\" befouling your own plate. It's actually a mini-burrito, but it stinks like canned dog food, and some of the gooey sauce and greasy cheese slide off it with a plop. \"No chewing,\" you continue, \"and you gotta hold it in your mouth and suck it down like a man, little bit at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus!\" Aaron explodes in a gasping laugh. \"You're talking like you're going down on it, like it's fat, Mexican cock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kick at him under the table, but bang your toes into the table support instead. \"Shit!\" You drop the mini-burrito, and the smelly brown sauce splatters onto you and your friends, who shriek and squeal and cuss you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you guys,\" you retort, \"those are the rules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What rules? Who says?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garner and Dougherty! And some other cocksucker. They were all hanging out by the portables and they were all, like, talking about how this is how you do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\" is the Taco Famoso Challenge. Or one of them. Taco Famoso is a famously hideous Mexican fast-food place, where it's said that every order comes with a side of Montezuma's Revenge. It's also said that the food is just as hot on its way out as on its way in, and tastes just the same after as before. But someone must like the food, because the place is still in business and has been for years. Or maybe it's because there are so many people who enjoy taking one of the Taco Famoso Challenges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we do it all, like, at the same time?\" Aaron asks as he pats the sauce off his t-shirt. It just adds another color to the other stains. But Aaron is always a mess, from his curly mop of brown hair down to the shoes that he never ties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're suppose'ta, like, time it,\" you explain. \"Whoever can hold it the longest without spitting it out. No, wait,\" you correct yourself as Aaron's eyebrows go up. \"It's like, if you spit any of it out, you automatically lose. But it's whoever takes the longest to swallow it all down is the winner. 'Cos of, like, the gag reflex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stare at you before exchanging an incredulous glance. Then they burst into giggles, and Elijah, who is black, covers half his face with a long hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man,\" he moans in his soft voice. \"I already can't stand the smell of this stuff. If I gots to eat it\u2014 No.\" He pushes his plate away. \"I don't care, I ain't doin' it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you gotta,\" Aaron goads him. \"If we do it, you gotta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna spit it out right away anyhow. If I don't, I'ma gonna be paintin' the walls of this place with my puke. Nn-nhn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we all do it,\" you insist. \"Spit it out and lose if you have to, but you gotta at least go along with us at the start.\" And because Elijah typically gives in to you, he grumbles and delicately picks up a mini-burrito with his forefinger and thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All together on three,\" you start. \"One\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we gots to do both of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, both. Two. Three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw your head back, open your mouth, and pop the mini-burrito into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's warm and soft, and at first you taste nothing. You close your mouth around it and gently squeeze it between your tongue and palate. Something oozes out into your cheeks. You glance around the table at your friends. Their cheeks are puffed out, and Aaron looks like he's stifling a laugh, but no one is reacting yet. And it's not really that bad. Why, you think, there's no challenge to this at all if\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits the back of your throat and nose. That stink of wet dog food, the stuff that slides out of a can like wet shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you choke. <i>Oh God it's worse than that! It </i>is<i> dog shit! It's dog shit and it's sitting on your tongue!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glmph!\" Aaron says, and his eyes pop. He turns red, and sweat pops out on his brow. \"Gw<i>phheeeewwww!</i>\" He blows the whole burrito back onto the plate. You flinch as beans and sauce spray everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a chunk of the same stuff slides down your own throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, Jesus, you're going to be sick!</i> You feel your whole stomach rushing up your esophagus, like a squad of linebackers bracing to hurl back an offensive charge. There's a burning fire behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw yourself from the booth and rush for the door. Outside, you spray the burrito in a fat, wet splat onto the pavement. Your stomach heaves, and acid pools on the back of your tongue. You cough it out, and with shaking limbs swagger back into the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElijah watches you with dancing eyes, the burrito still in his mouth. But his eyes soon begin to water. At least he has the self control to lift his plate to his mouth and gently drop the burrito back beside its twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe Challenge was your idea, to get Andrew's two best friends off someplace where the real Andrew wouldn't find them. Of course, he could always text them from Evie's phone, but that was another reason to hang out with them. When they asked you about your \"date\" with her, you jeered that she was weird and kind of psycho. \"She isn't even my type,\" you concluded with a sniff. \"Too skinny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Challenge is over, the three of you return home, for you all live just a couple of blocks from each other, just south of William McKinley Elementary, where you all first became friends in the fifth grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Andrew and Aaron and Elijah.</i> They're like a variation on the trio of <i>Will and Caleb and Keith.</i> Like you and your old friends, they spend more time with each other than with other people. But they're a tighter-knit trio, doing more things together than apart or in pairs, even at parties. But they also hang out with a lot more people and have more complicated social lives. They're a lot bolder, too. The very first weekend after they moved up into the high school, they made sure to hit The Warehouse, the high-schoolers-only party spot that is so hot and so dangerous that the trio of Prescott-Johansson-and-Tilley has never failed to wuss out of visiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they're more ambitious. They're larval jocks, though in different sports, and are pumped about being the best. Or, at least, Andrew and Aaron are. About Elijah you're not so sure. He hasn't got the same hustle as his friends. But officially, at least, he's committed to the same goal as the other two. The three of you are going to be captains of the school's prestige sports squads when you're seniors: Elijah captaining the basketball squad, Aaron captaining/quarterbacking the football team; and you (Andrew) running the soccer team. It goes without saying that one of you, at least, will be dating the head cheerleader. (Current betting is that's going to be Madison Crawford, and Andrew is careful to always attend every party that he's heard Madison will be attending.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElijah lives with his parents in a modest tract home a couple of blocks away, but Andrew and Aaron both live in a trailer park just off Carver Road, and have known each other from kindergarten. Andrew's mom works evenings at Eagle Foods, so you have the place to yourself tonight, and Aaron drops a hint about wanting to waste the evening with you. But you should probably get in contact with Caleb, to tell him what's up with you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can talk to Caleb anytime, so with a jerk of the shoulder you gesture Aaron to follow you back to your trailer. There, you sate your hunger with a couple of cans of microwaved Spaghetti-Os, and settle onto the sofa to play some Halo on a decrepit Xbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Aaron says, \"if I give you my grammar homework, can you do it for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" You keep your eyes glued on the screen, where you're trying to hunt Aaron down through the corridors of a challenge level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solid. I wouldn't ask, only I'm down to like a sixty-two average and I can't let it slide more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom making a stink?\" You hunch forward as Aaron's avatar swings into view, and you blast him into pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaiigh! Fucker!\" Aaron slaps you in the side of the leg. \"Nah, it's Coach who's\u2014 He told me at practice yesterday my grades were sucking an' I hadda get 'em up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who fucking told him? Ms. Cho?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit,\" you snort. \"Maybe it was Lindsay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betchu it was. Fecking little dicksnag. She totally would, you know.\" You strafe to one side and again blast Aaron into a puddle of raspberry jelly. \"Fat-faced little runt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay Cho, a girl in the sophomore class with you, is the kid sister of Ms. Cho, the English instructor Aaron has. No one can stand her. She's a sour-faced little bitch who gets off on getting other kids in trouble when they're just trying to have fun or blow off steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she's ugly, too. Fat, plain, and mopey-mouthed, to go with a personality like a water-logged garbage dumpster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Aaron mutters as he leans in on his controller. \"Maybe it was Mr. Fernandez.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you fucking defending Lindsay for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't defending her! Just saying! Mr. Fernandez pissed all over my last history paper, 'cos, like, he said he couldn't understand it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucker was just crunked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" Aaron hurls the controller away as you slag him for the third time in a row. He swipes his forearm across his forehead. \"I just can't ever get the words t'come out right. You know? Like I need a brain transplant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let 'em fucking get in your head, man. You don't need to know that shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do if I'm gonna keep playing,\" he grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you got me for,\" you reassure him. You clamber up onto the sofa and squeeze behind him, straddling his shoulders with your knees and giving him a neck rub. \"I'll get you up to a seventy percent. Eighty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron mumbles something, then hangs his head, giving you a better grip. The curls that tumble onto the back of his neck are soft and loose and kinda girly (when you get right down to it), and despite yourself you start to get an erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he notice? He tenses a little and raises his head fractionally. \"What are you doing back there?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretending you're Madison and I'm about to get lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Euugghh!\" He twists away and throws a hard elbow at you. You slap it away with a sniggering laugh. He dives in with a grin, and soon you're both rolling on the floor, trying to pin each other. Your chubby quickly dies during the struggle (which is fine), and the match ends with Aaron on top of you, hocking back a loogie and dangling it over your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou spend the evening dreading a text from \"Evelyn Cummings\"; worse, you dread that your new friends will get one. Eventually, you can't stand the anxiety, and after Aaron has gone home for the night you send him and Elijah both texts of your own asking if they've heard from her. When they both say <i>no</i> and <i>why?</i> you lamely admit that you're worried that she'll have a wigout or something after your \"study session\" at the library. <i>She's so weird,</i> you tell them, hoping that will inoculate them against anything she might try to say to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Andrew and Evie don't share any classes, so you don't have to worry about seeing her in class, but you do keep alert for signs of her the next day at school. You think you glimpse her in the hallways at one point, but her back is to you, so you can't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is this what it's going to be like?</i> you wonder with no little irritation. Constantly looking over your shoulder in case the real Andrew starts to come after you? <i>Maybe I should do another swap,</i> you think. <i>Find some pissy little nobody and swap with them. That way they're someone who won't come after me, and Andrew will be going after them.</i> You know of course that that's not a real solution, that's just compounding a problem that started when Caleb talked you into swapping places with Gordon Black. But you can't put the idea out of your head altogether, which is probably why you don't talk to Caleb to let him know where and who you are now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut school ends without any crisis breaking. Your mom texts you with a set of errands she needs you to run for her, and that fully occupies your attention after school lets out. Back home, you text Aaron and Elijah to see about getting together, but neither of them respond. That would\u2014and maybe should\u2014worry you, but you're also fielding texts from Ethan Clayborne, who's got questions about Geometry, and that keeps you busy and happy. If anyone deserves the title \"Most Popular Guy\" in the sophomore class, it's Ethan, which ought to piss Andrew off (and maybe it does, a little) but even he can't resist a sneaking admiration for the charismatic wrestler, and you plump up with pride at the way you're texting so casually with him, especially when he sounds interested in a party you tell him will be happening this weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you're not expecting trouble when Aaron finally gets back to you, and you're not looking for any when you swagger into his trailer. But trouble is waiting for you nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes the form of a pink-skinned kid with the face and body of Andrew Webb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAaron socks you in the stomach again. You'd howl, but you have no air left in you, and his other blows have already turned your guts into a cauldron of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron and Elijah grabbed you from behind as you came in, knocking you to the floor and pinning you. They yelled and grabbed at you as you howled back. Andrew's upside face loomed into yours, and you felt him clasp your face. You roared with a sudden fear, and felt your eyes bulge as a strong hand gripped your forehead. \"Fucker!\" you spat through foaming lips. \"Get the fuck off m\u2014!\" Then you felt your face being torn away, leaving you blind and senseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not for long. The darkness was rent by a red flash and you jerked awake with your stomach heaving like a pan of boiling pain. \"Fucker!\" Aaron screamed at you. \"What's your name? <i>What's your fucking name?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd have answered him more quickly if he hadn't kept hammering you in the guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, gasp by painful gasp, he and Elijah drew it out of you. Your name was Will Prescott, and you were a senior at the school. It was a book of magic spells that taught you how to make masks that let you steal Andrew Webb's face and body and life. And you did it because you were hiding from guys you needed to hide from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew himself wasn't present for the interrogation. Early on you heard him say, \"I'm gonna go try putting it on,\" but what \"it\" was you couldn't tell and didn't have time to worry about, not with Aaron pounding you into pancake batter while Elijah held you down. Even when Andrew reappears some minutes later to look down at you with a hard smirk, Aaron stays concentrated on you. But you notice when Andrew gloats, \"Fuck me, dude, I can remember everything you did as me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddaya fucking mean?\" Aaron growls as he glares down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I put that mask of me on, and now I can remember all the stuff I did yesterday. When it wasn't me. Like, fuck! Dana's throwing a party this weekend! You guys know about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Aaron cocks his fist again. You cringe and clench your eyes shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucker was listening in to her and Madison talk about it, butted his ass all in and\u2014\" Aaron pounds you the side of the head, and the rest of Andrew's words are lost in the clamor of your ringing skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElijah speaks. Unlike Aaron, who is boiling with rage, he is calm and soft-spoken. \"So, like, you remember where the real Evie is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I knew where she was all along,\" Andrew brags. \"She's being some hairy kid up in the senior class, I think. Not this guy. Some other guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dane,\" you groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where his shit is?\" Aaron asks his friend. \"The stuff he used to fuck around with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew pulls at his nose, then nods. \"Oh, sure. Back at my place. He put it in my closet. Want me to go get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we gonna do about Evie?\" Elijah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew sniggers down at you. \"Turn this fucker back into her. He was her before, he can be her again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck,\" Elijah says, very softly. Andrew says, \"Was she in on it?\" When no one answers, he slaps you across the face. \"I asked you a question, fuck-face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. She\u2014 I told you, I was trying to hide, I just did the thing with her like I did with\u2014\" You try swallowing, but it hurts too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should go help her,\" Elijah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh.\" Andrew leans over you with a leer. \"We're gonna turn this fucker back into her, and then we're gonna make him show us how to do this shit so we can do it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver all over. Trapped as Evie Cummings, under the thumb of these assholes and helping them, might be even worse than hanging out as Dane with the threat of Gary Chen looming over you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're saved from who knows what awful fate by a buzz from Evie's cell phone. It's her mom, telling her to come home. Andrew spits and cusses, but acquiesces when the others insist on sending home someone who looks like their classmate. You, of course, are volunteered, and Andrew even wants to force you to change into Evie's clothes in front of him and his friends, but Elijah and even Aaron force him to back down. Still, you're in tears as you run out of Aaron's trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've recovered somewhat when you reach Evie's house, though her mom notices your semi-hysterical mood. You put her off with a stammered lie about having had a bad fight with some of your friends, and she lets you retreat to a bathroom to wash up. You're in slightly better shape when you emerge to silently nibble at your dinner, but you have to put Evie's mom off again with the excuse that you don't really want to talk about the trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no point in trying to make another body swap to escape those assholes. They'd soon figure out where to find you. And even if they didn't, whoever you victimized would. It's one of the things that came in a flash as you were driving home: a memory of Evie Cummings looking at herself in a bathroom mirror and tentatively putting a hand to her brow to wrench at her face as arcane syllables of power bubbled on her lips. Then everything went dark. And when next she clambered upright to study her reflection, her lips curls into a triumphant smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory of how to take masks off: you left it in her mask when last you removed it. So all Andrew had to do was concentrate, and he could remember how to do the same thing. That is how he got out of her mask, so he could prove to his friends who he really was. Other memories, of a wondering Evie studying her naked body while not only Elijah and Aaron but Andrew grinned at her, tell you that his friends also took turns trying the mask on before they called you out for that ambush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, bottom-line, your days of body-swapping are over. Worse, Andrew and his friends now have that crazy book\u2014a thought that makes you shudder all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere isn't any place to hide from them, but after this afternoon there's no way in hell you're going to continue on with Evie's life. No, it's best to face them as Dane Matthias, even with Dane's cousin and Gary Chen being mad at him. Or maybe you should go back further and get yourself back into Gordon's mask. Those little sophomore pricks would have a lot harder time bullying you if you had Gordon's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe you should just undo everything you've gotten into. Give Dane his life back, give Gordon his life back, resume your own. With luck, Gordon and Dane will just be so confused that they won't link you to the weirdness. Even if they do, you feel you'd have a much less stressful time of it if you had to deal with everyone from behind your own face and not another's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after dinner you get permission to run into town for some quick errands. The first of those takes you to a Dollar General, where you buy the cheapest and flimsiest t-shirt and pair of shorts you can. Then, after changing into them and out of Evie's mask in her car, you drive out to Dane's trailer park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Dane Matthias asks from behind the screen door. His brow is deeply furrowed and his eyes are pools of fear and worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks hunted. You shouldn't blame him. But it makes you very tired to have to reason with the disguised Evie Cummings when you're here to rescue her from a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it won't help for you to yell or to act like a dickweed. So you put on your cheeriest smile and pretend like you're Dane's best friend. \"Hey man!\" you exclaim. \"How you doin'? I should'a texted you or something first, but I came over to see if you wanted to hang out or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDane looks very doubtful, and glances over his shoulder into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't,\" he says. \"Things are kind of, um, busy here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Busy with what? Your mom home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitates, then shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then if you can't come out, you know, to go looking for girls or a party, at least come sit out on the roof of the car with me. I'm bored, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got better plans?\" You spread your arms in an invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDane stares at you, and his expression turns very haggard. Then with a pained sigh, he sags and pushes open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it,\" you tell him. \"You just gotta hang loose. What happened the most relaxed guy at school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes Dane a moment to realize you're talking about him. Before he can reply, though, you've stepped behind him. That moment of hesitation was all that you needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grasp him from behind and grab his forehead with one hand. He freezes in your embrace, which gives you time to rip his face away from his skull. The mask comes off in your hand, and Dane's clothes slip a little as Evie's small, slender frame apparates within them. You haul her up into your arms and carry her out to her car. There you strip her and pile her clothes onto her naked body before scrambling back to Dane's trailer. Instead of going inside, though, you hide in the small yard behind it, and it's there that you change into Dane's trademark flannel pajama bottoms and smelly t-shirt. You put the mask to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAfter you wake, you climb into Dane's trailer through an open window in the back, just in case Evie's car is still parked out front. You find yourself in what you take to be his mom's bedroom, and it's as dirty and disheveled as you remember his room being, with dirty dishes and old magazines piled up atop mounds of funky-smelling clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone's snoring in the living room when you emerge, and your heart sinks when you find Dane's rat-faced cousin\u2014what was his name?\u2014sacked out on the broken-backed sofa. No wonder Evie was acting so frightened. You need to get out of here before he wakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after softly searching everywhere, you can find neither car keys nor a cell phone. You're on the point of slipping on some shoes and making a hike of it to a bus stop or something when Dane's cousin stirs, sits up, and smacks his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubs his eye and yawns. \"You packed yet, man?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Packed?\" you echo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, packed,\" he says, glaring up at you. \"Got your shit together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jesus!\" Dane's cousin heaves himself to his feet and swaggers over. Too late you duck, and he smacks you hard on the side of the head. \"The fuck have you been doing?\" He grabs you by the back of your shirt and hustles you down the hall to Dane's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ, you didn't even get started!\" he snarls. \"Hurry it up!\" He shoves you hard. \"I told Ila we'd be back by nine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you notice the suitcase just inside the bedroom door. \"Um, is there anything I should specially take?\" Your head spins, and your heart bobs with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything you don't want to leave behind,\" Dane's cousin retorts. \"Gonna give you five minutes, and after that you're shit outta luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, not having any idea what's going on, you shove every scrap of Dane's clothing you can find into the suitcase. \"Got y'r toothbrush?\" you're asked when you appear with your bag, and you duck your head as you run into the bathroom. Dane's cousin looks thoroughly disgusted with you\u2014but too tired to hit you again\u2014by the time you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes you back to his place (you assume), where he and a skanky woman with tattoos and some missing teeth ignore you for the rest of the evening. You ask if you can go out for a bit\u2014a chance to get away, maybe find the real Dane at Gordon's place\u2014but that only gets you another slap and a sneering, \"You fucking with me?\" Your spirits are very low when you bed down for the night in the living room. <i>At least,</i> you tell yourself, <i>I can go find Dane at school tomorrow and we can straighten this out.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the next morning Dane's cousin doesn't drive you to school. No, he drives you to the municipal airport and puts you on a turbo prop with a one-way ticket. When your journey is over, you are in Oregon, and a representative from the Fort Putnam Military Academy is at the airport to pick you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *<br>\r\n* * * * *<br>\r\n* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Carmona!\" Curt Bossard shouts as he tosses the package into your dorm-mate's outstretched hands. \"Better be cookies! Tompkins!\" He tosses out another package to its recipient. \"Better be cookies. Matthias! That better be a cake,\" the prefect growls as you catch the heavy box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTess Miller titters. \"Marijuana brownies,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddaya think this is, nineteen seventy-five?\" Bossard rocks back on his heels to watch as you pull at the brown paper the box is wrapped in. Given that it's from Dane's mom, it just might be something with weed in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanksgiving is coming in a rush, and care packages are now flowing into Fort Putnam. Still, it's a surprise to get something from Saratoga Falls. In the six weeks since Dane's cousin hustled you out here, this is the first physical item you've received.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your jaw drops and your hair crawls over your scalp when you rip back the tape and pull back the box flaps. It's not food that Marianne Matthias has sent you. It's a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than that, it's a book bound in red leather. When, in a semi-trance, you lift open the front cover, a row of hand-drawn faces grin and wink at you from the title page. They change expressions, aspects, and genders as you stare at them.</span></div></div>",

Oh, just a book,\" you reply, and quickly shut the box up again. \"It's a surprise, is all,\" you add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it's a surprise. In the six weeks since your exile to Oregon and the Fort Putnam Military Academy\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix weeks of reveille and drills; of hard classes and daily sports and dorm inspections; and of learning that the flabby body of Dane Matthias and the wilting stamina of Will Prescott can toughen up considerably when there's a prefect or a commandant to bark at you\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, not even in six hard-packed weeks has a day gone by that you've not thought about the book that landed you in all this trouble. And it's not like you're ever likely to forget about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the last thing you ever expected was to open a box from Saratoga Falls and find the damned thing grinning up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're too dazed to think clearly, but you're not so out of as to miss the glances and winks that your friends exchange. Suddenly, you're on the alert. There's a lot of respect for private property at the Putnam Academy. But if one of the guys here decides to grab the book and share it, the talk would quickly get pretty goddamned awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go back to my dorm room, get my homework done,\" you mutter as you scramble to your feet. \"Catch you guys later.\" As you leave, someones sniggers, \"Porn,\" setting off a round of snickers and snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're halfway down the hall when you hear your name called. It's Tess Miller. \"You sure cut out in a hurry,\" she says as she hurries up. \"It's not bad news from home, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It's just something I wasn't expecting to get is all. I\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're stopped in mid-stream by the worry in her wide, china-blue eyes. She's a tiny thing\u2014she hardly comes up to your chin\u2014and her mousy brown hair is done up in a small, disorderly bun. She's in fatigues, and they sit on her tiny body like pajamas. You have the urge to reach up and undo that bun, shaking her hair out and caressing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just worried about my mom,\" you tell her. \"And I have to do a little thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe furrow between her eyebrows deepens. \"Your mom or your stepmom?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, Jesus.</i> You feel your cheeks pale. \"Stepmom,\" you reply. <i>But now that she's mentioned it ...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiller goes up on her toes and puts her mouth near your chin. You put your hand to the small of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not gonna pry,\" she says. \"I mean, Lord knows your life's complicated enough without <i>me</i> mixing myself up in it. But if you need to talk, you know where to find me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment hangs. Then you lean down to peck her on the upper lip. She returns you the tiniest smooch on your chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she hops back and gives you one quick, bright smile over her shoulder before scampering (hands tucked behind her back) to the commons room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBack in your dorm room, you prop yourself on your bed and check out the box. It was sent under her name from Dane's mom's address, and it holds nothing but the book and a lot of wadded-up newsprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat worries you. Because you could maybe, just barely, with a lot of stress and strain, believe that Dane's mom might, somehow, in some bizarre way, while mailing you something else (like a batch of marijuana brownies) have accidentally mailed you the <i>SAME GODDAMN BOOK</i> you used to impersonate her son. But there is <i>No. Fucking. Way.</i> you can imagine her LOL-mailing you just the book, as though she thought or knew that you needed and wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's assuming that she had the book. Which she wouldn't have had to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps sound outside in the hallway, and you fly over to hide the book in your footlocker under your clothes and gear. Then you jump over to desk and open up email on the laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix weeks of life at Fort Putnam, and you're still not used to not having a cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you have to think long and hard before you are ready to hit \"Send\" on the email you compose to Caleb. And even then you only write a short note: <i>Hey, is there anything weird happening back home? Weird in you know what way?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohansson is the only person back home (except for the three sophomore assholes, obviously) who knows what happened to you, and how, and you've keep in pretty close touch with him. Naturally it was a shock to him when, three days after your induction into the Fort Putnam Military Academy, he got an email from you telling him about it all. He was even madder\u2014and more scared\u2014when you told him about Andrew and his friends, and how you lost the book to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>THERE'S SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, WILL! HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO BE THE BIGGEST FUCK-UP OF THEM ALL?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe passed a nervous week or two, during which nothing too weird or frightening happened. With any luck, you and Caleb finally agreed, Andrew and his friends had managed to kill themselves, or had moved to Hollywood and were now impersonating movie stars. During your interrogation, you had given them no clue that Caleb existed or knew anything about the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that it has turned up again, you're nervous about telling Caleb about it. Six weeks have gone by, so who knows what has changed at home, and in what way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Caleb eventually replies with, <i>No, everything's normal around here, why?</i> you reply: <i>No reason, bored, just checking in.</i> You don't know that he'll buy your excuse for emailing him, but you don't much care if he does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later you're finishing up math homework when your roommate, Timothy Carmona, shuffles in, and you brace yourself for questions about that mysterious package that sent you running. But he only slumps in front of his own laptop with a sigh, before stripping down to his tidy whities and sliding into his bed. \"Don't stay up too late, okay man?\" he asks before putting his head under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're up at seven the next morning for reveille, mess and inspection, followed by six hours of classes and two hours of physical training and sports. Then comes evening mess, formation, and study hall. It's not until twenty-one hundred hours that you have time to pull out the book to re-examine it. You're on your bed, flipping pages, when Carmona comes in. But you've got your back to him, hiding the book with your body, so you ignore him and keep concentrating on the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize the first few spells, the ones that you yourself uncovered. The ones that make a mask, the sealant for a mask, and a strip of metal that can copy the inside of someone's brain. It's almost as if the words had imprinted themselves on your mind, so that you don't even need to translate the ingredients and instructions to know what they say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut someone's been busy with it in the meantime, for more spells have been unlocked. You haven't translated them, to see what they do, but there's only a handful of them before the book's style begins to change. After one very short spell, which takes up only half a page, come pages covered in blocks of print that don't look like ingredients or instructions, and which don't even come with sigils. And then\u2014horrors!\u2014come pages that have sigils but no words!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPage after page you flip deeper into the book, wondering what the spells do, and how much mayhem they've caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've only spent about fifteen minutes on it, though, when there's a tap at the door and Miller puts her head into your room. \"Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to take a quick walk around the track,\" she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you get enough running during the day?\" you grumble. But you can't help smiling as you push the book under the covers and roll off the bed to join her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft rush of traffic from the highway lends the otherwise still night air a feeling of restlessness, but the darkness is soothing. The blazing lights of the main hall slant across the grass, but the arc lights are out, and the circular track, when you come to it, is a pool of gray. Side by side, you and Miller take the circle at a brisk pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was one of the first to make friends when, scared and disoriented, you arrived at Fort Putnam. At first you only took her friendliness for pity and charity, because Carmona and most of the other cadets were also encouraging as you adjusted to early hours, quick-time regimentation, inspection and regulation, and (groan) physical activity. But it didn't take you long to realize the twinkle in Miller's grin meant something more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd because you were lonely, desperate, frightened, and grateful all at once, you pushed away your usual reticence and incredulity, and returned her interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you and Miller have been able to do more than exchange a few still-chaste kisses\u2014there's no place on the campus for more than that. And, in truth, there's no hint that she does want more than that. It seems to be enough for her that you're able to sit and touch and lean against each other without embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's okay with you. Like she mentioned yesterday, your life is complicated enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you thought about what you're doing for Christmas?\" she asks now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking about just staying here over the break,\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want to go home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says nothing for another quarter-turn around the track. But it's a pregnant silence, and you tense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Will,\" she says softly. \"Don't you <i>want</i> to see your real family again? Even if it's just from across the street?\"</span></div></div>",

Even if it's just from across the street?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hang your head. \"What's the freaking point?\" you mutter when she asks you to repeat what you said. \"They don't even know I'm gone. Hell, they probably like the new kid better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you freaking say that, Will Prescott!\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's true. At least you can't help thinking it's true. The \"Will Prescott\" you left back home (Caleb tells you) tried out for the varsity basketball squad a few weeks back, and though your old carcass is a lot shorter and weaker and his old one, Gordon Black was able to use it to haul himself back onto the team. That's impressive enough, but the mulish Gordon also isn't taking any shit from the bullies who used to harass you, and though he's shuffled into class a few times with bruises and scrapes that you'd never have sported, he seems to be getting more respect too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally\u2014and this is what really makes you think your dad must be overjoyed at his son's personality change\u2014he's taken a job at your father's workplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know better than to argue with Miller, though. And maybe she's right. Maybe you're just stressed out. But you tense further when she says, \"When you go home at Christmas, maybe you could go see the guy that's living in your house? Talk him into giving you your life back? So he could have his back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've talked about that before,\" you remind her. \"It would be a mess. And then it wouldn't be <i>me</i> coming back here when school starts again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hike silently around the track for a bit. Then you feel her hand groping for yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should, Will,\" she says in a pained voice. \"We all love having you out here. But you can't just give up. It's <i>your life.</i> You have to get it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeeze her hand, but don't reply. It's another half-circuit of the track before she speaks again. \"But I guess you're worried about those guys back home. The ones you have to hide from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the gut-twisting tension comes welling up, and you almost gag on it. <i>That's what I'm stressed out at,</i> you realize. <i>Those fucking sophomores. They ran me out of town and I'm too scared to go back and face them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the book's come back to me. They can't use it against me, and I can use it to fix things.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly you pull Miller off the track. \"Come back with me to my room,\" you tell her. \"I got something to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got Taps in about ten minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's long enough for me to show you,\" you tell her. \"Then you can sleep on it. <i>I</i> can sleep on it. We can talk about it tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou have only five minutes with Miller to show her the book, tell her what it is, and how it got to you. She wants to ask you lots more questions, you can tell, but the scurrying of feet in the halls tells her she has to get back over to the girls' wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat leaves you alone with Carmona, talking with him in the dark about masks and magic and people who are not who they appear to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was the first one you unburdened yourself with\u2014even before Tess Miller\u2014in the privacy of the dorm room. It was your second week at the school, and you were feeling homesick. Badly homesick. Timothy Carmona wasn't contemptuous, but he wasn't very sympathetic either, and he told you the best thing to do was to write home\u2014it would make your family feel less distant. You told him you didn't have a family, not anymore, not for real. Marianna Matthias, you told him, was your stepmother, and she was widowed, so she didn't care about you. He told you that sucked and he was sorry for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only made a hard face at you the next night, though, when he caught you on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the night after\u2014more out of of spite and anger than because you wanted his help or pity\u2014you told him there was more to your story than what you'd let on. Something so big that you couldn't carry it on your own shoulders anymore. He flinched and tried to withdraw, but you told him that you had to show him, said that if he'd give you ten minutes to show him, he'd want to know more. He looked skeptical as you settled back on your bed and put your hand to your brow and pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to try the mask on himself of course, after lights out, and you told him all about the stuff that had happened to you. It freaked him out, but he had a steady nerve, and since then you've had long talks with him about the reality of magic and how it changes everything that you once thought to be true. One night he got real moody, and confessed that he sort of thought you had it all coming to you\u2014what with the way you used the masks to do a body swap with Gordon Black; and it was really a shitty thing what you'd done to Evie Cummings\u2014but he admitted that it was hard for him to judge because he hadn't been there and didn't know what it was like to have a sociopathic basketball player or a psychopathic drug dealer after your ass. Anyway, it seemed like you were being pretty thoroughly punished for your occult crimes. And that was all he had to say on the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a week later, when it became clear that you and Tess Miller were going to be semi-serious about each other, he insisted that you tell her about it all too. \"You never know, man,\" he said, \"you might get yourself out of this shit. And what're you gonna do if you're serious about her and she's serious about Dane Matthias, and then she finds out you're not him?\" So together you arranged a meeting time and place so you could show Miller your real face as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange to say, it didn't really change things between you three. You might have the face and body of Dane Matthias, but it's you and you only under the mask, so it wasn't like Carmona and Miller had to get to know anyone new. And having that kind of secret has only given you an even stronger bond with them, probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, with the return of the book ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Don't wait for Christmas, man.\" Carmona's voice floats softly in the dark. He has to talk softly, for the walls are thin, and everyone is supposed to be asleep. \"You can still get home for Thanksgiving. You can put everyone back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who comes back here when break is over?\" you reply. \"If everyone's back to being themselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The real Matthias. Dur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthias can't handle it out here. I told you what he's like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll straighten him out. Like we did you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says it as a tease, but you make a face anyway. \"People are gonna wonder what happened to him,\" you say. \"He's not gonna know what's going on, how to do anything.\" Your heart beats in your chest. \"Maybe I should wait till graduation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to cut it, and you need to cut it out fast, Prescott. You're in this mess now because you wouldn't fix things when you had the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere sounds a single hard, sharp rap on the wall\u2014a warning from a neighbor that your voices are carrying. You turn onto your stomach and lean out into the space between your bed and Carmona's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There could be a huge mess back home,\" you whisper at him. \"Those shitheads down in the sophomore class. Am I supposed to fix everything, including whatever they've done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmona doesn't answer right away. Your labored breathing fills the darkness. Then he turns over and leans out to meet you in space halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta take care of your side of things,\" he murmurs. \"After that, if you see a way, you can take care of them. Now go to sleep.\" He pulls himself with a groan back under his covers. \"We can talk about it more tomorrow.\" The bed creaks as he settles in. He closes things with a muttered, \"Miller'll be full of bright ideas too, I bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull yourself back into your bed. Carmona has a pretty strong, knock-down ethical case for your going back home ASAP. But you're full of practical worries, bad worries that keep you awake until long after he's snoring softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike: If you go back home and take your old place again, Andrew Webb and his friends are going to know it, because although Gordon Black might be able to play varsity-level basketball with your body, you can't. If you go back home, you're going to have to find and disarm them before you go back to being yourself. And that's a pretty tall order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"You're scared,\" Carmona says the next afternoon as you jog along next to each other around the track. Classes are over, but you've still got two hours of physical exercise to complete before you can go in for a little free time and third mess. But at least the day is winding down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right I'm scared,\" you retort. \"Maybe they're only sixteen years old, but they're a couple of psychos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not psychos,\" he retorts in turn. \"Just assholes. Besides, didn't you tell me you and your friend think they might've killed themselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd still have to make sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So make sure.\" He turns his head to spit over his shoulder. \"You're just telling me you're scared to. You want help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you offering?\" you ask, surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" He makes a face. \"But I got a feeling Miller's gonna shame me into volunteering. She already told me she wants to go back with you to help. And if you're real scared,\" he adds, \"you could tell Bossard what's going on, maybe a few more people. Get <i>lotsa</i> help.\" But he sounds disgusted as he says it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sure enough, when you catch up with Miller at third mess, she's in a chirpy, chipper mood and is full of offers to help. The three of you\u2014you, her and Carmona\u2014put your heads together at the corner of one of the side tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I don't have to back home for the break,\" she tells you. \"If you want, you know, a friend to go out there with you\u2014 And you know,\" she interrupts herself, \"if you're gonna send that other guy back, the, uh, real Dane Matthias\u2014\" She turns a little pink, as she always does, when distinguishing between you and the guy you only resemble. \"He's gonna need help. Someone to explain what he's coming back to and stuff. I can\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can wait until he gets out here,\" Carmona interjects. \"You don't want to scare him off.\" He looks over at you with an inquiring expression. \"Is he gonna freak out if he comes out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Totally. It was hard enough for me. I never seen Dane except when he's baked, and I don't think he was passing any of his classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiller and Carmona continue to quietly argue about whether it's better for Dane to get some warning and preparation before he's hustled back to Fort Putnam. For your part, you wonder if it would be best to let him run off on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat presumes, of course, that you actually return to retake your old life and return the others to theirs. You get a bad clutch of butterflies in your stomach each time you think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that, finally, is why you allow Miller to talk you into letting her come back to Saratoga Falls with you, and still more it's why you're silently grateful when Carmona (who was going to stay at the school over the break to work on college application materials) offers to come along too. If you didn't get that kind of backup, you're not sure you'd have the guts to go back home at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt takes you some serious finagling to scrape up the money for a plane ticket back to Saratoga Falls. Your \"stepmom\" takes almost a week to reply to your email asking for a ticket, and then it's only to tell you that Duane refuses to spring for one. But Miller and Carmona have a little extra money they can advance you, and you beg and borrow the balance off other classmates. Miller, meanwhile, has to give her parents a story about switching Thanksgiving plans so she can visit the campus of a prospective college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it all works out, and when Saturday the twenty-second comes, the three of you are on an American Airlines flight to Chicago, where you change to a commuter jet to Saratoga Falls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's like stepping out of a time machine,</i> you think as you ride the airport shuttle into town. When you left it was still late summer, with heavy green leaves weighing down every tree, under a sun still hot enough to tempt you into t-shirts and cargo shorts. Now, a cold, slanting rain slashes across the shuttle van's windows, and the bird-like Tess Miller hugs herself against temperatures that (if the forecast is right) will barely tap at the underside of fifty degrees. Those few trees that don't scratch at the clouds with bare branches shiver under a thinning shroud of brown leaves. You didn't expect fireworks on your return. But the miserable weather is foreboding. The forecast is for snow on Thanksgiving Day itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van drops you off downtown in front of the convention center, where you're able to catch a cab to your motel. Miller's family sent her some money to cover her expenses while visiting the Keyserling College campus, but though they were generous, the money isn't really enough to support three people. So although you technically have a week to sort things out, you know that you've really only got a couple of days\u2014the rest of the weekend, and Monday and Tuesday, before the high school lets out for the break\u2014to get things back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo stretch expenses, you reserved a room at best \"cheap\" motel you could find online. It turns out to be an old, shabby motor court clinging to life on the southern edge of the city, but the room you're given is clean and well-kept, though it has a stale smell. Miller crinkles her nose and remarks that the last few occupants clearly didn't smoke their cigarettes outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving your bags in the room, the three of you walk up the street to the Sunshine Diner for an early supper. A short, slight blonde kid about your age meets you at the host's station, and he's leading you back toward a booth when he suddenly wheels and fixes you with a startled look. \"Dane?\" he says. \"Good God! <i>Matthias?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey!\" you exclaim, and feel the sweat pop out on your brow. You hope this guy isn't one of Matthias's best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When'd'ju get back to town?\" the kid says. His eyes and grin both gleam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today. Just now.\" You jerk your chin at a south-facing window. \"Stayin' at the Layzee-Nites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not with your mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well.\" You shrug and run your hand over your close-cropped buzz cut. \"Things change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess they do.\" The kid gestures you and your companions to a booth. \"I almost didn't recognize you.\" He chews on half a grin. \"So how come you didn't recognize me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the color drain from your face. \"Oh, um\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dane's just embarrassed,\" Miller says, leaping in as she snuggles up close to you. \"He was, like, I don't wanna go home, my friends aren't gonna know it's me.\" You suck down your upper lip and nod in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wha'd you come home for, then?\" the kid asks. \"You're not gonna see your mom, not gonna see your friends. The hell's the point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm gonna go see 'em,\" you protest. \"I just feel weird is all. Shy.\" You pull Miller closer to you. \"Oh, these are some guys from Fort Putnam. They didn't have anything better to do, so they came out with me. That's Tim Carmona,\" you say, nodding at your roommate. \"And this\u2014\" You put your arm around her shoulders. \"This is Tess Miller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice.\" The kid passes out the menus as the three of slide into a booth. \"Get whatever you want, this one's on the house. Be back with some coffee,\" he adds, and is away before you can protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of Dane's friends?\" Carmona asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck if I know,\" you mutter. \"Damn. Used to, I'd just try bluffing him by pretending to be baked out of my skull. Can't do that now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll eat and we'll go,\" Carmona says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Dane's friend has other ideas, and after bringing you your order he slides in next to Carmona. \"So what they got ya doin' out there, man?\" he asks as he leans both elbows on the table top. \"I don't think I ever seen you clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug weakly. \"They got me straightened up real fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthias flunked his first inspection,\" Carmona interjects. \"But after being put on a five-mile hike with thirty pounds in his pack, he never flunked again.\" He grins at you as he stabs a juicy sausage with his fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carmona's my roommate,\" you tell your host. \"He doesn't let me get away with shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you on break now? Whaddaya call it, R&amp;R?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanksgiving break,\" Carmona dryly informs him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're on break, you should come out to Colson's tonight.\" The kid grins as he leans across the table to run his palm over your shorn head. \"Try to let your hair out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerk away. \"I don't know if that's a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, man, everyone's gonna wanna see you. I'm gonna tell them about you, and they're gonna freak out when they hear.\" He waggles his eyebrows. \"Prescott and his posse o' pussy are gonna be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prescott?\" you say, and a thrill runs down your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation lags for a beat. Then the kid nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, I guess he didn't start hanging out with us until after you left. Will Prescott, remember him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know who he is.\" That thrill down your spine turns into a hard shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he started hanging out with us. Dude's got pussy trailing after him like cats after tuna fish.\" He squirms. \"I ain't too proud, I picked up some of what he's kicked away. But some of those girls liked you, man, you know?\" He waggles his eyebrows again. \"You show up tonight\u2014 Shit! Some of them'll be begging for a three-way, if sharing you's the only way\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe catches himself and pales. You follow his glance, and realize he must have caught the expression on Miller's face. Your own cock, which had been hardening, quickly deflates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, everyone's gonna wanna see you,\" the kid stammers as he scoots out of the booth before Miller can fry him with her high beams. \"Bring your friends out. You don't wanna be stuck in a motel room on a Saturday night, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nNo you don't, especially when you're on a schedule and have a lot of jobs you need to get done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut back in the room afterward, you only allude to the party idea once under Miller's frosty gaze. \"It sounds like the perfect place to get in contact with Gordon Black,\" you observe. \"I mean, if I'm going to go back to being myself.\" You trail off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmona nods, but Miller says nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, there's the very practical worry\u2014which you discussed with them quietly on the plane\u2014about returning to your life without first having tracked down Andrew Webb and his friends. That had been one of the original plans you'd talked about: Going out to Webb's house and confronting whoever or whatever was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you also talked about being more indirect. Caleb knows all about the switch, but you haven't told him yet that you're coming back to town. Perhaps you should make contact with him first.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's not much talk in the motel room as you mull your options. A quick strike against Andrew Webb or one of his friends might give you a quick lead on what they've been up to in your absence. Talking to Caleb would give you another ally on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you decide on the third option\u2014to go to this party and get a look at the person that \"Will Prescott\" has become. If he's changed so much, then you want to know how different he is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause that might change your mind about creeping back into your old life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's not what you tell Carmona and Miller, though, when you tell them your decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to talk to this guy,\" you explain. \"Tell him that help is here, that things are gonna get fixed.\" You knead your fingers. \"Maybe\u2014\" Your mouth is dry, and you have to swallow before you can finish. \"Maybe we make a switch back now, tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmona nods. But Miller looks hurt and skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Dane! <i>Whooooooo!\"</i> The kid standing in the doorway throws his head back and howls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's a tousle-headed goober, with fluffy brown hair and a stoner's drooping eyes. The cigarette between his slim fingers dangles an inch of ash off its end as he puts out his free hand to give you a complicated handshake. \"You're rusty, man,\" he laughs. \"Rusty and crusty. And the fuck happened to your hair?\" He wobbles on his feet as he reaches out to rub your close-shorn scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party is down in the student ghetto south of the Keyserling campus. It's a tiny, cramped house built of whitewashed cinderblock, looking more like a bunker than a bungalow. A hard-edged beat pounds out of the open door into the cold night air, but inside it's as hot as a greenhouse. A dozen or more kids are jammed in the living room, pushed up into the corners or sandwiched atop each other on a tiny sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your friends were late getting there, for you had to return to the diner to hook up with the guy who invited you, and he had to stay until closing time. It's nearing midnight now as you enter Terry Colson's place. But that means the party is just starting to get good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's too many names and faces to keep track of, and there's only a few you know and remember from school. You make a point of introducing them to Carmona and Miller, which forces them to introduce themselves back, and in this way you're able to figure out that Terry Colson himself is the fluffy-headed smoker who pulled you inside; that the girl in the leopard-skin jacket is Rebecca Sykes; that the pallid kid with the shaved head is a Mark Zimsomething; and that the girl with Will Prescott's arm draped around her shoulders is Ceres Kesey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cock can't help but stiffen when you see the girl that your replacement has reeled in. <i>That could be me with her,</i> you think, and you can barely tear your eyes off her, even though you know you should be concentrating on her squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has cornflower-blue eyes and limp blonde hair that trails to the top of her breasts. She sports a retro-style red-print bandana like something a hippie folk-rock singer would have worn back in the 70s, and she wears a floppy long-sleeve tie-dyed shirt under a leather vest. Her pants are soft, baggy brown things with a drawstring at the front; ragged sandals enclose her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'd just have to unknot the drawstring, and all her clothes would fall off,</i> you think. <i>And then I could go in.</i> Your cock starts to throb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Prescott!\" You grin at your replacement as you sidle up. The girl lifts her head off his shoulder to give you a bleary-eyed glance, but you try not to look at  her. \"Heard you're making out great on the basketball squad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hardly recognize the guy you used to be. The stiff, straw-like hair that used to curl over your eyebrows and ears has been chopped back into a short but lush crewcut fronted by a tight wave over the forehead. The face is leaner than the one you remember looking back at you out of a mirror, and the eyes are harder. He doesn't hunch, either, but holds himself with his shoulders back and his chest out. He's wearing an extra-large, sleeveless muscle shirt that shows off biceps that have acquired a noticeable bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrescott gives you a quick, bored, hooded look. \"'Sup, man,\" he mutters before turning his face back to Ceres's. He puts his nose close to hers, and pulls her in. <i>Jesus,</i> you think as he sucks at her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Matthias.\" A hand settles on your shoulder. \"Lori wants to say hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a minute. I wanna catch up with Prescott here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing his name, your replacement back at you. There's infinite distance inside his gaze. And nowhere in that infinity is there a spark of either interest or pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you allow yourself to be pulled away to talk to a girl with blue hair, who squeals and throws her arms around your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"This is a bad idea,\" you tell Miller as the roar of male voices rises within the house. It's after two, and you're huddling outside with her in a darkened corner of the front yard. \"I should go in and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was your idea to come out here,\" she retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't my idea to start a fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is what Carmona is inside doing. Having made no headway in getting \"Prescott\" alone, you were bitching to your roommate about how useless the night has turned out. After wandering off to get himself a third (or sixth?) beer, he came back five minutes ago to say he knew how to get Prescott for you. \"Just go outside and wait,\" he told you. When you wondered aloud what he was going to do, Miller matter-of-factly told you he was going to pick a fight with your replacement. \"Stepping outside\" would lead to a jog down to a vacant lot, where you'd be able to jump him and get the mask off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It must be a Putnam Academy thing,</i> you decide. <i>How else does Miller know what Carmona is up to?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a shrill <i>Fuck you, man!</i> from inside, and you pull away from Miller, determined to intervene. But it's too late. The front door bangs open and Prescott and Carmona barge out. \"Come at me, fucker,\" Prescott says as he wheels on your roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down the street,\" Carmona retorts. \"Rest of you, back inside!\" he shouts at the crowd that's spilled out into front yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCries go up: \"Don't be an asshole!\" \"He's gonna kick your ass, man!\" \"Will!\" Miller restrains you from running over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psh!\" Prescott throws his hands in the air and stalks away. Carmona runs after and grabs him. Prescott swings around with his fist, and just like that, they tumble into some of the parked cars and sink down onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Miller can't hold you. \"Get back! Get back!\" you holler at the crowd as you dive between them and the combatants. \"I'll take care of this! Miller!\" Behind you, as you turn to concentrate on the fighters, you see your bantam-weight girlfriend jump in to push at the crowd. She seems to take special relish in shoving Lori Sherman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sink to your knees next to Carmona, who has pinned the cursing Prescott to the ground. \"Hold him for me?\" you mutter. He nods and says, \"Get his face off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace. Carmona has no idea how big Gordon is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you twist around to grapple with his shoes first. \"Jesus, man, what are you doing?\" Carmona grunts as Prescott twists and bats at him. \"You're at the wrong end!\" But it doesn't take you long to yank your replacement's shoes off\u2014though he tries kicking you in the face\u2014and you scramble around to lay your hands on his face. He snarls and tries to bite you. Your fingers slip the first time you try pulling at the mask, but the second time is a charm. The boy beneath Carmona is suddenly very still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, guys!\" you holler as you jump back out into the open. \"They just need to talk it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friend's a real psycho,\" one of the partygoers yells. \"They all like that back at your school?\" yells another. <i>Dane Matthias isn't going to be real popular with his old friends after tonight,</i> you reflect as you herd them back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, he's big,\" Carmona grunts when you and Miller rejoin him. You can't make out Gordon's face real good in the dark, but the form looks about right: tall, barrel-chested, and hulking. \"You're not gonna be able to hold him after he wakes up,\" you warn your roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do?\" Miller asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou study the guy who has been living\u2014and completely rearranging\u2014your life over the last two months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We talk to him,\" you reply. \"Tell him the nightmare's almost over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"You heard what I said,\" Gordon mutters. \"If it's up to me, you give me that thing back\"\u2014he points to the mask you pulled off him\u2014\"and let me go back to the party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe your ears the first time he said it, so you asked him to repeat it. After waking him up, letting him get used to having his body back, and briefly explaining that you're the cavalry come to put everything right, Gordon Black had told you he wanted to go back to being \"Will Prescott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My old life sucked donkey balls,\" he growls. \"I like this new one. Fuck off and mind your own goddamn business.\"</span></div></div>",

It's nearly three in the morning, but you're all too wired and cranky to sleep. \"You coulda pulled rank on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a sour face. Grateful as you are to Carmona and all he's done for you, sometimes he can really step on your nerve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not gonna be that easy,\" you retort. \"I can still make the end game, but maybe we should tackle the other end first. Find the guys who had the book, work backwards, deal with Gordon last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't got a lot of time. Or money,\" Carmona reminds you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're on a schedule and a budget. Tomorrow's Sunday, we got all day to go talk to some of Matthias's old friends, get a lead on anyone who's been acting weird.\" You glance over at your luggage, where the grimoire is packed away. \"Get a grip on what we can do about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmona gives a you very level look, then grunts. A little later, as he's brushing his teeth in the bathroom, Miller snuggles up close to you on the bed. \"Is that what you were like when you lived here?\" she asks. \"Like that guy back at the party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sucks in her upper lip. \"I'm glad,\" she says. \"I didn't like him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had a personality change,\" you assure her. But you hunch your shoulders in worry over the corollary. \"He's going to have to have another personality change when I switch back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't reply. Then Carmona comes out and it's your turn to brush your teeth. Afterward, you and he bunk down in one of the twin beds, while Miller takes the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's almost noon before you stir the next day, and only Miller takes a shower before the three of you head out to hit the Sunshine Diner again for lunch. Sean Wilcox\u2014that's the host's name, you found out last night at the party\u2014isn't scheduled to come in until four, however, so that sets your plans back by a few hours, and you eat a relatively quiet meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's just as well, for your head hurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not a headache, not exactly. It's more like really intense brainwaves\u2014bright flashes in your brain that blaze and fade, leaving behind intricate afterimages. At first you try to ignore and suppress them, figuring it's just anxiety and a lack of sleep. But pretty soon there's no denying what you're seeing in your head. Those maze-like pinwheels of light aren't just random hallucinations. They are sigils, like the ones in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it figures that you'd be getting visions of them. Maybe it's like when you play video games for hours at a time, and still see the screen and the images hours after shutting down the computer or game box. Back at Putnam, in the days before break started, you pored over the book, trying to decipher the spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were only a handful that you could understand, because only a handful came with explanatory text. Those were disturbing enough. One used graveyard earth and a lot of chemicals to create a thing called a <i>pedisequos,</i> which sounds like an earthen mannequin that can wear a mask. There's another spell that also makes a <i>pedisequos</i>, but it uses a human corpse (it sounds like) instead of graveyard earth. Why there should be two spells that make the same kind of thing you can't fathom, unless the book is just being very ugly and nasty about making you play with corpses if you want to have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last spell you can make sense of is the oddest and obscurest. It makes a paste that can be put inside a mask. You suppose the explanation would make sense if you made the stuff and played with it, but you're not sure you understand when it says that it can be used to \"make a <i>pedisequos</i> but only for a time\" before \"restoring he upon whom the mask is placed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the book devolves into gobbledygook and mystery. Pages caked in Latin words that don't even form coherent sentences, and sigils that take up a full page and are never explained. But there must be a way of deciphering them, because those freaking sophomores managed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're cranky when you finish eating, and so are the others. So instead of hanging out together and getting on each other's nerves, you part for the few hours before Sean is due to come in. Carmona and Miller go for a long walk up Twentieth Street, while you sack out in the motel room to take a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's three-thirty before your friends get back from their walk, and they find you huddled on the bed with the grimoire in your lap. Carmona swerves in mid-stride when you look up with a fierce frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not him you're mad at. You're not mad at all. Just concentrated. Fiercely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been having dreams since the book returned to you, but none were as intense as the one you had when you laid down for your nap. It was an abstract nightmare, intensely vivid, full of blazing sigils, like the ones you keep getting in those afterimages. They were still there, seeming to hang in the air before your eyes, when you woke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also woke with the fearful certainty that you understand some of the spells better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're for making fake people,\" you explain to your friends after Carmona has returned from a corner convenience store with some aspirin for you. \"You can check the Latin yourself. It's hard to figure out, but I know that's what it says.\" So firm is your tone that neither of them gainsay you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what the difference is between these two,\" you continue, flipping between the two spells that each make a <i>pedisequos,</i> \"except for the recipe. But they make a thing like a mannequin. You can put a mask on it, and it turns into a copy of the person in the mask. Like if I put Matthias's mask on one, it would turn into a copy of Matthias. Like making a clone,\" you continue as their brows furrow. \"One you can order around like a robot.\" You don't add that if you got rid of the original, you'd be able to substitute the clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is the scary one.\" You tap at the last legible spell in the book. \"It lets you turn <i>other</i> people into clones.\" You struggle to put into words the explanation that came to you in the nightmare. \"You make a mask of someone, and it puts a kind of spell onto it. If you put the mask on someone else\u2014like onto you or me\u2014it turns you into a copy of that person. Only it makes you forget who you are, so that you act just like that person. And you're a robot, too, so you can be ordered around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't get it,\" Carmona says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou draw a deep breath. \"Say I made a mask of myself, and cast this spell on it, then I put it on you. You'd turn into me. Only you wouldn't remember that you're really Tim Carmona. You'd think you're me, and you'd act like me. And you'd have to obey me. And if at the same time I made a mask of\u2014\" You lick your lips. \"Well, of <i>you,</i> I could switch places with you. I'd be you and you'd be me. Only, you'd be like a robot, and have to do what I tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you see?\" you continue when they continue to look puzzled. \"With this spell, Webb and his friends could switch places with anyone and turn the other people into robot clones of themselves. They'd know how to act like the people they're pretending to be, and their replacements would also act normal. We'd never be able to spot them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying we just give up?\" Miller says after a heavy silence has settled over the room. \"There's no point in looking for them, because we'd never find them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can pull your face off Gordon Black,\" Carmona says with an outthrust lip, \"we can pull the faces off Red Team,\" he says, using the school jargon for \"the other side.\" \"We were going to do that anyway, right? We find your guy Webb, or whoever, pull his face off, and if he's one of these robots we'll find someone under the mask. That'll be one of the guys Red Team is pretending to be, and we'll go find them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except I don't know what these other spells do.\" You flip forward in the book. \"I don't know how complicated this stuff can get. Maybe that won't work. Maybe it'll set off alarms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\" Carmona asks. He is starting sound surly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dig the heels of your hands into your eyes. You feel like you saw more than just the sigils in that dream; you feel like you saw around corners  into the future. But you can't remember what you saw, and only have a vague sense of the direction that you were pulled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to be careful,\" you say. \"Slow and careful. Because we don't know what we're up against.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got a budget and a schedule,\" Carmona reminds you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got all the time and money in the world,\" you retort, \"if we use this spell.\" You point to the scary one. Carmona's eyes harden as you explain your idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou expected him to instantly reject it, and for Miller to reject it too. You were completely prepared to surrender, and to go looking for Andrew Webb. But after a mulish interval, first Carmona and the Miller agreed that it would work, and might be best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will re-infiltrate Saratoga Falls by swapping places with other people, and you will send them back to Putnam, as obedient clones, under your faces. After you've neutralized the adversary, you will undo all the swaps.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carmona and Miller are willing to along with your idea for infiltrating the high school using masks, but they've accepted it with something like a brusque determination. Miller, particularly, has the unhappy expression of someone who's being swept up in something she doesn't quite approve of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's Carmona\u2014a leather-skinned rugby player and a 4.0-point honors student back at Putnam\u2014who takes charge of the planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I get this right,\" he says, \"we're going to need, what, six masks? One for each of us to wear, and one to put on the poor assholes we're gonna be impersonating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Plus the stuff we need to make the, uh, enchantment to put on those other masks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much is it gonna set us back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea,\" you confess. \"I'd have to make up a list and go to the store. But I don't think the masks are going to cost us more than sixty or seventy dollars.\" You don't mention that your estimate is based on experience. \"The other stuff, I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmona grunts and checks the time. \"We already owe on tonight's room rental. But if we get started tonight, maybe we can check out tomorrow. I don't want to sleep on the street if we need the rest of our cash stash to pay for the stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out a piece of paper and start jotting down a shopping list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt would save time but cost too much in cab fare to split up and hit multiple shops at once. You split the difference instead, taking into one cab around town, dropping each of you off at a different store or district while the others race ahead to the next stop. After leaving Carmona downtown and Miller at the mall, and you hit a shopping center on the west side, then head down to the Masonic cemetery to scoop a few pounds of dirt from off a grave. (This necessary stop you haven't mentioned to the others; you're not sure Miller can hold herself together if you told her that necromancy might be involved.) Then you circle back around town to pick up the others, who are patiently waiting at the agreed upon meeting places, the return to the motel. When all is said and done, the cab ride is the most expensive item in the ledger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting the masks will stink up the place, so you take the stuff outside to an empty lot behind the motel, where crumbling patches of a cement foundation peep out between the stiff weeds, stickers, and trash. You huddle around the burner to hide your work, so you all get a face-full of the noxious smoke. Once is enough for Miller, who retreats to stand a few yards off with her shirt pulled up over her nose and mouth, but Carmona gets in and gets his hands dirty alongside you as you cast the other five masks. Back inside, Carmona polishes up the masks with a car buffer while you and Miller carve runes into the metal bands that will copy the memories and personalities of the people you'll be impersonating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd who will those be? It doesn't take long for you and Carmona (Miller keeps quiet) to settle on using teachers at Westside as your infiltration point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt makes the most sense. As teachers you'll have uninhibited access to the school, before and after classes, and will be able to move through it unmolested. You'll have access to lots of different classes with lots of different students to investigate. You'll be able to pull students aside and isolate them. And as adults, you'll have money and independence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to the teachers, though, is going to be a problem. Not until the next morning, when Carmona with a vexed sigh, says he's going to go for a run, does it come to you how you can corner and isolate one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Do we need to check in with the main office?\" Carmona asks as the three of you stride across the student parking lot toward Westside High. It gives you a weird kind of deja vu to be back here. On the one hand, nothing could be more familiar than the sight of the blue-and-white walls of the gym and drama wing that loom up in front of you. On the other, you're conscious that's it's been almost two months since you've been here, and that you're returning under an alias. \"Will?\" Carmona repeats when you (too wrapped up in your thoughts) don't immediately reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? No. Not unless you want the administration to know they got a couple of strangers on campus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you got security that's going to stop us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff. No. There's one old guard that putters around the front doors, but it's an open campus, and anyone can get in and out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmona snorts at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shout of voices and the squeak of shoes erupts as you pull open the double doors to the gym. Carmona pauses in the vestibule to study the display case of trophies and team photographs\u2014going all the way back to the seventies\u2014before following you to the left into one of the gym courts. A pack of students\u2014freshmen, it looks like\u2014 in t-shirts and shorts is jogging around the perimeter under the watchful eye of Coach Puente. You catch her glancing in your direction as you lead your friends over to the mezzanine, but she doesn't call or stop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtop the mezzanine, which separates the two basketball courts, is the weights area, but within it are the offices of the P.E. staff. That's the idea that came to you back at the motel. Most of the P.E. teachers will out with their classes, but those with a free period will be isolated, in their office, in a building that is itself cut off from the rest of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently your trio pad down the central corridor, glancing at the names on the doors as you pass: Coach Brooks, Coach Gossett, Coach Carter, Coach Gellman. You stop in front of the latter door to try the handle. Locked. That's too bad. He's the soccer coach, and under his identity you could get to Andrew Webb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly two doors are open. The first belongs to Coach Tesla, and you quickly pull Carmona and Miller past it. Beggars can't be choosers, but none of you, you're sure, would want to impersonate that baggy-faced toad-lady. Instead, you push on to the very end of the corridor, where a crack of light spills out from behind the half-open door of Coach Puente's office. You push it open and peer inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach is sitting at her desk, bent toward her open laptop and tapping the keyboard with such furious concentration that she doesn't even notice you. She's a Hispanic woman of about thirty, you'd guess, with mocha-colored skin and black hair that falls in a straight line to just below her shoulders. She's wearing a blue spandex top that binds itself tightly to her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou motion behind for one of your compatriots to hand you a mask. The gesture must have caught the coach's attention, for she looks up with a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin at her. \"Ay! Coach Puente!\" you exclaim, doing your best to imitate Dane Matthias's goofball personality. \"You remember me!\" You feel the sweat pop out on your forehead as she only stares at you. \"Dane! Matthias! The Danester! You had me, uh, freshman year in P.E.!\" (You've no idea if she did.) \"I came back to say hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Dane,\" she says, and still she doesn't blink. \"Can I help you?\" Her brow furrows as she peers past you. \"Did you graduate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I changed schools. Din'cha hear? I got packed off to a military school!\" You snap your fingers behind your back, and someone finally pushes a mask into your hand. \"This is my Thanksgiving break, so I came back to check in and say hi to people!\" You saunter up to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls back fractionally, and her expression tightens. \"That's great, Dane,\" she says. \"But\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wheel onto Carmona and Miller. \"Shut the door, okay, so we can have some privacy?\" you tell them. Miller is very pale, and she stumbles a little as she turns to push the door shut. When you turn back around again, the coach is also looking alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I need your help,\" you tell her as you lean across her desk. She pulls away as you put a knee up on it and stretch yourself toward her. \"There's some bad dudes on the loose in Westside and we need\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ducks her face as you thrust the mask at her, and you fall forward, losing your balance. But your blow lands true, and your fingers grasp her forehead as the mask dissolves into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need one of us to be you,\" you conclude with a murmur as you recover yourself. The coach, her disordered hair draping over her face, slumps and slides onto the floor. Miller backs into a far corner of the room, and in a frightened, bird-like chirp, mutters \"Oh my God oh my God oh my God!\" over and over until Carmona silences her with a sharp word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step around the desk and bend down to straighten out Coach Puente's prone body. Below the waist, you find, she's dressed in blue athletic shorts, ankle socks, and sneakers. Her flesh is warm and soft to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens now?\" Carmona asks as he bends over you and the coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wait for the mask to copy her, then we seal it up and switch places with her.\" You've already made masks and brain-bands for Carmona and Miller, and Dane's mask has a band copying your own brain and personality inside. Those masks are also coated with the special sealant that puts them under the control of you and your friends, so that you can turn the coach and the two other impersonations into obedient copies of yourselves that you can send back to Putnam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who puts it on?\" Carmona asks, and he glances over his shoulder at Miller. She has her hands over her nose and mouth, and looks like she's trying hard not to hyperventilate.</span></div></div>",

But Miller looks like she's going to throw up <i>right now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn three steps you're by her side with your arm around her. \"Are you okay?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulps and nods. But then she shakes her head, and sags against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The coach is okay,\" you assure her. \"She's just knocked out. I mean, asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of a rough thing, though,\" Carmona says. He stalks over to the office door and pushes it shut. \"You look like you got practice at this, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiller shrinks up inside your embrace, and in that moment you could almost kill your roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I did some stupid shit,\" you snipe at him over your shoulder. \"But this is all about putting it right, you know?\" You turn back to Miller. \"You said you were going to help,\" you murmur. An ache starts to spread through your chest when she doesn't reply. <i>This is too much for her,</i> you think. And maybe her horror is infectious, because you feel yourself getting nauseated as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" you say when the silence has gotten oppressive, \"if this is too much for you, you don't have to help. We\u2014 Tim and I'll handle it. You can hang out at\u2014 at whatever place we wind up crashing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Carmona says. \"You can fly back out to Putnam.

He's now squatting beside the prostrate coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Just need to\u2014 Well, we'll need to strip her. And I guess we can rock-paper-scissor to see who puts on the mask.\" You put out your fist. \"On three. One, two\u2014 Whatsamatter?\" you ask as Carmona stares at you from under a sharply cocked eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jeez Lou-eeze!\" Miller suddenly snorts and pushes you away, to stalk over to where Carmona is crouching. \"Keep your hands off her. I'll undress her myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Carmona backs up. \"I know my way around a female's\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Miller slaps him in the back of the head. \"Coupla perverts is what you guys are.\" She kneels next to Coach Puente. \"I'll take her clothes off. And I'll put the mask on. You pervs turn around. Or go find a bathroom or someplace to hide out in till I'm done.\" With something like ferocity she starts tugging the shoes off the coach's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Carmona exchange a wondering glance. \"I told you,\" you start to say, \"you don't have to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'd stay and help, okay? What, suddenly you don't want me around? I can handle it if you two per\u2014 <i>assholes</i> can!\" She mutters under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmona sucks in his cheeks, shoves his hands into his pockets, and gives you a look as Miller starts tugging at the coach's shorts. But he doesn't say anything, and neither do you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Miller\u2014being one-hundred-thousand-percent invested in showing that she's as much of a badass as you and Carmona\u2014concentrates on stripping Coach Puente down to her underthings, and neither speaks nor lifts her face until she's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nPerverts or not, you and Carmona stay with her the whole time. You, to supervise the final touches to the coach's mask when it comes out of her, and Carmona to\u2014 Well, probably to ogle the naked coach and to annoy Miller with his presence. She finally throws him out, though, when you announce that Miller herself will need to strip down so that her duplicate can take her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stay, Will,\" she says as you start to follow Carmona out the door. \"You know, to make sure I do this right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>want</i> you to stay.\" There's steel in her voice, and as Carmona edges out the door he gives you the kind of look one guy gives to another when he thinks he might be seeing his friend alive for the last time. The door clicks shut behind him with the snicker-snack of a falling guillotine blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiller's face is blotchy with patches of rose and chalk, and her hair, though still done up in its tiny bun, looks windswept. She's got her hands on her hips, and her lips are compressed so tightly they've disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will,\" she says. You nod when she doesn't continue. She blinks. Then she looks away. \"Oh, nothing,\" she grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you can tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing.\" She glares into a corner of the room, and takes a deep breath. \"I just can't believe we're doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, you don't have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point!\" She swings sharply onto you. \"It's this!\" She flings her hand at the unconscious coach, and at the finished mask now sitting on the corner of the desk. \"It's what we're doing! It's what <i>you're</i> doing!\" A shadow flashes across her throat as she swallows. \"It's what you <i>did.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, what I'm doing right now.\" You point to your face, which is starting to burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, and her expression lengthens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were really sweet,\" she says. \"Oh, hell, I <i>know</i> that you're really sweet. And with your ... your <i>thing.</i> You know.\" She gestures vaguely at her own face. \"It made you sweeter, somehow. I thought you were like the frog prince or whoever in the fairy tale. The Beast in Beauty and the Beast.\" Her expression turns pinched. \"You know. Like it wasn't your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel an ache in your own throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you did it to yourself,\" she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! Only <i>this</i> made it real. What you did to the coach. The way you\u2014\" She bites her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I had a lot of practice,\" you finish for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. It hurts to see her being so honest. But you're glad, too. It gets things out in the open. \"It's okay,\" she starts to say, but you interrupt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it isn't. Me and Caleb were being really stupid, just goofing off. And then we panicked. <i>I</i> panicked. But now it's worse than anything, probably, and I have to fix it.\" Your face feels very heavy, like it's going to slide off the front of your skull, as you confess your stupidities and perversities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she says, sounding as grave as you feel. \"That's why I'm going along with it. Why I'm going to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Will,\" she sighs, but she smiles a wry smile too. \"You <i>are</i> sweet. Sweet and stupid.\" She grabs you in a hug. \"That's how come you're in this trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're gonna help me out. 'Cos you're smart and tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" She punches you lightly in the kidney. \"Someone's got to keep an eye on you and Carmona so you don't get into trouble. Okay?\" She sighs after giving you one last squeeze. \"So what comes next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nMiller crouches down behind the desk where you can't see her, and drops her clothes one article at a time onto the desk top. When she's done, you hand her the mask of herself that you made back at the motel, then scramble back against the far wall. Your heart in your throat, you wait to see the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt starts with a rustle and a murmuring from behind the desk. Then there's a strained cry of \"Oh jeez!\" and \"Oh my God!\" and a squeak. You can't tell for sure, but it might be two voices rather than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Miller says, \"Will?\" You edge up to the desk, going up on tiptoes to peer over the top as two heads peep out at you. \"I think it worked,\" one of the girls says in a strangled voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" two voices say in unison. They exchange uneasy glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Miller, the real Miller? You have to be the boss. I mean, you <i>are</i> the boss. But you have to act like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the other Miller slaps at the one who spoke. \"He's talking to me, you ... Fake!\" The first one drops her eyes. \"How do I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you just did. Tell it to get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get dressed,\" Miller says (though she sounds uncertain). \"My clothes. I put them up on\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember where I put them!\" A hand jumps out to pull Miller's clothes off the desk. \"And they're my clothes too, you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only for now. Oh, God!\" There's a sound of scrambling from behind the desk. \"Tell me when you're done! I don't want to look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gross looking at her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ditto,\" says the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the ditto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get dressed,\" you snap. \"Miller, get the coach's mask. It's on top of the\u2014\" A hand shoots up and fumbles across the top of the desk. \"Yeah, there. It's all ready, just put it on. By the time you wake up, your ditto will be dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you wouldn't call me that,\" the other Miller says. It has its shirt on now, and it stands up. The hair is tumbling about its shoulders, which adds to the distress evident on its face. \"You know, Will, things were really nice there, between us, until\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just finish getting dressed,\" you order it. It makes a face back at you, but complies. \"You're a fake, don't forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel like a fake,\" it says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help swallowing. It doesn't look like a fake, either, and it sounds just like your girlfriend. When it steps out from behind the desk, it takes all your willpower to remember that it's not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go sit out on the bleachers,\" you tell it roughly, when what you really want to do is pull it to yourself.</span></div></div>",

You huddle on the far side of the corner, with the coach's desk hiding sight of Miller, as you agonize with indecision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can decide, there's a tap at the door, and Carmona looks in. \"Is it safe?\" he asks in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on in,\" you tell him. \"Miller just put the mask on. She's going to be out for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five, ten minutes. I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives you a sober look. \"Can we wake her up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hasn't got any clothes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus.\" Carmona wipes his palms on his jeans, and glances over his shoulder into the hall. \"I told the, uh\u2014\" He licks his lips with a white tongue. \"The other Miller to go wait out in the parking lot. It's freaky, man.\" He shakes his head. \"Uncanny valley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought she seemed normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives you a quick look. \"Too normal. It was weird thinking it wasn't her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. That's the reason you sent it out of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about us?\" Carmona asks. \"You got some people picked out for you and me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just winging it. I'm kind of hoping that, uh, Miller'll be able to pick us out something good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she married?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? Miller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dumbass. The person she's\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I don't know.\" The question suddenly alarms you. \"Jesus, if she is\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she is,\" Carmona starts to say, then lapses into a miserable silence. \"Oh, forget it. But if she is, better her than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't sound like what he was originally going to say, but you skip it. \"You didn't want to be the one to put on the mask,\" you accuse him. \"Did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my thing. Gonna be weird, putting on someone else's skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You put on Dane's mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that was just goofing around back at Putnam. Besides\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, God,</i> you mutter to yourself. <i>I'm gonna get the same speech from Carmona as I got from Miller.</i> \"I know,\" you Interrupt him with a sigh. \"This is all real sketchy, I'm a dumbass for getting everything fucked up this way. But we're doing this to fix things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know,\" Carmona says. \"I just want you to promise me you'll fix me up so I still have a schlong. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh,</i> you now think. <i>Is that all his problem is?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lapse into a silence, one that lasts until there's a low groan from behind the desk. You wait for the sound of someone moving before you call out. \"Miller?\" Carmona goes up on tiptoes and tries to peer over the top of the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" comes a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. I feel like\u2014 Oh, God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Miller?\" you call again when she doesn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Only these aren't my fingers! And this isn't my\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA head pops up from behind the desk. It's got long, straight dark hair, and eyes that are wide with astonishment. There's a pallor beneath the brown tan of Coach Puente's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does everything work?\" Carmona asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Puente's brow furrows. \"What do you mean by\u2014? Does my voice sound funny?\" She covers her mouth with the tips of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Does it?</i> It doesn't sound like Miller, not exactly. The timbre is throatier and raspier. But do you detect a trace of Miller's nasal Wisconsin twang? \"How's your head?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got a touch of a headache. I feel like I woke up too fast from a really deep sleep.\" She touches her temple and shakes her head. \"Rrng. I wonder if she's got any Tylenol in her desk.\" Distractedly, she starts pulling open drawers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, think about it,\" you suggest. \"You should be able to get her memories if you try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuente pauses and frowns. Then she shakes her head. \"Brain still feels fried. I wanna take a nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got classes and you need to get Puente's brain engaged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could start by getting dressed,\" Carmona suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuente makes a face. \"You guys get a good enough look while I was conked out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't even peek, Miller,\" you retort. \"Come one, give us a little credit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she grumbles. \"Just give me a minute.\" Her face disappears, but the crown of her head bobs into a view a few time as she fumbles about behind the desk. Arms fly up into the air as she pulls her shirt on, and she hefts herself into her office chair to put on her shoes and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she puffs when she's done. \"How do I look?\" She stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't realize Coach Puente was so short. Well, she's not <i>short</i>, but in your mind's eye all teachers, especially the P.E. coaches, are taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she looks very fit as she comes around the desk. Her shorts are very short and so are her socks, so that there's lots of strong, milk-chocolate leg to ogle. Her top is very form-fitting, and\u2014 Well, dammit, her breasts are a lot bigger than Miller's, and the spandex lifts, sculpts and pumps up those assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither you nor Carmona can speak, something neither of you notice until Miller, with a frown, says, \"I'm asking if I can pass as this coach lady, guys. And my eyes are up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you look fine,\" you croak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have her for P.E.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" You did see Coach Puente around the gym during your freshman and sophomore years, when you were forced to take a P.E. class, but your hatred of the gym was such that nothing connected to it, not even Coach Puente, looked inviting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long till I have to teach a class?\" the new coach asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno her schedule,\" you confess. You glance at a clock on her desk. \"Probably fifteen minutes, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face falls. \"Jeez. I better get started on remembering things!\" She perches on the edge of the desk, and lowers her face to stare at her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBut her face is pale when the bell rings, and there's fear in her eyes. She's got nothing, she tells you. Not a clue about this woman she's pretending to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you have a hurried conference while trying to ignore the rumble of feet in the hallway outside. Miller can't go out and pretend to be Coach Puente without the memories\u2014if she's spotted by any asshole sophomores pretending to be other people\u2014the appearance of an amnesiac teacher will instantly tip your hand to them. But there isn't any time to check the mask for defects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's something like panic that sends you caroming off in a desperate direction. You escort Miller to the front office, where she crisply announces to the secretary at the front desk that she's taken ill and is going to have to take the rest of the day off. The flustered secretary tries to stop her, but she strides out without getting caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmona meets you in the teacher's parking lot with the coach's purse and computer bag, and using her keys you're able to hunt down her car\u2014a minivan\u2014which you all pile in to. It's a disorganized retreat you make from Westside, so disorganized that you have to go back to the school and swing into the student parking lot to pick up the fake Miller, who you had forgotten in your flight. On the other side of the river you pull into the parking lot of a strip mall and consult the coach's driver's license for her home address while ignoring the insistent buzzing on her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lives, you find, in a modest apartment complex on the west side of town. A cat greets you on opening the door, but it scuttles out of sight as you and the others follow the transformed coach inside. The place is clean, but there's a musty odor in the air, as of unwashed laundry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick search turns up two bedrooms\u2014one converted into a study\u2014two bathrooms, a small kitchen and smaller dining area, and a cozy living room. The furniture is faded and dumpy, and the dining table looks second-hand, but there's a large, flat-screen TV, and the office contains not only a desktop computer but another laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a queen-size bed in the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnxiously, you all scan the photographs on the walls for evidence about Coach Puente's life choices. There are a couple of framed photos that you assume show her parents, and one that shows a much younger coach\u2014high school age?\u2014in a cluster of girls and boys. But there are no photos that show her as one of a couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's check that mask,\" you tell Miller in the bedroom. \"I can't believe I messed anything up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think it's my fault?\" she retorts, sounding peevish and tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I don't know <i>what's</i> going on. But we need to\u2014\" You break off as her phone buzzes again. You need to just turn it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you freeze as you reach for the coach's face. From the other end of the apartment comes a dreadful sound: that of the front door opening. \"Beatriz?\" a male voice calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you exchange looks of horror. <i>Coach Puente's husband?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a walk-in closet that you and Carmona could hide in while Miller gets rid of him. But suppose she can't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've also got two blank masks. You intend to use them on teachers, and this is probably not a teacher. But\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beatriz!\" whoever it is calls again, sounding impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014this is a desperate moment.</span></div></div>",

Just get him back here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back in the bedroom!\" Puente calls out in a quavering voice as you dive for the sack that carries your gear. You pull out one of the blank masks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear me calling?\" the stranger calls back. He sounds surly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuente's jaw work soundlessly until Carmona nudges her and points at the bathroom door. \"I\u2014 I was in the bathroom!\" she calls out. \"Uh, come on back!\" she adds after you poke her. Carmona springs over to hide behind the bedroom door. You run over to hand him the blank mask before diving into the bathroom, dragging the fake Tess Miller in with you. You push the door shut until it's open by just a crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a mutter and murmur of voices outside, and the heavy tramp of footsteps. \"Why aren't you checking your texts?\" the guy asks. It sounds like he's just on the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I had my phone turned off,\" Puente stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I got hauled into the office by\u2014 <i>Rrfff!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a soft thump and a thud, and a hard gasp from Puente. Your heart jackhammers in your chest. You grip the knob of the bathroom door, but don't pull on it until you hear Carmona call your name in a ragged voice. \"It's okay, you can come out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA figure lays in a crumpled hump of clothing and limbs on the bedroom floor. It hardly looks human, just a tangle of dirty Levis and a camouflage jacket. The hair is thick and dark as coffee, and the skin on the back of his neck is even darker than Coach Puente's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea who he is?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Puente collapses onto the bed and grabs her temples. \"I don't know <i>anything,</i> Will! And what are we going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same thing we did with the coach.\" You nudge the prone figure with your toe. \"There's your schlong, bro,\" you tell Carmona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's not a teacher! Is he?\" Puente protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push the dude over with your foot. He has a dark beard, thick but close-shorn. Under the unbuttoned camo jacket is a white t-shirt with food stains all down its front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't recognize him,\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck,\" Carmona says. \"Check for ID.\" He squats to search the man's pockets. \"Matias Puente,\" he reads off the driver's license that he extracts from a wallet. \"Different home address,\" he adds after studying it further. \"Maybe her brother?\" He squints up at Miller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll know for sure after one of us puts on the mask,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know the masks are working?\" Puente protests. \"You said I was supposed to know what this teacher knows, but I\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know they're working,\" you retort, and point at the fake Miller, who has been silently following you all around all this time. \"Look at this girl here. Hey, what's your roommate's name, back at Putnam?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courtenay Philips,\" the fake Miller replies with a pinched look. She edges back a step. \"Can I go sit in the car or something? This is all way too weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" you tell Puente. You point to her face. \"Whatever's wrong\u2014 Well, soon as we take care of this guy we'll try figuring out what's wrong with your set up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do that now,\" Puente says. She hops backward on the bed and grabs her face, smushing it up. \"Can you get it off me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" You climb onto the bed and prop yourself over her so you can get a grip on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you pause before making a move. It gives you a funny feeling\u2014a pleasurable feeling\u2014to hover over her like this. You've never been in or on a bed with her, but as you look down at her and she looks up at you, you can't help feeling like this could or should be the prelude to an intimate moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when you touch her face, it's a caress rather than a grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about all this, Miller,\" you murmur at her. \"I didn't want any of this to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Will,\" she says, and smiles tightly at you. \"I'm sorry I'm not doing it right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back at her, then place your fingers around her temple and pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>fuck,</i>\" you mutter as you sit up. \"Mother of God.\" You squeeze your head between your hands. All this taking off and putting on of faces is getting really old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you pulled Beatriz Puente's mask off of Miller and put it on yourself, while Carmona put on the mask of her brother. (Yes, it's her younger brother who busted in on you.) You woke up not only with all of Beatriz's memories, but for almost half a minute you were convinced you <i>were</i> Beatriz Puente and couldn't figure out why these strangers were in your bedroom with you. Carmona, though, had no clue as to who Matias was other than what you (as Beatriz) were able to tell him. The same thing was true of Miller when you transferred Matias's mask onto her, and Carmona couldn't get any of Beatriz's memories when he put on her mask. (Meanwhile, a fake version of Carmona is now sitting in Beatriz's living room with the fake version of Miller.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was your turn to put on Matias's mask. You are presently suffering a brief migraine as you try to squeeze two sets of memories\u2014yours and his\u2014into one compact and manageable ball. \"Oh, fuck,\" you groan again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any luck?\" Carmona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, all bad. God damn it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmona and Miller exchange a brief glance. \"It doesn't work for you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it <i>does.</i> Son of a bitch.\" You drag yourself up onto your feet and shake your head clear. A hard shiver runs through you as the last of Matias Puente's memories click into place, giving you full control over everything he can think or do. \"Wish I knew what the fucking deal was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fucking deal, apparently, is that the masks work just fine for you, but don't work for your two partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the bitch of it is,\" you grumble, \"I don't got time now to figure it out.\" Instinctively you feel at your pockets for your cell phone, only to discover that you're still wearing your own clothes, not Matias's. \"I gotta get back up to the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The school?\" Miller asks, sounding alarmed. \"What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My job. Lobo here works in the cafeteria.\" The new memories and the knowledge are so vivid and clear that it almost gives you vertigo as you hurtle through them. \"He got called in to the office when the coach ran out. She wasn't answering her phone, so Sagansky sent him over to see what's wrong.\" You cock your head and pick up Beatriz's mask. \"I s'pose I could tell 'em she's throwing her guts up all over the bathroom. That still doesn't settle what to do about her tomorrow, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried glances are exchanged around your small, three-person circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, look, I gotta go back up to the school, cover for Matias,\" you say. \"I can do him, an' we don't want both of 'em disappearing. But you guys stay here\u2014 Beatriz don't got a boyfriend or nothing, ain't no one gonna come bustin' in on you 'cept me. You should put her mask on again, though,\" you tell Miller. \"Try concentratin' on gettin' some of her memories and shit. Look around the place. Maybe something'll knock something loose. I'll be back over sometime tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight?\" Miller echoes. \"Not after school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got another job I need to cover. God damn it. Six hour shift at the IHOP. What?\" you ask as you notice them both giving you strange looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not talking like yourself, Will,\" Carmona says. \"You've got an accent, and you're not\u2014 You just don't sound like you usually do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only snort. \"So I guess I'm talkin' like Matias here. But I gotta split.\" You pat a pocket, looking for a cigarette. \"Gotta change first, though,\" you mutter to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou chain smoke three cigarettes on the drive back over to Westside in Matias Puente's beat up van. (The faded logo of the pool cleaning service he bought the old junker off is still faintly visible under the coating of gray paint he got a friend to spray over it.) Everything's turning out a lot harder, a lot more complicated, than you'd planned. Sure, you managed to swap places with one of the teachers, but no one except you can seem to get into her memories to play her part. And now, at the moment, you're trapped in the body of a cafeteria cook who has no access to any of the students at Westside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it this hard for Andrew Webb and his friends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou park in the staff lot and make a quick stop in the office to report on Beatriz Puente's condition\u2014\"She's real sick, looks like food poisoning\"\u2014before trudging back into the cafeteria to resume your Matias's place at the hot stove, prepping gloppy food for the lunchtime crowd. Matias's absence has slowed things down, and the other cooks have had to work even harder to not fall back even further, and you get lots of surly looks and curses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut either your luck is changing, or you are being tempted to double down on disaster, when as you take a smoke break in back of the school once the lunch rush is over you look up at the sound of your new name, and see Cathy Schell approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss the cigarette away. A gorgeous blonde P.E. coach like Coach Schell won't like seeing a guy smoke. \"I heard Beatriz got food poisoning,\" she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we think so. She'll be okay, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she need me to bring anything over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaps. <i>Here's a chance to make another replacement.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it sinks. <i>Here's a chance to make another fuck up.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Lure Coach Schell out to be replaced.<br>\r\n* Hold back for now.</span></div></div>",

Could you\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Schell nods and says she'll be happy to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Another one?\" Beatriz protests when you get back to her place and tell her what you've got in mind. \"We can't even get these masks to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They work for me,\" you remind her. You're perched on the sofa by the front window, watching through a crack between the curtains for Coach Schell. \"I can't do any good as Matias here, I'm stuck back in the kitchen all day and then I got other jobs. Coach Schell's inside the school, she's as good as Coach Puente.\" <i>Better,</i> you add to yourself. <i>Sexier.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why don't you put on Coach Puente's mask, take over here?\" Beatriz insists. \"I'm not doing any good with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still not getting any of the memories? You trying?\" You glance back when you're answered by only a doubtful silence. \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I am getting something,\" she admits. \"I'm getting deja vu kind of hard.\" She glances around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go. Maybe it'll come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how come\u2014?\" That's Carmona sauntering in from the kitchen with half a sandwich and a glass of milk. \"So how come <i>you</i> can get into character, Will, instantly, and for us it takes\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me, pendejo. Sorry,\" you add when Carmona frowns. \"I guess I get in character fast <i>and</i> deep.\" You try not to notice the veiled glances that Carmona and Beatriz exchange. \"But look,\" you tell Miller, \"if in the morning you still got trouble with Beatriz's memories and stuff, I'll take over for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what happens to this other coach if we\u2014? Who would\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can miss a day. Tomorrow's last day of school before break, she can take an absence. Then we got the holiday to figure out how to handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you've already outlined a potential scheme to yourself. That spell that enchants the masks, putting them under a magician's control? You've set it up so each of you gets one mask to control\u2014each of you controls the mask of yourself. But are you really limited to controlling just one mask? Nothing in the spell says that you are. If you can control more than one mask, then you could turn Beatriz Puente and Cathy Schell both into puppets, and move between them. And if that works, you wouldn't need Carmona or Miller inside the school with you, doing impersonations. You could handle all the impersonations yourself. But you haven't suggested this idea to them yet, as you've worried they might freak out at the idea of turning <i>lots</i> of people into puppets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here she is,\" you announce a few minutes later, when you glimpse Cathy Schell, a grocery sack in her arm, getting out of a car. You hop away from the window. \"You bring her inside,\" you instruct Beatriz, \"take her into the kitchen, keep her back to the doorway. Carmona and me'll come in and get her from behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour girlfriend nods unhappily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nIt's disorienting at first when you wake again, but you quickly get yours situated, even though you're naked, in bed, in Beatriz Puente's bedroom. But even though it's a lovely feeling to sit up with Cathy Schell's boobs hanging off your chest, you don't waste time playing with yourself, for Miller is sitting on the edge of the bed, watching you with a hooded expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it work?\" she asks. \"The mask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You squeeze your temples between your hands. \"I just wish I didn't get a migraine every time I took one of these things off and put one on. Was it like that for you, with Beatriz's mask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head. \"No, I just felt funny when I woke up, like my body was all weird.\" She pauses. \"Is it because you get all the memories at once, that you get a headache?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" You have a truly bewildering array of thoughts flicking through your head, like a TV zipping through a hundred channels at once. Only after you stagger to your feet do things start to settle down. \"At least it doesn't last long. Hand me my things, could you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatriz Puente hands over underwear and bra, then the gym clothes. You try not to feel self-conscious as you dress in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Thomas Luna?\" she asks in a tone of studied casualness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" It takes you a moment to place the name. But when it comes rushing in, you sit back down hard on the bed. \"Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Beatriz's tone is very dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who told you about him and, uh, Cathy?\" <i>Him and me</i> is what you almost said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one. I told you think I'm starting to get the memories in the mask.\" She doesn't look happy as she says it. \"I was just sitting here, looking at you, and all of a sudden I thought how Cathy and Thomas are\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, don't remind me, okay?\" You stand back up again. \"It's vivid for me. And I got more to remember.\" You can't help flinching as you think of the guidance counselor's hairy cock worming its way up your cunny\u2014and at the intensely pleasurable thrill it gives Cathy Schell to have him pumping away inside her. \"Don't be jealous,\" you snap at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not <i>jealous.</i> I was just thinking we could make a mask of <i>him,</i>\" Beatriz says. \"Give it to Carmona to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>God</i>, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, then he'd be under control. You wouldn't have to worry about, uh\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk about it later,\" you snap. \"Speaking of Carmona,\" you add, \"has he gone yet to pick up the stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" She pauses. \"I guess that's the answer, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up at you. \"What you explained when you asked him to get stuff to make more masks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nWhat you explained was your idea about making student puppets, to spy out the school from the inside. They jibbed a lot less at this than you thought they would; Carmona even said, \"I thought we were going to do that anyway.\" But now, even before he's returned with the supplies, you're thinking of switching it up further. Instead of using student puppets as spies while impersonating teachers, maybe you should impersonate the students while keeping teachers in reserve as puppets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmona agrees when he's returned with the additional supplies, and you've explained this evolution in your thinking. And he goes further, suggesting that you scatter <i>lots</i> of puppets throughout the school, to smoke out any fakes that are hiding inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not really going to do this to the whole school, are we, Will?\" Beatriz asks when she walks you out to the car at three o'clock in the morning, by which time your trio has made six new masks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not the <i>whole</i> school,\" you assure her. \"Maybe not even all that many.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate, then explain, \"We might get lucky and trip up over some of Red Team's fakes.\" You don't add the kicker: If you do quickly trip over one of their fakes, it will probably be because they've made so many of them. They might already own the whole school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to get this over with,\" Beatriz murmur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I do too.\" It feels funny for you\u2014Cathy Schell\u2014to pull Beatriz Puente into an embrace. \"It's why we can't waste time,\" you whisper as you squeeze her to you. She squeezes you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then part for the night, to get a few hours sleep before going in to the school for the last day of classes before Thanksgiving break. You and Miller will each have three masks with you, and six classes to pick recruits from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're already picking them out as you stride in to school at seven-thirty the next morning, your head buzzing with a mix of exhaustion and anticipation. You are already looking forward to your first-period class\u2014volleyball practice\u2014and two prime candidates to turn into puppets and spies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first is Ava Price, the only sophomore on the team. You don't know how popular or connected she is, but at least she would be a recruit down in the sophomore class, where Red Team would likely have some of its own agents. The other is Reagan Hackett, a senior, who impresses Cathy Schell as a snoop, a gossip, and a plugged-in social butterfly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stride toward the gym you spot another possible recruit: Carl Gellman. He coaches the soccer teams, and maybe you should snag him for Carmona. At least one of the masks you carry is supposed to be for a disguise for him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOr maybe you should wait to talk to Miller first, and coordinate with her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Tuesday before Thanksgiving dawns very cold, and the temperature has just broken above freezing as you stride in toward the gym. Overhead, pillowy clouds float in a pale blue sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bracing chill seems to stiffen your spine. <i>No point in fucking around,</i> you decide as you cross the small quad in front of the gym. Reagan Hackett and Ava Price will probably be as good recruits as any, and if you start second-guessing yourself you'll never stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarsh voices sound over the squeak of rubber soles on polished wood sound as you enter the gym vestibule, just as they did yesterday morning when you and your friends came in search of some coaches. This morning, though, as you enter the eastern practice court, Coach Schell's instincts pull your eyes onto the floor, where the school basketball team is practicing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey've broken into two five-man squads and are playing a hard practice game. Lean, muscled forms in baggy shorts and tops sprint up and down the court and hurl themselves through the air at the nets; the ball bangs like a gunshot against floor. A scent of testosterone and sweat hangs in the air, and you draw in a deep lungful of it. Normally it would make you retch; but your impersonation loves it the smell of teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start a little when you spot an out-of-place figure in the middle of the scrum: the lanky form of Will Prescott. You almost don't recognize him, what with his shortened hair and his crimson-and-gold uniform. He looks scrawny and underfed when mixing it up with giants like Steve Patterson and Brendan Tummler. But he zips across the floor when he's got the ball, weaving in and out like a shuttlecock on a loom; and once, as you watch, he nails two points with a shot that's all net. His expression is set in stone as he sprints back down to the far end of the court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are other changes to the squad, which you take in like a flash. Gordon Black is gone\u2014and what a lot of drama there was in the coaches' offices when Black suddenly fell apart on them; Coach Brooks was almost suicidal\u2014and his absence is like plucking the biggest skyscraper from a metropolitan skyline. Gone too is Jeremy Richards. A new standout on the court is Adam Dortch, less for his skill or height than for the immense bush of hair\u2014like a brown dandelion\u2014that puffs up on his head. <i>Put it in a tie or tease it into a 'fro,</i> Brooks has told him, but as yet he's done neither.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the two standout changes to the Westside team have to be\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Ay, Coach Schell!\" a clear voice rings out, and your eye flicks over to Joe Durras. Golden of limb and golden of hair, he dances in place for you with his hands over his head, grinning. <i>God, he's gorgeous,</i> Cathy Schell murmurs in your ear. <i>If I was ten years younger and on the girls' basketball squad\u2014</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumbass!\" Patterson barks. \"Get your ass back in gear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe kicks up his heels, does a cartwheel, then trots down to the far end of the court, where play has moved. He casts a glinting grin back over his shoulder at you. His brother, Frank\u2014tall and dark and brooding (\"Byronic,\" Ms. Goretsky sighed as she and Cathy and some of the other teachers were drooling over him and his brother one afternoon)\u2014mutters at him, but Joe only shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came over to Westside from cross-town rival Eastman just a few weeks ago. And despite Gordon's dropping out, talk is that the Westside Dragons have significantly bettered their chances of going to state by adding them to the roster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep, pleasurable sigh, you turn toward the mezzanine and the coaches' offices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Nice spike, Ava!\" you shout as the volleyball bounces away on the other side of the net. Whitney Rosenthal, looking grim and exhausted as her team falls further behind the other, scoops it out of the air and hurls it back over the net to Regina Yost. Ava Price herself only returns you a hooded glance. You carefully refrain from frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was vexed when she woke up in your office as a fake version of herself. First thing after class started, you lined up the girls and asked who was staying in town for the break. To your relief, both Ava and Reagan had raised their hands. Not that you couldn't have picked two other girls, but it saved you from having to invent new plans on the fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sending the other girls jogging around the gym, you asked Ava to come back into your office, where you got her from behind with a mask. While she was unconscious you checked her for a mask and found nothing, and after the mask came out of her you applied some of the special enchanting goop to its inner surface before returning the mask to her face. She had instantly woken, confused and a little resentful, but had dutifully promised to tell the other girls that she had only had a short \"conference\" with you about her grades. Except for a shadow of anger that still hangs over her, you have seen no other change in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent the balance of class running drills and practice, the way Coach Schell would. Maybe she was more enthusiastic about watching the boys' basketball team than you were, but you enjoy this class more than she would. The girls aren't the prettiest in the school, and in truth they're not the most athletic either. But they show lots of leg and arm in their skimpy shorts and t-shirts, and there's a flush of health in them that gives you a flush of pleasure too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou call an early halt to practice, telling the girls they can shower, change, and have the balance of the time to hang out, but you call Reagan to follow you into your office. \"My grades are fine, Ms. Schell,\" she tells you in a very dry tone as you lead her down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did Ava tell you that's what I talked to her about?\" You force a laugh. \"That was just a cover. There's something else I want to see you about.\" Reagan looks piqued as she follows you into the office. \"Take a seat,\" you invite her, and close the door as she sits with her back to you. From the shallow shelf on the back wall, where the coach has balanced some plaques and small trophies, you pluck down a second blank mask. Smoothly you step up behind Reagan and reach around to press it into her face. All the starch goes out of her, and she slumps in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check her face for other masks and find none, then perch on the edge of your desk to study her. Like Ava, Reagan has long, dark-blonde hair that falls in straight lengths to the top of her boobs. But Reagan has a bold mouth and a bolder, almost prow-like nose, and she also has a figure that the instructor in Cathy Schell's college-level art appreciation class might call \"Rubenesque\": solid and barrel-like, but without being fat. Indeed, her thighs, though very big, are toned and tanned, even now at the end of November. <i>Probably she hits a tanning bed once a week,</i> you tell yourself. All in all, she has an appearance that well matches the bossy personality she sometimes shows on the volleyball court\u2014the personality that you chose her for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch the mask as it falls out of her, and coat its inner surface with the goop before setting it back onto her face, where it instantly sinks out of sight. Her eyes open, and she looks puzzled. But she accepts your instructions\u2014to tell the other girls that you wanted to talk to her about her classes\u2014with a calm assurance. As with Ava, you instruct her to come find you in your office when school lets out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nDuring the break between first and second period you tap at Beatriz Puente's door. But there's no answer, and it's nearly five minutes before, looking very blown, she comes striding down the hallway. \"Oh, God, I wanted to kill the girls this morning,\" she pants as she jams a key into the lock. This morning, unlike yesterday, she has a slight Hispanic accent. \"What's up?\" she asks as she leads you into her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just checking to see how you're doing,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay.\" She blows out a deep breath and turns a distracted gaze onto you. \"Don't worry about me, Will,\" she mutters, but she seems not to be looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure everything's okay?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying not to lose my concentration,\" she says. \"Is like running,\" she adds. \"I lose my momentum, I got to pick it up all over again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" you reply. With you, it's easiest to just fall into Coach Schell's personality, but you don't want to upset Miller by telling her that. \"I just wanted to check in with you,\" you repeat. \"I placed two of my masks last period. How are you coming along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?\" Beatriz snaps. \"I been running a soccer practice for the last two hours. When was I\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just chill, Miller. It's okay. You've got the rest of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out on the field all day,\" she retorts. \"Well, I got the two tutorials this afternoon, but they got those glass walls in the offices, anyone can see in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call your own students in for a one-on-one conference in here,\" you suggest. \"That's what I did with my girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatriz bites her lip. \"You got two done already? Really? Can I give you one of mine, that way I only have to do two instead of three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's no problem for you, and Miller is relieved and grateful when you take one of her masks from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've met your own quota\u2014two masks for you to control\u2014this morning. Now, with two more to handle, you have to find two recruits for Carmona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it should be one for him and one for Miller. You'd like to pick a good one for her\u2014one that you could appreciate too.</span></div></div>",

You already have a container of enchanted goop that will turn the wearer of a mask into an obedient servant of Tim Carmona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Except,</i> you only realize now that it's too late, <i>Carmona won't be here to give it any orders. How much of a problem is that going to be? Will it obey me if I give it orders? Or will it run out and tell everyone that Coach Schell is doing weird things with students back in her office?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest not to chance it,</i> you decide. You're going to have to restrain yourself and pick only one alias for Carmona, not two, for you will have to switch into the mask of whoever you pick so that you can control it directly while leaving Coach Schell on auto-pilot. Then, using that disguise or some other, you will have to get Carmona his second alias later today or tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings, and you jump. Time for second period: Personal Fitness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe Personal Fitness classes are electives, unlike the Basic P.E. classes that every graduate of Westside is required to take two semesters of. That means they are mostly filled with sophomores and juniors, and occasionally seniors, who need or want more physical activity. Mostly that means members of the junior varsity teams. Better than that, even, it means that the classes, being voluntary, are a lot more pleasant for the students, which makes them more pleasant for the teachers as well, who don't have to worry about bullying by the more athletic types, or sulking indifference from the less athletic kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particular Personal Fitness class concentrates on stamina and aerobic activities, and the kids on the floor are already stretching and warming up as you come striding out. Most of them are in sweat pants and long-sleeve tops, for you'll be taking them outside. You spend a few minutes looking them over as they continue to filter out from the changing rooms, and watch as some of them take off on a short, light jog around the court. Except for one or two of the chunkier kids, who signed up for the class to get in better shape, most of them look pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it looks like everyone is out and ready, you blow your whistle and summon everyone over for roll call. \"Adler! Ayala! Beecher!\" Down the list you go, too quick to make any notes for yourself. \"Okay, ten times around the perimeter, then out to the track,\" you order them. \"Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith heads down they take off, the fleetest of them flying out in front, and lapping the slow-pokes within the first two circuits. You stand in the middle of the gym, clipboard to your chest, beaming at them. Now you <i>can</i> take notes.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe juniors in the class you ignore: your gut tells you that if Andrew Webb and his friends have spread their tentacles through the school, they will mostly be in their own class or in the senior class. But there aren't that many seniors to worry about, and you are able to narrow the list of possible senior recruits for Carmona down to two: Darren Green and Shawn Sax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSax is the more plausible of the two. For a start, he's on the varsity basketball team, and given the squad's glamor and prestige you'd bet that that is one place that Webb and his friends would want to infiltrate. Sax is one of the few African-American students in the school, and though he's on the small side for a player, he makes up for it with raw skill and strength. You've always been scared of him\u2014with his bandana, moustache and goatee, and thuggishly soft-spoken manner he exudes menace\u2014but that makes him attractive in the current, dangerous circumstances. Even now, there's an animal vigor to his stride as he pounds around the perimeter of the gym in his snowy-white jogging suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friend Green was also on the squad until the purge a few weeks ago, when along with Black and Richards and Dylan Lloyd he was sent down and replaced with the two Durras brothers, Adam Dortch and (still bizarre to think about) Will Prescott. At first you're inclined to discount him for that reason. But it occurs to you that Green would still be close to members of the team, but that being off the squad he might not be a target for Red Team, which would make him a good recruit for your side. He would probably look more plausible as a companion to Reagan Hackett, the senior volleyball player you put a mask on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are a lot more sophomore boys to consider, but you soon reduce them to three. James Randolph, like Sax and Green, is a basketball player, though as yet he's only on the junior varsity team. You're not sure, but you suspect that he's popular down in his class. Or is it only because, with his blonde hair and strong legs, he reminds Cathy Schell of Joe Durras? Even so, you'd trust her instincts, and you consider him a candidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two are Liam Schoonover and Bradley White. Both are on the skinny side, and Schoonover in particular looks like a scarecrow with his thin arms and legs. But Cathy has noticed the way the girls in the class sidle up to him and White, to talk and smile and tuck their hair back while laughing. Schoonover plays in a popular garage band, so that explains his appeal. Of White's appeal you're much less sure, as he doesn't look all that special, though he has a very fresh face and a glinting grin under his mop of platinum-blonde hair. He must have a personality that gets the girls excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the kids outside to the track, and after Randolph and Jamie Laird (one of the junior girls) have circled it twice, you start shuttling them back inside as each one completes a circuit. You jog in with the last of them and let them walk it off and catch their breath before sending Sax into the equipment room to fetch out a bag of rubber balls. Most of the kids' faces light up at the prospect of playing dodge ball for the rest of the period, though Cristina Ramon looks like she wants to crawl under the bleachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's staying in town for Thanksgiving?\" you shout out before the game can start. \"Come on, put your hands up!\" The kids look puzzled but comply. \"Just looking to see who might be in town over break for some extra credit,\" you explain. The quick roll call has eliminated one of your choices: Bradley White will be heading out of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another possibility swaggers onto the court a few minutes later, as the balls start to fly: Peter Gossett, another one of the coaches. He grins and gestures you over with a crook of his finger. \"You doing this for the rest of the period?\" he asks. You nod. \"Mind if my guys join you? They're spazzing out and I can't get 'em to concentrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the wrestling class that Gossett is talking about, but you're not thinking of those guys\u2014hot as some of them are\u2014when you nod. It's Gossett himself. Like Cathy he's in his early thirties, with a full head of reddish-brown hair, a wide smile, and a beard so heavy it shows a five o'clock shadow even before noon. He's built the way a wrestling coach should be, with lots of muscle packed into a trim frame. He's popular with his students, too.

You already have a container of enchanted goop that will turn the wearer of a mask into an obedient servant of Tim Carmona, and\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause and frown. Only now that it's too late do you see the flaw in the plan you made for the day. You and Miller were going to put two masks onto students for Carmona's aliases, but he won't be here to give them any orders. Is that going to be a problem? <i> Will it obey us if we give it orders?</i> you wonder. <i>Or will it run out and tell everyone that Coach Schell and Coach Puente are doing weird things with students back in their offices?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest not to chance it,</i> you decide. You'll have to score Carmona two masks later, when he's around to take control of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost you take the second mask back to Miller, so that she can pick two aliases for herself, but change your mind. She sounded stressed so you can help her out by picking out one of them for her. So even as the bell rings for second period, you put your head into her office to warn her off from making a mask for Carmona, and to use only one of her pair to make another alias for herself. She looks relieved when you tell you'll pick her out an alias from your second-period class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe Personal Fitness classes are electives, unlike the Basic P.E. classes that every graduate of Westside is required to take two semesters of. That means they are mostly filled with sophomores and juniors, and occasionally seniors, who need or want more physical activity. Mostly that means members of the junior varsity teams. Better than that, even, it means that the classes, being voluntary, are a lot more pleasant for the students, which makes them more pleasant for the teachers as well, who don't have to worry about bullying by the more athletic types, or sulking indifference from the less athletic kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe particular Personal Fitness class that Cathy Schell teaches second period concentrates on stamina and aerobic activities, and the kids on the floor are already stretching and warming up as you come striding out. Most of them are in sweat pants and long-sleeve tops, for you'll be taking them outside. You spend a few minutes looking them over as they continue to filter out from the changing rooms, and watch as some of them take off on a short, light jog around the court. Except for one or two of the chunkier kids, who signed up for the class to get in better shape, most of them look pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it looks like everyone is out and ready, you blow your whistle and summon everyone over for roll call. \"Adler! Ayala! Beecher!\" Down the list you go, too quick to make any notes for yourself. \"Okay, ten times around the perimeter, then out to the track,\" you order them. \"Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith heads down they take off, the fleetest of them flying out in front, and lapping the slow-pokes within the first two circuits. You stand in the middle of the gym, clipboard to your chest, beaming at them. Now you <i>can</i> take notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe juniors in the class you ignore: your gut tells you that if Andrew Webb and his friends have spread their tentacles through the school, they will mostly be in their own class or in the senior class. Almost you discount the senior girls, who are only in the class to get some much-needed exercise, but you make a mental note to keep Cristina Ramon as a candidate. She is a chunky girl\u2014\"fat\" wouldn't be an inaccurate description\u2014who puffs and chugs along at the very end of the line, glaring at the backs of the runners who blow past her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wouldn't tap that,</i> you think. But maybe that's a reason to pick her, so that Miller won't think you were plotting with your cock rather than with your brain. Besides, Cathy Schell has heard and seen things that suggest that Cristina, like Reagan Hackett, is something of a gossip queen in the senior class; and a few times, when some of the sophomore girls have said something snarky and giggly to her face, she has silenced them with a dagger-like tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of the sophomore girls ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLots of them are in the Personal Fitness class as an adjunct to their sports activities. So you've got basketball girls, softball girls, track girls, and others well represented. Almost too well represented, so that it's hard to narrow the list down to only one or two top choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've still not picked anyone for Miller when the kids start exiting the gym, and you follow them out at a thoughtful pace. Three of them, you simply can't eliminate from consideration, even with all the other possibilities in play: Kaylee Mercier, Wendy Adler, and Avery Ayala. These are a giggling trio of friends that are obviously in training to be cheerleaders. Kaylee already looks like a younger version of Chelsea Cooper, with her golden locks and wide smile. Wendy is less buxom and she has a serious demeanor; in tracking her progress Coach Schell has noted that she is taking serious classes and getting straight As. Avery is still at a gawky age, with elbows and knees that don't quite want to obey her, and there's a desperation in her smile that (to Coach Schell's mind) suggests feelings of inferiority and a tendency to grovel for approval. But she is good friends with the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I was on Red Team,</i> you think, <i>Kaylee and probably Wendy would be girls I'd want masks of.</i> If you want to uncover one of their puppets, it would be best to strike at one of them. Alternately, if you just want to get close to Red Team agents, to spy them out, you'd probably be better off picking Avery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've not narrowed your choices any further before James Randolph and Jamie Laird (one of the junior girls) have circled the track twice, whereupon you start shuttling the kids back inside as each completes a circuit. You jog in with the last of them and let them walk it off and catch their breath before sending Shawn Sax into the equipment room to fetch out a bag of rubber balls. Most of the kids' faces light up at the prospect of playing dodge ball for the rest of the period, but Cristina looks like she wants to crawl under the bleachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's staying in town for Thanksgiving?\" you shout out before the game can start. \"Come on, put your hands up!\" The kids look puzzled but comply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood. The quick roll call has eliminated some of the other girls you'd not been able to eliminate on other grounds, so that feel yourself faced with only (only!) five: Kaylee, Wendy, Avery, Cristina, and Karen Beecher (an African-American girl on the JV basketball squad who for that reason might be close to Red Team's Elijah Washington).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost at random, you call one of them out to follow you back into your office. \"I want to talk to you about some extra credit over the break,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, though, you knock on Coach Puente's door and put your head into her office, for this is her free period. \"Come talk to me in my office when you have a minute,\" you tell her as she looks up from her laptop. You hope she'll approve your choice of\u2014</span></div></div>",

You cock an eyebrow at Beatriz as you slide a blank mask off the back shelf, and she pushes the door shut as you turn back to Kaylee. You take her from behind\u2014she stiffens in the chair, then slumps. You have to catch her and prop her more firmly in the chair to stop her from sliding to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to give me your other masks?\" you ask Beatriz. \"I seem to be getting pretty good at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returns you a pinched smile\u2014an unhappy expression, but she doesn't look as freaked out as when you did the same thing to Coach Puente yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle it,\" she says. \"You don't have to do everything for me, Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told me you were having a hard time, 'cos you're out on the field all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <i>you</i> told me to pull them into my office to do it,\" she retorts. \"I see what you mean now.\" She steps around you to scrutinize Kaylee directly. \"She's pretty, isn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not why I picked her,\" you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2014\" You twist inside your assumed skin. \"Not totally. She's got lots of friends, and that's the important thing. But this stuff is easier, you know, if you don't hate the body you're wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you are very self-conscious of Coach Schell's boobs and butt, and you have to restrain yourself hugging yourself with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatriz grins. \"You're so cute, Will. And I don't mean\u2014\" She clasps you by the elbows. \"We should have a sleepover. We can paint each other toenails!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself blush furiously. Beatriz titters, and pushes your hair out of your face. \"It's easier to hang out like this, right?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as girlfriends. Oh, wait!\" Her face falls. \"You picked out some guys for yourself this morning, didn't you? With your masks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're relieved to tell her that you picked out two girls. \"I was thinking the same thing,\" you lie. \"That it would be easier if we didn't have the, uh, boyfriend-girlfriend thing going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins again. \"Except you'll have to worry about it with Carmona, won't you?\" She leaps back when you slap at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nTen minutes pass, and you're able to finish the mask and set it back on Kaylee, and through Beatriz you relay instructions to the mind-controlled girl to forget about what happened and to tell her friends that you offered her extra credit for participation in a fun run. You also get contact information from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's almost the end of the period by that point, and you suggest to Miller that for her second girl she pick someone in the senior class\u2014someone from the soccer team she teaches. She agrees to, and also volunteers that she'll get a mask for Carmona on the lacrosse team, which she also coaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat leaves you with one last mask, also for Carmona, that you need to get. You're taking your lunch\u2014Coach Schell's lunch break comes during third period\u2014and flipping through rosters looking at names, when there's a tap at your door. Before you can reply, it opens, and Thomas Luna looks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit.</i> You forgot that he has this period free and likes to spend it with Cathy. But you force a smile onto your face, and despite the chill of irritation you feel on being interrupted, Cathy's body instinctively warms as Thomas comes in and shuts the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you didn't call,\" he murmurs as he leans across the desk to put his dark face to yours. His eyes are a liquid black under a heavy brow, and his strong jaw works hungrily as he drinks you in. His gelled hair is swept straight back in a way that makes you think of a rooster's coxcomb. In fact, everything about Thomas Luna, from his strutting gait to his thrusting stare, reminds you of an arrogant rooster lording it over his henhouse. He acts that way, too, setting the tempo of your dates, from the hour he picks you up to the minute he pulls you into his apartment; and when he is ready to end the necking and move on to the rutting, he doesn't ask or suggest, he only thrusts his hand down to grip your pussy, and with his free hand he lifts you up and pushes you down the hall to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd any second now, you can tell, he's going to lay a hot palm on the back of your neck and pull your face to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got caught up in paperwork,\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" he murmurs. \"But I didn't forget about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis had goes to the back of your neck, and then you're being dragged forward. His hot breath washes over your face, and his strong lips and muscular tongue encompass your mouth. They taste like cinnamon hots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh God,</i> you think, <i>I know where this is going.</i> And there's only one way to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not on the desk,\" you pant when he breaks off. \"Last time that didn't\u2014 That wasn't\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, where?\" he murmurs. He doesn't even question that you <i>might not.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chair. Take your pants off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives you a darkly amused smile. \"And what about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, but I want\u2014\" He dives in to push you again, but you push him away. \"Fine,\" he mutters. \"But if I'm going to owe you, I'm going to give you\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't owe me anything. Come on, sit down. We only got forty minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas sniggers as he falls back into the fatal chair. As he unbuttons his trousers you slide behind him to fetch down the last mask from the shelf. <i>Carmona needs a teacher anyway,</i> you tell yourself as you embrace Thomas from behind with the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"That wasn't the lunch break I was expecting,\" you mutter to Cathy when the silence has become awkward. You're buttoning up your shirt\u2014the last change of clothing\u2014and have to suck in your stomach as you bind it up. Thomas likes his clothes tight, the better to show of his gym-sculpted physique, and to keep him off the sugars and carbs that he likes too much. \"What?\" you ask when you see the secret smile playing about Cathy's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say anything about this to anyone,\" you warn her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean about the masks or anything. Or the girls this morning, or Beatriz or\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to. I think I know what you want, whatever your name is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Does she?</i> You give her a doubtful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasps and laughs and tucks back a strand of her hair. \"We got ten minutes,\" she says. \"Why don't I give you that blow job that I\u2014\" She catches herself and for a moment looks confused. \"That we were talking about a little while ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. <i>Why is she suddenly horny?</i> You weren't horny, you were just pretending, when you were in the mask. You turn her gently down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, after using the urinal in the nearest restroom, you study your new reflection in the mirror as you wash up. Your expression, you notice, falls naturally into the kind of brooding stare that looks like an invitation to rut. And when you twist your face into a stare like you gave Cathy in her office\u2014 <i>Yikes!</i> It looks like you're about to reach through the mirror and grab someone's breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wonder Thomas Luna gets laid all the time, and got laid with a different girl every weekend before settling down with Cathy Schell. He just has to look at a woman, and she'll take it like he's hitting on her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no privacy in the tutors' offices, for not only the door but the walls are made of floor-to-ceiling glass. Only one wall, the one directly behind your desk, is opaque, and you put your back to it as you pull out your cell phone to text Carmona, telling him that you've got a teacher for him, and that he can pick up the mask immediately after school. In the meantime, you'll just have to finish the day as Thomas Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmona surprises you with a quick reply, asking if he can come up to the school to see you, as he's finished another mask. You ponder before replying in the affirmative: If Carmona brings that mask up, you decide, you'll be able to finish your first round of infiltrations this afternoon\u2014each of you will have one teacher and two students under your control. But if Miller is going to a catch a senior-level lacrosse player for him, you'd best try to find a sophomore. You take out Luna's register and flip through it, looking for a candidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Carmona asks a few hours later. It's been ninety minutes since the final bell dismissed classes for the day and for the rest of the week. You and he Miller are meeting in Puente's office; for company you have the lacrosse player that she picked out for him: a well-built jock by the name of Noah Lepley. Carmona's sophomore alias, Jared Cochrane, has gone home for the day, as has Anita Nuevo, the captain of the girls' varsity soccer squad, who was Miller's senior-level choice of alias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can them or any of the others up here within the hour, you're sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough maybe you should wait a bit before making such a switch. You feel the need to study the recovered grimoire more closely, and as the teachers you'll be able to set your own schedules, and work in the privacy of your homes without worrying about family or friends busting in on you. On the other hand, you made masks of students so that you could start searching the school for fakes. Maybe you should get onto that.</span></div></div>",

'Huh?'\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, probably,\" you say with a very Caleb-like wave of your hand. \"Look, it's no trouble, I can cover for you at home, and maybe I should in case Eva\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll go home myself,\" he says, very loudly and firmly. \"You go back to cover for Dane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going back there, not with Chen on the loose,\" you repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're worried too much about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm worried!

He'd just think it was a bizarre hallucination he'd been having. You can go back to being Gordon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you mean I should let Chen kill Dane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He <i>can't</i> kill Dane,\" Caleb says through gritted teeth. \"Didn't you just get through saying he can do everything just short of killing Matthias?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't want to see <i>Dane</i> getting it in the neck. Listen, I've got an idea\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea too,\" says Caleb. \"My idea is to go home. It's getting late. Your sleeping bag and stuff is still here, isn't it? Then you can camp out here if you don't want to go back to playing Dane.\" He starts to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you hang on and listen to this idea I've got?\" you demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns, and his manner is a little frosty. \"I'll make you a deal,\" he says. \"Since you want to share your idea, and since you're having a lot of fun inside my head, how about\u2014\" He grabs one of the many metal strips you've made over the last few days, and dangles it between his fingertips. \"Gimme a copy of <i>your</i> head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace as you take it from him. \"I shoulda known that's what you'd say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAt least he has the grace to not put it on in front of you. In fact, he's already left by the time you recover from the swoon after putting it on; indeed, while you were out he seemingly took care of all the business that needed taking care of. The last thing you remember is laying back to take off his mask, and when you woke you found that not only was he gone and you were back in your own skin, but your sleeping bag had been rolled out and the book laid open so you can start reading up on the next spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when you look around, you find that he's taken his own mask and brain band with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a little miffed at that, for it seems like a sign that he doesn't trust you with them. <i>Doesn't trust you?</i> Like you'd really like to move in on his life, to live in that shitty little house alone with his mother; to worry and gnaw at the wound of his father's abandonment when he was a kid; to chase hard after good grades and career contacts so he can win himself a solid, rewarding job so he can get a wife and family that <i>he</i> won't abandon; to stagger through the school halls with an erect cock and a frozen tongue at the sight of all the girls who he's sure won't even talk to him\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub thoughtfully at your forehead. <i>Did Caleb really pull that metal strip off of you?</i> You have a raw feeling inside you, as though something has been torn away, and you've lost that sense that you've got another person riding around under your skin. But the memories and impressions seem very vivid, and thoughts you recognize as not your own keep popping up unbidden. You wince hard at some of the jokes that Keith Tilley was making behind your back about you and Lisa, and silently vow to get back at him somehow. And the thoughts keep coming even after you've bent over the grimoire in the dim light of Caleb's laptop, checking the translation of the ingredients against the supplies he'd started to set out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not a hard spell, and it uses many of the same liquids and powders you'd gathered for the first two spells, and after about twenty minutes you're able to set a bowl of the slurry-like liquid onto the sigil in the book. As directed by the instructions, you run your finger three times around the circle and set a flame to it. It flashes into a brief fire, then goes out. The page beneath turns when you lift the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is only a short paragraph on he other side, and the on-line Latin translator gives a straight-forward interpretation: It's a glue that lets you attach one of those metal strips to the inner surface of a mask. <i>Cool!</i> That means you'd be able to put the strip and the mask on at the same time instead of in two separate steps. And on mulling it over, you think you see another benefit: You could get a mask and mind-strip onto a victim in one blow if you glued a blank strip into a blank mask. Like if you got that kind of combination onto Gary Chen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you reflect grimly an hour later as you slip into the sleeping bag, you'll have to convince Caleb to go along with the plan. And he's being such a turd that he might not want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's got a point, you admit to yourself as sleep begins to take you. It probably would be easier to just take Dane out of Gordon's mask, and let him take the consequences for what you've done. Isn't that what you've been doing since you started playing with these things? Letting others pay the price for your fuck-ups by sticking them into the lives you've fucked up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou come out of the sleeping bag with a shout, and you almost come out of your body as well. \"M'huh?\" you gasp, and blink in panic at the figure advancing on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you still doing asleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink up at the person, but it's only Caleb, and so you try to slow your heartbeat back to something under five hundred thumps a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squats next to you and holds out a tall paper cup. It's hot to the touch. \"My treat,\" he says of the coffee. \"I had to beg the money off my mom. Anyway, I'm hoping we can get it back later today. Tomorrow at the latest, maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? What <i>time</i> is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little after nine.\" He sets a heavy plastic sack down by your side. \"You know how many places are open this early on a Sunday? A lot more than you'd think, thank God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow down a great gulp of bitter coffee, and it scalds your throat. But it shocks you into semi-coherence. \"You were shopping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I had to pick up the shit if we're gonna nail Chen this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're raising the coffee to your lips again, but stop before you can choke in surprise on it. \"Chen? What are you talking about Chen for?\" Your heart starts to thump again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what you wanted to talk to me about, isn't it?\" he asks. \"Just before you put that brain-thingy on, you were thinking about using a mask on him. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gyuh?\" That was the last thing you expected him to say. \"You, uh, you're cool with doing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb shrugs tightly. \"Well, it makes sense. You <i>don't</i> want him coming after you, right?\" He's avoiding your eye, and falls silent. Then he speaks again in a rush as you continue to stare at him. \"Look, that was something else I saw last night when I had the, uh, the thing in my head. I didn't realize just how fucking scary Dane's cousin is. So, you know, it makes sense, this idea you've got.\" He pauses. \"I don't wanna see Dane all fucked up either,\" he adds quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're gonna\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" He opens the sack. \"I borrowed enough from my mom to make one more mask. Besides\u2014\" A nasty little gleam comes into his eye. \"I figure that Chen knows how to turn that shit we took off him into cash. So if we swap one of us in for Chen\u2014\" He rolls his tongue around the inside of his cheek. \"We can keep his profits for ourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThank goodness for that car buffer; with its help, you're able to get the new mask made and polished up inside of an hour. As you work, you explain the new spell to Caleb, and he agrees that it could be used to attach a blank strip to the blank mask, for taking Chen in one fast blow. As for Chen himself, you put on Dane's mask, then make a phone call. \"Oh man,\" you gasp excitedly when he answers. \"Like, I finally remembered where I put that stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is guarded: \"What are you talking about, Matthias?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your stuff, man. Gordon didn't get it, I put it in a new place, but I was <i>baked,</i> man, when I did it, that's how come I was all, like, uh, Patrick Star when you asked me where it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb is listening intently, and his eyebrows shoot up. \"Patrick Star?\" he mouths incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? So bring it to me,\" Chen says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't,\" you say. \"It's up at the school and I can't reach it. Yeah, I can't reach it,\" you repeat. \"It's up in\u2014 I don't know what it is, but it's back up in this space thing where I can't get to it, but maybe you can? You know, 'cos, you're, like, stronger than me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not making any sense,\" Chen says, but consents to meet you at the portables at three-thirty. You hang up with a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which of us gets to be Chen?\" Caleb asks.</span></div></div>",

No, we put Chen under Dane's mask, but I step in for Chen. You can, you know\u2014\" He turns shy. \"Do like you were doing last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you didn't like that last night. You seemed really creeped out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't like that, but what I hate even more is the way you keep getting us into deeper trouble every time we make one of these changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so insulted you can't even reply, so he just keeps talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Chen is really bad news,\" he says. \"If you couldn't handle <i>Dane</i>\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shove him in the chest. \"Fuck you! You think you could do a better job of it than me? In what fucking universe? Anyway, this time is gonna be different, I'll have Chen's brain in there with me, I won't have any surprises to deal with. That's how come I fucked up as Dane, 'cos I didn't know he was in business with fucking Fin Fang Foom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb looks pissed, but he relents. And maybe he's a little relieved as well, for quickly falls into accord as you plot out how to catch Chen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou grin widely as Chen gets out of his Jeep. \"Hey! You made it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I made it, you fucking lunatic,\" he says, and slams his door hard. He advances on you menacingly. \"So where's the shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're up at Westside, so you point toward the nearby gym. \"Back at the portables. Don't be mad at me.\" You try putting your arm in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad move: Chen swings at your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Don't be so\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabs a fistful of your hair and hauls you close. \"You take me to the fucking stash, and if it's there, and if it's <i>all</i> there\u2014\" His voice dissolves into a strangled choke, and he twists your hair until your scalp screams. \"If this isn't another <i>colossal fuck up,</i> Matthias, <i>then</i> maybe I'll only twist your arm off and shove it up your ass. Shove it up so far you'll be able to blow a guy <i>and</i> give him a hand job at the same time. You got that, you dumb-ass <i>shit?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, it's all cool!\" You get to your feet, and now you keep your distance from him as you lead him across the deserted campus toward the creaky old portables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Caleb have chosen the usual portable as your trap: you've had good luck catching people there, even if you've had only bad luck with them afterward. With exaggerated caution\u2014extreme tiptoeing and shushing\u2014you push open the door of the one you chose, and gesture Chen inside. \"So where'd you put the stuff that you can't get to it?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up there.\" You point to a ventilation duct in the wall just under the ceiling, hanging partially off its one remaining screw: It took you and Caleb nearly ten minutes to spot the duct as a possible \"hiding place,\" and another five minutes to get it loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChen's eyes narrow as he turns on you. \"No fucking way you got it in there. It's too small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think so,\" you giggle. \"But I did, I shit you not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why can't you get it back out? Is it stuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, kind of. And it's way deep inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" He pulls the old teacher's desk over so he can stand on it. \"What are you doing,\" he asks at the sound of you pulling a drawer open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just looking for shit, in case someone left something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone did: a blank mask with a blank brain band attached to its inner surface. You make loud rummaging noises with one hand as you silently pull the mask out with the other. You whisk it under your shirt, lest Chen catch a glimpse of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he's too busy fiddling with the duct. He rips the ventilator cover away and sticks a hand in. He discovers\u2014as you did\u2014that it's very shallow. \"The fuck? There's nothing\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you have feel around, go up,\" you tell him helpfully as you climb onto the desk behind him. \"Here, lemme show you.\" You thrust an arm over his shoulder\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014and around his head to press the mask into his face. Chen jerks back, then sags against you. The sudden onslaught of his full weight almost knocks you off the desk, but you catch him and yourself just in time, and sag with him onto the desk. You disentangle your limbs from his, and leap for the door. \"Caleb!\" you call, and your friend dashes in from the portable opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChen isn't a big guy\u2014he's about your height\u2014but he's strong without being bulky or sculpted. Getting him undressed is a bit of a production, for he's wearing a dark-green, heavy canvas jacket over his red t-shirt; dark denim trousers; and combat-style boots. You whisk away the gray ski cap he's got pulled low over his forehead and are about to tackle the jacket when Caleb waves you off. \"Just get out of Dane's things,\" he hisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you need my help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but first things first. I won't let you sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you quickly strip yourself of Dane's loose gear, lay in the filthy floor, and grab your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou come out of your swoon slapping hard at Caleb: to rouse you, he's covered your mouth and pinched your nose shut. Effective, but it leaves your brain feeling like it's been stuffed with dry leaves and set on fire. You ache all over as you rush over to help get Chen undressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out you didn't have to rush too hard. The mask is still copying Chen by the time you've got him completely disrobed and into Dane's clothes. He never wakes or stirs, even when you accidentally drop his head hard onto the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've got Chen changed, you get yourself into his clothes. There's a rough, grimy feel to them. They don't seem to be dirty\u2014not overly much\u2014and there's no smell off them. But they're not the kind of clothes you'd wear, and they're associated with someone you are very much not like. You feel like you're playing a very unconvincing game of \"dress up\" as you tighten the laces on the boots and wrap yourself in the jacket; you feel lost in them. You pull the ski cap down around your ears, tuck your hair into it, and turn to Caleb. \"How do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a sad little douchebag wannabe. Go wait in his car, I'll be along with his mask when it's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want me here to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna be seen with you while you're looking like that. I'm not sure I wanna be seen with you after you've got Chen's mask on, either,\" he adds in a grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChen drives a battered red Jeep with a fabric top and doors. The interior of the cab isn't much different from the interior of your old truck, with the floorboards on the passenger side being buried in papers and old fast-food sacks. You may be dressed like Chen, but you don't look like him yet, and it would never do if someone spotted you sitting behind his wheel. It wouldn't do for them to spot you dressed like this out in the open, either. You try compromising by sitting in the passenger side, but even that leaves you feeling exposed, and you slouch down as far as you can, then lay on your side so that you'll be entirely invisible to casual passers-by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time passes uncomfortably, but it's only a few minutes before there's a scratching at the fabric of the door, and you sit up as Caleb opens it. His look of surprise changes to a sneer of exasperation. \"And <i>you're</i> going to take over for Chen,\" he snorts. \"I'll believe it when I see it.\" He hands you a mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you don't want to piss me off, not if I'm going to be wearing this mask,\" you retort. You turn it over to look at its inner surface. Your jaw drops a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, check it out, Chinese characters and shit,\" Caleb says. \"Gimme the keys, I'll drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I drive? It's gonna be\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna be far away when Chen wakes up,\" Caleb says. \"Gimme. We'll finish up back to the clubhouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he puts the car in motion, you open up the plastic tub filled with the sealing goop, and with a brush that shakes from the movement of the car you paint its interior. You move fast, and the Jeep is still on the street when you're able to wriggle down firmly into the seat and raise the mask with both hands to your face. The blue flames of the Chinese characters dance and burn and blur as they rise to meet you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You rise from sleep like a shark breaching the ocean surface. Someone is shaking you, and the side of your fist--did you swing your arm?--connects with something hard but a little yielding. You sit up and look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're parked next to the old elementary school; Caleb is rubbing the side of his jaw and giving you a wounded, reproachful look. \"So, does this mean you're Gary Chen now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ungh.\" You put your face in your hands, but it doesn't help. Your clothes crawl all over your body, like they're made of insects. You brush and pat and pull at them, trying to get comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you're hit by that wave of nausea and dizziness, like you had yesterday when waking under Caleb's mind-strip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wells up and spills over you, over the crown of your head, down your limbs, and into your lungs and guts. You bend double, first with sickness and then with fear, for his approach is awful. He's dark and shrouded and baleful as he creeps up behind and wraps himself around you like a full-body veil. Your mind unravels, and you reel as new threads entwine with old; you turn and fall and twist; but when the sense of motion ceases you find yourself standing again on firm and familiar ground, though with a new horizon about you. You open your eyes, and are enveloped by an overpowering sense of something like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u2014a sense that you're looking at and remembering things twice over. Briefly you are of two minds about where you are and what you've been doing, but with only a tiny spasm of willpower you bring them into alignment. You suck in a deep breath, and exhale. \"Yeah I'm here. Let's have a look at our shit,\" you say, and get out of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're sharply aware of Caleb's movements as he follows you to the basement door, though you only watch him from the corner of your eye. <i>Fucking stupid to let them make that play back in the portable,</i> you can't help feeling; but you also can't help feeling glee at having bested Chen. You kick the ground impatiently as Caleb fumbles the key into the lock. \"Snap it up there, Johansson,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be an asshole, Will,\" he replies. His tone is quieter than the one he usually takes with you, you notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard for me not to be under the circumstances, you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't overdo it. You're just playacting, and you're with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dizziness hasn't completely faded; maybe that's why you feel not quite in control of yourself. \"If this is playacting, I'm doing a pretty good job convincing myself,\" you retort, and push past your friend once he's got the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause halfway down the interior steps, and blink away a distressing portrait of home life you'll be returning to. <i>Mnh, that's not gonna be fun.</i> But Chen's dealt with it before, and you're sure you can too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause as you test the wooden stairs under your boots, everything firms and tightens up. <i>This feels natural,</i> you think to yourself. <i>This feels right.</i> \"Is the shit still in that desk?\" you ask. \"Get it out while I make sure I got my gear on right.\" Caleb makes a face, but you ignore it to shove your way to the back where the full-length mirror is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there he is; or, there <i>you</i> are: Chen Guangli, or \"Gary Chen,\" as the Americanization has it. Grandfather didn't come to the United States from China, he came via Indonesia, but there's still the pressure to conform to the old ways, even in these days of the old father's physical and mental decrepitude. Not that the form staring back at you has anything like an \"old ways\" stamp to it. You shift about inside the jacket, resettling it; you adjust the belt and pants; and <i>who the fuck put your boots on </i>that<i> way?</i> You undo them and start over again, getting your cuffs just inside the tops before lacing them up again. And the cap: You pull it off, sending straight dark hair falling over your brows and into your face, over your ears and down the back of your neck. You slide the cap back on, pushing your bangs inside it as you pull it down to your eyebrows; but you tug the hair on the sides of your head and the back out further, so that it frames a face that narrows from wide-set eyes and high cheek bones down to a tapering chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more pass over all the clothing gets it all in place and comfortable. You hike your shoulders, and realize you're tense all over. But you don't relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you <i>done</i> yet over there, Confucius?\" Caleb wearily calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething taut and heavy, like a piano wire, snaps inside your head. \"Confucius\" is almost as bad as \"fortune cookie\" or \"fried lice.\" Inside of four steps you're in Caleb's face and inside his defenses before he can bat feebly back. You jam him back against the wall and punch a hole in his gut; and since you've got a fistful of his hair in the other hand he can't bend double to cover the sudden pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to deliver a second blow when you catch yourself; and though your muscles blaze with undischarged flame, you force yourself to release him, and your best friend sinks to the ground, groaning and puffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm sorry about that,\" you say, but your tone is clipped, for that wave of anger is still receding; and you're also mortified at having let yourself be carried away by it. \"But don't call me shit like that, okay? Instinct kind of takes over, I guess.\" Caleb glares up at you from under his eyebrows. \"But, uh, I guess that's one reason Chen is such an asshole. Because for as long as he can remember people have been calling him names like that, thinking it's funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think he's just an asshole,\" Caleb retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe,\" you admit. You flex and relax your fist thoughtfully. That sense of bifurcation is back, now that Chen has receded. You doubt he'd ever say it aloud, but you say it aloud for him as you retake control: \"When you're always in a bad mood, it doesn't take much to set you off, you know? Anyway, yeah, I'm all set now.\" You look down at him, and can't help grinning. \"Think I could pass as Chen now, you pudding-faced little shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb doesn't reply as he struggles to his feet. You step back, keeping out of range, tensing for a blow that you doubt will come, but you never know. Caleb gives you a sidelong glance as he returns to the desk where he's got the stuff set out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou <i>tch</i> over the busted lock, but carefully study the contents. It <i>looks</i> like everything Dwayne promised, and he's never cheated his customers yet. But of course you'll have to double-check it. And after that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do with it?\" Caleb's question is your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you let Chen answer for you: \"I got my customer list, I can clear ninety percent of it by Wednesday, rest by the end of the month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who buys that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly morons at the college who don't know they could get it faster and cheaper from dealers on campus. Rest at school, one eighth at a time. 'Cept for one <i>big</i> customer there. Fuck me, but you'd never guess who buys fifteen ounces of this shit a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gardinhire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounds like Caleb is trying not to swallow his tongue. \"Gardinhire? <i>Martin</i> Gardinhire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Mansfield's best butt-boy. I get five thousand a month from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho! Lee! Fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. He's gotta be buying for his friends, you know, Mansfield and Kirk, prob'ly for some of the girls too.\" You laugh. \"Fuck, I bet Kelsey's getting high with Hennepin every time they get together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's brow crinkles. \"What's this about Kelsey and Hennepin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right, we didn't know about that.\" You grin. \"Hennepin is fucking Kelsey, and they think they're doing it in secret. Or Kelsey thinks it's--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Blankenship we're talking about?\" Caleb gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. They're doing it in motels, and Kelsey thinks it's all a big secret between her and Keith, and maybe Amanda, I'm sure Kelsey's telling fucking <i>Amanda</i> about every sweaty little orgasm.\" Every orifice in your body clenches at the thought of those two <i>cunts,</i> an opinion on which you and Chen would be at one even without this merger of minds. \"But every fucking one at Westside knows Hennepin's slipping his sausage between her buns and leaving a squirt of mayo behind. Everyone except you and me and Tilley, of fucking course.\" You spit on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're dismayed by the wave of contemptuous bile that sweeps over you at the thought of Caleb Johansson, Keith Tilley, and Will Prescott. You're not the only three losers in the school--worms Chen and his gang can stomp without fear of trouble or retribution--but that's what you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" you continue when Caleb maintains a thoughtful silence, \"Gardinhire pays out five thousand a month, every month, for a portion of this shit, which is way more than he can be using himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long has this been going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Gardinhire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, with Chen, how long has he been\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since he was a fucking freshman. Dwayne, Dane's cousin? He was a senior that year, and he got Chen dealing it down in that class.\" The thought comes like a pang of conscience: <i>I need to find a dumb little shit down there now, someone fucking stupid like I was, to start dealing it down there, so I can keep this up for the next few years.</i> \"Matthias acts as go-between, so there's nothing to directly connect Chen to Dwayne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much does he make off this trade? How much can <i>we</i> make?\" Caleb adds with undisguised cupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't immediately reply. Given the situation, you could sell the whole stash, split the money with Caleb, and leave Chen's operation totally bankrupt. Crushing the asshole that way would be a sweet pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you also know the facts behind his operation. And if you're going to spend any time playing this part--and you might have to--it might be better to keep things running the way they're supposed to be running.</span></div></div>",

Can you believe that? Chen was fifteen and in hock to a fucking loan shark.\" You shake your head. \"So four thousand of what he makes goes to paying off the debt. He's worked fucking hard to keep ahead of what he owes, but he's still--\" You trail off. \"And he doesn't keep what's left for himself, either. His grandfather lives with the family, and everything that's left goes to helping with the medical bills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb staggers back a step. \"His <i>parents</i> are okay with their kid dealing drugs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand shoots toward his throat, but you pull it back with a jerk. \"They don't <i>know</i> that's where it comes from, okay? They think it comes from his job as a fucking dishwasher over at the country club, same place Gardinhire works as a waiter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up. Anyway, Chen tells his parents that the extra cash he's bringing in is part of his share of wait-staff tips. He throws it into the family account along with all of his real salary, gets a tiny-ass allowance from his dad because it's all they can afford to give him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" Caleb drawls after a pause. \"So Chen's this sweet little Chinaboy who does all this to help out his pawpaw?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe in speaking all these facts aloud you have somehow claimed them as your own, and come to identify with them. But now you don't stop yourself. You advance on Caleb, and with a hard knuckle to his breastbone push him back into the same corner where you'd slugged him before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can skim <i>maybe</i> a couple of hundred bucks from him,\" you hiss. \"Enough to pay back your mom and maybe for some of the supplies we'll need for more spells in the book.

With that kind of-- <i>Gauuggghhhh!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou punch him in the exact same spot as before\u2014it should still be real tender\u2014and as before you keep him on his feet by grabbing the hair at the top of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't. Fuck with me. Johansson,\" you hiss in his ear. \"I'm the one who made the fucking call to get inside Chen, and I'm the one who's got to take fucking responsibility for him until we figure out a way to sort things out. You said you couldn't picture me playing Chen. Well, I can, and I am, and this is me telling you to <i>not</i>--\" You gut punch him again. \"Get in my way, and don't second-guess me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you release him, and again he slides to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta start getting this shit out to the people who want it,\" you tell him, ignoring his distress. \"If I don't talk to you at school tomorrow, meet me here at four. I'll give you something so you can pay your mom back, and we'll talk about what comes next. Oh, and speaking of which--\" You scoop up the grimoire. \"I'll take the book and give it a look-through, see how much we need to skim to unlock the next spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do about Matthias? I mean, the real Chen?\" Caleb asks weakly, pausing every few words to gulp down some air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore him. You can ignore him too, since he doesn't have any idea you're mixed up in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou drive back to the Westside, and are glad to note that Dane's car is gone. You try imagining what Chen will be doing--you've got his brain inside you--but the magical-sci-fi idea that someone might force a body-swap on him is so outrageous that you can't find any instincts that could even grapple with it. He might try going back to his real house; he might try looking for some of his friends. But he couldn't convince anyone of who he is, right? They'd just think he was wacky Dane being extra wacky. They might even think the drugs had finally blown Matthias's mind all to hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seek out one of the back doors of the school--the one Chen knows how to jimmy open--and glide through the darkened halls to his locker. <i>So much easier this way,</i> you think as you quickly twirl the combination lock open. <i>No guesswork about where my shit is, or what to do with it, or where to go.</i> You pull out a backpack and take it into a nearby bathroom; from it you draw a set of electronic scales and some plastic baggies, and set them next to the briefcase with this month's bales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start by weighing the latter: Yes, Dwayne shipped what he was supposed to, down to the tenth of a gram. Next you weigh out and bag Gardinhire's portion: fifteen ounces. Then for the university: Chen had already budgeted amounts for Harper and Keating and Whitmore and Ragland, based on a rolling average of their last six monthly purchases and incorporating an adjustment based on a trend-line. (Math class is far from wasted on him.) So you just have to measure out four baggies for them, totaling about thirty-six ounces.  The remainder you leave as is for now: that's where the hard work will be, and you've got people who can help you out. You take out your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst person you call is Dwayne. \"You talk to your cousin today?\" you ask. The reply is negative. \"Whatever. Point is I did and I got his shit straightened out. Got my shit, too. He says he <i>forgot</i> about the new place where he put the, uh, baking powder. He showed it to me and I got a new mix going. It's all good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How hard did you hit him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, man. He can walk. He was acting kind of goofy when I left him, though, so maybe his brain isn't working as good as it should be. But who knows with him. Oh, and he busted the case, so you're gonna have to get a new one. I think he was trying to get into it, that's probably why he was pretending like he lost it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can get a new one, but the cost is coming out of your account.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck? It's your cousin who--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it happened at the school, it's your responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't <i>know</i> where he busted it, chances are he busted it at his place, and then it's <i>your</i> responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll split the cost with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery muscle in your body tightens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll pick up the whole bill, fuckface! He's your cousin, and it was your fucking brilliant idea that he play the mule. Don't fuck with me today, Macauly,\" you interrupt him. \"After this week's fuck up-- Listen, when I sell this shit I'll have twenty thousand large. If I want, I can pay off Mathis and be out of this shit for good, and then how are you gonna make yer lunch money in Westside? You'd have to set up a new guy, and how are you gonna do that from where you're sitting? So you pay for a new motherfucking box yourself, motherfucker, if you don't want it costing you fifteen big ones a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The things are only about fifty bucks,\" he grumbles. \"Why are you being such a hardass about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the fucking principle, that's what it is. I'll give you back this busted one, but you replace it on your own dime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets the message and stops haggling. You're breathless, nauseated, and exhilarated when you hang up, for you can't believe that, even with Chen's native psychology to guide and support you, you managed to browbeat Dwayne Macauly into paying for the damaged briefcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you're in a fine mood when you call Tanner Evans next. \"I'm heading over to your place. Your mom gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what's the--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got homework we need to work on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of homework,\" the idiot asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's nine cut seventy-two ways, you fucking pustule? That's the kind of homework. Clear a space on your bed and lay some spray around, last time I was there it smelled like your jerk-off sock.\" You hang up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pack everything away, and though you'd like to swagger out of the building, you keep it cautious, and skulk through the halls and back out that the door you came in by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nTanner Evans's head is square and flat on top and puts you in mind of a shoebox. He has dull, heavy-lidded eyes under beetle brows, and splotchy brown freckles that look like he got spattered with paint and couldn't get the stains off. He smells funny, too. You instinctively hate the sight of him, because he's one of the assholes who hangs around with Kirkham and Chen, and tries to act like he's as tough as them by being tough on you and your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you're suppressing a smile when he lets you in: His lips twitch nervously between pale cheeks, and he can't look you in the eye. \"I thought you said this month was off,\" he says as he leads you into the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said there was a problem. It got sorted out. Here we are, and we got three days to make up. You got everything set up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Set up</i> means that he's got his own set of scales out, along with the packages of tiny self-sealing bags suitable for holding and passing eighths of hay. You spread out on the floor and get quickly to work. It's both tedious and exacting, but you don't talk or put on any music, because you want to be able to hear if someone returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're almost done and are packing the seventy-two cuts into twelve bigger baggies when Evans speaks. He swallows first, though. \"Uh, I think I wanna skip this month.\"</span></div></div>",

Still, though his meaning is plain, you can hardly believe your ears. \"The fuck do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licks his lips. \"I mean, you said on Friday that the month was blown--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say the month was blown, I said there was a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made it sound like--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sounding like a pussy, Evans. The <i>fuck</i> do you mean that you wanna <i>skip</i> this month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't pay you,\" he says. \"I haven't\u2014 When I heard from you, I spent the money on some other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck did you\u2014? Every month, you give me twenty-four dimes for one of these.\" You brandish one of the large baggies, which contains six of the smaller ones. \"That's the fucking deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can still hold it for you, if you need it held--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your left hand--your awkward hand--you clip him across the nose. \"You're fucking with me? Seriously, are you fucking with me? You'll hold six eighths without giving me any fucking security?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little stream of red trickles onto his upper lip, and he puts his head back and pinches the bridge of his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't lose out anything, Chen, I swear! I'll hold it and I'll sell some, I sold all of 'em last month! You can tap me for the money, and what's left at the end of\u2014 Jesus, it's not like I can bug out on you! End of the month, you'll know where to find me, you'll get back everything I owe you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shivers and shrivels under your stare. \"Three-sixty,\" you finally say. \"End of the month you give me thirty-six dimes <i>and</i> whatever you haven't sold. You sell all of them, you give me thirty-six instead of twenty-four. You sell none of them, you give me thirty-six <i>and</i> the eighths you were too fucking stupid to deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I can't get thirty-six for them? I mean, even if I sell all six, that's, uh\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sixty an eighth. Christ! You either get the money from someone else, or you raise the price of what you're selling. I wanna see if I can raise the price point anyway, and it looks like you just volunteered to test the market. Am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods and winces as another trickle runs out his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" You gather up all your stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after you've got it packed, and haven't left a baggie for him, does he point out that you've not given him a supply. \"I'll give it to you Wednesday,\" you tell him. \"You can start late, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou make two more stops, dropping additional baggies onto Joe Thomason and George Mendoza, and since they're not sad little shits like Evans, they give you twenty-four dimes for each. Chen only keeps one baggie for himself handy at school at any one time\u2014an amount just under the limit that would put him in lock up if he got busted\u2014but by dropping baggies on these cronies and insisting they carry them to school, he can tap a larger supply if the day's demand exceeds the six eighths he's brought for the day. <i>And</i> he can spread his net wider than if he were handling it alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you've got one last place to go before you can go home. David Kirkham smiles\u2014a sneering, lopsided thing\u2014as you hand him a baggie; and since he's Kirkham, you don't ask for any money, and you don't expect to ever get any, either. \"Nice,\" he says softly, as he says everything softly. \"I knew you weren't the cockup you were claiming to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your boy Evans has a cock up <i>his</i> ass, or something,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose? Yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't fuck that sick-making little douche if it got me a ticket inside a cheerleader. He says he's not taking a set this month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you telling me? You can sit on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's your little cunt. Him and Mendoza and\u2014 Fuck, I'd drown 'em in a ditch as soon as look at 'em, but they're the ones supporting your end of things. You wanna know the sad fucking truth? At least a third of what I sell each month goes through them. And if they get it in their heads that this is all, like, <i>voluntary,</i> what am I gonna be left with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll talk to him,\" Kirkham sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do more than talk to him, fucker. I wanna see blood on his face when he begs me to give him some bash to deal. I'm giving you sixth eighths a month\u2014sixth eighths without overhead, you faggot, that you can smoke or you can sell\u2014and me, I'm only netting six hundred a month even with those three motherfuckers helping out. We're basically partners, you and me, and I'm doing the work while you're collecting a third of the profits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'll talk to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. And feed him one of his own balls if he gives you any bullshit stories about how he <i>is</i> on tap for the month. He's just dumb enough to think he can get away with a fucking lie like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint smirk crosses Kirkham's face, and you guess that he guesses you already straightened Evans out. But he nods all the same, for he understands that bullshit like Evans tried to pull can't be tolerated. Not if it endangers his own supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nDid you tell Kirkham that you're only making six hundred dollars a month dealing marijuana? Well, that's all he knows about, that's approximately the profit on what you deal yourself and what you hustle through the others. He has no idea that you sell even more than that to Gardinhire in one giant drop at the first of each month, and he has <i>no fucking clue</i> that you sell more at the university than you do at Westside. Six hundred a month? You told Caleb the truth: It's forty-six hundred a month and change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad four thousand of that sum goes toward clawing back the debt to Karol Mathis, and the remaining goes into the family bank account. When you get home, you get a close up look at what it goes to paying for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chens live in a house that would need at least another two hundred square feet to even be considered \"dinky.\" There are two small bedrooms in the back, but one of them has been done up as a very small sitting room, whose fold-out couch Gary gets to sleep in each night. That's because the real living room has been turned into a sick room for his grandfather. You get an eyeful of it when you come in the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is dominated by a king-size adjustable bed that's raised its withered occupant into a half-sitting position. He's on a respirator, and a couple of monitors are attached to him. A portable toilet, still faintly stinking from its last use, is on one side of the bed. A chair is on the other. At the moment, Gary's mother is sitting there, but during the day it's usually occupied by a nurse. Grandfather really should be in a nursing home or even a hospital, but Gary's father won't stand for it. And so, despite his holding a middle-manager position at a bank, his family is reduced to these circumstances so that they can honor the old man by taking care of him here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Chen looks tired, but her eyes are sharp as you come in the door. \"Are you finally home? Where's your homework?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my way to do it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only now? What have you been doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got started on it, I only need to finish it.\" She turns her head so you can kiss her on the cheek. \"I was doing some of the rest with friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't hesitate to open the backpack, for you hid the busted metal briefcase in the back seat of the Jeep, and the stash and cash are in the small strongbox that you and Macauly soldered to the underside of the chassis last year. You take out a notebook and open it to some math that Gary did yesterday as insurance against just this kind of demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squints at it. \"Why are you working with friends on this? Do you need help? Don't you understand it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally understand it, but I have to help <i>them</i> with their math so they'll help me with English.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's your English homework?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have any this weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you have to finish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little Physics and some Marketing.\" You suspect you could teach Mr. Peters  more about marketing than he could teach you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You practice your viola yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at the old man. \"Isn't it too late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as you get home tomorrow, then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have work and other homework after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hours Tuesday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a boy stopped by, looking for you,\" she says as you turn toward the bedroom. \"Was he one of the ones you were studying with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips. \"I don't know. What was his name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dane Matthias.\" Her eyes narrow. \"He smelled funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he wasn't one of the guys tonight. What did he want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't say. He wanted to talk to you.\" Her tone turns aggressive. \"I didn't let him stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bet she didn't, and you wonder if Gary\u2014under Dane's mask\u2014was shocked, relieved, or heartbroken when she turned him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, should you call him? Go to his place? Or wait to see him tomorrow, which you undoubtedly will?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your \"mother\" won't like seeing you go out again, not with Physics and Marketing homework hanging over your head, and she especially won't want you going off to see a guy whose clothes smelled like burnt marijuana. Besides, Chen could try calling his old cell if he really wanted to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you settle into the living room with a padded writing table in your lap, you wonder why he hasn't tried calling. <i>Probably because he doesn't know there's a fake \"Gary Chen\" walking around,</i> you decide. Asking for himself when he stopped by was probably only an excuse so he could test his parents' reaction to his new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe homework is boring, but Gary's got some pretty good powers of concentration when he needs them. You find yourself distracted a couple of times as you notice his neat handwriting flowing out the pencil you're guiding. <i>I'm Gary Chen, and I'm doing \"my\" homework,</i> you think to yourself. When you were dealing with Evans and Kirkham and the others you were too intent, and too lost in the guiding flow of Chen's intelligence, to feel self-conscious. Now, though, you've more opportunity to touch and rub the sense of change in your position and circumstances. You separate more fully from him, in a way that leaves you feeling slightly disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou work until nearly one in the morning--for you've also the grimoire to study--then pull out the bed and quickly fall asleep. The alarm is set for six-thirty, for you've morning medical chores to help with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou sleep in a pair of track pants, and that's what you're wearing the next morning as you help your mother move the old man to the toilet, and wipe him down afterward. If Gary weren't so inured to it, you'd probably have thrown up. Luckily, the old man is in a docile mood, and only mumbles a handful of feeble curses in Chinese instead of throwing his arms about, as he often does. And as you handled the tissue paper needs, you're immediately excused thereafter to shower and clean up. Then comes a quick breakfast with the whole family in the sickroom. Mr. Chen asks his own perfunctory questions about school work, and you give your own perfunctory answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool ought to be a relief from the home life, but it isn't. Not usually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAs you glide across the front quad of the school, alert for trouble from any quarter, you've cause again to marvel at how much easier it is to play someone's part when you've got that someone with his chin on your shoulder and hands over yours (as it were), guiding you along. Take what you're doing now, for instance. You enter the library by the side door, and after making a cursory, pretend search on the catalog terminal, pull down a book from a top shelf in a back corner: <i>Aspects of Ancient Persian Life,</i> a book that Chen had carefully researched not for its content but for its lack of popularity. Not once, he found, had it been checked out in eight years; probably he's the only one who has ever opened it. You open it now and furtively slip a baggie holding sixth eighths into its back pages. You return it to its shelf, and peruse a few more titles, just to make things look proper; then you head out behind the music wing for a quick, lonely smoke while plotting out the day's transactions. You think you can get most of today's supply placed, since it's the start of a new round, and some of your best customers have been without for a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake the prospects in first period English, for instance. Adrian Semple and Keith Hennepin are regulars; if they've enough on them today, you could drop all six on them, maybe. There's also Justin Roth. He has his own supplier someplace--maybe he knows and gets his shit from Dwayne direct--because he swallows shit you don't dare traffic in. But he sometimes picks stuff up from your network.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's also the sports teams. Patterson tries to keep the basketball team clean, but Luke Bennett, who represents the squad in first, dresses like a thug and would probably take some. A better gamble is the football team, though they get their supply from you know not where. Better not try dropping any on their representatives in first period, though: Cameron Huber or Marcus Johnson are pretty square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's Molly Shaw, who's sulking in the back as you enter the room. She's a talker, so you don't like that she knows she can buy from you; so with her you pretend you only use the stuff but can be persuaded reluctantly to part with an eighth at cost. She's the very definition of \"casual user,\" but she's looking stressed (apparently she's had another baby scare), so she might be looking for relief. <i>Mm.</i> If you play it right, make her feel good while sharing the experience with her, maybe you can give her grounds for another scare?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if you were looking for that kind of play and that kind of playdate, you'd set it up with a girl who's not in the class, but who, toward the end of class, walks past the window every day, to the delight of every guy in the room: Andrea Varnsworth. She's the captain of the swim team, and she has been smoothed and sculpted by the water into a form that begs for caressing by something other than the waves. She's tall, with large, firm breasts that she always keeps covered in school; a tummy curved just the right shape for clasping with two hands; wide hips; and strong, tapering legs. Summer has been good to her, so that she has an evenly bronzed tone, and her tawny hair has streaks of light gold in it. The killer, though, is her face, which is a little pinched and a little wolfish, maybe, but which she keeps raised and turned from all comers. If her body is the prize, her expression--and the attitude of ethereal disdain it wears--is the challenge to be overcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChen has never dared talk to her, but you've got guts he hasn't--didn't you go on a couple of dates with Eva Garner under another guy's face?--and between you and Chen you know at least how to approach her, even though the chances of making any kind of a score are so small you'd need to start dozens of places to the right of the decimal to measure them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, as always, heads swivel when she appears outside, walking slowly down the sidewalk that runs between C and E wing. You stare with watering eyes, forgetting the teacher droning on at the front of the room, and hunch over in your desk, nursing the erection. After she's gone you catch Fred Hildown staring at you. \"Fuck are you lookin' at?\" you hiss at him, and he looks away. <i>No point trying to talk the track star into sucking some smoke into his lungs.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nEnglish is boring: If you wanted to know how the Trojan War turned out, you could rent <i>300.</i> (They both got Greeks in them, right? Must be the same story.) When the bell rings, you let the evergreens Semple and Hennepin go in one direction while you trail Roth out. \"Yo, didn't you got a more fun place to be last period,\" you murmur at the back of his neck. \"You run outta fun times?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes you gotta go to class,\" he rumbles in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you, man, you're too cool to school, right? If you're running a little short on fun I got some I can lend you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lend?\" he asks skeptically as the crowds jostle you. He doesn't have to ask what you're inviting him to borrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got any dimes on you?\" you ask, drawing up close so you can speak directly into the side of his head. \"No biggie if you don't, I know you're good for it. Pay in installments. Or get your friend Small to cover for you. Get some for him, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not Chen's style to let people pay later for stuff now\u2014except, of course, with the first few purchases\u2014but Roth has never come to Chen, and always let Chen come to him; a gentle manner is about the only way to get him to pay. \"Tomorrow, maybe,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Collect now, pay tomorrow,\" you say. \"Bring me fifteen, twenty dimes tomorrow, the balance over the rest of the week. Today I'll give you--\" You scratch your cheek with two fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoth hesitates, then nods. \"When?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet me back of A-wing fourth period, we'll share some baloney.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone bumps you in the shoulder, and you turn with a snarl, but it's only a sophomore. When you turn back around, Roth has moved on. You don't pursue him, though, for Gordon Black is looming up ahead. You pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's definitely not the Gordon Black that you or Chen or anyone else is used to seeing. Usually he bulldozes through the halls with a lowered head and a glower. Today he's bulldozing through, but more carelessly than forcefully, as though he doesn't realize he's knocking people around. His countenance is bright and open, and his eyes are shining with a kind of innocent wonder. <i>Hasn't Matthias gotten used to his new position yet?</i> you wonder with some irritation. <i>It can't be such a novelty anymore, being so tall and powerfully built.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press against the side of the hall as he passes. You don't need to dodge him particularly, for Matthias wouldn't be stopping to talk to Chen anyway: Dane had no idea who was picking up and returning that briefcase every month. But you feel very shy around your victims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the indirect victims. Jason Lynch, looking a lot more surly than his friend, trails in Black's wake, and his face still bears the marks that \"Will Prescott,\" to everyone's astonishment, put on it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next two periods are taken up with soccer practice: Westside is so sports mad that the school will let one hour of varsity practice a day count as elective credit. Soccer is the only area in Chen's life where he even vaguely resembles a team player, on account of his hyper-competitive instincts, which have won him a position as a center-forward. Such are his resentments, though, that he's not even happy with that, and casts envious eyes on the attacking midfielder position. But that spot belongs to fucking golden boy Marc Garner, who runs the team from it. Still, he is good at it, and Chen likes to win, so he swallows his resentment and even acts like an enforcer for Garner against the troublemakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumber one trouble-maker would be the goal-keeper, Lester \"The Molester\" Pozniak. But you hope he does make trouble today, because \"The Molester\" has been Will Prescott's tormentor for years, and you'd love to dish him some back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou change into shorts and cleats and a dirty jersey, but keep the ski cap on\u2014it's Chen's trademark\u2014so you still look like a thug when you take to the field. There's banter on the jog outside, but none of it is directed at you, for no one on the team likes Chen, not even Mendoza, who's there's too as a defensive midfielder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you jog, you spot the Molester and Brophy Maddox\u2014his chief lickspittle, on the team and off it\u2014lagging at the last curve around the field. \"You need a fucking motorized scooter?\" you shout back at them. \"Pick it up, Maddox!\" He continues to lag right alongside the chunky Molester, falling further behind. When the jog is over, you confront them before the rest of the team. \"Fucking pussies, you're short a lap. We all passed you, but here you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit,\" snorts Pozniak, and his face, already the color of a beefsteak tomato, deepens in color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone lapped these two old ladies, right?\" you demand of the rest of the team. No one supports you, but no one gainsays you either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Garner\u2014who doesn't like Pozniack any more than you do\u2014takes the opening. \"Another lap,\" he tells them. \"If you finish before we're done with the sprints, you can skip those.\" Pozniak and Maddox expostulate, but only until you step into Pozniak's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Molester tries getting some back later in the changing room. You're coming out of the shower as he's going in. \"Ping pong dong,\" he murmurs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whip around and shove him against the tiled wall. He flies back at you, and would have got you in a bear hug except you meet his pudgy but muscled stomach with a hard blow. He still succeeds in knocking you backward, and it might have gone badly but other guys, also naked and wet, pile in to separate you. This time Garner doesn't take your side, and promises both you and Pozniak extra laps on the morrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're in the math wing when you spot Roth coming out of Muniz's classroom. You don't rush to meet him, though, because someone much more interesting has followed him: Andrea Varnsworth. For a moment only you quail, then follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't tread too close behind her, though, on account of the crowds and on account of Steve Patterson, who also came out of Muniz's. You worry he'll waste the break time trying to chat her up, and your heart constricts with fury at the thought. But when Andrea stops and opens a locker he passes her by, though not without a long, lustful look back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeeze in by her shoulder. \"Hey girl, you still letting Semple hang out at your place?\" you ask in a husky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you the briefest flicker of a glance. \"He stops by,\" she says after turning back to her locker. \"Sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanna be hospitable next time he's in, you know--\" You shrug, but it comes out more like a spasm. \"Him and me, we buy from the same guy. If you wanna take some off me--\" You shrug again. \"Semple'd think it's pretty cool of you if you offered him some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lip curls slightly. \"I know where he buys his stuff, so don't bullshit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. Offer still stands, though. You ever done some with him? It's good stuff, best stuff. Pretty fuckin' expensive, but if you ever wanna get together, you and me, I can comp you some out of my own stash.\" Chen is strictly a cigarettes and beer kind of guy, but you'd kill Semple for his bong if it could get you between Andrea's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she turns fully toward you, which would be nice if her stare wasn't so icy. \"Are you looking to get paid or laid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both if I can swing it,\" you blurt out. It crushes you to realize that self-sabotage is a vice you and Chen both share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get yourself a dress, a makeover, and street corner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour guts flash-steams into molten anger. <i>A ladyboy gag? This cunt is dismissing you with a ladyboy gag?</i> See, this is why people are awful, because even a beautiful creature like Andrea will casually throw racist insults at guys just because they're not the right fucking ethnicity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a standing offer, girl,\" you softly reply, trying hard to keep the bitterness from your voice. But you can't resist adding, \"Both of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes no move, and you shove your way back into the milling crowds with a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou haven't been worrying about the real Gary Chen and what he might be getting up to as Dane. At worst, you figure, he's lurking somewhere in the school, spying things out and trying to figure out what to do. Not until you duck into the library to retrieve two eighths for Justin do you realize he could cause you trouble even out of sight: The baggie is gone from its hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a moment to figure out it must have been Chen; your first thought, naturally, is that some asshole finally stumbled on the hiding place. But after a moment's thought, you realize it's much more likely that Chen stole it. You chew the inside of your cheek furiously, because what are you going to do about it? You can't confront \"Dane\" about it without tipping off that you know who he really is, and you'd much rather play it like you're Gary Chen, that you've always been Gary Chen, that the stoner who thinks he's Gary Chen is fucking crazy. So you decide to let things slide for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme two eighths,\" you tell Mendoza when you find him down outside the cafeteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me some green,\" he says, for of course he had to buy his six from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you the color of your balls,\" you retort. \"Two eighths, now. I'll return 'em tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got someone waiting and I can't reach mine,\" you tell him. \"If you find I'm no good for it, you can break my legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMendoza glances around furtively, then the two of you press into a corner so he can slide you two small baggies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin isn't especially gracious when he takes them off you, and his thanks come from the back of his throat rather than his heart. \"Pay you after school,\" he says. \"After I talk to Perry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow's soon enough,\" you assure him as you squat in the grass next to him. He's got some papers in his backpack, and he quickly and expertly rolls out a joint as you talk. \"You seen Matthias around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's one of your regulars, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, no, dude gets his from-- Psht, I dunno, someone with so much weed they can burn it on him. I's just figurin', where Matthias is, that's where Semple and Hennepin'll be too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're back at the portables.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, fuck 'em.\" You pound your knee absent-mindedly. Matthias is still on your mind, and you're furiously chasing a thought that refuses to hold still and be identified. It's about more than the eighths that disappeared from the library. \"So Small's settin' you up for these?\" you say. \"The other one for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think you can get Perry as a customer,\" Roth says, and accepts the lighter when you proffer it to him. \"He's not into it enough to support you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need support, this is just, you know, videogame money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be a nice videogame collection you got, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squint at him. Roth is a mop-headed drug addict on a fast slide to dropping out, but no one thinks he's stupid. And he's quiet, which in your experience means an asshole is alert. \"Eh,\" you shrug. \"There's not much profit margin in these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin huffs and sighs. \"That's why you make it up in volume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how to reply to that. Then you can't reply, for you've scooped up your bag and are sprinting hard toward the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Volume. Your month's supply. In the strongbox under the Jeep. Which the real Chen knows about, same as he knew about the book in the library.</i> He won't have a key to it, but that wouldn't stop him from trying to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, when you come to a panting stop you find sticking out from under the Jeep a pair of legs clad in pajama bottoms and bedroom slippers. You drop next to them and punch him in the groin. There's a shout and a clang, as of a head hitting something hard, but you punch again, and again, and you scream curses at him as he tries to flip over to protect his vitals. Once he's curled in a fetal position, you seize him by the ankles and drag him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a bloody gash across the side of his forehead, and from under his copper-red bangs Dane Matthias glares up at you. You sit on him, knee on his chest, fist on his throat. \"The fuck are you doing, Matthias,\" you demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting my shit back,\" he says. \"Give it, or I'll call the cops on your ass.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I knew you were dumb, Matthias, but I didn't know you had a fucking death wish,\" you hiss. The guy under your fist and knee is bright-eyed with anger. \"You call the cops on me, who'm I gonna roll over on? Your cousin, that's who. Think Dwayne'll be happy with that?\" You push your fist deeper into his throat. \"You want me tellin' him what you just said about the heat? Whaddaya think he'll do to you? You know, when you fucked up last Friday, he told me I could put you in the hospital. Those were his exact words, you know.\" <i>Yeah, Chen will know you're speaking the truth on that.</i> \"He said, 'You can put Dane in ICU if it makes you feel better, just don't send him anyplace worse than that.' He knows you're a fuck-up, but he likes you. He won't like you so much if he hears you were using the word 'cops' around me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let it sink in, that you remember what Dwayne said to him last Friday, and by extension that you know everything else that he knows, and that you know how to act like him, too. <i>Let him get used to the idea that this Gary Chen is a perfect clone of the old Gary Chen.</i> Then you ask him, \"What were you doing to my ride, Matthias? What were you doing under there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt already seems to be having an effect. \"Nothing,\" he mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you <i>think</i> you were doin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe you. I think you still need some hurtin' from last Friday.\" You put some weight on his breastbone, until his face is almost black. Then you relent enough for him to draw a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was looking for--\" He doesn't finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think there's something under my chassis? What do you think is there? Why do you <i>think</i> something is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe visibly struggles over what to say. \"I heard Dwayne mention it,\" he says. \"That you keep something under there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit. Dwayne didn't tell you nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, he said you keep some stuff under the chassis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd bet it's confusion, rather than pain, that is provoking this confession; you'd like to think that, psychologically, Chen is more resilient to pressure, since you're relying an awful lot on his native steel to carry out stuff like-- Well, like this interrogation. Instead, it sounds like he's going to avoid accusing you with something like the truth: that he was looking for his stash because <i>he's</i> really Gary Chen and you're an (even more evil) impostor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's good enough for now, so you let him up. \"You stay outta my shit, Matthias,\" you say, and shove him hard as he's just gotten to some wobbly feet. \"I catch you fuckin' around with any of my--\" You stop, as though just remembering something, and press close on him. \"You been cultivatin' a interest in faggy Persian books?\" He pales, and shakes his head. \"Uh huh. Just stay outta my shit and outta my way until I need you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nWhich hopefully is never. You think about calling Dwayne to tell him that his cousin was trying to break into that strongbox, and to tell him about his cousin's threats to involve the police. But you're pretty sure your own threats have taken care of the latter, and you don't want to bother Dwayne anymore than you need to: it makes you look weak. But in three weeks, when it's time to place your order for next month's goods, you should tell Dwayne about today's adventure. Then you and he can cut \"Dane\" out of the system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut will you be playing Gary Chen for that long? It depends on what other spells you find in the grimoire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got time to worry about that later. For now, you've got to get the stash to a safe place. After Matthias is away, you check the state of the strongbox, and find that the lock is badly scratched--he was apparently trying to pick it--but still operable. So you take off from school, heading over to the old elementary school, there to deposit the sorted weed and cash that Mendoza and Thomason had given you for their supplies. You keep out one set of six eighths to replace the one Matthias stole--it kills you to have lost it, but you were an idiot to have put it where he could find it--and two more eighths to return to Mendoza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it's back to the school. You've managed to miss most of the one blow-off class in your schedule--Fundamentals of Marketing--and use the extra time to find a new hiding book in the library. You'll have to find a better spot later, since Matthias knows about the old system, but for now you stick it in a book on butterflies of Africa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let the rest of the day slide without trying to peddle any more packets, though you get Mendoza's two back to him, and make a note in sixth period to talk to Perry Small on the morrow. You also send a text to Gardinhire: \"Let's talk about tip money,\" so he'll know you're ready for another exchange at the country club this evening. By three-forty you're on your way to the Panda House Chinese Buffet, whose owners--Chen's aunt and uncle--comp Chen a takeout meal three times a week from the lunch leftovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're wolfing these down and checking notes to yourself on the phone when the door to the school basement opens and Caleb comes in. He stops on the topmost step. \"My favorite thing,\" he snorts. \"Coming in here and finding <i>Gary Chen</i> waiting for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Gary Chen's favorite thing too, lookin' up see your sad little douchey--\" You bite down on the rest of the insult, and stare at him critically. He's so mealy-mouthed and awkward, and so fucking <i>white.</i> Is there any way he could be that would make Chen like him, or at least tolerate him? You try to think of someone Chen likes and respects. There are lots of assholes he respects, at least to the extent he wouldn't piss them off if he could help it: mostly that's the jocks, whether bully boys like Black and Patterson and Lynch, or just the strong ones, like Cameron Huber and Laurent Delacroix. There are also those whose company he enjoys--like Adrian Semple and \"Maize\" Tsosie--that he doesn't respect. But both? About the only two names that come close to fulfilling both criteria are David Kirkham and Justin Roth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuckin' hard to tell Caleb to be more like them: strong, silent, and cool-headed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a fuckin' day and a half,\" you say more mildly, trying to put Gary into a small box where he can't get out. \"How was yours?\" You brought an extra container--Aunt Sue is always pushing leftovers on her nephew--and you shove it toward him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normal,\" he says, slowly sinking into a chair and sniffing at the food. \"I'm not sure I wanna know what counts as normal for Gary Chen. Or for Will Prescott these days.\" He discards the chopsticks for a plastic spork, and shoots you a dirty look at your (unintentional) snicker. \"So, are we millionaires yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're out three-twenty, in fact, which just about wipes out what I hoped to skim from this fucker.\" You tell him about Matthias. \"At least I've just about got him convinced he's going crazy and is just imagining that he used to be Gary Chen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a permanent change, is it, Will?\" Caleb asks uneasily. \"Because if it isn't, you're going to have to let him out to be himself again eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see what the magic book has to say about that,\" you mumble through a mouth full of spicy pork. \"Speaking of which--\" You tap at your phone's keypad, then push it toward him. \"That's the list of stuff for the next spell, at least that's how the internet translates it. Fuck, why couldn't the book have been written in Chinese instead of Latin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because then we'd <i>never</i> have gotten this far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck me,\" you gasp, and sit up straight. \"Can you guess what I just thought of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could, I'm sure I'd regret it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should slap one of these brain things onto Mr. Leavey. He's the Latin expert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's perfect, man! Stick his brain inside yours, or mine, and then we won't have to guess at these fucking translations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want <i>Leavey's</i> personality inside mine,\" Caleb exclaims. \"I think the fucker likes little girls, and I don't mean 'little' as in 'Yumi Saito' little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the name is like having a scab ripped away. \"Don't fucking mention--\" you snarl. \"You know what my mom-- Gary's mom, what she said and did last year when she saw Lin Pol courtside, the first time Lin went out as a cheerleader? She asked him how come he wasn't dating her. Jesus, bad enough being there with his mom, but then she drags him around to see Lin afterward, and basically shoves the two of them at each other, telling them they should go out on a date. And Lin, fucking cunt, she's nice about it, all dimples, and says yes. But the next day she tells Gary--who actually kind of got his hopes up--that he can tell his mom <i>anything</i> except that they had a good time on the date, because she'd dig her own ovaries out with a spoon before going out with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, Jesus, you're actually sympathizing with Chen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at where I'm sitting,\" you retort, and lean back to dump the last of the cold goop into your mouth. \"But we should definitely do that brain thing on Leavey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, while Caleb is still bitching about the idea, an even better idea comes to you. \"Gardinhire. Pack me up one of those things for Gardinhire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't know Latin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but he knows who he's distributing his excess ganja to. He's not smokin' it himself, and he ain't got that many friends who can be smokin' that much of it without it hurting their grades. He's definitely dealing it somewhere. And if we find out where--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not going into the <i>drug trade,</i> Will,\" says Caleb.</span></div></div>",

But if we know where Gardinhire is selling his extra shit, maybe we could squeeze in and take some of his trade, keep the cash that woulda been riding around on <i>his</i> hip.\" You run a fast calculation in your head using extremely liberal parameters. \"It could mean an extra twelve-hundred for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dollars?\" Caleb exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, gumdrops. Jesus, of course I mean dollars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of extreme cupidity comes to Caleb's face. You open the drawer where you put Thomason's and Mendoza's deposits. \"How much you owe your mom? Here.\" You give him five twenties. \"Pay her back whatever she needs, the rest is fuck the world money for you, an advance on my share of whatever we're gonna personally skim. You can have mine. And here's another two hundred, which I figure should about cover the cost of the materials we need for the next spell.

But I'll leave the brain-band on the front seat after I get it off Gardinhire. Are you gonna finish that?\" You point to the food you brought for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm suddenly not real hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More for me, then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nMondays, Wednesdays and Fridays kick your ass. You have to be up at the country club by four-fifty so you can start your shift at five; then comes six hours of work as a dishwasher and kitchen dogsbody; then home by eleven-thirty to do homework until probably two in the morning. So after gulping down the last of what Caleb left, you jump into it. Only the prospect of mind-raping Gardinhire offers any prospect of fun or reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to the club--a faux-colonial building west of the river with long, low wings that screen off the tennis courts and golf courses from public view--with a few minutes to spare; in the employee locker you quickly change into fresh, heavy cotton trousers, black loafers, and a white long-sleeve shirt; you also have to ditch the ski cap. Then into the kitchen, to run the first loads of plates and cutlery from the first of the night's five dinner seatings. A little after six you and Jose and Chris and Manny rush the McKinley dining room, stripping and replacing the table cloths, wiping down the chairs, fast-mopping the floor, and otherwise readying it for new settings, which the wait staff will take care of. Gardinhire is one of them, and he calls you over with a tilt of the head while hanging back by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInwardly, you seethe. Gardinhire is one of the AP assholes: tall, thin, privileged, and very, very white. His brown hair is thick without being unkempt, and like his best buddy Mansfield he looks down at the world along a slightly elevated nose. The best that you--Will Prescott--can say about him is that unlike most of his friends he doesn't go out of his way to be rude and condescending to his social inferiors. The best that you--Gary Chen--can say about him is that he's your single best customer. \"When's your smoke break,\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine thirty-five, same as always. Meet me at your car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that's the way I wanna do it tonight. You wanna do it some other way, find yourself another asshole to fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt nine-thirty, you and Manny take off for your daily smoke break, squatting behind the kitchen. He's a few years older than you, a high school dropout, but pretty cool in his way. You don't like the tats, though, which to your mind bespeak an idiot who's given up on striving for anything better than what he's got. You exchange a few abrupt words: He asks if you're watching the latest hot HBO show; \"Ain't got time,\" you reply. You're almost down to the end of your first cigarette when you spot Gardinhire out of the corner of your eye, moving through the employee parking lot. \"Tell Jose I gotta take a shit, man,\" you tell Manny as you take out another cigarette, and in the same motion pull out a tightly wrapped ten. \"A long, fat, wet one,\" you add as you hand both to your companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles, pockets the bill and puts the cigarette between his lips. \"Sure thing, soon as I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it for later, with the beer you're gonna buy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods again, and puts the cigarette over his ear, tucking his long hair over it. You wait until the door clicks shut, then trot over to the nearby dumpster. From just inside it you pull out a plastic bag: you'd taken the precaution of hiding the shit there in case Matthias got another bright idea to ransack your Jeep while you were working. A quick glance inside shows that the stuff is still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardinhire is leaning against his car--a used Audi, of course--but he gets in when you tell him to check his glove compartment. Through the open window you pass him the bag, and turn around to study the flood lights on the nearby tennis courts. A minute later he twitches the back of your shirt. You turn and take the bag from him--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--and in a continuous move slide the metal band you'd had in your pocket onto his forehead. He slumps to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long and nerve-wracking ten-minute period follows, during which you crouch by his car door. You pass the time by peering into the bag and doing a quick-and-dirty count of the money. Gardinhire dresses down at school, but he knows to be anal when dealing with you, and his payments--bills which are all used and frayed and rumpled--are always sorted and rubber-banded into standardized packs. Forty-eight hundred, it should be, and looks like it is. You'll know for sure when you count it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when the brain-band reappears on his forehead, and falls into your waiting hand, you happily reflect that you'll soon know where he gets it from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're break's only for ten minutes, Chen, not twenty,\" Jose warns you when you return to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to show you the turd next time I have to go?\" you ask. He glowers, but says nothing more about it, and you work extra hard and fast the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nGrandfather is in a bad mood the next morning, which puts everyone on edge. Not only do you have to deal with his physical needs of the morning, but he screams all during the meal; biting words are exchanged between mother, father and son during those moments when the old one isn't making noise. The mood is only slightly alleviated when you pass along forty dollars cash in \"tips\" from last night. But how the mood would change for the worse if they found the money you'd hidden inside the couch cushions last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo your nerves are ragged when you arrive at school. You've a headache from the morning's chores, and you've only five-and-a-half hours of sleep; you've also the stress of thinking of a new hiding place for your stash and cash. The solution comes when you see Caleb drive by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hang back until he's out of his car, and then you rush him, grabbing him from behind and hustling him toward the gym. He squawks, but you silence him with a curt word: \"Shut up, I'm trying to make this look good.\" You get a few looks as you grimly force him along toward the portables, but no one interferes. You push him into the one you've been using and close the door. \"First of all, did you try out Gardinhire's brain-band?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, fuck us, Will, when I tell you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it. Second, you bring a brain-band to use on Leavey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe makes a face, but nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, I was gonna fuck you up if you didn't. Meet me at his room after fifth, you know, in the middle of your big break. We'll get it on and off him then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's gonna be people around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure something out. Okay, last thing is I need you to meet me over at the clubhouse around five-thirty. I'll have some tools and shit, and we're gonna weld a strongbox onto the underside of your car, like Chen has on his. We'll use your wheels instead of mine as a ditching place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's eyes bug from his skull. \"I'm not gonna play drug mule for you, Will! If I get caught with-- Isn't it, like, a giant felony to be caught with that much weed on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but who's gonna think to search Caleb Johansson's shit for something like that?\" You grin and jab him in the breastbone. \"Name like Johansson, look like yours, the worst they're gonna think is you're smuggling weaponized lutefisk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not doing it, Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Then we'll get some more mask supplies and you can spend the next month pretending to be Martin Gardinhire.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now Caleb's jaw really does drop. \"What kind of sick, fucking fantasies do you think I've got going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's perfect,\" you say. \"We need a place to put the cash and stash, someplace Matthias--Chen, I mean--won't think of looking. Gardinhire is made to order. I mean, he's already holding thousands in cash each month, so we just add our pile to his. And fuck, I'm sure he's got folding money to spare we can skim off, what with the tips that fucker makes at the country club.\" You spit on the floor. \"And it's totes safe sticking him under your mask. He's already doing better than you in school, he can totally cover for you if we make him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb can only gasp like a landed fish. And you--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you were originally just going to use this idea as a bludgeon to force Caleb into holding the stuff in his car. But now that you've articulated this second idea, you realize you like it a lot more than the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Caleb, rather shrilly, starts to protest, you push in close to him. \"We're going to do this, man. It makes too much sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to make me?\" His voice quivers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ugh. He's starting to act like you're really Gary Chen and you're really threatening him.</i> Of course, you also realize that he's not wrong to, because that's pretty much what you are doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not going to make you do anything, but I want you to think about it, because it makes too much sense. You wanted to skim money off of Chen, right? So what's wrong with skimming money off of Gardinhire? He can afford to lose more, right? You been in his head, how much can he spare? Enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb doesn't disagree, but he still argues. \"Chen's making his money off <i>drugs,</i> man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So's Gardinhire, isn't he? I'm right about that, him and his friends aren't smokin' it all themselves? So how come he gets a pass and Chen doesn't? Because Gardinhire is fuckin'--\" You break off before one of Chen's usual resentments bursts out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we didn't do this to Chen because we wanted his money, we did it so he wouldn't kill you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's how we got into it,\" you shrug. \"Here's how we make it pay off better for us. We hijack Gardinhire, for as long as I'm playing Chen, and skim off <i>all</i> of his profits, maybe invest some of his fuck-around money in our projects too. How much is he making?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's making enough. But how long are you gonna be playing <i>Chen</i>? Because this is sounding more and more like--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play Chen until I don't gotta anymore, till we find something in the book that means we can let him and Black and Matthias loose. So there's an incentive to get to work. How much can we get from Gardinhire? What's his set up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean who's he--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah. Who's he sharing the shit with, who's he selling it to, how much is he making? You know, the fucking <i>set up.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get short with me, Will. Okay, about a third of it he's sharing with his friends. Mansfield, Kirk, Garner--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marc Garner? Eva and Jessica's brother? You're fuckin' with me, Garner's using?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once a week. Saturdays, they all get together, the AP crowd, and they have a reefer party--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>shit!</i>\" you howl. \"They don't call it a 'reefer party', do they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What <i>should</i> they call it? But they get together at Kelsey's place, the bunch of them--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horizon tilts. \"They're doin' it at one of their <i>houses?</i>\" you exclaim. The world is making less and less sense, and it's pissing you off more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelsey's folks turn a blind eye. But it's pretty much the whole AP crowd, like I said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Gardinhire collects for them, right?\" you ask. \"So they don't have to soil themselves with Chen directly?\" You spit again on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you stop that, it's freaking me out. But they don't even know where Gardinhire's getting it from, they only know he can get it, so they put in their shares and he buys for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he buys for more than them, right?\" This is what you really want to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you'll love this.\" He backs away. \"Don't hurt me, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What's he doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's selling nine ounces a month to Trantham.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the floor does lurch beneath your feet. \"Trantham, <i>Chris Trantham,</i> Chris Trantham the motherfucker who does dishes with me <i>every fucking Monday and Friday</i> at the country club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Gardinhire just puts the stuff in his club locker, and the next day Trantham gives him thirty-one-fifty for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run the sums in your head. \"Thirty-one-fifty gross? That's twenty-seven dimes in profit! Just for holding it overnight at the <i>fucking country club?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's not all. He's been telling his AP posse he's paying four hundred an ounce for their stuff\u2014I mean, that's the rate Chen charges when selling eighths individually, so if they ask around that's what they'll hear. But since he's been buying in bulk from you at three-twenty an ounce, he's been collecting another four hundred in profit off his friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure inside your head is so great your ears close up. <i>Fucking Gardinhire is making six hundred and seventy a month, </i>almost as much as you make after loan payments,<i> just for picking up and moving a couple of plastic baggies between lockers.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dance up and down in a fury, punching the air. \"Fucker! Oh, we are <i>so</i> fucking him over! You're gonna put his fucking mask on, Johansson, and you're gonna--! Nine months I been dealing with that goat-sucking bastard! I want seven thousand outta his trust fund, cover my loss on his carrying trade, plus a penalty! Then--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not <i>your</i> loss, Will,\" Caleb shouts, and now he looks deeply alarmed. \"It's Chen's. You're not turning into Chen, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! But the fucker's been cheating Chen! He could have paid off that fucking loan already if--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch your breath, close your eyes, get a grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, this isn't our business. But at the end, when we sort it all out--\" The tremble you've been suppressing explodes in a violent shudder. \"We'll figure out a way to make it all come out <i>fair!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe bell rang while you were arguing with Caleb, so you're a few minutes late for English. You slouch through class and concentrate on figuring out Gardinhire's various angles. You'll have him under your thumb soon enough, but you still seethe to think of the way he took advantage of--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, God damn it, Caleb is right, he didn't take advantage of <i>you,</i> he took advantage of Gary Chen, a guy you've hated and feared for years. You ought to be on Gardinhire's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you aren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ought to be thinking about how to get your own supply sold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're not. You're thinking about Trantham. He goes to Eastman, the other high school in town, and he must be dealing there. Chen never thought him the sharpest tool in the kit, more like the kind of guy who uses his own product, and he must be making some pretty thin margins if he's buying from a middleman who's buying from you. Of course, there's no reason to help him out by selling to him at a lower price than Gardinhire was giving him, if you forced the latter out as a middleman. But maybe it would be worth more to find a partner at Eastman, someone to replace both Gardinhire and Trantham, that way all of their profits would flow to you and this new partner, who'd be better able than Trantham to grow the business over there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who at Eastman to use? A brain-band on Trantham might give you a lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nWith that line of thought rounded off for the moment, you return to planning some more local sales. There's no point trying to sell any to Garner--though you have to laugh privately when you see him second period, playing the straight-arrow boss of the soccer team--and you don't want to fuck up the team by dealing to anybody else. You hear that the Molester sometimes uses, but you don't want to be in business with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have some business with Roth after third period: he passes you a book, and inside it you find five twenties. You like the implication that Small is covering at least part of the cost, and you invite yourself along, to hang out behind the music wing with Roth and Small, sharing gossip about the orchestra and other bullshit; and it doesn't take much pressure or teasing from you to get Small to agree to buy two eighths for the upcoming weekend: you'll make the trade when you see him in Physics. But you're only twenty minutes with them; on a subsequent circuit of the grounds you place an eighth with Cody Wooten and get a promise he'll buy three more tomorrow for himself and some friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifth period is the blowoff Foundations of Marketing class, which is filled with dipshit freshmen and sophomores, and a couple of seniors (like yourself) looking for an easy grade.  Late last year, Evans claimed to have sold a joint to Darrell Parson, who sits in the back. So you slide into the desk in front of him. During class you pass him a note: a drawing of a marijuana leaf, followed by a question mark. At the end of class, you turn to cock an eyebrow at him. He shakes his head while avoiding your eye. \"Sure?\" you softly ask. He shakes his head again, but weakly. You shrug. It's okay, you know where to find him later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen comes math. But first you need to stop at Mr. Leavey's room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Caleb is already waiting outside Mr. Leavey's classroom when you arrive. \"This is a bad idea,\" he says nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance into the room. It's empty, except for the teacher, who is just turning away from erasing the board. \"Nah, it'll be easy,\" you mutter. \"Gimme the band. Come on, hurry,\" you urge as he fumbles in his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeavey is a dapper little man, with graying hair and horn-rimmed glasses, and he wears a bow-tie. It's probably the latter that's led people to make \"pedophile\" jokes about him, for it gives him an odd daintiness that one might associate with a collector of dollhouses--or a collector of those who like to play with dollhouses. He looks up from his desk with a dim and uncomprehending smile as you approach. \"Yo, Mr. Leavey, think fast,\" you say, and strike quickly. The metal band briefly sizzles on his forehead and vanishes. His eyes go out of focus, and his head falls forward into your hands. You arrange it so that it looks like he's taking a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb turns green as you roughly pull him over so he can help block the view of the teacher; together, you lean against the desk, you with arms insouciantly folded while Caleb more stiffly rests his skinny ass on the edge of the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait a terribly long time. Students soon begin to file in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of them just sit in their chairs and do their best to ignore you and Caleb and the teacher. Some crane their neck to see what's going on, but you daunt them with a glare; and, anyway, whatever the teacher is doing with his head on the desk is not their business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one guy tries to make it his business: James Lamont. \"What are you doing here?\" he bluntly asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' your sister,\" you retort. He takes the hint, and retreats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell eventually rings. The students, who have been talking quietly, fall silent. Everyone turns toward the front, and they watch expectantly. You can practically hear the sweat dripping off Caleb. You just smile and ignore the stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you've calculated that the brain-band <i>must</i> have reappeared, you glance behind at the teacher. Sure enough, the band is on the desk, wedged between it and his forehead. You pull it out and slip it into your shirt pocket. \"Look after him, okay,\" you mutter in Caleb's ear, and give him an encouraging clap in the shoulder. You don't look back as you saunter out into hall; then you run hard for Muniz's AP Stat class. He has a few sarcastic words for you after you've puffed and panted through the doorway, but you fall into a chair in the back without taking umbrage. You steal a glance at the strip: ROBERT EDMOND LEAVEY, it says in glowing blue letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSo you're feeling good when you head into seventh period. You'd already picked up two eighths for Small, and you have a third on you that you weren't able to place with Wooten. It works out: Jonas Martin catches sight as you're making the sale to Small, and you bluff him into taking the third eighth by telling him his best bud Luke Bennett has agreed to go in halvsies on one; the two ballplayers might be pissed when they find out you lied to them, but the fact that Jonas so easily agrees, and even forks over the full cost, suggests they won't be too pissed. You enter the two of them down in your phone list as possible marks for development and exploitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that puts a swagger in your stride when you head into last period: Orchestra, in which you play the viola. Eva Garner plays in that section too. You were too angry and distracted yesterday to do anything but mutely play the notes set before you, but now you glance slyly at Eva as you sit down next to her. \"I heard you have a new boyfriend,\" you say in a teasing leer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's news to me,\" she says after a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you and Johansson aren't doin' the nasty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hits you, and it's not a friendly punch either. \"Shut up, you sick--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just yanking you, girl,\" you laugh. \"You could do a lot worse than Johansson, you know. You could be doin' Pruitt over there.\" You jerk your chin at Brent Pruitt, a skinny, geeky, wet-looking violin player. \"But you could do a lot better, too.\" You grin. \"Give me a chance, show you how gentle I can stroke your strings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns away. A few minutes later Mrs. Heinz takes the podium and calls everyone to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nProbably you shouldn't have teased Eva that way, but you decide it probably doesn't matter. So what if she decides that Caleb Johansson just didn't measure up? Pretty soon Caleb is going to be playing someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich reminds you that you need to get that set up. You can take care of that while running some other errands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, first thing after racing away from school, you swing by the elementary school and pick up the packages that are due at the university. It takes you an hour of driving around to get them dropped off to the four buyers, and you're pleased to see that you actually under-estimated the demand at the house where Ragland lives. \"Yeah, we got a new roomie, took the old bedroom up in the loft,\" he tells you as you stand in a dirty living room. \"Man, he puts it away like\u2014 Better add, like, at least another ounce to what we've been\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can do,\" you promise him, and you take the extra he buys off you out of Whitmore's package. That sends you back to the school to collect more from the individual baggies. You run into Caleb there. You just want to get what you need and get out, but he insists on bitching about the thing with Leavey. \"I can't believe you fucking ran out on me,\" he yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\" you ask, while paying only a little attention. At first you think you're just not hearing him, and turn around only after measuring out another ounce from the stash. His face is red. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" he admits. \"I ran out right after you did. But I bet anything Leavey's gonna have it in for us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we care? We don't have him for any classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if tells some of the other teachers\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he gets me in trouble. You won't get in trouble, you're gonna be Gardinhire by tomorrow afternoon. Thursday at the latest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb changes color. \"I was hoping you'd forgotten that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not likely. Hey, write down a list of what you remember we need to make a mask. I got the book at my place but I don't wanna stop back there before picking up supplies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to make it,\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like the way he asks it, and you look at him sharply. \"Ain't no way I can make those things at my place. You're gonna have to do it here. I want it done tonight, okay, and no excuses tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I do have a life,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the next twenty-four hours. Then you're gonna have a different one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nCaleb remembers some ingredients that you forgot, and has forgotten some that you remember, and after getting the last of the college transactions done\u2014which leaves you driving around town with more than seventeen thousand dollars in cash. You don't have it for long, though. Your last stop is a billiard hall downtown. The sun is slanting low as you park in the alley behind it. Nervously, you rap on the metal door leading into the back, and a man in a dirty white apron lets you in. The back half of the building is divided into a small warren of storerooms and offices shared by the billiard room and the bar and the barbeque pit that occupy the converted two-story warehouse space. But you know how to find your way around. Chen has been coming here for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCountry music filters in from somewhere, along with the sharp clatter of billiard balls hitting each other. The door to Karol Mathis's office is open, but he's not inside. You hunt around, squeezing past open crates containing beer and cola bottles, and you even look out on the floor of the billiard hall itself, though you understand that Mathis is rarely to be found there. You finally track him down in the kitchen of his restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's a small man with a paunch; his arms are brown and leathery and covered with wiry hairs. The hair on his head is curly but closely cropped and gray. His eyes are an indefinable color, something between hazel and light blue; they seem empty and soulless. That could describe his whole demeanor, for Karol Mathis never blinks or raises his voice. He looks over now as you appear, and seems no more interested in you than in the pile of unscrubbed potatoes by your elbow; he returns to talking quietly to his cook, who is complaining very volubly in a thick accent about something you can't make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Mathis says a few very quiet words to the man, which seems to satisfy him. Then Mathis turns to you. \"Chen,\" is all he says, and you step aside to let him pass, then follow him back to his tiny office. It contains a small, scarred desk and two metal filing cabinets and a small bookshelf. There are no electronics except for an ancient calculator. As he sits in his chair, you set a satchel of money in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opens it and counts it out very carefully. It takes a long time, since it's mostly in fives and tens and twenties. You keep your eyes locked on the desk before you. Mathis once caught Chen glancing around, and had said a very sharp word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat done, he takes out a ledger, enters some numbers, and turns it toward you. You write Gary's name beside the number 19,000.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch is the power of compound interest at Mathis's rates, that even at four thousand a month, it will be two years before Chen can pay that sum off.</span></div></div>",

He looks at you expectantly. \"I need five hundred,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe counts out five hundred in small bills and hands it to you. He again counts the remainder, and scrawls the amount\u201413,285\u2014in bold numbers onto a bill pad like they use in cafes. He shows it to you, and you nod. \"How much more will you be depositing?\" he asks in a voice so soft you can barely hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another two thousand, probably,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not growing the business,\" he says in a very off-hand way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" you protest. \"I've spotted a seven hundred market I can go after. I just have to make sure it's actually there. Some of my regular guys might have to go a little short while I\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your board of directors, Chen,\" he says. \"I don't want to know.\" He turns away in manner that tells you you've been dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now you don't have to worry about the real Chen getting his hands on a gigantic wad of cash, You've also disposed of all but four ounces of the monthly stash, and some of that will go to Evans tomorrow. You let out a huge sigh of relief as you get back into the Jeep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThat leaves you another hour for shopping for mask supplies before you have to be home for dinner. You barely slide in under the deadline, and Mrs. Chen's temper\u2014already stretched past the breaking point by an argument with the nurse\u2014isn't improved when you announce you have to head out to study with friends. \"We've got a test coming up,\" you plead. \"The material is kicking our asses\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't curse!\" she shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all trying to figure it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowns fiercely. \"I want to see your work when you get back. I don't want these boys wasting your time.\" Her eyebrows arch. \"You are meeting with boys, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to that cheerleader? Lin Pol?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Christ!</i> \"It didn't work out, I told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's why it wasn't a good date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last you manage to escape back to the elementary school. Caleb hunches his shoulders as you barrel in. \"Did you have a look over the stuff for the next spell?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It was a waste of time, you had it all translated good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Well, now that we know, go around tomorrow after school and pick the stuff up. In the meantime\u2014\" You set bags of mask supplies in front of him. \"Take care of this, will you? I got homework to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not after tomorrow you won't. Well, not <i>yours.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to keep joking about it,\" he says as he empties the sacks. \"Anyway, I'm not leaving Gardinhire in a hole. Physics and Stats,\" he adds when you ask him what the homework is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle Stats for you. Maybe Physics too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm taking AP Stat now, you know. You're only taking\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chen's taking AP Stat?\" Caleb's eyebrows go up and down and side to side. \"Oh right,\" he adds after a moment's thought. \"Look at him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck is that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Caleb, you're able to grab one of his arms before he can pull his eyelids sideways into slits. Doubtless he doesn't understand the enormous favor you've done by stopping him from making that gesture, for you'd be far more furious if he had succeeded in making it. As it is, he howls as you wrench his arm behind his back. \"You think it's fucking genetics or something? Oh yeah, it's Chen, obviously he's a math whiz, probably a programming whiz too. Ain't no fucking way he can laid, though, 'cos\u2014\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anger swells mightily, but you catch yourself before it breaks over you, and release him. \"Sorry man,\" you say in a trembling voice as your best friend turns hurt, resentful eyes on you. \"The thing about these brain bands is\u2014 Well, part of what makes them such a perfect disguise is that the instincts sometimes don't wait for you before kicking in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not so sure about that,\" Caleb says as he rubs his shoulder. \"I didn't get carried away when I had <i>your</i> brain band on the other night, and I sure as hell didn't go out and molest any little girls when I had\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww, don't talk about Leavey, okay? I dunno, maybe it's the combination of face and clothes and everything else. Look, lemme just do your homework for you, and we'll call it all good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grumbles but agrees. You get far enough that you're not in a hole when you get home, and can do the two hours of practice on the viola that Mrs. Chen did <i>not</i> forget you owed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe next day dawns earlier than it ought to, thanks to a screaming fit from the old man. He's so bad\u2014so physically argumentative\u2014that he leaves no time for any of the family to get into a bad mood over him. In fact, his fit is so bad that both the Chens send you out to school early, even before they've finally dealt with him. You've a gnawing sickness in your stomach, for you wonder if they're preparing to do something to him that they don't want you to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou restock your hiding place in the library, then hunker down next to B wing with a cigarette to await customers. Your spot gives you an unobstructed view of the portables, so you can see quite clearly when Steve Patterson rounds into view, hustling a victim toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's funky,</i> you think. Oh, not that Patterson should be taking a victim there, but he's not in pre-class basketball practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice the victim. It's Dane Matthias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoot to your feet and toss the unfinished cigarette away. You remember Patterson threatening you when you were under Dane's mask. Has the new Dane unwittingly crossed the line Patterson drew with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey disappear around a corner; you move carefully around to get them back into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatterson has Dane pressed against a wall. His back is to you, but Dane is turned in your direction, and even at this distance you can read the smoldering fury on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shifts to one side in a way that you recognize, but that Patterson won't. Time seems to slow: you jump forward, running toward the pair, but it's like your feet are caught in a mire. You've only take a few steps when Dane sucker punches Patterson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ballplayer staggers, surprised, and Dane follows with more blows. But Matthias isn't as strong as he needs to be, and Patterson is very big and sturdy. Matthias needs to push him to the ground, but he fails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you're between them. You throw your entire body against Matthias, knocking him back against the wall, and with two fast, hard blows you double him over. Then you get behind him and get his arms locked. You feel the blows through Matthias as Patterson delivers them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he steps back. \"Get the fuck outta here, Chen,\" the ballplayer says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" you jeer. \"Looks to me like you need some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is between me and him,\" says Patterson coldly. \"You better hope I <i>don't</i> have to come looking for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug as you release Matthias, who slips to the ground. \"I'll be around the corner if you need rescuing again.\" You strut past Patterson, half-expecting a blow as you pass. But it doesn't come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch from the edge of the first portable as Patterson leans back in over Matthias. By his face the latter still has a lot of fight in him, but he's too hurt to do anything. You can't hear any words that get exchanged, but you're sure Patterson is threatening Dane, the way he threatened you last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt disquiets you: Last week Patterson was warning Dane to keep away from Gordon, apparently under the impression that Dane had been getting Gordon high. Of course the captain of the basketball team won't have sobered up: it's still Dane under a mask of Gordon. So is Patterson just taking out his frustrations on the guy he blames for Gordon's sudden goofiness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr did he catch Dane talking to Gordon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's the possibility that chills you. \"Gordon\" tried talking to you when you were still wearing Dane's mask; it seems likely he tried talking to \"Dane\" after you'd moved on to Chen. If they're comparing notes ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Gary Chen realizes he's not the only one who thinks he's suffered a body swap ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're pulled out of these thoughts as Patterson strides past you. He doesn't say anything, or even look in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Matthias, who is sitting on the grass, back against the wall of the portable. His face is drawn, but there's a smirk on it as he stares back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to him, shaking your head. \"Fuckin' stupid of you, Matthias, gettin' Patterson pissed at you. Dude don't take shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDane just stares at you from under hooded lids. \"How'd you do it, fucker?\" he asks in a soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what. You're doin' pretty good, got everyone fooled, it looks like. Almost had <i>me</i> goin'. But there's gotta be, like, better assholes you can do it to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill settles over you. <i>So much for making him think he's just gone crazy.</i> But there's no way you can confess anything to him. \"Lay off the loco weed, Matthias. It's making you loco.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By eight-thirty you've had twice as much excitement as you think you can stand for the whole day, and that doesn't take into account some excitement you've got planned for tonight. Fortunately, the rest of the school day goes smoothly, though you skate through it on high alert. Tanner Evans finds you early, and with a lot of sniveling asks for the six eighths he's supposed to distribute; you hand them over; and you send Caleb a text\u2014which he acknowledges\u2014about picking up the supplies for the next spell and meeting you at the school by six o'clock; and that's pretty much it, beyond placing three eights with Cody Wooten and Spencer Osbourne and two more with Alex Massey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's one of your days to work at the country club, which means it's one of your days to pick up supper from Aunt Sue, and you pick up enough for Caleb as well. He's not in a cheerful mood when he shows up with a couple of sacks of supplies, but he's not pissed off. \"How much did it cost?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna receipt? You want change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I told you to keep the balance. I's just curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple of hundred,\" he says. \"That was some pretty weird crap, lots of volatile chemicals. You got the spell? I wanna see how they're all supposed to be combined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bring it in tomorrow, we'll get started then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't get started now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shovel some food into your mouth and push a cardboard container toward him. \"Nah, we got one more ingredient we gotta pick up,\" you mumble through a full mouth. \"I didn't tell you. Which reminds me.\" You fish out your phone, and while balancing some noodles on a chopstick with one hand you punch up the number for the country club. \"Yo, Jose, this is Gary. Man, I'm super sick or something, I'm not gonna be able to make it in tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJose yells at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame me, blame this fucking stomach bug. I mean, you want me to come in, I guess I can come in, if you want me hurling all over the dinnerware.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yells at you some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So get Valencia to cover for me, one of those guys. I'll switch days with 'em, give 'em a ticket saying <i>I'll</i> cover for 'em the next time <i>they're</i> sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJose grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, bro, you're awesome. You're an <i>asshole,</i>\" you add after you've got the phone off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't <i>look</i> sick,\" Caleb observes as you slurp down the hanging wad of noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta get out of work, but I gotta get outta the house, too, so this is like stomping on two snails with one shoe. Shit, man, I don't got any free time in my schedule for anything like\u2014 Oh hey, you and your mom gotta coupla shovels at your house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad. Then take your dinner with you while we run by Walmart or something. We need to pick up, like, a hundred sandbags or something, and we'll just get some shovels while we're at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandbags?\" Caleb asks dumbly, and doesn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move it, Johansson. Sun'll be down soon, and I don't wanna make a late night of it where we're going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"I'm not going in there,\" Caleb says. \"I'm not helping you dig up\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not digging anything up,\" you tell him. He folds his arms truculently. \"We just gotta get some dirt, man. We can get it from just inside the wall. I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>think?</i>\" He turns, and even in the dark of the cab you can see him thrusting an unhappy lower lip at you. \"What did the book say, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember the Latin, but it translated pretty clearly as 'soil dug up from a graveyard'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're getting into necromancy now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't say we had to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's gonna have to come from of a grave, Will,\" Caleb says. \"Why else would it want dirt from a graveyard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll find a grave close to the wall. Now come on.\" You open the Jeep door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will, I'm not\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of his refusal is lost in the sound of you slamming the door, but you're not going to let him sit on his ass while you do all the work. You go around to the other said and haul him out. \"Get the fucking shovels,\" you tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's dark\u2014it had better be, since you don't want anyone seeing you\u2014and you're parked at the corner of the Masonic cemetery farthest from any street. There are a few low clouds, but it's mostly clear, though the lights of the city have completely washed out the stars in the sky. It's not cold, it's not windy, the only sound is the grumble of traffic from a hundred yards away as the occasional car drives past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're breaking into a graveyard. It doesn't have to <i>be</i> spooky for you to feel a little jumpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much dirt do we have to get?\" Caleb asks unhappily as he follows you over the low wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four hundred pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four hundred--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, keep your voice down, fucker. We got a hundred sandbags, we don't even gotta fill all of them. I'll start digging, and you hold the bags open for me.\" You test a spot on the turf with the tip of the new shovel, and drive it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we even gonna be able to get four hundred pounds of dirt into your car?\" Caleb asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll make a couple of trips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be out past ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we better get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nCaleb winds up being late getting home\u2014seriously late, because it takes a very long time to fill up the bags. You don't even get all of them filled before you have to pile some of them into the Jeep and drive it back to the elementary school. Caleb helps you offload them into the basement, then goes home. You return to the cemetery, and after a lot of feverish work you get the last of ninety bags tied up. That should be four hundred pounds, plus some extra. It takes you two more trips to get it all back to the school, and by then <i>you're</i> late getting home. Late and filthy and sweaty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have some luck though, for you're able to get into the house and into the bathroom and undressed and into the shower before you're cornered by the woman of the house. She's not shy about interrupting you in the altogether, and she yells at you for being late, but at least you don't look like you returned from manual labor. And, again, you're able to buy a little peace with forty bucks of \"tip money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you ache all over the next day at school. And when you catch sight of Caleb in the halls, he gives you a pale and dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"I shouldn't be doing this,\" Molly Shaw says. She sucks very delicately on the end of the joint, and coughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is my baby mama worried about getting in trouble?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your baby mama,\" she says, and punches you hard in the arm. You gasp theatrically and fall to the side. \"I'm not <i>anyone's</i> baby mama,\" she adds sulkily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could be. You could be mine.\" You lean in close to her with a small leer. She looks back at you with distaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're sitting out past the portables, close to the horticulture sheds and as far away from the school building as you can get while still being on school property. Westside backs into an agricultural pasture on this side, and you're sitting with her under a tree that droops over a culvert. This is the place that kids go when they <i>really</i> don't want to be found, which means almost everyone gives it a wide berth since it's a dangerous spot to stumble over anyone. It's fifth period, and you're skipping Marketing so you can spend this hour with people more entertaining than Mr. Peters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, that only means Molly Shaw, who you'd connected with after first period. But you're expecting more people to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to your friends?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" She takes another very small and delicate hit. \"I'm not going to finish this without them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you went in three ways with 'em to buy it,\" you agree. \"But they can be late. I like being here with you, just the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peers at you around a thin stream of smoke, which makes her look cross-eyed. Molly has a broad, freckled face, and her hair is pulled back in a small, tight bun that make her face look even bigger and more frog-like than it usually does. There's no reason she should act like she's deserving of better than you. And it's not like she keeps herself aloof from the guys. Why, you heard her last scare was connected to\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a discount,\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down her nose at you. \"A little fun like you want to have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jesus, is she proposing to sell herself so cheaply? For seventeen dollars?</i> \"You'd have fun too, babe,\" you reply. \"Why should I give you a discount on a straight-up fair trade like\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\" she says, and takes another hit. She overdoes it, and falls into a long cough, which she tries delicately covering with her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me that before you drop it.\" You pinch the joint away from her, but hold it away from you. She's fallen into a serious little fit, and begins to turn pink. You snort softly to yourself and check your phone messages. Sure enough, the two people you expect to turn up are scheduled to appear. In fact, one of them has just texted to say he's in position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly finally recovers, and takes the joint back from you. But she only does this to pinch it out. \"I should wait for Faith and Mindy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything you want to do while we wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returns your steady gaze with one of her own. Then she shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to lean in for a kiss when you catch a movement out of the corner of your eye: Martin Gardinhire appears around the corner of the farthest portable. It looks like he hasn't spotted you.</span></div></div>",

Or not.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll catch up to Faith at the start of eighth period,\" you tell her. \"It's fifty, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't forget,\" says Molly, and doesn't even look back in your direction. You swing your pack onto your shoulder and sprint off toward the portables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardinhire is just about to the other end of the portables on his way back to the main building when you catch sight of him. You loose a teeth-jarring whistle at his back. He turns; you jerk your head at a nearby portable\u2014the one you keep using. \"In here.\" He stares as you open the door to it, then slowly trudges back the way he'd come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's dim and musty inside\u2014an air that you've gotten familiar with over the past week\u2014and the floorboards creak under your boots. You drop your pack into a desk and unzip it. You grimace and glance around, looking for some kind of distraction that you can use. It's remarkable enough that you could cajole Gardinhire to meet you here, since you've as little to do with each other as possible on school grounds, so you've laid no plans for getting the mask on his face. You glance at the broken ventilation cover. <i>Use that again? But with what excuse?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Gardinhire comes in. He stops in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's wearing a light blue button-down shirt that drapes over the tops of his knee-length khaki shorts, and even in the dark of the portables he doesn't take his shades off. \"Shit, man, how can you see through those things?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to talk about?\" he asks. He's got his hands in his pockets. <i>Dude is scared,</i> you think. <i>But he's trying to play it cool.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in and close the door. I ain't talkin' to you where no one can hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't immediately move. Either he's thinking of bolting, or he's trying to untangle all those negatives in what you just said. But he does shuffle in, finally. He leaves the door open, though. With a sigh you brush past him and shut it. You feel him stiffen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, man,\" you say, improvising. \"I don't wanna bust up your business, but I know that you don't use. At least, I know you don't use all the shit I been selling you. You're dealin' on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit. Then you tell me what you're doin' with it, if you're not dealin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't say anything not right away. \"I've been sharing with some friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a lotta friends. And you gotta buy their friendship by comping them weed? Five thousand a month? Shit, man, what I could do with an allowance like you apparently got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They pay me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Adam's apple bobbles lightly. \"Why do you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's bad for my business if your friends are getting a discount relative to what everyone else is giving me. If word gets around that Gardinhire can set you up for less\u2014 You <i>are</i> setting your friends up for less than they'd pay if they came to me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he says. \"I don't think so. You charge fifty dollars for a joint, don't you? That's what I've been charging them.\" He seems to realize too late that's not an admission he should have made, for he shifts on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you're making a profit,\" you softly observe. \"That's okay, man. That's fair. You've tapped a market I can't reach. But you see, don't you, that that makes us partners, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't\u2014\" he croaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're partners, because I ain't givin' you no discount, not if you're just usin' with your friends. Are you just collecting on behalf of your friends, and buying for them from me? In that case, you pay four hundred an ounce, same as I charge any other fucker at this school. But if you're my partner, if you're dealing right alongside me, then it's okay that you're paying me only thirty-two dimes an ounce instead of forty. The difference, that's your commission for handling that part of the market for me. Shit, I'm fuckin' impressed if that's what you're doin'. I got other guys doin' the same, buyin' at thirty-two and sellin' at forty. But I had to ask them to go in with me. But you? Fuck me, Princetonian gonnabe Martin Gardinhire set <i>himself</i> up without my needing to say a word. I'm getting a chubby I'm so fuckin' ripped by what you done. But those other guys, they're my partners. And so are you, since you're doin' the same thing they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardinhire's nostrils flare. \"If you want to look at it that way,\" he says, and his voice trembles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter how I wanna look at it, that's the way it is,\" you say. \"Either you start paying four hundred an ounce\u2014right now, in which case tomorrow you bring me twelve hundred, to make up the difference on what you paid me Monday and what you <i>should</i> be paying me. Or we're partners. Which one is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe keeps very stiff and erect, hardly moving, hands still in his pockets. His shoulders shrug. \"Okay then. Uh, partners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin. \"Good. Now, the thing is that my other guys, they tell me who their market is, and I tell them about mine. That way we don't accidentally get in each other's way. So\u2014\" You reach into your backpack, feeling your way around the mask, to pull out a notebook and a pencil. \"You write down who you've been selling too. I'll write down who I sell to. That way we don't get in each other's way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think\u2014 I mean, my guys aren't the kind of guys that, uh, that you\u2014\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, he's trying to say and not say at the same time that you don't mix with his crowd so you're not likely to try selling to them. Inwardly, you bridle, but outwardly you remain calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, see, here's the thing,\" you say. \"I don't know that you're serving your market well. Maybe you're leaving some money on the table by not talking to everyone you could be talking to. I got a pretty good idea who you're selling to. If you don't tell me who they are, I <i>am</i> going to go nosing around to see if there's any crumbs you're not picking up. So you <i>need</i> to tell me.\" You push the paper and pencil at him. \"Sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe does, though it sure looks like his knees don't want to bend. He takes the desk in front of the seat where you put your backpack, so his back is to you. And now he takes those sunglasses off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly, you pull out the mask and reach around to press it to his face from behind. Gently, you let his head drop to the desk. You've already got your phone out, and with your thumb you dial Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Jesus, is that the bell?\" Caleb groans. \"I'm going to be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we're all going to be late. Stop thinking about yourself,\" you retort. \"Anyway, it's not the bell. Christ, we've still got thirty minutes at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb is in Gardinhire's clothes, but he's not in his mask yet, for it's not come out of your latest victim. Together, you are struggling to get him into Caleb's clothes. Johansson is tying one of his shoes, when he glances up and does a double-take over your shoulder. \"Who the fuck?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him, then whirl to look over your shoulder. A dark shape vanishes from the dirty window. \"Who was that?\" you ask Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't see. They just\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't hear the rest. You're at the door in five strides, wrenching it open. Outside, you look wildly around. No one is in sight. You pound down the lane toward the main building, but when you're free of the portables you see no one running away. You circle through the portables again, but catch no sight of anyone, except for Molly and Faith Becker and Mindy McAdams, sitting under that tree way off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you catch them?\" Caleb asks when you get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't even see them. Jesus, is that the mask finally?\" You lift it from Gardinhire's face and give it to Caleb. \"Get back across the way, get into it. Remember, you have to seal it up first. You <i>did</i> remember to bring that stuff, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got it,\" he says impatiently as he goes to the door. \"Just don't be in a hurry to get <i>that</i> guy finished up. I'll need a little while to get things ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you impatiently crouch by Gardinhire, waiting for signs of returning consciousness while fiddling with Caleb's mask. Who was at the window? Just a random passerby? Someone trying to spy on you? Could it have been \"Dane\"? Or even \"Gordon\"? How much did they see? You don't much mind being a target; with Gary Chen's guts, you think you can survive anything they might try throwing at you. But if they figure out that Caleb is involved\u2014 Well, you don't have the same faith in Caleb's ability to withstand pressure, in either his own form or that of Martin Gardinhire. Fuck, you didn't even have to raise your voice, and you were scaring the shit out of Gardinhire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, speaking of whom, his eyelids are starting to twitch.</i> You drop Caleb's mask onto him. His body briefly wavers, like it's a reflection in a pool that's had a rock dropped into it, and then it's Caleb Johansson lying on the floor next to you. He's breathing, but is otherwise perfectly still. Quietly, you pack up your bag and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the narrow lane you find someone who looks like Martin Gardinhire laying in the middle of the opposite portable. You pinch his nose shut. He chokes and sits up with a hard start. \"Wake up, asshole,\" you say. \"Better get to where you belong before someone tries stealing his old life back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" he gasps, and rubs an eye. \"Where am I supposed to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me, that's your business. But meet me at the clubhouse at four. We got a new spell to start, <i>and</i> some old business to talk about.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You leave Caleb to get oriented inside his new mask, for you don't want to be seen with \"Gardinhire\", and you also don't want to be around the portables when the real Gardinhire wakes up in his new situation. The latter should be able to find his way around, for though you did not put any kind of brain-band inside Caleb's mask, you did put his class schedule and locker info at the front of his notebook. If Gardinhire is as smart as he is supposed to be\u2014something you're not quite prepared to bet on, not after talking to him this afternoon\u2014he shouldn't have any problem getting into Caleb's school life even without the benefits of your friend's memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment of crisis comes pretty quickly, and you and Caleb are both witness to it. Sixth period finds you and the new Martin Gardinhire in AP Statistics. He is in one corner of the room talking quietly with Marc Garner, the way Gardinhire is supposed to be doing, with a smug grin on his face behind those shades; you're in the opposite corner, in the back, slouching with David Kirkham; all parties have a clear view of the door when Caleb Johansson peeks into the room and stares at the figure sitting where Gardinhire should be sitting; where Martin Gardinhire in fact <i>is</i> sitting. You only watch from the corner of your eye and are careful not to react when he turns to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kirkham notices. \"Faggot in the door's makin' eyes at you, man,\" he says. So you give Johansson a direct look, and when he doesn't break off staring at you, you blow him a hard kiss. He jerks backward, and hurries away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask him out, man,\" Kirkham teases. \"If he's hot for you, take him. Not like you're gonna get any pussy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only gotta ask and you'll lemme in <i>your</i> pussy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nMaybe Gardinhire <i>is</i> smart enough to go along with a gag: You make a point of passing Caleb's locker between the remaining classes, and each time you find a guy who looks like Johansson at it. You feel a little sorry for him the second time you check, for Tilley is leaning next to him, bantering about something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school lets out you have to run an errand for your mom in answer to a text she sent, and it's just as well that you had to stop at home first, for you had to collect the grimoire anyway. So it's about four-thirty when you get to the elementary school, and half a grin slides up the side of your face to find Martin Gardinhire's Audi parked outside it. \"Yo man,\" you call as you tramp down into the basement, where your friend is slouched in a chair. \"How was the rest of your day? You get laid yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Christ,\" Caleb says. \"Why <i>didn't</i> we get masks of a couple of guys who are getting some regularly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself. I came <i>this close</i> to banging Molly Shaw before you showed up fifth period. And didja see that queer Johansson flirting with me at the start of Muniz's?\" He flips you off; you catch him about the neck and lightly pummel him in the gut. \"You gettin' smart with me? At least you lost those fucking sunglasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's true that he's dumped them\u2014big, dumb things made of cheap plastic\u2014exposing his eyes, finally. They're dark, which makes them a match for his mousy brown hair; maybe it's Caleb, or maybe he's channeling the real Gardinhire, but he blinks nervously as you release him. \"How're you settling in,\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess,\" he says, and pauses. \"It's like I have to concentrate to keep in character, though. Like, seventh period, in Chorale, this girl was talking to me, but I couldn't remember her name. I finally remembered it, and get this, Gardinhire\u2014 Well, he doesn't have a crush on her exactly, but he does have kind of a, uh\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like this, huh?\" You laugh and thrust your hips. \"Yeah, I can see that with Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin gives you an irritated look. \"Is it really that easy for you? Or is all this bullshit gangbanger stuff just <i>you</i> acting like you think Chen should act?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, but it feels kinda natural to me. I guess it'll come to you once you get used to it.\" But then you cock your head. \"Didn't you feel a rush when you woke up in his mask, like this stuff just pouring down over you and into you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I just had kind of a headache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't feel like someone sneaking into your head and sitting down next to you and putting his arms and legs around yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he looks a little alarmed. \"No. I've just got this sense like there's stuff I can't quite remember. You know, like you get when you know there's something you're supposed to do, but you can't quite remember it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're saying you can't quite remember how to be Gardinhire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like I say, if I concentrate on it I can get it. Like, right now I should be out someplace with Geoff and Ricky, maybe getting coffee and doing homework. It's like I have to remind myself that I'm Gardinhire, and then things come. Whatever is relevant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Maybe it's just working slower in your case. Or\u2014 I dunno. Come on.\" You nod at the stack of sandbags nearby. \"Let's get this taken care of. You don't wanna be Gardinhire forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether you pore over the next spell in the book, making various alternate translations of the instructions and muttering in increasing disbelief. \"No fucking way,\" your partner finally declares. \"We're not setting fire to this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't gotta set fire to the school, asshole, only to the\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, if we set all those chemicals on fire, you better believe this whole place is gonna go up like a torch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's magic,\" you reply, though you feel far from certain yourself. \"There's gotta be something to stop it from\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you getting this shit? We can't do it, Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean not here? Then where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anyplace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on! Look, if we don't do it here, there's plenty of spots we can do it. Out in Suffolk Wilderness if no place else. Or we just drive, like, twenty miles down the old highway, out to butt-fuck nowhere and do it three hundred yards away from the road. We pile everything up like it says\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's another thing!\" he exclaims. \"We're supposed to pile all this onto a sigil and set it on fire. Are we gonna use the sigil in the book? Because we couldn't get the last sigil to work when we copied it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers. \"You know, I bet that's it! I dunno how come the sigils didn't work last time, but I bet it's the sigil that'll keep everything from burning down. You know, it's like a magical force field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groans long and loudly. \"How the <i>fuck</i> would you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we have to try <i>something.</i> Stop that,\" you say when he starts chewing on a fingernail. \"Try to stay in character, that's something <i>Johansson</i> would do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb gives you dirty look, but drops his hand. \"Maybe we could run an experiment,\" he says. \"Like, try it on a sample\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you groan long and loudly. \"If that's you being in character, get back out of it. That's fucking lame. If it was gonna work on less than four hundred pounds of dirt I think it woulda called for less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou argue for a long time like this, then reach an agreement: He goes out to buy a fire extinguisher while you remain behind to copy the sigil onto a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still not finished when he gets back. \"Finish this for me, will ya,\" you say, pushing the sigil at him as you sit back and stretch the crick from your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, that's your side of the deal,\" he says. \"I sprang for the extinguisher\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who wanted it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014and your job is to draw the sigil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" you grumble, and bend back over the work. \"Dish me some dirt while I'm working. Like, who goes to these reefer parties at Kelsey's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gardinhire,\" Caleb says after a moment's thought. \"Mansfield, Kirk, Golia, Amanda, Kelsey, Brooke\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Galloway? You serious? She's such a fucking prissy little bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does everything Kelsey tells her too. Whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That</i> was instinct, what I just said.\" He blinks thoughtfully. \"I just blurted it out, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Instinct, huh? I know what you mean. I look at your face and I wanna puke, that's instinct too. I'm talking about Gardinhire, don't give me that look. Who else is at these parties? They're every Saturday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. So who'd I say? Golia? Marc Garner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Eva and Jessica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually, but they're not really part of the group anymore. There's some bad blood between them and Kelsey. Marc's not coming as much as he used to, not since he hooked up with Hannah Westrick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Pruitt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brent? Oh, fuck no!\" He laughs. \"Douglas Canfield comes, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adrienne Canfield's little brother. You remember Adrienne? She graduated a few years ago, kind of acted like a mentor or something to Kelsey and them.\" He makes a face. \"She's at Stanford now. Anyway, Douglas is her little brother, he's a junior, and Kelsey kind of looks after him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By getting him high on Saturday nights?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think she kind of resents Adrienne. Kelsey's not someone who <i>likes</i> it when others help her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which\u2014 Hey, hand me my bag. I wanna smoke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clucks his tongue. \"Take it outside if you're gonna do that. Jesus, you're a sick, fucking, degenerate lowlife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that instinct?\" You show him your teeth in a wide, sharp grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and it was also deliberate.\" He stretches his legs and tilts his head back. \"Gardinhire's been wanting to tell you that for a long time, Chen.\"</span></div></div>",

What's everyone in the group saying about her and Hennepin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Caleb says after another long pause. \"I think everyone is watching, and everyone is kind of embarrassed. Kelsey thinks it's a secret, but everyone in her group knows about it.\" He falls silent again. \"So Chen knows about it, huh? I didn't think he'd be interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not. Actually, what I wanna know\u2014 Hey, write me down a list of all the guys who show up to Kelsey's pot parties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just curious. Also, how did Gardinhire get hooked up with Trantham?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're concentrating on finishing up the last few squiggles in the sigil, so you don't immediately notice Caleb's silence. You look up to find him regarding you thoughtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" he says when you ask him what he's looking at. \"But Trantham, he heard from someone about Kelsey's parties, that I\u2014 That Gardinhire was in charge of buying for them. He went to Gardinhire, said that his own guy had been busted and he needed a new supplier. He asked where Gardinhire was getting his stuff. I\u2014 He said he could take care of it for Trantham, get him the stuff and pass it along. So he went to Chen and added a bunch to his order. Started getting a serious discount 'cos he was buying so much in bulk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. Fucker. Do Kelsey and them know that Gardinhire is also selling stuff into Eastman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. He hasn't told them, and no one's said anything to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be fun if they found out,\" you grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence for a little longer. Then: \"Are you seriously thinking about fucking these people up when we let them back out again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what I'm thinking,\" you confess. \"I guess we'll see when we get there.\" You straighten up from your work. \"And I guess we can get started on that now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, you spend almost thirty minutes at it. You clear out a wide, open space on the concrete floor and get as much flammable stuff away from the spot as possible. You lay the copied sigil on the ground and\u2014one bag at a time\u2014cover it over with four hundred pounds of cemetery dirt. You douse the pile with chemicals and liquids. \"We got hair like it asks for,\" you ask Caleb. \"Whose? Yours or Gardinhire's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I don't want his shit mixed up in this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb takes out a match while you stand by with the armed fire extinguisher. You look at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd look at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on, fucker, do it,\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hand that is visibly trembling, Caleb strikes the match. It hisses and flares into life. Gingerly, he stands over the pile and drops it. Almost simultaneously he flings himself backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're no chickenshit, and stand your ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when a massive, purple bloom of flame explodes off the pile, you get it full in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Jesus, man, are you okay?\" Martin Gardinhire seizes you by the shoulders and stares into your eyes. He and the rest of the world seems to be enveloped by a sickly ochre haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. \"Yeah, I guess I\u2014 Fuck!\" You jump backwards and try batting out the flames that envelop your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are on fire, aren't you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you seem to be fine. You look over at the pile of earth. It's being licked by violet flames. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a face full of that crap,\" says Caleb. \"Big ass mushroom cloud came off it.\" He peers closely at you. \"Doesn't look like it burned you or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push past him toward the burning earth. There is no heat. You even stick your hand into one of the petal-like flames. Nothing. \"Fuck, this ain't gonna burn the place down or anything,\" you say. \"Is it supposed to be this cool? I mean, naturally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not with the shit we were pouring on it.\" Caleb puts his own hand into the flame. \"Yeah, this is\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Booyah, this is real magic,\" you exclaim. \"Gotta be that sigil, man. I <i>toldja</i>\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah,\" says Caleb, but he still looks worried. \"You think it's safe to leave it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't babysit it. I can't spend the night here and neither can you, I bet. Not unless we find some poor fucker to hang Gardinhire's mask on so you can hide out\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not getting into the kind of trouble you got into,\" he says firmly, and picks up the grimoire and studies the spell again. \"Right. We gotta relight the thing if it goes out, until it doesn't light up anymore. I wonder how long this is gonna take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can keep an eye on it. I gotta get home for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I.\" You look at each other. \"We can't just leave this thing,\" Caleb says. \"What if it turns nasty, starts burning stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we keep our fucking mouths shut and pretend we were never here.\" You look around. \"We should clear all our shit out first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you longer than you'd like to gather it all together, and a lot of it is unlabeled. There are powders and liquids and mirrors and tools; things for making masks and brain bands and sealants and glues; raw materials and half-completed materials and things that are used to make other things and a few completed items, like a plastic tub of sealant and another of glue and a few brain bands. You and Caleb gradually get it all organized. And something nags at you until you finally remember it. You snap your fingers at him. \"Where's that mask of Chelsea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't reply, but bends his head to study the contents of a sack more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea? Oh. It's out in my car. Gardinhire's car, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it doing there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was moving it,\" he says in a voice that's almost inaudible. \"You know, I couldn't leave it at, uh, at my house for Gardinhire to find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck was it doing at your house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lips compress and disappear, and he avoids your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe penny drops. \"You were getting in and out of\u2014 Oh, fuck me!\" You explode with laughter. \"You were putting on her mask every night and fingering her pussy, weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns so red so fast it's like watching a cuttlefish in action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jesus, that's awesome,\" you gasp. \"I wish I could do that! No wonder you didn't wanna get into Gardinhire's mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has nothing to do with it,\" he sputters. \"Not being Gardinhire, that's a totally\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not taking it home with you now, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ, man, what if you get caught?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna get caught, I'll do it in a locked bathroom like I was doing at\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you taking bubble baths as her?\" you ask with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face is almost black. \"You can take it home too if you want, Prescott, if you think it's so funny and so awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't, really, though I'd love to. I don't got the same expectation of privacy.\" You whoop a little more, then draw up close to him. \"If you wanna put it on for me, though, lemme sample summa what Black's been\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shoves you away, and you hoot and holler and stomp around the basement. \"Oh, fuck me,\" you gasp when you're exhausted. \"But you won't. I'll go get it. We should keep it safe with the other shit. But stay out of it, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run up the steps and out the basement door. You've just time to see a blur behind you when you hear a hoarse voice: \"There, grab him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn, and your vision fills with something big and burly barreling down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nHe doesn't know what to do with his arms and hands, but it doesn't matter. He's too strong for you anyway, and he's got you pinned pretty hard. You can scuff at the ground, and you can grimace hard, but the guy with Gordon Black's body is not going to let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be bad enough, but Gordon keeps giggling and exclaiming, \"This is so freaky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it, Matthias.\" That hoarse voice sounds to the side, from a guy who looks like Dane Matthias. He's got his arms around someone who looks like Martin Gardinhire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there's the fifth of the bunch: Caleb Johansson, looking like he wants to throw up, sways on his feet in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit him, ya' fuckin' pussy,\" Dane yells. \"Kick him in the balls. You gotta make 'im hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, fuck you, Matthias,\" you shout back. \"I get outta this, me and your cousin\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wasn't my idea,\" Gordon protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't talking to you, Black!\" you snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoices rise and overlap. Then Johansson punches you in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Talk about sad.</i> It makes you go \"Oof\", but that's about all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Christ,\" Dane says. \"You'll never\u2014 If you can't fuck a guy over better than that\u2014 Get over here and do it on this guy. You can break him at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohansson turns even whiter. \"I can't,\" he croaks as he stares in bug-eyed horror at Gardinhire. \"It's too weird! I mean, that's\u2014 That's <i>me.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why you wanna fuck him over,\" says Dane. \"So get over here and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man,\" Gordon gasps. \"How can you keep straight who's supposed to be who?\" He giggles some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohansson totters over to Gardinhire. \"Don't do this,\" the latter says. \"Come on, Caleb, what are you doing hanging with these\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least your partner is trying to bluff the guy he trapped in his mask. It won't do any good, you suspect. You get confirmation when Johansson bends Gardinhire double with a blow to the solar plexus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb is bound to give up the goods eventually. So why make him suffer? Shouldn't you just give up now and save him the pain?</span></div></div>",

Hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the guy who looks like Johansson steps back from the guy who looks like Gardinhire. \"No, talk to him,\" he says. \"I'm not going to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthias curses at him, but the other refuses to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny beads of sweat\u2014like spiders\u2014crawl all over your body as you wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthias curses again, then orders Black to let you go. He shoves his own prisoner toward Johansson, who steps back as Gardinhire jumps to the side. It's like a field of mutual repulsion separates them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat leaves you to stare at Dane Matthias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hair is matted and his eyes are feverish and his lips curl back to show yellowed teeth. His clothes are sloppy and casual, but there is nothing like Dane's goofy cheer in his face or pose. He looks like a wild, desperate animal. You wonder if he has a knife on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod at the basement door. \"We'll talk down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You first, fucker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay.</i> He edges away as you approach the door, and you keep your eye on him all the way down the creaking stairs. He remains at the top of the stairs\u2014high ground from which he can fall on you if he has to. \"So whaddaya got to say,\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new experiment is burning in the far corner, but Matthias doesn't so much as glance at it. That surprises you, until you realize he and his friends, in laying the ambush, must have been peeking through the windows and already seen it. And you and Caleb were too wrapped up in to notice them spying on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm waiting, asshole,\" Matthias says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously it's no use bluffing anymore, so you counter with a question of your own. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna know\u2014! What the fuck are you doing? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinks: He shouldn't have tossed away that advantage. \"I know that's fuckin' Johansson up there, all dressed up like\u2014\" His breath turns ragged and he licks his lips. And now you see just how scared he is of you. A reciprocal confidence flows into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you know who I am,\" you gloat. \"I'm Gary Chen. Chen Guangli. Son of\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you!\" shouts the real Gary Chen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, man, I'm not trying to screw you,\" you tell him. \"I'm sure you figured out most of it.\" <i>No problem telling him what he already knows.</i> You point to him. \"Before I looked like this, I looked like that. Before that, I looked like Gordon Black.\" You pause. You're not going to go back any farther than that; and maybe you should let him think you're really the bully-boy captain of the basketball squad. \"Yeah, I made myself up to look like Matthias, and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For reasons.\" You hold his eye. \"I made myself up like him and accidentally screwed you on your shit. I didn't mean to, it just happened. But you got pissed at me, and Dwayne told me you were gonna break something. So I turned myself into the asshole who was trying to hurt me. I wasn't going to stick it out long anyway,\" you add. \"Just until I could figure out someplace where you couldn't get me. Then I'd give you your shit life back again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin slyly at him. \"You really want it back? Ain't it so much easier bein' Matthias, just chillin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flushes. \"Fuck you. Show me how you do this shit so I can change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not showing you shit. And I'm not changing you back until I figure out how to get away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChen advances down the steps. \"You put things back or\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what? Listen, man.\" You put up your hands in a placating gesture. \"I understand how you feel, I got your upstairs in my upstairs.\" He blanches as you grin. \"But the thing is, we gotta work together. And we can, you know. Those dipshits out there, they're not your friends. Matthias is a goof-ball, and Gardinhire's been cheating you. Yeah, you knew he was sellin' on the side, but did you know who he was selling to?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity and loathing fight for possession of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To some to his friends, but at school prices. He was sellin' to his friends at forty dimes an ounce, pocketing the profit that shoulda been yours. But most of it he was selling at a profit to Chris Trantham, at the club. Yeah, Trantham. He told me, and you can go sit on him and ask him yourself. He'd buy from you, drop it in his locker at work, next day turn around and sell it to Trantham at a markup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not a good partner for you, man,\" you continue as Chen grips the edge of a bookcase. \"But I can be. I'm not rockin' your life. I dealt to Gardinhire and up at the college, your mom and dad are gettin' your tip money, I gave Karol Mathis this month's payment, left the rest with him as the advance on next month's buy. I didn't know how long I was gonna be here, and I didn't wanna make any trouble for myself. You step back in and you won't find anything disturbed. But\u2014\" you raise a forefinger at him. \"I'm not giving it back until I can make myself an escape hatch. And in the meantime\u2014\" You shrug. \"We can work together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares at you a long time, breathing heavily. \"And then you'll fuck me up, take all my shit when you bolt\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that? Why make you mad at me? Madder? I can't steal anything, I gave it all to Mathis. All I got is the shit you deal around school yourself every month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About three ounces. You lifted some off me Monday, right?\" You grin, but he doesn't return it. \"You deal it yourself? Keep it, it's your money anyway. Tell you what, everything I sell, I'll turn it over to you. In fact, here.\" You cross to the pile of supplies, which also includes the remaining bags of weed. One by one you toss him three of the bags, keeping one for yourself. \"You deal those, they're yours, but this one I'll deal. I'll either give you the money or, if I run out of eighths, I'll use that money to buy some more supply off you. Between us, we'll get the stuff dealt fast. Of course,\" you add thoughtfully, \"you'll have to give me an allowance, fifty bucks every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, as tip money for your folks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing gets said for a long time. Chen's eyes glitter as he studies you. You can't be sure, but he's got to be weakening. What else can he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I gotta stick it out as Matthias? For how long?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few weeks. What's wrong with that?\" Then a thought comes to you. \"Or maybe you could be Gordon Black. Let Matthias have his life back, and you could hang out with Chelsea, get some pussy time with her.\" You waggle your eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasps, then swallows, like a fish taking some bait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe someplace else,\" you continue. \"I put my friend in for Gardinhire, so he could help me out. We can put you someplace useful, that'll do you good for when you got your old face back. Bulk up your network in a couple of places, develop 'em when you're feeling like yourself again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like where?\" he asks. Wariness shows in his face, but interest does too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lotsa possibilities, man. The basketball team? I sold some to Martin and Bennett.\" Chen's eyes widen. \"Yeah, you go in there, develop some contacts by playin' one of them. Or, we already got Matthias lookin' out for us from Gordon's perch, if we take care of Patterson\u2014\" You grin. \"Can you see that fucker dealin' to his own teammates? It could be you doin' it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or the football guys. Fuck, we don't know where they're gettin' their weed, you could bust their supply from the inside, then step in to take it over. Or how about Roth? Cool cat like him would probably make an awesome salesman. You and your friends are too scary. Roth could talk fuckin' Sagansky into buying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hungry look comes onto his face. But he surprises you with a riposte. \"So why don't <i>you</i> take one of those guys, let me run things myself? <i>As</i> myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it's true. Over the last few days it's become very easy to act like this, but you could still pry Gary Chen's face and head off of yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouldn't you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you temporize. \"You should set things up the way you want,\" you reply. \"Besides, that's the place we're aimin' at, you gettin' your life back while I disappear. If you wanna keep your hand in, start dealing as Roth. Maybe go into Eastman, set up a network there. Or kick back as Matthias while I do the heavy work.\" You remember the mask Caleb had made. A grin breaks out on your face. \"Or maybe you wanna relax as someone a little sexier? We got Matthias playing Black. That'd make it easy for us to get you in for Chelsea Cooper. Why beg for the chance to play with her tits when you could play with them yourself any time you wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meant it as a tease, but to your surprise he turns quiet, and his gaze goes distant. After a minute it becomes clear he's not going to answer right away. You move into a corner, and relax atop a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong minutes pass. But when he stirs, his words have no force behind them: \"Yeah, a lot of that makes sense. Even Chelsea could deal some.\" Agony shows on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lapses into silence. Clearly he's receptive to all the ideas you've laid out, but undecided beyond that. You can push him in whatever direction you wish.</span></div></div>",

Then he shakes himself. \"So how does it work? How do we do the, uh, the\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the mechanics? That's a trade secret. As for getting our hands onto Chelsea for the switch?\" You rub an itchy spot under the brim of your ski cap. \"We can use that fuck room of theirs. Her boyfriend can talk her into it, and you or me can take it from there.\" You want to see Chen take this bait\u2014Chelsea seems like a spot he can't hurt you from\u2014so you bite back any jokes you might make about his acquiring a fake Gordon Black as a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When would this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on when Matthias can get Chelsea up there. But first we better deal with everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou start with Caleb and Martin. You still want to protect Caleb's identity from them, and you certainly want to hide how the \"body-swap\" trick works, so there's some negotiations about the switch-back. At the end of them, Chen withdraws a safe distance; the real Caleb goes down into the basement; and the real Gardinhire gets in the back seat of his own car. Hidden from sight this way, the two guys disrobe. Gardinhire gives you a beady-eyed glare of hate and fear as you lean in the car window toward him. \"Close your eyes,\" you tell him. \"No peeking.\" You grip his forehead, say some magic words\u2014which are amazingly easy to remember\u2014and pull Caleb's face off him. As his head falls forward, you wrap the mask in his clothes and hustle them over to the basement. Caleb is already out of his mask and clothes, the latter of which he has left at the top of the stairs. You pick them up and drop the latter into the car next to Martin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you gesture Chen back over, but meet him halfway. \"We'll let Gardinhire get on his way,\" you say. \"Then you can talk to your man Matthias. Tell him we want Chelsea alone up in that loft in the gym. You stick close to him, so he doesn't fuck up, and when he gets it set up, give me a call. Whatever time, wherever I am, I'll come running. Except tomorrow night, I got the country club,\" you add. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat off-hand reference to his work, and your need to keep at it, seems to disarm him further. \"How much prep time do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clench a fist. \"It's all set, man. Sometimes these things take time, but this one's ready to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nostrils flare hungrily and he looks over his shoulder at Gardinhire's car. \"How long's that fucker gonna sit there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's out, it'll be about five, ten minutes. It's hits a guy hard.\" An awkward silence falls. \"Listen, once you got Chelsea in hand, you know you're gonna be able to get into the girls' locker room, shower, all that with no problem. If you could see your way to\u2014\" You mime snapping a picture. \"Lots of them, of lots of\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you come in with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you shake your head. \"Tempting, but let's wait and see. Some good snaps, though, they might melt the ice between us quicker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nWithin ten minutes, everyone has left: Gardinhire to go home, Chen and Matthias to catch Chelsea. You call down into the basement: \"They're gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reply is a lot of thumping and banging. Caleb, looking very pissed off, is loading himself up with the supplies you'd started packing before being interrupted. \"What are you doing?\" you ask as he comes up the stairs. You ask him again after he's passed you without reply. You shout at him as he stalks toward his car. \"Hey, the fuck are you\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting the fuck out of here,\" he shouts back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear at him, and charge over to his car, wrenching open the passenger's side door before he can stop you. \"We have to fucking talk,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it for your new best friend,\" Caleb snarls back. \"Whoever <i>he</i> is, because I don't know who <i>you</i> are anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck do you mean by that? You don't even know what I told him or what we're doing with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that any of my business? It sure doesn't seem like it, since you're not asking my opinion about anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you shut up and listen? It wasn't like I could fucking <i>consult</i> with you, dipshit, not while they had us in those headlocks! I had to talk to him and straighten things out before he beat your guts into bloody mush and pushed them out your sphincter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks, man!\" He grips the steering wheel and stares straight ahead. \"It's not like I'da been in that position except you <i>keep! Fucking! Up!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come very close to punching him in the side of his head, but manage to keep your temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was the last place I fucked up? Huh? Explain it to me. Yeah, it's been one fucking disaster after another, but when was the last one that was my fault? And anyway, what is the big fucking problem <i>right now</i> that's my fault?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says nothing, only stares straight ahead while breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I got Chen off our asses. Off mine, at any rate, and off yours too, since he isn't even sure that you <i>are</i> Caleb Johansson. If you're worried about that, fuck, we can handle that, we'll just stick you in for\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's</i> where it went wrong!\" He turns on you with flashing eyes. \"When I let you bully me into doing that fucked up switch with Gardinhire. We're right back where we were, except now we've got that psycho even farther up our asses!\" His eyes narrow. \"And one of us has him even farther up than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the organs in your gut churn and boil, but still you don't lose it. \"I bought us time to straighten things out. And anyway, you're out of it now. Look in the mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're not out of it, Will,\" he says, and visibly struggles with your name. \"We're not out of it until everyone's back where they were. And even if that happens, Chen's going to know it was us.\" He blinks, and his eyes are suddenly bruised with tears. \"My life is fucking over, no matter what. Either Chen puts a fucking gun to my head, or I have to run away under some God damned mask to hide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not going to\u2014 Look, lemme tell you what I've done.\" You get in the car and close the door behind you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got him right here, man.\" You point to the center of your cupped hand. \"He doesn't know it works, he doesn't know it's masks or any shit like that. But he's workin' with us, now.\" Caleb's eyes widen with incredulity. \"I'm movin' him, talked him into swapping Matthias for a new face. He wants his old one back, or so he says right now, but we'll see how long that lasts after he's had a few days to play around with his new body.\" You grin. \"He can't hurt us, not where he's going to be, and he might not even want to go back, in which case he's more or less going to be on <i>our</i> side goin' forward. And even if he does get his old face back, he's going to be totally simpatico with us after his vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let the promise hang until Caleb snaps at it: \"What? What are you doing with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, I'm gonna swap him out.\" You chortle hard. \"Gonna swap him out for Chelsea Cooper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's eyes almost pop from his skull. \"You're giving him that mask? You said you didn't tell him about\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't! I'm putting him <i>in</i> the mask\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about when he needs to take it off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question puzzles you, until you realize his mistake. \"No, man, it's a swap like we did with you and Gardinhire! We'll put Chelsea inside Dane's mask\u2014 Oh, man, can you imagine what that'll be like for her? Ha! And we're putting Chen inside Chelsea's mask, permanently! We'll have to get one of those brain bands so he can imitate her like we were doing\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb throws his head back and screams. \"I can't believe it!\" he yells after he's run out of air and sucked in a new supply. \"You just can't help yourself, can you? You keep having to fuck people up by putting them inside masks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, fucker, <i>you started it!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you keep doing it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is how we keep him from fucking us up anymore! Anyway, it was <i>his</i> idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb looks you up and down. \"Yes,\" he says. \"I'm totally sure it <i>was</i> Gary Chen's idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat tears it, but instead of hitting him, you grab up the sacks of supplies and leap from the car. He's already cranking the engine before you can slam the door on him. He takes off, and in a choked voice you curse after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throttle back your fury while unloading the stuff again in the basement; that weird fire is still burning in the corner, but you can't take the stuff back home. You check that you managed to keep the important stuff: the book, the unfinished brain bands, the supplies for making masks. Chelsea's mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait. It's not here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink and try to remember where it is. Caleb sent you outside to get it, that's right, because it was in his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was driving Gardinhire's Audi at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan. It's still got to be there. If it isn't, then Gardinhire has got it.</span></div></div>",

How could you be so stupid as to let Gardinhire drive off with the mask of Chelsea Cooper in his car?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer is obvious: You and Caleb were so preoccupied with Chen that you forgot it was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five hard blows to your own skull, you decide there's nothing to do but try to get it back before he finds it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nFrom your phone you get the addresses for two families named \"Gardinhire\", and they're on opposite sides of the city. Naturally, you visit the wrong one first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Martin's Audi is in front of the other one: a big, two-story slate house on a deep lot with leafy trees, out in one of those subdivisions right on the edge of town not far from Suffolk Wilderness. You case out the Audi's front and back seats, in case you can snatch the mask without having to talk to Gardinhire. You don't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips twitch into a ghastly grin as you mount the steps to his front door. What if his mom answers, and you ask to talk to him, and she finds Chelsea Cooper up in her son's bedroom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Gardinhire's father who actually answers, and you very politely introduce yourself as a classmate of Martin's and ask whether you can speak to him. He lets you inside the foyer and calls to Martin, who in answer comes down a set of stairs tucked into a nook next to a very large dining room. He stops halfway down and looks at you guardedly. \"Hey,\" you call to him cheerfully. \"I gotta couple of follow up things to talk to you about, from our study session this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardinhire hangs back, then curtly nods and takes a step back upstairs. But you gesture outside, and to show him you mean business, you actually go back out. You don't wait for him either, and stride back down the pebbled walk to his car. You're standing by the passenger-side door when he catches up. \"Mind if I check out the inside of your car,\" you ask. \"It looks nice.\" Without waiting for a reply, you get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he circles around to the driver's side door. You quickly glance about. The mask isn't on the seats, or in the foot wells that you can see. Fuck, did Martin find it already? He's not acting like he's guessed what you're looking for. Maybe Caleb hid it under the seats? You bend to feel, but the door opens, and you straighten back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardinhire says nothing. He's not wearing his sunglasses, and he looks very worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's all straightened out,\" you say. \"You had a little adventure today, one nobody would believe, but it's all good again.\" He doesn't reply. \"You hear from Matthias?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh. \"Good point. I suppose I oughta call him 'Chen'. He wouldn't like it, probably, to hear me calling him by some other name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardinhire just looks ill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you're out of it,\" you tell him. \"That thing that happened this afternoon, it wasn't personal, it was just a little thing we needed to do to get some info. We got it so you don't need to worry anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't look reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what we talked about in the portable, about being partners?\" You break off and look all around, and look into the back seat, down into the floorboards, as though afraid someone might be hiding there, listening\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo mask in the foot wells back there either. You hope Caleb didn't put it in the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I was saying about us being partners, that still stands. You see, Chen and me reached a kind of partnership of our own, and I'm gonna be running his end of the business a little longer. I gotta run it the way he would run it, and what I told you, that's what he'd tell you. So, we're still partners.\" You punch the glove compartment button with the side of your fist, as though making an emphatic point. It opens. Nothing in it but papers and vinyl envelopes. You close it. \"So you still okay with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply. You look over at him. He seems frozen in place. He doesn't nod, doesn't shake his head, doesn't blink. Is he still alive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump out of the car, and quickly slip into the back seat. Now Gardinhire's expression changes to one of deep alarm. \"What are you doing?\" he asks in a very weak voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giving you some space. You seem kind of freaked out,\" you say from the back. \"Did you hear what I said, about us being partners?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the deal still stands?\" You duck down and feel rapidly under the front seats, and under the back. \"What did you say?\" you ask when you come back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I think maybe I don't want to be buying anymore?\" he says quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you weren't in front of his house, you'd grab him by the head and convince him he'd said something very different. But you just get very quiet yourself. \"You don't want to buy any more? Not for your friends? You've already talked to them about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licks his lips. \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the last hour? All of them? Mansfield and Kirk and Canfield and Kelsey and Amanda and all the rest? You talked to all of them? And Trantham, you talked to him too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jaw sags at the revelation that you know who he's been selling to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd since you've had a moment to think, you see that his pants-shitting regret at being in business with you is probably for the best. So you nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay then,\" you say. \"It was good doing business with you, but all good things and shit like that. D'you already sell Trantham his stuff? Is that a yes? Okay, as I understand it, you were giving him nine ounces. I'll want the profit you got on it, the difference between what you paid me and what he paid you. What was it? Speak up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hundred and seventy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then bring me two hundred and seventy bucks tomorrow at school. You also bring me one of your friends at school, one of those guys you've been having reefer parties with.\" You don't snicker over the lame term \"reefer party.\" \"I'll start selling to him, so your friends can still throw them. You make the introductions. Don't worry, I'll treat him nice, the way I treated you nice. Only difference is, I'll be charging him four hundred an ounce, the way I shoulda been charging you. So don't tell him you were paying less than that. I don't think you would, though, since you <i>didn't</i> tell them you were making a profit on those parties. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head wobbles up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. And since we're not partners, you can also bring me the profit you made on dealing to your friends this month. By my calculations, that's another\u2014 Four hundred. Got that? Good, I'm real glad we had this talk. Everything's all sorted out.\" You pat him on the shoulder. \"You've nothing to worry about, as long as there's nothing you haven't forgotten to tell me. Uh, <i>is</i> there anything you've forgotten to tell me?\" <i>Like, something about a dinner-plate-sized porcelain mask that has the ghostly image of Chelsea Cooper floating in it, that you found in your car after me and partner let you take it back, you cocksucker?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him. But you can't challenge him without tipping him to the mask, and if he doesn't know about it, that would tell him about it. So you clap him on the shoulder, tell him you'll see him tomorrow, and slip from the car. He's still sitting in it as you drive off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * * </div><br>\r\nYou've no fucking idea where Caleb put the mask, and you're not going to call him to ask. Chen could be calling at any moment to say that Chelsea is in position. You've no choice, then, but to rush back to the school and try to get another mask ready before he does. Luckily, you've one last brain-band ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a game effort, but you're still buffing the new mask when the phone rings. You recognize the number. \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize the voice, too. \"We got her up in the loft,\" says Dane. \"Get over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you've got her in the loft? You mean tied up? You're sitting on her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Matthias managed to talk her up there. They're up there now, I'm down in the changing rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, he's just going to have to keep her entertained until I can get there. That won't be for another\u2014\" You look the mask over. \"Forty-five minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck? You said you were ready to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot one thing, I'm getting it ready now. Dane's just gonna have to stall her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucker doesn't know how to talk to girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be up there as fast as I can! Faster if you let me get back to work!\" You hang up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nFrantically you work, but not so frantically as to be careless, and you actually get it done\u2014including a brain band glued to the inner surface\u2014ten minutes before you'd promised. Your heart races during the drive to Westside, and you pray your phone won't ring again. It doesn't, and when you're in the parking lot you call Dane's number. \"I'm outside the gym,\" you tell Chen. \"Lemme in?\" The door opens a minute later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it,\" he says as the two of you run across the darkened court. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, these thing happen, fucker. I got it done as fast as\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean about Matthias. He's managed to keep her occupied. Even\u2014\" He motions you to silence when you come to the foot of the stairs leading to loft. Quietly you ascend. At the top, you put your ears to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft voices sound within, a guy's and a girl's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn a wondering glance on your new partner. He nods curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen business reasserts itself: \"We just bust in on 'em?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, no. It's best that Chelsea not even see you. But do you let Chen see that the magic trick uses masks?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's too much pressure for you to think clearly: You want to keep the masks hidden from Chen, but you also want to keep your own face hidden from Chelsea; and you can't see how to do both. You decide to risk showing the masks to Chen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call Matthias on his cell,\" you murmur to Chen. \"Tell him to pretend like he has to go downstairs to meet someone. After he's gone, we wait a minute, then you go in.\" From inside your pocket you draw out the blank mask. \"This thing, you put it on Chelsea's face. Just grab her and shove this onto her face.\" You mime putting it to Chen's face, and he jumps back. \"Like that. You catch her as she falls, and then you call me in. I'll do the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter. Just call Matthias.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe does so. It takes a few hissed imperatives before you hear raised voices inside the loft, and the creak of approaching footsteps. You and Chen hide around a corner as the door opens and closes. Footsteps go downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou draw a deep breath, and hand him the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe holds it, and stares at it. It dawns on you that he's thinking about using it on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he turns to the door, opens it, and goes inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA harsh, female voice sounds. \"The fuck are you\u2014\" Then comes a shrill shriek, abruptly cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a hoarse shout, which you assume is your signal. You bound into the loft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks much like the last time you were up here: boxes and crates and disused exercise equipment that's been shoved into corners. An old gym mat, rolled out in the middle of the dusty mess. On that mat, a tableau: Chelsea Cooper, her head lolling, sagging in Dane Matthias's arms. His eyes are wide with terror. \"That plate thing,\" he says. \"It\u2014 It melted into her or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it'll do that,\" you say, and help settle her onto the mat. \"Was that Chelsea's car we saw out front, next to Gordon's Bug? Then call Matthias, tell him he can split. I'll start getting her undressed.\" Your palms are already sweating in anticipation, and they're not the only part of you that's tingling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's dressed in light-blue culotte-style shorts that fall to the middle of her thigh and a sleeveless checker-board blouse; slim sandals adorn her feet. You unbuckle and discard the latter, then unbutton and pull down the shorts, exposing white panties. With a mix of high excitement and a little repulsion, you discover the latter are slightly damp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unbuttoning her blouse from the bottom when Chen bends next to you. \"Don't hog her,\" he says as he starts undoing the blouse from the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have her all to yourself, you lucky fucker, and not just the clothes,\" you mutter back. Once the blouse is off, you lift her up and pull her toward you as Chen undoes the bra. And so, when you drop her back, she is entirely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she is glorious. Rounded calves and knees and thighs that join in bowl-like hips that balance a curved stomach above which bloom firm breasts like ripe cantaloupes. Her arms are slim but shapely with hands ending in tapered fingers. Her neck is a little thick\u2014everything about Chelsea seems compressed downward a little\u2014topped by a head draped by golden, shoulder-length curls. And all over, with no visible lines, she's a golden tan\u2014not too brown, so that a glow still shows from underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face doesn't bear looking at in the circumstances, though: it's slack and shapeless, and her mouth has fallen open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare with hurting eyes, and you know that Chen is staring too. Then your eyes lift to meet his. \"You are one lucky motherfucker,\" you tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" he asks hoarsely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get outta your clothes. We gotta get them onto her.\" It doesn't take him long, for he's in Dane Matthias's usual wardrobe: flannel shorts, greasy T, shabby sports coat and sockless tennis shoes. Naked, he is much less inviting to look at than Chelsea. But such is her luster that she still looks achingly beautiful even in Dane's shabby and smelly clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext part?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Chelsea's purse you find a set of keys, which you pass to Chen. \"Get downstairs and into her car. I'll be down in a few after I've got things wrapped up with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean run down like this?\" he exclaims, and gives you an eyeful of Dane's hairy nakedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get some of your gear outta your gym locker, your soccer stuff. I'll be along in, like, five minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives you a skeptical look, but hustles out when you glare at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got several minutes free while the mask is still inside Chelsea. Time enough to think, but nothing comes to you. Having gone this far, you've nothing to do but to keep to the plan. You're not sure what advantage Chen thinks he sees in taking Chelsea's place, and Chen isn't the sort, you judge, to pursue a plan without an angle. Maybe he just recognizes that you hold all the cards, and is knuckling under to you as he knuckles under to Mathis and Macauly and even to Kirkham. In which case, you need to keep showing him that you're the alpha in this relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ponder this, you organize and fold up Chelsea's clothes, set her purse on them, and make sure you haven't overlooked something. You also confiscate a case of beers from the mini-fridge. Finally, the mask reappears on her face. Gingerly you pull it off her; from an inside pocket in your jacket you take out the small container of sealant and a brush. You keep a very careful eye on her while coating the inside of her mask. <i>So her middle name is 'Courtney',</i> you reflect as you work, for her name floats in blue letters over its inner surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is still unconscious when you finish blowing the mask dry. But will she still be unconscious after you've run down to get Matthias's mask off Chen? You look around nervously; then, for lack of a better idea, you drop her mask back onto her. Again, it vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good enough for now,</i> you pray, and sprint downstairs, taking the stairs five at a time while making a tremendous racket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk has deepened almost to night as you race over to the ghostly figure sitting in the passenger-side seat of Chelsea's red Nissan Sentra. \"Last thing, man,\" you pant after he's got the window down. \"I gotta get you out of Matthias. Close your eyes.\" He doesn't even blink. \"Come on, man, you've come this far with me. It's not like you'll see anything anyway.\" His glare of skepticism deepens. \"Fine, it doesn't even really matter. Just don't fight me. Hold still.\" You clasp his forehead between your fingers, and as softly as you can mutter the magic words. You pull. A mask comes away in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gives you a queer turn to see the face of Gary Chen lolling unconscious there. You've gotten used to seeing it in a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're not turning into Chen, are you?</i> Caleb kept asking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you're sure you're not, and the sight of his face brings back a lot of the fear and hatred you'd felt for him since your freshman year brought you together. Still, you've no choice but to work with him, and to keep on being him until you can get this nightmare unraveled. You sprint back into the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find the mask back on Chelsea's face. You lift it, tuck it and the sealant back inside your jacket, and lay Dane's mask on her. Her form wavers, and is replaced by that of Dane Matthias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd dearly love to see her reaction when she wakes up. Instead, you make one last hard sprint back down into the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChen is still passed out, and you're glad for whatever force of habit led him to leave the driver's seat empty: You drop into it, fish the keys from his loose grasp, start the car, turn on the lights, and peel out of the parking lot. A dippy pop song wails out of the car radio\u2014it's a style both you and Chen hate, and you snicker to think of him trying to pretend he loves it. You search for a good changing spot, and finally settle on the parking lot of a nearby shopping center. You pull into a dark corner near the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast step: You put Chelsea's mask to Chen's face. Even in the dark, the golden hair glows as Chelsea Cooper fills out Gary Chen's soccer jersey and shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the figure, trying to get used to the idea that Gary Chen's intelligence is now operating Chelsea Cooper's body. You shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're leaning against the passenger side of the car, smoking a cigarette, when you hear the window come down. You turn and drop next to it. Chelsea Cooper, with eyes wide, stares back at you. Her mouth is slack. \"Hey there, you sexy thang, how you doin'?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says nothing, and after a moment reaches tentatively for the cigarette. You hand it to her. With trembling fingers she puts it to her mouth. She chokes and gasps on it a little before drawing down a good lungful. She blows it out, and swallows. \"I thought you said I'd have stuff on the inside, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Memories, you mean? You should. Don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes narrow as she shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try. Where do you live? Concentrate. Remember, you're Chelsea Cooper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, check out her driver's license. It'll come eventually. After it does, just remember who you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the cigarette from her, draw some smoke into your lungs, and give it back. She does likewise. Your eyes lock onto each other as she passes it back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this way, you silently finish the smoke.</span></div></div>",

But you are so keen to glimpse Chelsea Cooper, to see the new head cheerleader in action, that it's like the feeling of having one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nNothing much happened between you and the Chelsea-fied Chen last night. After finishing a cigarette between you, you'd gruffly told her to start getting changed into her new clothes; as she'd struggled into them, you'd driven back around to the high school, to park briefly in the teacher's lot. \"Don't hang around,\" you'd told your new partner. \"Get back to your place, get into your new life. Maybe you better hide out in your room until you get your new brain better locked onto yours. See you tomorrow.\" You'd barely held back the overpowering desire to lean in and tear a kiss from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching her drive off, you'd run back around to the student lot to collect the Jeep. Matthias's car was there, which suggested to you that Chelsea was still upstairs, probably freaking out. You'd almost left her to it, but decided to check on her in case she did herself some harm. So you called Dane's cell. After five rings, a very tentative voice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, I'm here, where are you?\" you said. No answer. \"Hey, <i>fuckface.</i> I asked you a question. Where the fuck are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm at the high school? In the loft over the gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the dark windows high up over the gym. \"You're fucking with me. You see me?\" You wave. \"I'm down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down in the fucking parking lot, dipshit, where you wanted to meet. Fucking liar, I knew you weren't\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I see you. Uh\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The door to the gym open? I'm heading up there to kick your lying ass.\" You hung up and ran for the side door to the gym, which was still open. \"Yo, Matthias!\" Your voice reverberated in the dark gym. \"Where the fuck you hiding?\" But you didn't wait for an answer, and sprinted for the stairs. At the top you found the loft door ajar, and peeked in. A hunched figure stared back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a low whistle. \"The fuck are you doing in here?\" you asked. \"Jesus, I gotta give you credit for balls. If Black or Patterson or one o' them caught you up here\u2014 Tch, but your ass ain't worth the hospital bill they'da stapled to it, no matter how gentle they was.\" You advanced into the room and looked around, stopping on the mat. You kicked at it with your foot. \"You think this is where they do it? Where Black's cock meets Chelsea's cunny?\" You laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on, we should get outta here. I don't got time to waste, and anyway the thought of them doin' the nasty makes me wanna puke. Something wrong over there, Matthias?\" You stepped forward and pulled the figure into the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Dane, of course, and he was trembling all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck? You on a bad trip or something, man?\" You clicked your fingers in his face. \"Snap out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best thing, you judged, was to get him in motion and home. \"Come on, I don't got time, like I said.\" You pulled him out of the loft and down the stairs, outside to his car. \"So where's the shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shit, man, the stuff you said you had for me.\" He just stared at you, so you whapped him on the side of the head; he returned a wounded and frightened expression. \"You called me, man, said you had the shit and we should meet up at the school parking lot. Is it in your car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling your eyes, you crawled into the car and searched about until you found the baggies you'd passed on to Chen earlier. You pocketed them and turned back to Matthias. \"So are you going home now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seized his head between your hands. \"Go home, Matthias. You know where you live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a wallet? A driver's license?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's thought, he took it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" you said with exaggerated patience. \"Look on your driver's license. It'll have an address. Go to that address. Go inside.\" You slapped him hard. \"And sleep it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you left him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got in a lot of trouble at home for missing dinner, which you did your best to deflect by throwing yourself into homework. You were up until one-thirty, then fell into an exhausted stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBut now it's Friday, at last. Amazing to believe that you've been playing the part of Gary Chen for less than a week. It's been so full. And even now you've got a ton of stuff to sort out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides scoping out the state of \"Chelsea Cooper,\" you've got \"Dane Matthias\" to spy on. Martin Gardinhire and Caleb Johansson to keep an eye on. Normal business to transact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after hiding a baggie in the library, you go to the gym to watch pre-class basketball practice. Westside was built at one of the peaks of a physical fitness mania: the gym actually has two full-size basketball courts inside, separated by a high mezzanine where all the weight equipment is kept. From up there you briefly watch the freshman girls' basketball team practice on one court, then cross over to gaze down at the boys' varsity squad. They're dressed out and running hard: Steve Patterson is yelling at them, but Gordon Black is nowhere to be seen. No surprise there, since Dane Matthias hasn't got Black's skills with the ball. You wonder how long he can last as captain of the team if he's been skipping all the practices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to catch Luke Bennett's eye, and nod at him. At this distance, you can't make out his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only have to wait ten minutes before Patterson calls an end. The rest of the team returns to the changing rooms, but Bennett runs up into the mezzanine to meet you. \"What happened to Black,\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignores your question as he pushes in close and grasps your t-shirt. \"I didn't agree to buy anything from you, motherfucker,\" he says, obviously in reference to the eighth you'd peddled to his friend Jonas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool, I don't hold it against you.\" You grin and grip his wrist, pressing a small baggie holding an eighth of an ounce of weed to his hand. \"Here's some more, gratis, my treat. Just wanted to see if you and your boy were interested, that's all,\" you say as he glares at you. \"Turns out Martin's interested. You're not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBennett shows you his clenched teeth. \"I'm not fucking around\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither'm I. Come on, man. Today's Free Ganja Day, tomorrow's the weekend. Who you hangin' out with, Martin, maybe Green? Two eighths gonna be enough for you? Look, that first one, that was just me breakin' the ice. Fuckin' Patterson's got you all too-shittin-in-your-pants scared to ask. But I drop some on your boy Jonas and he snaps it up hard. This one's free\u2014\" You push the baggie again on him. \"Show I'm your friend, only wanna cultivate a relationship.\" You wink. \"You want another one, make sure you're well stocked for the weekend? Talk to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBennett's stare wavers, then he steps back and stalks away. But you grin at his back, for he's taken the baggie with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a happy sigh you turn back to the gym. Ten minutes until the bell, for you've no place better to be, and one good reason to linger. It comes five minutes later, as the ballplayers are starting to troop out, when the main doors open and three girls come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them is Maria Vasquez, the dusky, shapely, bird-brained cheerleader. Another is Kendra Saunders, the light-skinned African-American cheerleader with the track runner physique. Between them is Chelsea Cooper. You catch your breath in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's dressed in skin-tight blue jeans whose cuffs are rolled up above dark-grey high-heeled boots. Her midriff is exposed but her bosom is tightly clasped into a light blue sports top over which hangs a crisp white blouse, unbuttoned and draping to the mid-thighs. She wears a choker with a bright stone right at the top of her breastbone. And her hair is tucked under a cherry-red knit ski cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in this new guise, Chen can't lose the ski cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loose a rafter-rattling whistle from on high. \"You're smokin' today, Chelsea,\" you yell, and she lifts an imperious chin in your direction. \"Gotta special booty call set up witcha boy toy?\" You grin as Kendra stares back at you with shock and horror; Maria looks vaguely puzzled; Chelsea smiles very faintly. The trio don't break stride on their way to the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your erection settle a little before turning toward the stairs. But before you reach them, your phone buzzes with a text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's from Chelsea Cooper: <i>Fuck room in ten min. Skip first.</i></span></div></div>",

And, anyway, you really want to see and talk to her up close. This is the gap between periods when you can get up the loft stairs without being seen, and you make it in a quick dash. The door is still unlocked from last night, and you slip inside. You take care to stand out of sight, though, in case someone other than Chelsea comes in first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there's a moment when she has to look around with a puzzled air while you stare at her from behind a pillar. It was ten minutes before she appeared, and she's dressed out in the school's crimson-and-gold cheerleader uniform: colors that might have been chosen to bring out her hair and complexion. You whistle softly as you step out, and after jerking in surprise she twirls about once for your delectation. \"How you settling in, girl?\" you ask hoarsely. \"I see you got the wardrobe figured out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took me a little while,\" she says. She does a double take at the door, and locks it. \"It's not as easy as you're making it look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, maybe not, but she is very easy on the eyes. \"You remembering everything you need to remember? Class schedule, locker combo, how Gordon likes his blow jobs? Oh, speaking of which, what's going on with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you asking about his quitting the squad?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He quit?\" you gasp. \"Really? When? Did you\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night, and it wasn't my idea.\" She puts her hands on her hips; between that and her wide stance, she's suddenly copped a very butch attitude. \"Patterson caught up to him last night, tried giving him some bullshit intervention.\" Her tone turns clipped: a contrast with the chirp of her voice. \"Said the wrong fucking thing, and Matthias told him to shove the squad up his ass. Moron. Patterson came 'round to see me afterward, which was a bitch and a half, since I was still settling in.\" She shrugs. \"I didn't know what to say, just told him it was Black's business, which I guess he thought was a fuckin' strange thing for his girlfriend to say 'cos he gave me a look.\" She twists her face into a goofy expression. \"Then an hour later I started getting texts from Chelsea's gangbangers, all squealing about Gordon quitting, 'cos Patterson sent a text around to the other players, and then <i>they</i> started\u2014\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething dings. Chelsea growls as she takes her phone out. \"Driving me outta my fucking mind,\" she says as she checks a text. \"Like I give a fuck, you cunt!\" she yells at it, and puts it away. \"You have any ideas what I should do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that Chelsea's specialty? Boyfriend wrangling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glares at you. \"Actually, I wanted to talk to you about her anyway, the real girl. I guess she got away from here okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made sure she did. She was freaking out hard, but to anyone watching, it woulda just looked like Matthias having one of his fits. You know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if she comes nosing around me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do whatever Chelsea would do. Like I tried doin' to you when <i>you</i>\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she sighs, but still looks worried. \"It's just not coming naturally yet or anything\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, stop worrying about it. You're letting your own brain get in the way.\" With an inward pant of delight lay your hands on her shoulders. You knead them, and she gives your hands a doubtful look. \"Just go with the flow. Remember, you're Chelsea Cooper. 'What would Chelsea do,' that's what you gotta keep saying. 'I'm Chelsea Cooper, what would I do? I'm Chelsea Cooper\u2014'\" You lapse into a singsong as you massage her. \"I'm Chelsea Cooper, the hottest girl in school. I'm Chelsea Cooper, head cheerleader, I date the hottest guy and I crack the meanest whip, everyone thinks I'm hot and I don't let anyone put a finger up my cunny unless\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorknob rattles. You and Chelsea both jump. \"Hide,\" she hisses, and you scamper behind some crates. A lock slides back and the door opens with a creak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey.\" The voice is soft and a little hoarse, with a twang in it. \"I didn't see you downstairs, so\u2014\" <i>Jason Lynch. Ugh.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you supposed to be out on the diamond?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to come back in to get something, that's when I saw\u2014 I thought you might be up here with Gordon\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I guess you're thinking about\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you got a fucking point? Gordon's not here, if you wanna find him try looking in\u2014 Where the fuck is he now? Spanish? Or wait until you can see him later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slams. There's a knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go the fuck away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hardly contain your amusement at the entirely unladylike way Chen is conducting himself inside Chelsea's skin. You don't know what would be funnier: Chen being out of character with all the cursing, or Chen being totally <i>in</i> character with all the cursing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all your mirth dies at her next words: \"You can come out now, Prescott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou look over the crate. Chelsea stares back at you with a look of dull hate, but it doesn't look like she's mad at you: it looks like her reaction to dealing with Lynch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut forget Lynch: \"What'd you just say?\" you ask with a smile you hope is quizzical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said you could come out. Or were you asking why I called you by your real name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was wondering why you called me 'Prescott'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Cos it's your real name, dipshit. You think I wasn't ever gonna figure it out?\" Whatever of Chelsea's mannerisms Chen had managed to mimic fall away, and you can see your alter ego behind Chelsea's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's</i> who you think I am?\" you laugh. \"You must have one hell of a theory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's fucking obvious now that I think about it,\" she says. \"You were hanging out with Johansson, and though I never gave a shit about you 'cept when you were in my way, I do remem\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johansson's just where I happened to have my man when\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit. Second is the way you bumper-carred me and Matthias around. Follow the fucking ball. You put me in Matthias's body, you put Matthias in Black's body. So where's Black? You sayin' that <i>you're</i> Gordon Black? Bullshit.\" She spits on the floor, and somehow it's even more alarming when she does it than when one of Chen's thug friends does it. \"Would fuckin' Black do this to his girlfriend, let me help undress her last night? Fuck no, that motherfucker's a psycho about Chelsea. You ain't Black, which means you put him someplace else. Wherever you were before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just now Jason Lynch comes scratching at the door. I open it up, look at his face, the face that a sad little douchey mama's boy named Will Prescott tattooed all black and blue last week. Fuck, that was impressive, I was fucking impressed with the little prick for all of the five seconds I spent thinking about it. Prescott could never do that. But Black could, I bet. So put it together. Johansson's butt buddy Prescott jams Black into his body, Matthias into Black's, me into Matthias's, and himself into mine. If that ain't the way it worked, I'll lick out my man Kirkham's asshole every day for the next month.\" She arches her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say nothing, not right away. She's right: When spelled out that way, it's obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if that's your fuckin' theory, sweet thing,\" you say when you do reply, \"more power to you. But don't think I'm gonna confirm or deny anything,\" you add with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea cocks her head and stares at you. Her words had been contemptuous, and her expression baleful, but there's nothing like hatred in her eyes. Nothing like respect, either. Only a measured kind of regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will say I've got a little more respect for you now, Prescott,\" she says. \"I always thought you were a sad little douche. Oh hell, you know <i>exactly</i> what I always thought of you, when I ever thought of you, which was as often as I could get away with <i>not</i> thinking about you. Even Knouse and his little gang of elf fuckers got more going for them than you and your friends, at least they've got the balls to let their stupidity hang out in public. But this trick you figured out, it's pretty impressive, I gotta say. You got balls going for Black, and trying to play me. Keep it up, and maybe I won't spit on you the next time I pass you in the hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she finishes, your nerves are vibrating on about three different frequencies. You are very frightened that Chen has figured out your identity, and means to treat you accordingly. Meanwhile, the part of Gary Chen's psychology that you've borrowed is quivering with rage, and would like nothing more than to knock this asshole about for disrespecting you. But there's a third vibration, an excitement at having this beautiful girl talk so dirty at you, and an ardent desire to prove to this person\u2014whoever exactly he or she might be\u2014that you're worth respecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three vibrations come together to produce your reply: \"Does Gordon like it when you suck him off with a potty mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe colors hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, man,\" you continue. \"However I got here, from wherever, you gotta deal with me as I am, and as I am <i>this\u2014</i>\" You point to your face. \"Get used to it. And you get used to being Chelsea Cooper. You asked for it, you got it, and if you wanna be half the bad-ass, motherfucking shapeshifter <i>I</i> am\u2014\" You step close to her. \"You will strive for a perfect impersonation of this almost perfect girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nostrils flare, and you can't suppress the fantasy that she wants you to crush her in your arms. The fantasy isn't entirely dissipated when she says, \"I want to see you fifth period. Up here again.\"</span></div></div>",

You sneak down the stairs, and when you get to the bottom you find the cheerleaders\u2014all dressed out\u2014standing in a semi-circle at the far end of the court with their backs to you. You use the opportunity to get into the boys' changing room, where you switch into your soccer clothes. You spend the rest of the period jogging and walking around the field, thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Chen has figured out who you are. What can he do? Turn Chelsea's mean girls on you? As long as you're running his life, he has to do whatever you say, and if he makes your life hard, that just gives you a greater incentive to hunker down inside it. <i>He's just trying to put himself over you,</i> you decide. You can survive that. You just have to make sure he can't lay his hands on the grimoire or any of the toys it can make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll need a hiding place for them, though. He knows about all of his hiding places, and your hiding place at the elementary school too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, you need to check on the progress of the latest spell after school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou put all these thoughts from your head during soccer practice, and concentrate on exhausting yourself for two periods with exercise. Then comes lunch, and you decide to scour the school for signs of Caleb, Martin Gardinhire, and/or Dane Matthias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all seem to be in class, for you see no sign of them in fourth-period lunch. You're heading back around A wing, looking for some other company, when up ahead you spot Erik Carstairs, squatting in the grass with his fingers to his lips. He gives you a sharp glance at your approach, then with a smile takes another hit off the toke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't remember ever seeing so much weed consumed as you have during the last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, right, when you were still yourself you always avoided places where it was done in the open.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weekend's comin' up, man,\" you say to Carstairs. \"Set you up for some more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good,\" he says. He wets his fingertips and extinguishes the joint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Set your friends up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all good. Next time we're short a little, we'll talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Hey, you seen Matthias around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dane?\" Carstairs looks around, as though it's a trick a question. \"Yeah, I think. Maybe a day or two back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And Carstairs is one of the smart football players. No wonder this season is shaping up as a disaster.</i> \"You see him, tell him I'm lookin' for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you text him, Chen? I'm not your fucking messenger boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucker's too wasted most times to check his phone. And if you <i>were</i> my messenger boy, I'd tell you to smack him around. That's what I need to see him about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarstairs laughs, and you leave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are briefly stymied, until on a hunch you slip back around outside B wing and peer through the window into Walberg's class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there he is, staring straight ahead with a look of intense concentration. You can't make him out clearly, but he seems to be wearing full-length pants and a button-down shirt. You don't remember Matthias even having a button-down shirt. And where's his sport coat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, can you fuckin' believe it?\" a gruff voice says behind you. You jump and spin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Gordon Black, gazing with boggle-eyed fascination into the same classroom. He glances down at you, then returns to staring at Matthias\u2014or, rather, the apparition that has replaced him. \"I saw him coming out of Mr. Peters' class second period, you know, 'cos I was comin' out of Boykin's?\" He pauses, and giggles. \"Boykin,\" he says again, and giggles. \"What was I saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing in your classes, man?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" he says. \"Is that even me in there? Doesn't look like\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not him, you.\" You poke him in the chest. \"The classes you're going to, how are you doing in them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold feeling forms in your chest. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon's eyes go vacant, and his face goes slack. \"Fuck if I know any more, dude,\" he says softly. For a moment he ruminates on that very profound question, then trudges away. He's only gone a few steps, though, when he stops to look over his shoulder. \"Oh yeah, Chelsea sent me to find you. She said to remind you about seeing her this afternoon.\" And he turns back toward the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So she's pretty goddamned serious about.</i> You decide to oblige her, and even go so far as to eat your lunch at the top of the stairs leading to the loft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou don't have to worry about being caught out so close to the loft during the lunch periods because the gym courts are taken up with freshman and sophomore classes; and today the class that normally occupies this court is out jogging around the school track. The only danger would be if Patterson or Lynch or someone else with semi-official access to the loft came up and caught you loitering. But when the stairs creak, it's Chelsea coming up. She only gives you a sidelong glance as she unlocks the door and walks in. You follow and close it behind. Her ass, in those skin-tight Lees, is delectable. So is her face when she turns around, though she's wearing a stony expression. Your heart beats and your cock rises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, to business,\" she says. \"And I know you got the brain for it, Prescott, 'cos it's my brain in there with you, apparently. First, we're going down to see Karol Mathis tomorrow morning. Starting today, you'll give me all the money from your sales, and <i>I'll</i> deposit it with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What?</i> \"I don't think he'll like that,\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been dealing with him longer than you, I know he'll be fine with it. He only cares about the money, not the package that delivers it. You just explain that you won't be able to come in anymore, but that you trust me to turn the money over to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I trust you? I mean, look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, look at me,\" she says. \"<i>That's</i> why you trust me. And if you play ball with me, Prescott, I'll make sure that tomorrow he sees <i>exactly</i> why you trust me with the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles, and you almost swallow your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's first. Second, you're gonna start getting <i>really</i> aggressive about dealing. No more of this six eighths a month from the dipshits. I want Evans and them pushing at least three ounces a month. Each.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck?</i> \"They haven't got the stones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will, because you're going to put them behind some new faces, better faces, smarter faces. Like you were telling me yesterday, about growing the business by moving into some other position, some other\u2014\" She pauses. \"Some other identity. You're going to do that with them. Like you did with me, you're going to put them inside\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impossible!\" you explode when you finally find your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? You did it with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, first, where do I put the people they replace? Like, right now you're pretending to be Chelsea, so Chelsea is\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do like with you did with Gardinhire and Johansson. Johansson became Gardinhire, and Gardinhire became Johansson. Switch them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Gardinhire didn't know the first thing about how to be Johansson! And it wasn't going to be a permanent thing, it was only for a little while, only to get some\u2014 And Gardinhire was smarter than Caleb, he couldn't fuck up Caleb's academics, so it wasn't going to hurt Caleb's life. I can't swap Evans and them for just anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't give a shit about anybody's academics, Prescott, least of all the dipshits. They're dumbasses. Anyone can take their classes, pass them. Fuck, swap the dipshits in for smart people, and the smart people can pass their classes for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while you're choking on that, she continues. \"I'm thinking that one of them needs to go in for Trantham, I like the idea of building a network in Eastman. Another one needs to go down in the sophomore class, start setting up a network there. Last one can go in for Roth. I think you said he could be a good\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I just tell you no, I'm not going to do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles mirthlessly. \"Ask what happens if you say yes. If you say yes, then I don't fuck you up after you give me my life back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That just gives me an reason not to give it back,\" you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile widens. \"Fine. Keep my old life for yourself. I'll keep this one. Why wouldn't I want to keep it?\" She thrusts her bosom out. \"Look at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do, and groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the third thing,\" Chelsea continues, \"you and Johansson are going to swap yourselves out with some of those rich fucks, like Gardinhire and those guys again. Just one-day jobs, long enough to lift all their loose change and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave Caleb out of this,\" you say firmly. \"This is just between you and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's just between us, what was he doing with you at that school yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He fucking quit on me. He couldn't handle it anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then <i>make</i> him handle it, Prescott. If you can't, then you're an even bigger pussy than him, 'cos you at least got <i>this</i>\u2014\" She jabs you in the chest with a sharp fingernail. \"As a crutch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not doing it,\" you say firmly. \"Caleb is out and he stays out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad,\" Chelsea says. \"Because that means you have to go see Kirkham, show him all this shit like you're going to show Evans and them, and then you and <i>him</i> start fucking over the rich twats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lurch on your feet. <i>Kirkham?</i> If you don't use Caleb to steal from the rich kids, you'll have to pair up with <i>Kirkham?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It figures that a fucking Oriental like Gary Chen would know how to jujitsu you: If you don't do as he demands, he'll stick the responsibility for his old life onto you permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now you know why he picked Chelsea's face yesterday: He can force you to do all that work for him; he doesn't have to lift a finger; and he'll be happy where he is if you decide to \"punish\" him by leaving him where he is. Fucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the worst part is the way Chen is now trying to rope Caleb back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Kirkham or Johansson,\" Chelsea continues. \"I'm being really fucking nice, like blow-job-with-Chelsea-Cooper's-mouth nice, by giving you Johansson as an option. I figure as long as he knows all about this shit, you can use him. If you don't use him, you'll have to tell Kirkham about it all, and how we can use it to suck trust fund money out of the rich twats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long do I have to decide?\" you ask thickly. You just want this interview to be over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say 'yes' anytime. I'll still be here.\" She smiles sweetly. \"And you can say 'Fuck you sideways, asshole' as many times as you want, right up until the moment that you say 'yes'. I won't hold it against you, as long as you say 'yes' eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan and writhe in place. <i>How the hell did you manage to fool yourself into thinking you could outfuck Gary Chen?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that someplace else, Prescott,\" she says. \"Right now I've got a fucking cheerleader squad to run, and a boyfriend everyone thinks has blown his brain on goof weed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<i>Everything is blown on goof weed,</i> you decide as you stumble back downstairs. You want to get off someplace by yourself, unscrew your head from its shoulders, and let the world spin about without you for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour passage back to the portables is like a review of all the crazy shit that's happened to you since finding the grimoire. As you exit the library you almost run into Lin Pol, and feel a sympathetic stab of Chen's anger at the way she treated him last year when he asked her for a date. In front of the cafeteria you spot Gardinhire in the company of Mansfield and Kelsey Blankenship and Anthony Kirk and others from the AP gang. Dane Matthias, incongruously, is only a few feet behind them, following them toward the cafeteria, and behind him are Kevin Hall and Erik Carstairs. Hall is a football player, but a junior, so you're helpless to dodge the thought: if Chen wants to set up a network in a lower class, Hall would be an obvious recruit. As you pass the office: \"Hi Gary,\" a female voice calls, and you look over to see Molly Shaw, Faith Becker, Mindy McAdams and Elle Moore. They grin and giggle at you. You lower your head and press on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen comes the worst, after you charge out the front doors: On the quad between the office and the library are sitting six figures. Four of them are Jenny Ashton and Yumi Saito and Paul Davis and Keith Tilley. The fifth is Caleb, which causes a hard enough twinge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's the sixth figure that stops you short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Will Prescott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's in a long-sleeve shirt and jeans, wearing your cap, hunching forward and hungrily devouring a sandwich while listening intently to the others. No one seems to be paying special attention to him, though Caleb might be leaning in to talk to him more often than to the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the last week, while he was suspended for pasting Jason Lynch in the face, you had gotten very used to the idea that you were both yourself and Gary Chen, that you could pretend to be Chen while not losing your own claim on your own identity. But the sight of someone with your face, sitting with your friends, occupying your space, now rocks you on your heels. <i>This is what Dane Matthias felt when he saw that other Dane in the classroom; it's what Gary Chen felt when you pulled him from under the Jeep on Monday.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad enough that you feel your own claim to your own self weakening. But after your talks with Chen this morning, it feels as if <i>both</i> the identities you've been sporting for the last week have been challenged and usurped. How can you be either Chen or Prescott when both of them\u2014in spirit or body\u2014are so obviously manifesting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble, and almost sprint backwards toward the main doors of the school. Steve Patterson\u2014another unwelcome reminder\u2014looms, but you dodge him at the last moment. You rush down the hallway and explode out the entrance between the Vocational and Music wings. You're heading toward the portables, and are just passing the first, when you hear voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're exhausted, more mentally than physically by now, and can't resist their siren call, though you recognize them. So you fetch up helplessly in the company of Jeff Spencer, Joshua Call, Jamie Rennerhoff, Jonas Martin, Luke Bennett\u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd David Kirkham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nNo one says anything as you slide into their circle. Maybe they're preoccupied by the subject of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why you keep that shit under control,\" Kirkham is saying in his soft, sneering baritone to the two basketball players. \"Ain't no one gonna cross Black over what he done, but either of you cost us a game 'cos you're gettin' baked\u2014\" He's fiddling with something, but you don't recognize it until he raises it to his lips and seals it with his tongue: a joint. He holds it out to Martin, who takes it and hands back some folded bills in return. \"You blow a game, and me and my friends\u2014\" He jerks his head at the cluster that includes Spencer, Rennerhoff and Call. \"We'll take you out to Suffolk Wilderness and take turns folding each of you up into a dildo and using you to ass-fuck the other. That right, man?\" he says, turning slightly toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin'-A,\" you reply. \"We talkin' about the way Black's popped his screws all over the place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who was selling him this shit,\" Martin asks. He stares hard at you as he tucks the joint into his sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not me. You think I'm a dumbass,\" you reply. \"I caught Patterson out here a day or two back, trying to beat some kind of sense into Matthias.\" You take a cigarette and lighter from your backpack. \"My bet is it was him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking Dane, there's <i>another</i> one's lost his shit,\" Rennerhoff says with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the fuck would Black be hanging out with Matthias?\" Bennett asks. \"They're same planet, different worlds types.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that's who he was looking to score from,\" you reply. \"If you're lookin' for bash and don't know where to get it, who do you go to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?\" Bennett says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said if you <i>don't</i> know where to get it. Matthias stinks of weed from ten miles away. Me,\" you say as you suck down a lungful of tobacco smoke. \"I wouldn't put that poison to my lips if Chelsea Cooper stuck one up her cunny and told me to pull it out with my teeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep, reflective silence falls over the group as every guy\u2014you included\u2014visualizes the image you've just delivered. When Bennett speaks, his voice briefly cracks. \"Funny to hear a salesman run down his own product.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, some people like it,\" you shrug. \"You guys, Matthias. Some people can't handle it. That'd be Black, apparently. I don't especially like it, but the thing is I can't afford to get mixed up with it, even if I can handle it. I wonder if you assholes can afford to get mixed up with it either.\" You peer narrowly at them through cigarette smoke. \"But I'm willing to bet I'm wrong. And I'd like seeing you prove me wrong. Anyways,\" you add as you pat your pocket. \"After the pasting Patterson gives you during the week, everyone needs a little recreational shit to dull the edge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what pisses me off,\" says Kirkham. He plucks the cigarette from your fingers and takes a drag. \"Cunts like Kelsey and Kirk, and the way they look down on\u2014 You should try placing some there,\" he tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those fuckers won't even jam on Pop-Rocks,\" you snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelsey does it with Karl,\" Rennerhoff sniggers. \"That's what I hear. Does with some of the stuff you've been selling him, too,\" he adds with a sly wink at  you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I can see <i>that,</i>\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard Anthony Kirk got caught with a joint,\" says Kirkham, turning to you. \"Remember Connor Hutchison? You know him, he caddied at the country club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember him, but I never see him out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's working at a Starbucks now. Anyway he told me Kirk got busted out there with a joint. That's why I say\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to him?\" Bennett asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirk? Nothing, of fucking course. It was only half a joint anyway. But that's how come I'd like to see you them set up. Think what you could take offa them rich fucks.\" He snaps a finger in your face; you brush it away. \"I'd fuck 'em over too, extra surcharges, lots of loose stuff, make it hard for 'em to hide it, they'd lose a lot of it trying to roll it, pile up so much on them they can't keep track of it, so when you slip a little more into their locker and leave a tip in the office\u2014 <i>Bam!</i>\" He claps his hand, and the bang of it resounds. \"They can't deny it 'cos they think they did leave it there. 'Course I'd wait till I'd sucked as much cash off 'em as I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat settles it, you're not bringing Kirkham into Chen's plot.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you get right down to it (you decide later after thinking about it) Chen isn't asking you to do anything that you weren't proposing to either him or Caleb. The only difference is that you'd be using Evans and Mendoza and Thomason to do it. And you're pretty sure you can pull their strings. As Chen, you already are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you'll go along that far with his scheme. Before lunch is over, you've shot each of them a text, telling them to make no plans for Saturday afternoon. <i>Meeting,</i> you tell them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeventh period: Gardinhire is waiting for you right outside the door of Muniz's classroom. \"I got someone to talk to you,\" he stammers. \"I also brought\u2014\" He fumbles inside his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not here, man,\" you mutter, and glance around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The restroom?\" he suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a fucking moron. Meet me outside.\" You nod at the nearby doors. \"I'll be hanging out, and you and your friend can find me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saunter outside and lean against the wall. <i>Restroom,</i> you snort. <i>Fucking Gardinhire should know better than that.</i> Restrooms are the most dangerous spots at the school. Mostly on account of guys like Chen and Kirkham, but even they can't singly take on the roving packs from the lower classes that sometimes erupt into them. Your already low opinion of Gardinhire's intelligence falls\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it craters further when he appears with his \"friend.\" It's Marc Garner. His face freezes when he sees you, just as yours freezes at the sight of him. Obviously, Gardinhire has already told him that he's to meet the AP gang's \"dealer\" so he can take over the purchases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Marc Garner,\" Gardinhire tells you. \"He\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know who he is,\" you snap. \"Hey man,\" you say to Marc. He doesn't reply. \"So I guess he told you what we need to talk about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Garner says through clenched teeth. \"He didn't tell me with who, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\" You turn to Gardinhire. \"Wait for us inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I also got\u2014\" He takes out an envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put that away. Put it in a book and hand me the book at the end of class. I'll pass the book back when you're coming out of the music wing after seventh. Now fuck off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scampers away. You jerk your head to the side, and Garner follows you off a little way. \"I guess I shouldn't be surprised it's <i>you,</i>\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too, man\" you retort, then decide it's better to relent. \"Listen,\" you tell him, trying to keep your tone mild and friendly. \"Coupla things I wanna get straight. One, I don't 'deal', whatever Gardinhire said. I procure. People tell me what they want, and I'm able to get it for them. Sure, I make a profit, but that's 'cos I'm moving it from one place to the next, like a trucking company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarner snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, second, I don't procure for anyone on the team. I wanna be straight on that. <i>You</i>\u2014\" You jab him in the breastbone. \"You are the only guy I know on the team I will be doing this with. And I'm not thrilled about it. I don't use this shit myself, and to be fucking frank with you, Garner, I'd like it better if I knew you didn't either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pozniak uses,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pozniak's a fucking loser and you should use your pull with Gellman to bounce him from the team, him and Maddox both. I know he uses but I wouldn't sell to him even if he came to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm a disappointment to you,\" Garner says with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying anything. If you can handle it, you can handle it, I won't say anything about it to anybody. Naturally I won't, 'cos you're our best guy, and I'm not gonna fuck the team over by putting your dick in a wringer. I just don't want you lookin' at <i>me</i> like I'm a lowlife when <i>you</i> and your friends are the ones who give assholes like me a way to scrape a few nickels together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face tightens, and his eyes drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So here's how it works, the fifteenth of every month at the latest, you get me word how much you and your friends wanna buy. Price is four hundred an ounce, you knew that already, right? You give me an amount, and by the last day of the month, no later, I'll have it for you. We'll figure out an exchange point where I'll trade you the product for the cash. Sweet and simple. Talk to Gardinhire about how he sorts and binds the money, he's good at it, I like how he does it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all. You can get it cheaper on the street if you know where to look, but you and your friends don't know where to look, right? So all you're doing is hiring me to get it off the street and bring it to you. If you wouldn't have a problem buying it on the street, you shouldn't have a problem buying it from me, 'cos I'm not even the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" he says, and with that apparently swallows your bullshit story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang while you were talking, and you quickly return to class. \"Soccer stuff,\" you tell Kirkham when he asks what it was about; after class, Gardinhire hands you one of his textbooks. At your locker, you extract from it an envelope containing six hundred-dollar bills and seven tens. At the next break, outside the music wing, you return him the book with a firm clap to the arm and a cheerful thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that marks the climax of the day. After school you pick up your customary meal from Aunt Sue and go by the elementary school. You wonder if you'll find Caleb there, but you don't; and besides, he never called or texted you during the day. You feel a strong twinge of regret. And inside the basement you find that fire still burning, and still giving off no heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it's up to the country club. Work there is exhausting and boring, but after the excitement at school, it comes as a relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that: Home, where the old man is screaming in the living room, and though you are almost too tired to move your limbs, you help your parents clean and change and quiet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"You look like you're having fun,\" says Chelsea Cooper as she gets out of her car. It's noon, and you're downtown in front of Ben's BBQ. \"How's my grandfather doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you're having fun too,\" you retort. \"How's Gordon's cock doing?\" She only grins at that. She does flinch, though, when you yank the black ski cap off her head. \"Don't be so fucking obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, I can wear\u2014\" She lunges for the cap, but you put it behind your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later. After we talk to Mathis. You'd just look lame in it. Even more lame. Christ, where did you find that shit? Don't tell me\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in Chelsea's closet, apparently, Chen found some heavy green work pants; a short, black, midriff-exposing t-shirt; and an overlarge green-camo jacket. For accessories he's got black boots, a black leather belt that's three inches wide, and that ski cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bought it yesterday. I've got a credit card with no credit limit,\" she brags. \"Well, in practice no limit. Mom and Dad pay for everything I put on it, and this girl hasn't hit a limit yet. Her mom says that as head cheerleader she has to look good.\" She sniggers. \"If you're nice and let me wear my new cap I'll take you shopping when we're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You turnin' queer in there, 'cos I'm not. You even look at yourself in the mirror?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look good!\" she bridles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like a fucking doctor's daughter on her way to a costume party. Mathis is gonna take one look at you, and then he's <i>not</i> going go along with this gag about you bringing him the money. So here.\" You jam the cap back onto her head, pulling it halfway over her face. \"Wear it in fucking health, you bint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yanks it off, and her hair flies all over. \"You're really starting to\u2014!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was your idea to do this, so come on.\" You take her by the elbow and pull her into the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen's BBQ is a local landmark and semi-legend, being over seventy years old. It's in the middle of downtown, close to the railroad tracks, and inside it looks like what it is: converted warehouse space. It's all part of a cluster of businesses owned by a local businessman, Karol Mathis, who quietly collects his revenues and rents and makes no splash on the local scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably because he's also the banker to the local underworld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, a short, fat girl just this side of thirty looks up cheerfully from the register and asks for your order. You take a sandwich and fries; Chelsea a diet cola (she'll have part of your meal, she says); as an almost casual afterthought, you ask if you can speak to the owner. The girl shouts back into the food prep area, and takes your money. You and Chelsea stand off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMathis comes around a corner. His calm demeanor doesn't flicker when he sees you, nor when his eyes light on Chelsea. You try moving your head in a way that suggests you want a private conference in the back; Mathis leads you down a narrow corridor to one of his offices. He doesn't sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if it's alright,\" you stammer. \"I'm not going to be able to come in here anymore, it's complicated, but\u2014 This is, uh, Chelsea, and she's a friend, and she's going to be bringing you the, uh, the payments I owe and passing messages?\" You hate the interrogatory lilt you end your request with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMathis studies you and he studies Chelsea for a long time. Then he shrugs, as though the whole thing bores him. You mumble a thanks, and pull Chelsea back out. Your order is already waiting at the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He thinks you're my fucking bitch, you know that,\" you say as you settle into a booth with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs. \"And what he doesn't know is that you're <i>my</i> bitch.\"</span></div></div>",

I still have to remind myself, though\u2014\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cell phone chirps; She looks at it, and stabs it with a finger. <i>Not very dainty,</i> you reflect. <i>Is that how Chelsea does it, or how Chen does it?</i> Then you wonder what tiny little things of Chen's you've managed to miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Matthias?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen the one who <i>looks</i> like Matthias. Have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"What about the other one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs, says nothing, then leans forward to talk quietly and urgently. \"You know what sucks, what <i>fucking blows</i> about being here? All these fucking cunts just <i>waiting</i> for me to fuck up.\" She scoots forward, puts her chin in her hand, to speak in a quiet murmur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the fucking head cheerleader, right? I sure as fuck had better be dating the head of the basketball squad, you know? 'Cos the way everyone around here feels about the squad\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember the threats Kirkham levied against Jonas Martin and Luke Bennett yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, we're talking huge fucking prestige. So when the captain of the squad throws it all away, turns himself into a\u2014\" She snorts. \"I dunno. Maybe it's this cunt's instincts running all over me. I mean, I could give a shit. But it crawls all over me, knowing what they're thinking. I oughta be able to keep him in line. Look at me, look at this fucking body, this perfect body to fuck. If I can't make him shape up, if I can't whip him back into line, what does that say about <i>my</i> desirability?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty fucking desirable, dude. I'd throw you down on this table right now\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flips you off. \"Isn't there something you can do about Matthias?\" she asks. \"Something to give him so he can do Black's stuff on the court? 'Cos that's what he told me, that he can't do any of that shit, can't even dribble a\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that stuff's on the inside somewhere. He's just got the looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you give him implants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's complicated,\" you lie. \"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about undoing and doing it again, to give him a full package?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's complicated. I'd have to figure something out. By the way, should we be seen in public together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around, and catches sight of what you've glimpsed: Half a dozen tallish guys standing at the register. Most of them are in letterman jackets, the imperial purple and emerald green of Westside's crosstown rivals, Eastman High.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think they know who I am,\" she says, but pulls the ski cap down to her eyebrows and puts her chin back in her hand. \"But what can you do about\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I'd have to think about it. What can <i>you</i> do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe buries her face in her hands, ignores another ping from her cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't let my boyfriend go wandering off,\" she says. \"He's hanging out with Hennepin and them, you know. <i>That's</i> something you could do, you could scare him off of guys who are giving him\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can scare off <i>Gordon Black</i> from anything he wants to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can, he's not Black. He's got the parts, but he doesn't know what to do with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't?\" You grin. \"Is that something you've found out, him not knowing what to do with his parts when Chelsea\u2014 Aigh!\" You pull your foot back and nurse the spot where she kicked you. \"There's no use me talking to him. <i>You</i> gotta be thinking about what <i>Chelsea</i> would do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finishes your fries, and you finish your sandwich during the long silence that ensues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want some gossip about Chelsea?\" she says at last. \"I know you would, 'cos I know I would, but you keep your fucking mouth shut and don't make any stupid jokes about who I'm looking like, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't say 'em out loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glowers. \"Alright. You know how we heard her giggling the other day, when we caught her up in the loft?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Oh, no way. They were doing it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raises a claw at your face. \"No, did they have their fucking clothes off when we busted in on 'em? No, they were laughing because, God damn it, Chelsea was actually having fun with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean,\" she says, turning red, \"that she was actually liking the goofy Gordon Black more than the old one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Matthias is a lovable guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. Gordon's got this power, you know, big guy, takes no shit, stomps on the plebes, and Chelsea gets off on that. But he's got these goddamned moods, hates to go out, hates to party, just sits around and makes faces at everyone. Chelsea likes to party, and <i>I will rip your fucking balls off if you don't stop smirking.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou adjust your expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Matthias <i>loves</i> being with people, so suddenly Gordon loved being with people. So he was driving her crazy because he wasn't doing all the things she was telling him do, and he was fucking up the squad, and she was screaming at him over it, but all the time she was also digging the fact that he was finally fun to be with.\" She shudders all over. \"He was <i>cute</i> all of a sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suck thoughtfully on a tooth before speaking. \"I gotta tell you, man, this isn't the kind of gossip I'm really into. I was hoping you were going to tell me about all the dyke sex Chelsea's been secretly having with Kendra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Kendra!\" She shudders again. \"Never mind that. I guess, being where I am now, maybe I'm more interested in Chelsea's fucking moods than normal. Reason I told you, I guess, is because you asked what Chelsea would do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean she might stick with the new Gordon, have fun with him even thought he's\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea's expression grows very pinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or do you mean she'd break up with him? Is she that cold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" she hisses. \"I'm only telling you what Chelsea would do, not what <i>I</i> would do, or want to do. But this bitch wouldn't just dump him. She'd start going out with <i>Patterson.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rear back with surprise. \"You're fucking\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!\" She pulls you forward. Her cell pings again, but still she ignores it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not one fucking word, Prescott. Not one smirk, or joke, or even a fucking <i>thought.</i>\" She pushes you back. \"But she'd do it. To punish Black, to show everyone she's all about punishing people for fucking up the team, <i>and</i> to keep herself at the top, because Patterson's the new captain of the squad, and all the birds at school are perched and leaning forward, waiting to see if it sticks, if Black's gone for good. Then they'll all jump on Patterson\u2014\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes blaze. \"Oh, that fucking beanpole's gonna have three helpings of pussy a day for the rest of the year. He's gonna audition every fucking cunny in the school and give every one of them a call back just to be sure his dick remembers them right. That's what all these calls are about\u2014\" She gestures at the cell. \"Chelsea's gangbangers telling me who's been doing what and saying what, how they're jostling to the front of the line so they can be in position when the gun goes off. By Monday morning\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes a little noise in the back of her throat. It sounds like she's trying not to vomit. When she raises her face, she's gone very pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By Monday morning,\" she says, \"I'm gonna have to decide if I'm gonna take Patterson off the market pre-emptively.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou can't say you really sympathize with Chen, but you understand where he finds himself. And you don't tease him about it: it's not a good idea to piss him off. In fact, you tell him you've got a present that will make him feel better. He stares suspiciously when you hand over the ornately wrapped gift box you'd prepared just before this meeting. He gasps girlishly, though, on opening it. \"Where did you\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From Gardinhire, yesterday,\" you say. \"That's this month's profit he made off the Westside trade. I told you I could take care of things.\" <i>You don't mention the two-seventy you held back from his Eastman profits.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got other things to take care of,\" Chelsea says slyly, but smiles as she slips the box into a pocket. \"But this is a nice gesture. I'd kiss you, but\u2014\" She glances at the Eastman crew. \"Those guys <i>might</i> recognize me. They play for the Eastman squad.\" You glance over at them; it must be Chelsea's memories that recognize them, for their faces mean nothing to either brain inside your head. Bad luck for Eastman, though, you reflect; one of the guys has his arm in a sling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave soon afterward, and drive to the school to check on the fire; it's still burning. Your old house is nearby, and you find yourself thinking about Black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could, actually, transfer Black's memories and abilities into Dane's mask; you just didn't want to tell Chen that, at least not right away. It would be complicated, for you'd have to get Black alone, and get your mask off him, and use a brain band on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you think about it all, you find yourself wondering what's going on with him. He wasn't with Chen when he and Gardinhire and Matthias attacked you and Caleb. Of course, Chen didn't know at the time that \"Will Prescott\" was a fake. He knows that now, though. Does he care? Has he talked to Gordon? And if he has, what has Gordon said?</span></div></div>",

You wonder if Chen has said anything to him, about the masks and who victimized him. You're tempted to sound him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you decide to leave well enough alone. Bad enough that \"Will Prescott\" got suspended for a week for beating the crap out of Jason Lynch; you don't want him suspended for a month for doing the same to you if you got him pissed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you return to the job that was interrupted by lunch: making some brain bands. If Chen wants to put Evans and Thomason and Mendoza under some other faces, you can oblige. In fact, you've figured out a way to do so that won't disrupt things too badly. It'll be tricky, but\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, the trickiest part is that you have to work at home. To save money, you have to play nurse on Saturdays to your grandfather. Back at the house, you sit by his bedside and hunch over a metal strip, carving runes into it; the old man makes gabbling noises, and his arms sometimes flail, but he's mostly quiet, being distracted by the TV and the Chinese tele-dramas playing on the DVD player. Your mom asks you at one point what you're doing; you tell her it's for Marketing class, a fake product you have to invent and develop an ad campaign for. That wins her approval, though she plainly has no idea what kind of product you think you're developing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's long and tedious work, and by five o'clock you've only got two of them done. You text the three motherfuckers who help you deal, and tell them you're postponing the meeting until tomorrow afternoon. Your dad relieves you of nursing duties after supper, and you grab up homework\u2014so the excuse of a study session looks legitimate\u2014and race back over to the elementary school. There you're able to finish the third band and to make and buff three masks before knocking off at eleven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirkham calls at one point, interrupting you while you're still carving runes into the last brain band. \"The fuck are you doing?\" he asks. \"Thomason's on his way over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you need me for? You think my cock's tastier than his?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want this fucker over here. Come hang out here too, or take him off my hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So'm I. I'll come over and we'll get our shit done together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, this is solo work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long does it take you jack off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Longer when I've got your voice in my head. This weekend is shot for me, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got time for chollos like Mendoza. He told me you're supposed to hang out with him tomorrow, were supposed to hang out with him today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's business, and what I got going on is kicking my ass so hard I had to put it off. Next weekend I'll have a chubby you can blow, promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe signs off, grumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThomason and Mendoza, believe it or not, have church the next morning, so you won't be able to set up the meetings with them until two. You put the time to use, though, with another trip to the elementary school. Your heart leaps when you see that the fire is out, but the grimoire warned that it might need to be relit: the spell won't be complete until the pile doesn't relight. You toss a match onto it, and to your disappointment purple flames bloom off it. They continue to burn for the next five hours as you make and polish three more masks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it's time to meet with the dipshits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd staggered the meetings times in half hour increments, so that Evans arrives at two o'clock, thirty minutes before Mendoza is due, and an hour before Thomason. You're lurking by the corner of the gym when Evans pulls into the lot, and with a jerk of the head you lead him back past the tennis courts toward the portables. \"So, what's the deal?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're changing the network around, gonna set you guys up with some new markets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already have a good market,\" Evans says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're only selling six eighths a months,\" you tell him. \"You're gonna start selling three ounces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasps. \"I can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can, when you see how I've got it set up. In here.\" You open the door to the infamous portable for him. He goes inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow, and when you're over the doorstep you catch him from behind with a brain band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou catch Mendoza the same way at two-thirty, and Thomason at three. In Evans's and Mendoza's cases, after they recover to glare confusedly about, you tell them to \"go get a shake or a blow job someplace\" and to be back at three-fifteen. They're punctual, banging on the door to the portable just as Thomason is sitting up on the teacher's desk and looking around groggily. They look at you suspiciously as you beckon them inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shake it off, fuckers, and sit down. You're about to have your minds blown,\" you tell them from the front of the room. They look at each other, and shuffle into some desks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind where I found this stuff, or how I figured out how to do it,\" you continue. \"You ask me any questions like that, I already got an answer. The answer is 'Fuck you'. Understand? Your job is to do what I tell you, to fuck who I tell you, to fucking deal and roll like I tell you. You're gonna have fun, but you're working for me. I own your fucking souls now, with or without your permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes narrow, except for Evans, who just looks confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold up a brain band. \"You see this? You fucking see this, Mendoza? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glowers. \"A metal strip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what it looks like. Check out the other side.\" He catches your toss, and his eyes widen as he looks down at it. The other two, who flank him, lean in. Soft murmurs go up, and they take turns trying to touch the name GEORGE EDUARDO MENDOZA that floats in blue letters above its surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what that is?\" you ask them. \"That's your fucking brain, Mendoza, what there is of it. It's every memory you ever had, from the first birthday party you remember to the last time you jacked off, all the way up until two-thirty, when you walked through that door. That's what I did to you when you came in, I slapped that little motherfucker on your head. It's like a fucking memory stick, and it sucked up everything you got inside here.\" You point to your temple. \"It's a portable installation of George Eduardo\u2014nice middle name, by the way, asshole\u2014Mendoza. And I got one of you, and one of you, too.\" You toss brain bands to Evans and Thomason. Thomason hangs on to his. Evans drops his on the desk, and recoils from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's not all I lifted from you ass clowns.\" You hold up a mask, one of three that you made when you had them. \"Check it out, pretty cool, eh? Take a close look at it. You see a face inside it?\" You hand it to Mendoza, and the other two scoot in close to peer into it too. When their expressions change, you speak again. \"That's right, it's Thomason. I put a copy of his face in that thing. I put a copy of his whole body inside it. I'm an artist. Except I'm not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is magic, you faggots. What you're looking at is a magical disguise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nSo then you explain it to them, in broad terms, and answer the good questions you care to answer, and the bad questions with \"Fuck you, that's what.\" You explain that the brain bands copy brains and the masks copy bodies; that you can put the two of them together to make a perfect disguise; and you let Mendoza, who's the smallest of the trio, put on the mask of Thomason, who's the tallest. \"Go on, touch him, feel him, rub him, like you want to, you homos. Feel yourself up, Thomason, give yourself a blow job.\" They all look very green, but also fascinated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now here's what we're going to do,\" you tell them. \"These brain bands, they're only good up until three o'clock. They don't got any of your memories after that, which means they don't got any memories of what I just told you. Now, what we're going to do is, we're going to put Thomason's brain band and Thomason's mask together, and we're going to put it on someone else. Not one of you faggots, but on another poor asshole at this school. And he's gonna wake up and find that he's got Thomason's body and Thomason's brain, and he's gona have no choice but to go around jacking off like he's Joseph Terrence Thomason. He's gonna take your place, fucker, and for lack of anything better to do, he's gonna act like you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou poke Thomason in the chest. \"And <i>you</i> are going to take his place, because we're going to make a mask and brain band of that poor fucker. We're going to turn <i>you</i> into him. You're gonna replace him, and you're gonna start dealing as him. Dealing more than you ever did, because he'll be in a better position to make us some serious cash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Thomason says in a voice that is very weak. \"Who am I\u2014?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part of that's your choice.\" You gaze around the room. \"One of you is gonna transfer to Eastman, turn himself into a fucker over there named Chris Trantham. Another one of you is gonna move down to the junior class, take over for Kevin Hall. The last one of you\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou haven't quite decided, for you're torn by two choices. One is Justin Roth, who you'd already identified as a good potential dealer. But if you can get away with it, you'd really like to turn the third guy into Andrea Varnsworth.</span></div></div>",

Also: \"Think about movin' to Eastman, man, put some distance 'tween you and this shithole.\" You suggest to Thomason that he should be a gambling man, aim for something big with the \"mystery guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of fraught and agonized and silent pondering they give you their ballots. \"Don't look so sick, man,\" you tell Evans. \"Your life'll still be there when you're done, this is just till the end of December, maybe a few weeks into January. That's how come we give the other guy your brain, so he knows how to be you. It's just a vacation for you man. Or a secret mission.\" You grin. \"Don't you wanna be a spy, go undercover? Fuck, man, at the end of this maybe you won't even want to go back to bein' yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvans doesn't look much comforted by this, but Thomason perks up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open their ballots. They're not much of a surprise. Evans put all of his votes toward escaping your influence: eleven for Trantham. Mendoza split his six for Hall and five for Trantham. Thomason voted five for Hall, four for the mystery guest, and only two for Trantham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You win Trantham,\" you tell Evans. \"Keep your phone on, I'll call with the plan for how we're gonna pull off the switcheroo. Probably tomorrow after classes, in here, so don't make plans for four o'clock or anything. Mendoza, you got Hall, I know you can talk to him. Call him tonight, try to set up a meeting with him in the morning. Tell him you want to talk to him here at the portables around eight or eight-fifteen. Call me back with what he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you two can go, I got more business with Thomason here. And remember,\" you warn them as they reach the door. \"Not a word about this to anyone, and don't think you can get away from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fucked up,\" says Thomason when they're gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you're interested, I saw it in your eyes,\" you reply. You sit on the desk in front of him. \"Now, I told you you're gonna have a choice. Both of 'em are nice, you'll like 'em, but one of 'em's kinda weird.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomason stiffens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, first choice is Justin Roth. You know Roth, good-lookin' fucker, smart, but hangs out with a bad crowd, hangs out with fuckers like you and me. But he gets laid, man, I hear he's got pussy coming and going. I ain't a faggot, but I look at him and I can believe it.\" You poke Thomason. \"You, I know <i>you</i> know a good-lookin' dude when you see one.\" He flushes as you grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the dividend for you,\" you continue. \"The point is I want him to start dealin' for me. You and Evans and Mendoza, you don't got charm, you 'specially, you're kinda scary lookin'. You look like a fuckin' skin-head.\" It's true: Thomason is tall and thin and white and blue-eyed, but there's a cadaverous look to his eyes, and his white-blonde hair is shaved almost to the scalp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Roth,\" you tell him. \"People love Roth, they think he's cool. If he offers to sell them something, they think, 'Man, how cool is that that Justin wants to sell me something, he'll think I'm cool if I buy it.' You'd be popular, man, more popular than Trantham or Kevin Hall.\" You wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Thomason does look intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other one,\" you continue. \"The other one is cool too. Great body, great face, lots of fuckers just dying to rub up against 'em. Almost as popular as Roth, even better looking. 'Specially in the boobage area.\" You mime fondling some hefty funbags. \"Andrea Varnsworth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomason rears back as though slapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, don't think I'm gonna think you're queer or anything if you go for Andrea,\" you tell him. \"The way I see it, the way I <i>think</i> about it, what straight motherfucker wouldn't want to be Andrea? You ever fantasize about playing with those tits, fingering that pussy?\" You slap him in the chest. \"You could do that, every night and five times on Sundays, if you were her. Layin' in her bed, runnin' your fingers up and down her body.\" You moan with erotic anguish. \"And in the daytime, too. Pulling on that swimsuit, sliding through the water, having it rub all up and down your body, then washing it off in the showers, squeezing it off your boobs and ass and legs. In the girls' shower, too, with the other girl swimmers.\" You massage his shoulder. \"Gets you hot and bothered just thinkin' about it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, mystery choice is the right one, there ain't a wrong choice to be made here. I'll leave you to think about it for a few minutes.\" You retreat to the back of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you wait for only about two or three minutes before you decide: He wants Andrea, but he's too shy to say so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe half-turns as you come up beside him. \"You decided yet?\" you ask. His shoulders jerk. \"I think you should take Andrea. It'd be a hell of a lot of fucking fun, more fun that your sad little friends are gonna have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomason looks up at you. His eyes are wet. And they seem filled with gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBut you still have to capture these targets, and you call Evans after Thomason has left, to give him Trantham's contact info, which you'd looked up. \"Tell him you want to meet him at Westside, in the student parking lot, at four tomorrow afternoon,\" you tell him. \"Tell him you need to talk to him about Gardinhire. He'll know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you do wonder as you put the cell away: Evans is easily the dumbest of the bunch; can he possibly handle Eastman the way you know it needs handling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it's something to worry about later. After talking to him you race back to the elementary school. You pause as you look the basement over from the top of the stairs. You can't put your finger on it, but you've a feeling that someone has been inside; things aren't quite the way you remember leaving them. Maybe it's just paranoia. But instead of working here, as you'd intended to do, tending the fire, you return home. First, though, you stop at an office supply store, and make a phone call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou have to wait forty minutes behind a shopping center a few blocks from downtown before Dwayne Macauly shows up. You don't say anything to him, though, for you're sitting about fifty yards away, watching from your Jeep, as he pulls up next to a dumpster. He gets out of his car, goes behind it, and reappears with a brand-new metal briefcase. He gets back in his car. Your phone buzzes with a text: \"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply: \"Gear, not 4U. Need out of house. 5 days max.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long pause. Then: \"OK\". He drives off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a risk giving the grimoire to Macauly, even locked in that metal briefcase, but you think you can trust him. Even if he busted it open, he'd just find an old book that he'd regard as probably nothing but a valuable artifact. He might demand some money from you, but that's all. In your text to him, you promised him a hundred bucks just to hold it: money you'd put in an envelope taped to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't drive off immediately after he does; paranoia has too great a hold on you. You spend five minutes pretending to text, then go inside the comic book shop you're parked in front of. The owner is a Korean-American, a fact known to you though not to Gary Chen, and you affect surprise and pleasure at making his acquaintance. Eric Kim is the dopiest guy you've ever met, and you don't have to talk to him long to sense that Chen's psyche is forming the same opinion, but you keep it friendly, and even buy a handful of titles that he recommends to you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eight-ten, Monday morning. You're at the corner of the gym nearest the tennis court, gulping down hot, bitter coffee and chain-smoking cigarettes. Exhaustion claws at the bags around your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't go to sleep last night. After tearing through your homework while babysitting your grandfather, you'd retired to the \"bedroom\" to polish off what remained of your schoolwork with no qualm about its accuracy, then shoved it away and until six-thirty carved runes into the three brain-bands you'd prepared. With the container of glue you attached them into three blank masks, and attached the bands of Evans, Mendoza and Thomason into their masks. You were reeling, but a hard, cold shower revived you enough to propel you through breakfast and out the door. You were at the school by eight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're waiting impatiently for fucking Mendoza to show up. In that time you see Jacob May, and arrange to sell him three eighths at lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMendoza finally shows, and with heavy feet and ankles and legs you lead him back to the first portable. \"Bring him back here,\" you tell him, referring to Kevin Hall. \"You do like I did to you yesterday. You let him go in first, then grab his chest from behind and bring the mask around like this.\" You demonstrate, clasping his chest from behind with your left arm and putting your right palm over his face. \"Lay him down, whistle for me. I'll be over there, waiting.\" You give him a querying look\u2014surely he can pull this off\u2014and hand him one of the blanks when he nods. An encouraging clap on the arm sends him back toward the gym while you duck around a corner. You squat in the grass, set the coffee to the side, and light another cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is brutal, man,</i> and you're not thinking of your victims. Trying to get this shit done in one day? Fucking brutal. But if not now, when? You got maybe two hours after school before you have to be up at the country club, to work until midnight. And homework after that. You exhale a stream of smoke and rub your nose. Then what? Five hours sleep, if you're lucky, before Tuesday starts. If you don't take care of business today, Tuesday would be the earliest you could do it, and that's too much time for your bitches to dig in their heels. Hustle 'em into it, that's the only way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven then you won't be done, because today you can only get Trantham and Hall. You could probably get Roth too, if you'd pushed Thomason in that direction. Luckily, it looks like he's beguiled enough by the idea of Andrea Varnsworth that you can let him dangle a bit longer. You close your eyes, pondering how to get her. Your head droops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerk it back up as you feel yourself fading. Also, there are voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuys' voices. You raise up, alert. Cheerful, laughing voices. They don't sound like Hall and Mendoza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aw, Christ, not this.</i> Adrian Semple and Keith Hennepin appear around the corner. You fly into their faces. \"Hey, faggots, who the fuck said to come back here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSemple blinks in surprise, but his grin doesn't fade. It does vanish, though, when you shove him into a wall. Hennepin steps forward, but you slap him across the cheek with your left hand and show him the bunched up fist you've made with your right. \"I asked who the fuck told you to come back here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we can\u2014\" Semple starts to stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I said you fuckin' can't. We got a fuckin' campus big enough for twelve hundred assholes, you gotta be back here?\" You grasp Hennepin's skinny throat and force him backwards. \"You walk back where you came from, you little shit-dribble, and you go put your fucking head in a fucking toilet, and you flush it till you got yourself a perm. You do that now, cocksucker, or I'll do it to you every day for the rest of the month.\" You shove him away. \"Semple, same goes for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, man, you don't gotta\u2014 Okay, I'm going!\" He runs past, shielding his face and head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothin' personal, man, see you at lunch,\" you call after them, but they just hurry away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pass Mendoza and Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back around the corner to your waiting spot. The confrontation with Keith and Adrian jammed some adrenaline through you, but it's left you weak and shaky, for your exhausted constitution can barely handle the rush. You swallow most of the rest of the coffee, and make a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Mendoza and Hall talking gruffly. You wonder vaguely what story Mendoza told Hall to get him back here. Hall uses, but Mendoza isn't his supplier. Do they share a class? That would be awkward after the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour meditation is interrupted by a low whistle; you jog around the corner and into the portable as Mendoza holds the door open for you. Hall is just inside the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's a junior, and he's not especially big, but like his brother Nathan he plays for the varsity football squad. His hair is honey brown in color; it's short and straight, but twists away into curls at the ends. His features are regular, and his face is thinner than his brother's, and he wouldn't be a bad-looking son of a bitch except that his expression settles rather too easily into a scowl; and he has a reputation for being mean\u2014gleefully so. He's dressed in half-assed gangbanger attire: floppy shorts that drape below the knee, socks that come right halfway to the hems of the shorts, gaudy sneakers, a t-shirt that hangs past the end of his butt. \"Take your clothes off,\" you tell Mendoza as you seize one of Hall's feet. \"Then help me get this fucker undressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou've had so much practice by now that it almost goes as clockwork: Undress the victim, redress him in your partner's clothes while your partner dresses in his; send your partner to another portable; take the mask from the victim when it reappears on his face; seal it up while he's still unconscious; before he stirs, drop your partner's mask onto him. Within ten minutes, George Mendoza, looking just as he did when you met him at eight-fifteen, is sprawled on the floor as you shut the portable door on him. You rap on the door of the portable opposite and let yourself in. Mendoza, looking perfectly at home in Hall's clothes, looks up at your entrance. He's much calmer than you'd expected him to be. \"Drop on the floor, this'll only take a minute.\" He obliges, and you drop Hall's mask onto him. Then you pinch his nose shut; a moment later he's up again, sputtering and coughing. But it's Kevin Hall gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna take you a little while to get used to your new brain,\" you tell him as he blinks manically at you. You squat by him and grab him by the hair. \"You hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah, take me a little while to, uh, get used to\u2014\" He blinks. \"My new brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. You gotta concentrate on it, use it, make it your own. So you go over there, under that desk\u2014\" You point to the teacher's desk. \"You hide there until the start of second period. You think about all the classes you're gonna be taking. Who you see in them, who your friends are, what your homework is. You think about your brother, you think about your parents, what you did this weekend. You think about the football team and who's on it. Also, and this is important, you think about where they're gettin' their weed from, who's using, who's paying, how much, to who? I wanna know the demand structure of the football team, inside and out. Make notes, practice your penmanship.\" You kick Hall's bag. \"When second period bell rings, you go to class, go to classes the rest of the day, you <i>be</i> Kevin Hall, as much and as hard as you can. You send me a text if there's an emergency. Otherwise, I don't wanna hear from you for at least twenty-four hours.\" You slap him lightly. \"Make this work, pendejo, I'm counting on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods dutifully, and you leave him as he scrambles over to that desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, you glance around. No one is in view. You swing your pack onto your shoulder, and as the warning bell for first period rings you trudge off toward English, where Ms. Gladstone doesn't let you sleep, no matter how boring the subject matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou do catch a break second period. You cannot possibly make it through two periods of soccer practice, but you're not going to show yourself weak in front of Garner. But he notices the sag in your shoulder while changing out after first and pulls you aside to ask what the trouble is. You confess you didn't sleep last night; he regards you gravely, then goes to talk to Coach Gellman, who gives you a pass to the library for the two periods. You gratefully accept, and pass out for a hundred minutes in a back corner, waking only briefly at the changeover to fourth when May shakes your shoulder and swaps three fifties for three baggies; you go back to sleep, and sleep through fifth as well. That gives you enough rest to get you through AP Statistics and Physics II, which are dry, serious classes of sustained concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost skip Orchestra practice, but suck it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's where you hear the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the girls chattering about it, of course: Eva Garner, Danielle Davis, Audrey Briscoe, others. Brent Pruitt lurks near the little knot, listening intently. At first you pay no attention, but something about their enthusiasm for the subject finally draws your interest. It takes you awhile to piece it together, for you don't interrupt to ask them what the news is. But gradually it dawns on you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea Cooper has dumped Gordon Black's sorry ass curbside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle quietly to yourself and listen some more, but there's no mention of Steve Patterson. Did she not ask him out, as Gordon's replacement, as she told you Saturday she'd likely have to do? It would be hilarious if he rejected her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evans had texted you during the day to say that Trantham would be over to the school at a little after four. You meet him outside B wing at three-forty. \"What did you tell him,\" you ask as you lead him toward the portables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you told me,\" he says, looking very anxious. \"That I wanted to talk to him about Gardinhire. He wanted to know why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't tell him? Good. Well, when he gets here\u2014\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear voices coming from the portables. <i>Fuck.</i> You peer around a corner and spot Justin Roth, Shep Tsosie and Tim Gerard. Laughing, passing around a joint, and blocking your way. There's no telling how long they'll be there. You pull Evans back to where no one can see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, when Trantham gets here, tell him that Gardinhire is getting out of the business, but that you can step in to keep him supplied. Ask him what he's paying, for how much. No matter what he says, tell him that if ups his order by three ounces, you'll cut his price by a ten percent an ounce. He'll probably argue he can't do that, 'cos he's incompetent, but you just keep making promises and negotiating with him. Doesn't matter what you say. But all the time you're talking\u2014don't stop for <i>nothing</i>\u2014you lead him back here, back to the portable where we had our conference yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then when you get him inside and the door's closed, you take him from behind like this.\" You show him the move, like you showed Mendoza. \"Lay him on the floor and take his clothes off. God, don't be such a fucking pussy about it, okay?\" You sneer at his expression of distaste. \"I'll give you ninety seconds exactly to pull this shit off, then I'll come in and join you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on what Roth and them are up to. If they're still here, I'll be yukking it up with them. Otherwise I'll be in another portable. But I'll be watching and I'll join you, help you finish up. Okay? Go wait for him.\" You push him back toward B wing. Then with a deep sigh you walk out to meet the other three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoth looks up with a friendly smile as you approach; Tsosie, who is always a lot more circumspect than his friends, only gives you a flat, mica-colored glance. Gerard leans away. \"Ladies,\" you say as you squat next to them. \"How's the pussy business?\" Roth guffaws, and hands the joint over to Shep. You take out a cigarette. \"Likin' school so much you can't leave it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you still doing here?\" Roth asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waitin' for someone. Business. You know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. Roth takes the joint back from Tsosie, takes a deep toke, muses on it. \"If we're in your way, we can take off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd appreciate it. You don't gotta go yet. It'll be fifteen, twenty minutes before he shows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Gerard asks, like the utter tool he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Franny Upshaw,\" you reply. \"Know her? Hot little number. Smoking body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks confused. \"I thought you said it was a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't paying attention,\" you say. Out of the corner of your eye you notice Roth grinning to himself. \"Lemme explain. Franny Upshaw. That's short for Francine Upshaw. Initials F. U.\" You draw down a solid quarter inch of the cigarette and expel the smoke in Gerard's face. \"Ever heard of F.U.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoth laughs hoarsely as Gerard looks away. \"You are one fucking funny son of a bitch,\" Roth says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But I ain't got nothin' to contribute to this conversation. You guys carry on. Sounds like you were having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you've killed the talk and the mood. When it resumes, it's classes and teachers and homework. Only at the end does a note of gossip catch your interest. \"You gonna go find Dane,\\?\" Roth asks Gerard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's being weird,\" Gerard says. \"Weirder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's being <i>sober.</i>\" That causes Roth to gasp asthmatically with laughter. \"I'm serious. Today, in History, he was raising his hand every couple minutes with questions. And they were show-offy questions, like he already knew the answers and just wanted everyone to know it. Like, isn't it true that Georgia was originally a penal colony, like Australia? I mean, who asks shit like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penile?\" asks Tsosie. \"You mean like <i>cock?</i>\" And with much laughter the subject shifts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nEventually there are footsteps, and Tanner Evans and Chris Trantham come into view. \"Hey, I know that guy,\" says Gerard, and waves at Trantham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dudes,\" you say in a heavy voice. That at first draws bewildered stares; then Roth sighs deeply, and with a groan gets to his feet, dusting himself elaborately off. Tsosie and Gerard follow his cue; and only a minute after Evans and Trantham have disappeared into the portable, you are alone on the grass. You nurse the last of the cigarette, grind it out, and walk into the portable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nChris Trantham isn't fat, not in the conventional sense, but he is pear-shaped, with a wide bottom and a paunch that droops toward his dick. He is blonde, with long hair that he pulls back over his ears and down to the bottom of his neck. He dresses down in sloppy khakis and long-sleeve shirts, has a weedy moustache, and wears glasses. His ears are too big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, he'll be a step up for the pimply-faced, beetle-browed Tanner Evans. Evans, though, is looking a little sick as he squats nakedly beside the naked Trantham. \"Smart of you,\" you say. \"I didn't tell you to get undressed, but you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talked to, uh, Kevin Hall\u2014\" He pauses with evident confusion about which name to use for his friend. \"After first. He told me basically what would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then help me get him dressed in your stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Trantham is quite a bit bigger and heavier than Evans, that's a formidable task, but you get it done before the mask comes out of him; then Evans gets in Trantham's voluminous clothes. You tell your fellow conspirator to keep an eye on Trantham for reviving consciousness while you creep into a corner, out of sight, to seal up the inside of the mask. You end by dropping Evans's mask onto Trantham, Trantham's onto Evans; and you wake the latter quickly with the standard suffocation trick. He looks very confused as he rises\u2014and to prevent worse confusion, you shield the sight of the Tanner Evans on the floor\u2014and push him outside. In a tight space between two neighboring portables you give him a lecture like the one you gave Hall. <i>Go someplace quiet and lonely, concentrate on getting memories back, review Trantham's life, rehearse the fact that he is now Chris Trantham.</i> To your surprise, he asks one very penetrating question, albeit in a tone of quiet horror: \"Am I going to forget who I really am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" you tell him. \"Anyway, we'll be getting together, and I'll keep reminding you.\" <i>Like Chen keeps reminding me that I'm Will Prescott.</i> \"By the way, you're going to see me tonight at the country club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, yes. Don't be late. Oh, and when we have our smoke break, I want you to hand over a list of everyone that Trantham's being selling to over at Eastman. And the next time after that we talk, I want you to tell me about the whole social scene over there. Who's connected to who, who might be interested in buying, everything. Full web.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods, and you push him away. You yourself return via A wing to the front of the school, and take the long way back around to the student lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou're very tired by now, but not loopy as you were during first, and you get some energy at the Panda Garden, where you eat in. It may be the largest Chinese restaurant in the city, with a massive open dining room and buffet space, but at four forty-five, just before the dinner time crowd starts showing up, it's comparatively empty. Aunt Sue personally brings out some lunchtime leftovers for you. \"How is your grandfather?\" she asks with brusque interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same old same old,\" you shrug. It's never been explained to you why Aunt Sue and Uncle Lee don't help support the old man. So far as you can gather, it goes back to some kind of bad business relationship between the your dad and uncle (who are only brothers-in-law). Whether Mr. Chen has refused help, or whether Uncle Lee has refused to provide it, you don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where you going after here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. The country club. When you getting a job on wait staff there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When I can pass as a fuck named Chip Havenhurst,</i> you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think only kids whose parents are members get hired as waiters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe your mom and dad could join,\" she says. \"Or your uncle and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That would be hilarious,</i> you think bitterly. Especially in your Aunt Sue's case. Her accent is still easily detectable, especially when she starts cursing the kitchen help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chats with you a little longer, then leaves you to play with your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's one message from Thomason: <i>Everything OK?</i> You text back, <i>Sure, hang loose.</i> Nothing from the Mendoza or Evans numbers. You decide to wait until tomorrow before inquiring after your bitches' replacements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there is one message from Chelsea Cooper. You tense all over at the sight of the sender's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChances are she's just checking up on progress. It'll just be gossip, right, about the way \"she\" dumped \"Gordon Black\" as her boyfriend. It's gotta be bullshit, you can safely ignore it until tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan't you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris Trantham is in the locker room of the country club when you arrive, and he does at double-take at your entrance. He turns back to his locker, and looks very shy, but you can tell he's thinking about saying something. You ignore him, and to drive the point home even more, you move into the restroom to do most of your changing. Then it's into the kitchen, where everyone is too busy for much talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch him closely, though, to see how he's doing. The real Trantham is always quiet and a little slow, slower than Jose likes when a crush of dishes comes in or when you have to sweep into a dining room to help with a change. The new one is slower still, and you keep close to him, burning your last reserves so you can help him out. It grinds on your patience to do this, and you snap at him hard when he drops a tray full of knives on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNine-thirty comes, and it's time for your smoke break with Manny; you postpone it, though, and tell him you'll stick it out to ten-thirty, when Chris takes his. \"Trantham don't smoke,\" he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His not-smoking break, then. Come on, I'm helping cover for him, he's being a fucking butterfingers tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's on thin ice. Tell him so from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo at ten-thirty you squat behind the kitchen with your new confederate. \"Get your head where it needs to be, man,\" you tell him as you light a cylinder. \"Trantham's always on the edge of losing his job here. You need to be better than him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try,\" he says. \"Oh, I made a list for you, like you asked.\" He hands you a sheet of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job. Fuck me, excellent job,\" you add as you glance over it. It's covered top to bottom and back to front: Names, in caps, embedded in whole paragraphs. \"Do I thank you or do I thank him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, I dunno. Not him, I don't think. Putting it together, it was\u2014 Well, it was like studying a subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he reaches for your cigarette, and you remind him he doesn't smoke. \"Jose noticed, bet others do too. Get in character. Night's sleep might do you good. How's your new life look from the other side? You play in that band, what are they called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Hi-Hats. It's okay.\" A tone of quiet desperation creeps into his voice. \"I hope I can remember how to play before practice tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sellin' to any of the guys in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two of them, but mostly I sell to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it in these notes? Then I'll read it there. Listen\u2014\" You draw the cigarette down to the filter, then grind it under your toe. \"You just stay under deep cover, send me texts if there's a serious problem, otherwise just settle in, get your head inside Trantham's. We'll talk later about a meet-up time on the weekend. And don't worry too much about being convincing. You got Trantham's head in there, he'll carry you. But the face is ninety percent of the disguise. That's what people see and believe. Even if you fuck up, they'll just be mad at you. And if they're mad at you?\" You clap him on the shoulder. \"Fuck 'em.\" You pull him back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBeing utterly worn out, you fall asleep as soon as you get home. It's a shorter night than you'd like, being behind by a full night's sleep, but you're at eighty-five percent, you feel, as you head out the door the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd checked the message from Chelsea late last night: <i>Call me, urgent.</i> You'd cussed. If Chen wanted you to see an urgent message he should have put \"urgent\" in the subject line. Does he expect you to leap just because he's got boobs now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your exasperation doubles when the phone buzzes on your drive to school. <i>Never mind,</i> says the new text from Chelsea. Great, does that mean the problem went away or that Chen is passive-aggressively baiting you for being late? You swing by the old elementary school on your way out, and as you sit outside the door you text her back: <i>Didn't read texts till midnite, busy all day w/ your hos then work. Things OK or not?</i> The reply comes a minute later, after you've relit the pile of dirt. <i>OK, mayB best u not c txt.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fucking cunt.</i> Must be seriously turning into Chelsea if he's going to be such a ditz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou study the burning pile, which still gives off no heat. The mass of dirt has congealed into a rough cylindrical shape, and some rents and fissures have opened up in its sides and at one end. You hope that doesn't mean the thing, whatever it's turning into, is defective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<i>First period.</i> You stop dead in the classroom door as Faith Becker, Molly Shaw, and Mindy McAdams swivel at your entrance. Their eyes pop and shine, and they giggle, and Mindy runs her tongue over her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Are they serious?</i> you gasp to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out they're not. Not about you, anyway. A rough blow almost sends you sprawling into Fred Hildown's lap, and only some quick footwork keeps you upright as you stagger against the back wall. \"Move it, stir fry,\" says Steve Patterson as he swaggers into the room. The eyes of all the girls are upon him, but he coolly ignores them in a way that still acknowledges their admiring stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin Roth and Adrian Semple give you a commiserating glance as you drop into a desk in their company. Luke Bennett's expression is stony. Hildown just looks down into his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarson Ioeger stares back at you with pale, quivering horror, but turns abruptly away before you can rebuke him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<i>Soccer practice.</i> George Mendoza is there. Or, someone who looks like him is there. In reality, it's Kevin Hall (trapped under a mask) a few lockers down in the changing room, keeping his eyes straight ahead as he ignores the horseplay around him. You're relieved to see that Hall is following Mendoza's instincts and memories, and going to his classes without prodding. But you need to test him, to see how far he can play his new character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chance comes about halfway through practice, when the ball is down at the other end of the field. You drift over to Mendoza. \"How's your supply holdin' out,\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flinches as though touched by a hot match. \"It's holding out,\" he stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want it holding out, I want it moving,\" you tell him. \"You do too, the more you move, the more cerveza-and-lime money you get. How many you sold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chuck Johnson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sold him two?\" You spit when he nods. \"You're fucking lying to me, Mendoza, you sold one of 'em to yourself. Which is okay, I don't mind how much you smoke so long as you give me twenty-four a month for your bag. But you make sure Chuckie Johnson and Bucky Penis or whoever the fuck you're blowing out in the animal pens is buying too. I'm raising your fucking quota next month, from six to twenty-four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I can't\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can. You just gotta convince Chuckie and Bucky and Muckie that ganja tastes better than cow anus. Watch out, here they come.\" The game returns to your part of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nYou go off by yourself at lunch to think, for you need to find an angle that'll let you swap Thomason in for Varnsworth. Thomason seems vexed too, for he comes looking for you, and finds you behind the music wing, smoking and chewing on a sandwich. He just nods in greeting, though, as he slides down the wall and opens his own sack lunch. \"You seen Evans's ugly face around?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His face, not his ass. And I'm not talkin' about the asshole hanging out at Eastman,\" you add in a lower voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chews thoughtfully. \"I don't have him until seventh. By the way, how are we gonna talk about each other, keep from being confused?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We call people by their faces. The guy I saw at practice this morning? That's George Mendoza. The fucker I'll talk to later this afternoon after ball practice? That's Kevin Hall. The sorry shit I work with at the country club, that goes to Eastman? That's Chris Trantham. The guy you'll see in seventh, that's Fuckface Evans. So you haven't seen him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" He swallows. \"When does my name change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to think of a way. You have her for any classes, ever bump into her regularly, got any friends in common?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Am I shit out of luck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. I gotta friend maybe I can call in a favor from.\" You're wondering if Chen, from his position as Chelsea, could help. \"Meantime, you play it cool with Evans and Mendoza, like nothing's changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's creepy. That's why I left 'em, came looking for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally, they're a coupla creeps, just like you. Wait, they're eating together now? Alone? Fuck.\" You jump up. \"We better go sit between 'em, make sure they're not comparing notes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Thomason puts away his lunch and follows. As you walk toward E wing, where you know they like to lurk, Thomason asks in a low voice, \"Are you gonna be switching faces with anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't. Can't leave my face on autopilot like I did with you fuckers. Got too much stuff upstairs I can't have anyone learning about.\" <i>Like where the real Gary Chen is, for a start.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why you probably need to get his help with the last switchover.</span></div></div>",

Add quartz, ice and parchment. Run fingertip twice around sigil. Breath upon bowl. Run fingertip once around sigil. Put mirror on sigil. Pour bowl over mirror. Set flame to mirror. Polish the receptacle. Put the receptacle onto the face. It will absorb the imago and copy the person.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom half of the page is taken up with a sigil. It consists of two circles of nearly the same size, one enclosing the other, to make something resembling a rimmed wheel. Inside the rim (the 1/2-inch space between the circles) are inscribed intricate symbols resembling Hebrew or Arabic or Sanskrit. Similar symbols are inscribed along the inner surface of the innermost circle, and around the outer surface of the outermost circle. The interior of the circle is empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen performed, the ingredients the bowl form a kind of sludge. The ice when added will cause the stuff in the bowl to pop and bang loudly, and an acrid, smelly smoke will pour out. When everything else has been added, the mixture will bubble like thick oatmeal. When poured over the mirror, it will instantly harden into a shell that conforms to the shape of the mirror. When a flame is set to the shell, it will catch fire and ghostly blue flames will dance over it for fifteen minutes before winking out. The hardened mixture is a dull gray color and cool to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen pulled off the mirror, it will retain the hemispheric shape, then will suddenly snap into the shape of a mask, complete with brow, nose, mouth, chin, and cheekbones. The eyes will be solid, however. The mask has the feel and lightness of alabaster and is an off-white color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the mask it made it must be polished until it is a burnished blue (the color of a deep blue sky) on both sides. This will take twenty-four hours cumulative work by hand with a cloth, or forty-five minutes work with a car buffer or rock polisher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the mask is polished, it can be placed upon the face of a person. It will sit there briefly, then sink into them and vanish. They will be unconscious and unresponsive for up to ten minutes. Then the mask will appear on their face. To the person, it will feel as though they have been dragged into (and woken up from) an extremely deep sleep, but the experience will not be unpleasant (unless they are easily panicked by momentary paralysis, and an awareness that they are losing consciousness. The mask will have acquire their <i>imago,</i> and by studying the mask one will be able to dimly make out their features inside the mask, as streaks of light inside it. Turning the mask in one way or another will enable you to glimpse the side of their head or the top of their bare shoulders and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, a mask-shaped stain will appear in the book, on the page containing the first spell.
