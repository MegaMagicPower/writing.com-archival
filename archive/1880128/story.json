The last remaining member of the Seiryu clan. Which once was the clan of the mightiest warriors to ever exist. You had a mother, a father, a brother that had the same age as you, a younger sister (3 years younger) and an older sister (1 year older). When you were 5 years old, your family and your clan were murdered by an extremely powerful demon named \"Dark Dream\" (think of a fusion between Nightmare and Black Heart) and his three groups of followers, The Band of Seven (Inuyasha), The Juppongatana (Rurouni Kenshin) and The Darkling Lords (Visionaires: Knights of the Magical Light). The village where you lived had impenetrable barriers. Outsiders could only come in if either, the barrier was lifted or the outsider was in the company of someone from of the clan. Thus you had no idea of how the enemies had entered the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You saw everything. No one was supposed to be spared. All the men were tortured and brutally killed, while the women were raped, tortured and, only then, killed. And, what was worse, when the demons attacked your house, you found out something horrible. You found out how the enemies had entered the village. Standing there, besides Dark Dream, was your brother, smiling. You knew what that meant. He had betrayed you and the clan. When they were leaving, the only words you managed to say to him were:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Why, brother? Why?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as the last amount of life within you began to fade, you heard a voice calling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Can you hear me, little one?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear the voice. From the way it sounded, it was female, no doubt. It sounded gentle, caring and warm. But you were very weak so you couldn't move very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"W-who are you? What do you want?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Fear not, little one. I'm not here to harm you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the woman revealed herself to you and you felt an aura envelop you. And, before you knew it, you were completely healed. The woman was beautiful, to say the least. Her hair was golden in color and reached the end of her back. Her eyes were sea-blue. She had what looked like a crown on her head and a scepter in her left hand. She was dressed in what looked like roman robes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Please, little one, listen to me. You need to keep living.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Why should I? I have nobody. Almost every one I cared for is dead. And the only one who's still alive betrayed me. I have no reason to go on.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"That's not true.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"How so?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"The demon that led this attack is planning to do what he did to your clan to the rest of the world.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"That's not possible. My family nearly killed him.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"True. The fight with your family inflicted a big defeat on him. But he will recover. And when he does, he'll be even stronger than what he was now.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"And you want me to fight him, don't you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Yes. With the proper training, I think you can defeat him, in the future. I can help you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"How? How can you help me? Who are you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"My name is Aqua Regina. And I am the goddess of the sea.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"The goddess of the sea?! But, if your a goddess, why don't you simply destroy or vanish that Dark Dream?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Because, right now, I am not strong enough to do so. I am only a spirit. I can heal and teach you to control your powers. But I can not directly interfere with humans or other creatures. Not yet.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"What do you mean \"not yet\"?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"For me to regain my power and to be able to vanish Dark Dream,  the seven mermaid princesses must reunite, unify the power of their pearls and summon me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Seven mermaid princesses?! Mermaids are real?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Yes, Leon. They are.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"How do you know my name?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"I always knew. I have been watching you since you were born.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I see. You said they are seven mermaids princesses. So, if I'm guessing right, each one represents one of the seven seas and each one has a pearl, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Exactly. You are very smart, despite being so young.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Thank you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"You are welcome. So? Are you going to help me? I won't force you. But you must make your choice now.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even needed to think about it. That monster had killed your most beloved ones and he planned to do so to the entire world. You couldn't let that happen. Not to mention that you wanted to avenge your clan's death. Also, despite the fact that what your brother did was beyond monsterous, you wanted to know why he did it. You had to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I have made my choice.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"What have you decided, Leon?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she asked that, you kneeled in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I will help you, Aqua Regina-sama.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at you and teleported you to a world where you could train all you wanted, without risk of causing harm to something or someone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*present day, year 2011*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You are now 17 years old, your 18th birthday being in a couple of weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You were taking a walk along the beach. You liked to go there to relax. Since you met Aqua Regina, you always felt more relaxed being near or in the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     When you agreed to help Aqua Regina, you received two things. A golden necklace that had a heart shaped locket made of golden crystal and a symbol, which appeared on your chest, where your heart was. She then handed you 8 pictures. Seven of them were pictures of girls. You assumed that those were the mermaid princesses that you had to find. The eight picture however, was your favorite. It was a picture of Aqua Regina, your family and yourself. As for the symbol, it was the proof that you served Aqua Regina and it had the shape of her scepter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Tonight was a beautiful night. The sky was painted with thousand upon thousands of sparkling stars and the full moon showed it's magnificent splendor reflecting itself on the vast amount of water that was the sea. While you were standing there, you began to think about everything that had happened since that tragic, yet happy, day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*flashback*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had agreed to help Aqua Regina, she asked you to hold her hand and, when you did so, she raised her scepter in the air. The scepter then began to glow so brightly that you had to close your eyes, but you never let go of Aqua Regina's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Open your eyes, Leon.\"</span>, said Aqua Regina with a reassuring voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did so and you were amazed at what you saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a giant Dojo with many symbols that showed different fighting poses and a house with a garden that extended so much that it seemed endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"It is. And, before you ask, I can read your mind. Here you'll learn to train your body and mind. I have many instructors. Some will train you to fight every kind of fighting style that exists and some will train your mind to do things that you thought that were impossible.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I understand, Aqua Regina-sama.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Now, now. Don't be so formal when we are alone, Okay? I would like it if you called me \"Auntie Aqua\".</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing those words made you feel so happy that you were crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Are you alright, Leon?\"</span>, asked Aqua Regina, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran to her and hugged her as tight as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I'm fine, Auntie Aqua. I'm fine.\"</span> you said, still crying and with a smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Aqua Regina smiled warmly at you and hugged you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then asked, with renewed spirit and confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"When do I start training, Auntie Aqua?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Rest today. We'll start training tomorrow.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*end of flashback*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to her, now you were very strong in mind and body. But you felt that something was still missing. What could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided not to think about it now and pushed the thought out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, I guess I should go back to work. I still need to find 7 of the 7 mermaid princesses.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resumed your walking, hoping to Auntie Aqua that you found them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, you began to hear something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"What's this sound? It sounds like a music, but I can feel a great amount of dark energy in it. Hmm... Someone could be in trouble. I better check it out.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to run towards the source of the music, hoping to arrive before any innocent gets hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------In the meanwhile----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n(<span class=\"cnavy\">Noel</span>, <span class=\"cviolet\">Karen</span>, <span class=\"cbyellow\">Koko</span>, <span class=\"cred\">She She</span>, <span class=\"cpblue\">Mimi</span> and <span class=\"cmagenta\">Noel, Koko and Karen together</span>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSong the She She and Mimi are singing: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJdCdr0qJUU\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJdCdr0qJ...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Noel's pov)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did we got into this mess? My sister, Karen, our friend Koko and I just went for a swim to relax after a day of work at the hotel and at the beach condo. Then they appeared. She She and Mimi, the \"Black Beauty Sisters\". Before we could transform, they had begun to sing, rendering us powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"My, my. This is being almost too easy right, sister Mimi?\"</span>, said She She. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had blue sapphire colored eyes, long brown hair and red fins on her head. She was dressed in a sort of dominatrix clothing, which was red and black in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Yes, sister She She. It's almost no fun. Almost.\"</span>, said Mimi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had hazelnut colored eyes, short light-blue hair and light blue fins on her head. She was dressed in the same type of dominatrix clothing as her sister. Only hers was light-blue and black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to sing. As long as they sang, we couldn't do anything at all. If this kept going, we wouldn't last long. But, suddenly, a shadow appeared in front of me. Fearing the worse, I closed my eyes and waited for the pain. But the pain never came. Instead, the singing stopped and I heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Are you alright, Princess-sama?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? The voice is male, no doubt. And it's asking if I'm alright?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Hey, you two. It's not nice to attack princesses, you know?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy curiosity got the best of me. I looked up to where the voice came from and I couldn't believe what I saw. Standing there, confronting She She and Mimi was a human boy. He was young. Maybe 17 or 18. He had short black hair that ended in what looked like three inverted waves. His skin was tan and his body was well built. Every piece of clothing he was wearing was black in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Get out of here. It's too dangerous...\"</span>, i tried to warn him as best as I could, but my voice was very weak. But he heard me. He kneeled before me and put a hand on my shoulder. He was so handsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Don't worry. Princess-sama. Everything will be fine.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said to me. Wait... How did he knew I was a princess? Did he knew about us, the mermaid princesses?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Out of the way, human. Or else you'll end up dead.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Yeah. Don't get in our way. Unless you want to get hurt.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Sorry, Black Beauty Sisters. But, as long as I'm here, you wont lay a finger on the mermaid princesses.\"</span>, he said with a firm and fearless tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did he, a human, knew about us? And how did he knew who She She and Mimi were? But, it seemed I wasn't the only curious one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"How do you know about us, human? And how do you know about the mermaid princesses?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the neck of his shirt and pulled it down until his heart was visible. And what I saw left all of us, including She She and Mimi, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*GASP!* I know that mark!\", exclaimed Karen. \"It's Aqua Regina-sama's symbol!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"But, how?! How is it that a human has it?!\"</span>, asked Koko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I'm going to tell you. But first, I should present myself. My name is Leon Seiryu.\"</span>, he said as he let go of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Seiryu?!\"</span>, Karen, Koko and I exclaimed. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"You mean the legendary clan? The clan of the best warriors to ever exist?\"</span>, continued Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes.\"</span>, he simply answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"That's impossible!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"That's right! They were destroyed thirteen years ago!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Almost. When I was about to die, Aqua Regina-sama appeared before me and restored me. And I was sent by her to protect the mermaid princesses!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Grrr! We'll let you go, for now! But the next time we meet, your pearls will be ours! As for you, human, you can expect a slow and painful death for this!\"</span>, screamed She She angrily as she and Mimi vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Are the three of you alright? Mermaid princesses-sama?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yeah. I'm fine.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Me too.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I'm fine as well. Thanks to you, Leon, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes. Princess-sama.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Oh! Where are our manners? We forgot to introduce ourselves! My name is Koko.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I'm Karen\"</span>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"And my name in Noel.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Pleased to meet you all.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Say, how did you knew we were the princesses?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, for one, those two wouldn't have attacked you unless you were mermaid princesses. Also...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took some pictures from one of his pant pockets and showed them to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"...On the day I met Aqua Regina-sama, she gave me this. She said that, after i trained, I should look for the seven mermaid princesses and reunite them, so they could unify the powers of their pearls and summon her.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Ah. I see. Well... We aren't the only mermaid princesses around. There are three other princesses back where we are currently living.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I see. Well, that makes things easier. We only have to find the princess number seven.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Actually... We already know who and where the seventh mermaid princess is but, she's not available.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"What do you mean?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"We'll tell you once we go back to our place, okay?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Alright. Lead the way.\"</span></span></div></div>",

During the walk, you couldn't help but wonder what could they possibly mean when they said that the seventh mermaid princess was \"unavailable\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"So...\"</span>, said Noel. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"You said that Aqua Regina-sama sent you to a place to train. Where was that?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, it was what you could call another dimension.

He's going to be VERY mad and pissed!. Unless...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Unless, what?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpteal\">\"Unless we don't tell him that there's someone else causing him trouble.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Are you crazy?! In the position that we are now, lying to Mikeru-sama is out of question! We already failed many times! If we lied to him and he found out...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"He would most likely absorb you.\"</span>, interrupted a voice that was all too familiar to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Fuku. He was Mikeru's right hand and second in command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"What do you want you little pest?\"</span>, asked SheShe in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpteal\">\"Right! We already are going to have plenty of troubles, so go away!\"</span>, said Mimi angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Pu, pu, pu. I just came to see what's taking you so long. Mikeru-sama is very impatient right now.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Mimi and SheShe) <span class=\"chunter\">*gulp*</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Pu, pu. Come on. If you don't go now Mikeru-sama will get more impatient and angry.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Ugh. I hate when your right, you little pipsqueak!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpteal\">\"Me too!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them began floating higher until they arrived to the top floor of a tower. That was Mikeru's current location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpgreen\">\"So you failed me again, Black Beauty Sisters.\"</span></b>, said Mikeru in an obvious irritated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Mikeru-sama, we ca-\"</span>, began to explain SheShe, but she was interrupted by Mikeru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpgreen\">\"What? What are you going to use as an excuse now?!\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpteal\">\"Actually, Mikeru-sama. We have more bad news than just not getting the pearls. And it's something very serious.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpgreen\">\"Oh? And what could be so serious?\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Well...\"</span>, began SheShe, unsure if she should give Mikeru a straight answer or to try and make it better for her and her sister. She ended up choosing the first option. <span class=\"cred\">*sigh* \"You know that the Seiryu clan was destroyed 13 years ago, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat name picked Mikeru's interest. But they were dead. Why would SheShe bring them up ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpgreen\">\"Yes. So?\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpteal\">\"They weren't completely destroyed.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpgreen\">\"What? What do you mean?\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Well... Today we met a member of the Seiryu clan.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpgreen\">\"What?! Impossible!!!\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"It's not. He was a boy that looked human. But, after he presented himself, a great power could be felt emanating from him.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpgreen\">\"I see. What did he wanted?\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpteal\">\"He said that, 13 years ago, when his clan was destroyed, Aqua Regina saved him. Also, he said that he had been sent by Aqua Regina to protect the mermaid princesses.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat shocked Mikeru greatly. Now, not only he had to deal with the mermaid princesses. He also had to deal with this Seiryu boy. But, was it true? Was he really a member of the Seiryu? He had to confirm it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpgreen\">\"Very well. Next time I'll go.\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Mikeru-sama?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpgreen\">\"I'd like to meet this Seiryu boy.\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, three more women arrived on the scene. One looked like a young, cheerful little girl. She had green hair and pink eyes and was dressed in all green garments and had dragonfly like wings. She also had some sort of wand. The second one was older, with a darker shade of crimson hair tied in a ponytail. Her eyes were violet, she had fangs and bat like wings. And the third one was the eldest of the trio. She had purple hair, tied in what looked like two buns, the rest flowing down her back. She was dressed in chinese clothing and had a fan on her right hand. The fan was currently extended and hid most of her face, except her rose colored eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpgreen\">\"Ah. Arara, Lady Bat and Ran Fa. I was wondering when you would appear.\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"Excuse us for not coming sooner, Mikeru-sama.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Ne, ne, Mikeru-sama! Can we go insted of She She and Mimi?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"What?! No way!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpteal\">\"That's right! It's was us who met him first! So we get first dibs!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"You? Please. You can't even beat three mermaid princess and you think you can defeat a member of the clan tha possesed the strongest and most powerful warriors? Don't make me laugh.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Shut it! Please, Mikeru-sama! Give us a chance to defeat him!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpteal\">\"Yes, please!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"Look at you. So desperate.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"What do you mean?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpteal\">\"Yeah! Why would we be desperate?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"Simple. You have failed countless times since Mikeru-sama brought you back from being mere fishes. The only reason you want so bad to face this Seiryu child, is because your desperate to retrieve Mikeru-sama's trust.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Uhg...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"I'm right, aren't I?\"</span>, she said in an obvious mockery to She She and Mimi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right she was. Nor She She nor Mimi could say she was lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Maybe. But the three of you failed every time as well!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"True. But our amount of failures combined is by far lesser than yours. Not to mention that, even if you managed to somehow retrieve the trust that Mikeru-sama had in you, it would be impossible to trust you completely. After all, when Gaito  decided to get rid of you, you decided to steal from him and escape. Thus, bertaying him.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Even so! Please, Mikeru-sama! Let us-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpgreen\">\"ENOUGH!\"</span></b>, roared Mikeru. <b><span class=\"cpgreen\">\"Enough of this foolish quarrel. I'm going to decide this.\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikeru colsed his eyes to think while the girls awaited his decision anxiously. A few moments later, he opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpgreen\">\"I have decided. I'll take with me...</span></b></span></div></div>",

I also know about Mikeru, his minions and your fight with Gaito. I know about what happened to the orange mermaid princess. I know all of this because I'm a servant of Aqua Regina-sama. She sent me to protect you all. So that you could gather, unify the power of your pearls and summon her. I believe that cover any questions you may have. Am I right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Um... Yeah, pretty much.\"</span>, said Rina, still shocked.

Are you alright?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yeah, I'm alright. It's just that, aside of Aqua Regina, I hadn't had a family in a long time.

The beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------- (The beach) ----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken Mikeru and the others only a few minutes of travel to get to the beach. Fortunately, no one was there at this hour, so no one would hinder them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpgreen\">\"Alright. From here, we'll separate and begin looking for the boy. Assume your other forms and begin searching. If one of you finds him, let the others know and follow him until the others arrive. Is that clear?\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"Yes, Mikeru-sama.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Yes!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"Understood, Mikeru-sama.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the girls transformed. Arara became a dragon fly, Lady Bat a bat, and Ran Fa a butterfly. They went their separate ways and began searching for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------- (The mermaids + Leon's home) ----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Noel\u2019s POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up, as the rays of the Sun hit my face. I yawned, got up and did my morning routine, which was bathing, brushing my teeth and going down for breakfast. After my bath, I opened the door to find Karen and Koko on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cGood morning, girls.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cGood morning, one-sama.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\u201cMorning.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I smelled something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cHey, do you girls smell something?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYes. It smells sweet.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\u201cIndeed, it does! Nikora-san must be preparing something tasty!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThen let\u2019s go. Before that glutton of a penguin eats it all!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cKaren! While I agree that Hippo eats a bit too much, it\u2019s not nice to say it behind his back.\u201d</span>, I scolded my little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSorry, one-sama.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Now let\u2019s go.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree of us went down the stairs, thinking we would find Nikora-san cooking. Instead, to our surprise, we found Nikora-san, Luchia, Hanon, Rina and Hippo seated at the tables, chatting and as if they were waiting for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cGood morning, everyone.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cGood morning, girls. Did you sleep well?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\u201cYes, we did, thank you. But, Nikora-san\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cYes?\u201d</span>, she asked, with a knowing smile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cIf you are here, then who\u2019s cooking?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all simply pointed in the kitchen\u2019s direction so, Karen, Koko and I looked there and we were surprised for the second time this morning. Because we couldn\u2019t believe what we were seeing! Leon, our newest friend and our guardian was cooking for us! I mean, it was pretty uncommon to have a man cooking for us. Let alone the last surviving member of the Seiryu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cGood morning, Noel, Karen, Koko.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cG-good morning, Leon-kun.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cPlease sit at the table. Breakfast will be ready in a couple of minutes.\u201d</span>, he said, giving us a cheerful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cAlright but\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBut? Something wrong, Noel?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cNo, no! It\u2019s just that\u2026 Why?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cTwo reasons. One: It\u2019s my way to say \u201cthank you\u201d and to show you how much I appreciate your hospitality. And two, I don\u2019t want to be a freeloader. So, I agreed with Nikora-san that I would help around the condo and at the beach restaurant.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThanks, Leon.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNo. I\u2019m the one who thanks you for letting me stay.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, my sister, Koko and I sat down along with the others, waiting for breakfast to come. Which didn\u2019t took long at all. After about 5 minutes, Leon brought our breakfast. And it was quite a hearty one! Pancakes with syrup, fresh juices of many flavors, French toast with a little bit of butter on them and a few small cheese breads. We waited until he had sat down and then we all took a bit of what we liked the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cMy goddess!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cOh my!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\u201cHmmm!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThis is soooo gooood!!!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cDelicious!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yum!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"So tasty!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpteal\">\"Quite good!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it.\u201d</span>, Leon sais, blushing and rubbing the back of his head a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHey, there\u2019s no need to be embarrassed.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWell, it\u2019s the first time I cook for someone else so, I wasn\u2019t sure if you would like it.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhat about Aqua Regina-sama?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cKaren, Aqua Regina-sama is a spirit. She doesn\u2019t needs to eat.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOh. Right.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\u201cAnyway, this is pretty good, Leon.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThank you.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cI-it\u2019s better than my cooking.\u201d</span>, Nikora-san said, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHey, Nikora-san, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not trying to take your place, okay?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cThank you, Leon.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Say, I gotta go outside a bit.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWell, I usually train around this time. So that I don\u2019t get rusty. And I doubt you have a training hall.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><span class=\"cplum\">\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">You\u2019re right. We don\u2019t have one.\u201d</span></span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWell then, if you need me, I\u2019ll be on the beach. After all, there\u2019s little to no people there at this hour.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cAlright.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cBe careful.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, with that, Leon left to the beach.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It all started with a guitar. A gorgeous, fancy, holy-white guitar passed down to you by your grandfather in his will. This beautiful white guitar marked with glittering crosses and the bible verse of 'Isaiah 38:20' inscribed on it was your grandad's pride and joy when he was a young Christian musician. He always told you the guitar had a legend to it, it was a holy instrument to ward off the evils of the devil passed down from his father and his father before him. You didnt believe any of that stuff,  but man could he play it like he was born with a guitar in his hands! After his passing, you felt obligated to wield it as you pursued your dream of becoming a rock star!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, you were pretty damn good with it! Each pluck of a string you played was breathtaking! You could hear angels sing along to your wondrous ballad! You were recruited to a local band halfway through high school. It wasnt long before that particular band was winning school talent shows and even picked to sponsor local events. You'd like to think it was grandpa's guitar that helped you get so many steps closer to the fame and prestige you dreamed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with your fame came the fans. Two specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since your first official concert, these two stuck in your mind like bad premonitions. Near the end of the last song, you spotted through the roaring crowd two girls that stuck out: an older brunette with aqua blue eyes in a red tight jumpsuit and a younger blue haired girl with blood red eyes in a tight blue vest and spike collars. You dont know why, but something about these two rubbed you the wrong way. But you shrugged it off and paid it no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second concert, you saw them again in the crowd, but this time in the front row. While everybody else was watching the whole band (specifically the singer), you felt these two only staring YOUR direction. You coulda sworn you saw fish fins for ears on both of them! You tried to ignore them as you continued strumming your guitar, but it wasnt long before you tuned out the rest of the crowd and noticed only them staring deep at you with obvious interest. But once again, you paid it no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a week later during an event to help fund more money for your school, you were chatting among your bandmates backstage, when you felt someone watching you from behind. Through the corner of your eyes, you saw two girls a ways away whispering to themselves as they gazed at you. You turned your head to them, but they immediately vanished! Youre pretty sure you saw fish fins that time!<br>\r\n\"Yo dude, you ok?\" one of your mates asked.<br>\r\n\"Er... yeah... yeah, I'm fine,\" you tried to keep your cool, but you were having bad feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only got worse from there. One day you were helping your mom shop for groceries, when you saw those two girls over at the magazine rack pretending to read, but you could feel their eyes on you! You approached them to say hi, but they vanished again.<br>\r\nThe next day, you were at the arcade challenging some newb to a game of Street Fighter IV. You were wiping the floor with him until you saw a certain brunette and blue-haired blue playing DDR while still looking your direction! That distraction left you vulnerable to one sonic boom too many and that newb kicked your butt!<br>\r\nThe next day, you were taking a seat in a bus and you saw those two girls sitting in the very back no doubt staring your direction. This was getting out of control. But instead of approaching them and asking what gives, you just got off at the very next stop and kept running! These two fan girls were getting way way WAY too close for comfort!<br>\r\nThe next night, you could not get any sleep because earlier in the day you were picking up the mail and saw those two girls AGAIN staring at you from afar, whispering godknowswhat to eachother. It's bad enough you got stalkers, but now these stalkers know where you live! Heck, just when you finally thought of going to sleep, you coulda sworn you saw their silhouettes through the window! You gripped your grandpa's guitar tight in your bed like the teddy bear of a scared little kid who's afraid of the monster under his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoulda told somebody. You shoulda told your parents. You shoulda called the cops. Instead, you kept your mouth shut and ignored, allowing the stalking to escalate to the point where it may be too late for anyone to help you.<br>\r\nAfter a hard morning of running track during PE, you headed back into the locker room to change back into your regular clothes when you saw a little letter in your locker. The bad feelings returned as you opened it and read it.<br>\r\n'MUSIC STORAGE ROOM. NOON. COME ALONE. NO ONE ELSE.' Very brief and thorough. It even emphasized to come alone TWICE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew those stalker fans wrote it! Guess they finally wanna stop admiring you from afar and just confront you face-to-face... where nobody can hear your cries for help! Did all the great rock star legends have a situation like this in their lives?<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard and wiped the sweat from your forehead as everybody else left the locker room. You knew you were gonna have to confront them sooner or later, but you were not looking forward to it. They made scary movies that started out this way (granted, they also made a few porno movies that started out this way, but youre not placing your bets on THAT scenario!) Still, it probably wouldnt get better if you ignored the letter. If they ARE the creepy stalker types, they might not take rejection very well. Which would DEFINITELY lead to a scary movie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to make a choice and make it fast before somebody else makes it for you. Do you dare go and finally confront your fans once and for all? Or ignore it and allow the stalking to potentially grow worse?</span></div></div>",

And your gut was telling you that if fans want to confront you ALONE in a STORAGE ROOM, no good could come from it. But the longer you ignore these two, the worse things could get for you. After all, they know where you live. They could get your family involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed hard and put that accursed letter in your pocket as a painful reminder that all this couldve been prevented if you had acted sooner.<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing,\" you say to yourself as you walked out of the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner after you stepped out did the whole school suddenly got quieter. You heard no footsteps, no chatter, no whistles or bells or anything! Nothing but the wind. It was WAY too quiet for comfort.<br>\r\nNot only that, you didnt see any students around either. NONE. You doubt that they ALL already made it inside their classes. They just vanished. You were all alone.<br>\r\n\"I dont like this,\" you started to get nervous as you headed to what may very well be your destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long quiet lonely walk toward the music storage room. You kept looking around for somebody ANYBODY to talk to and ask what's going on or at the very least enjoy companionship! 'How could everybody be gone?' you wondered. Maybe this was part of those stalker girls' plan. To separate you from everyone else so nobody can answer your call for help! Those two must be a lot more than they seem.<br>\r\nYou DEFINITELY saw this in a horror movie! First, strange girls stalk you, then everyone around you suddenly vanishes, next the sky's gonna turn blood red, the walls'll bleed, the place will be littered with snakes spiders and all kinds of creepy crawlers, then two demonic apparitions are gonna hunt you to drag you with Hell with them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down,\" you whisper to yourself as youre almost on the verge of pissing yourself, \"relax. Panicking will only make things worse. Remember grandpa. Grandpa would want you to stay strong.\" Thinking about your grandpa helped ease your fear a little. He's like your own guardian angel.<br>\r\nJust when you finally eased your fear, you reach the door just aside the music room marked 'Music Storage Room'. The time had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard and turned the knob. Conveniently enough, it was unlocked.<br>\r\nThe inside was completely dark. You flipped on the light switch, but for some reason, the lights didnt turn on. You could barely see the stacks of musical instruments nearby, so you had to be careful where you walked. Of course they werent gonna let it be EASY for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?!\" you call out, \"is anybody there?!\" No answer. You took a few steps through the middle of the darkness and you suddenly heard the loud click of the door locking behind you!<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth, but called again, \"I got your letter! I wanna know what's going on! Where is everybody?!\" Just silence. \"Answer me! Tell me what's going on or I'm calling the cops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear a little whispering, but you cant make out what theyre saying. Your patience was wearing thin, but it wasnt long before a single spotlight suddenly turns on and shines on the blue haired girl with red eyes and spike collars. 1/2 of the fangirl stalker duo! She had a microphone in her hand like she had an important announcement to make in front of the crowd of ONE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya!\" she waved at you and announced through her microphone, \"I'm Mimi! Nice to finally meet you at last!\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... hi Mimi,\" you answered back, still keeping cautious.<br>\r\n\"We're so glad you came here,\" Mimi gave you an assuring smile which doesnt assure you at all, \"we were getting tired of spying on you from afar!\" At least she doesnt sugar coat it.<br>\r\n\"You know, if you wanted an autograph so bad, you coulda just asked,\" you said. But Mimi shook her head.<br>\r\n\"No, we want more than a stupid autograph. A LOT more. Like everything you have and then some!\" Yikes. At least she's brutally honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, whatever it is you want with me, make it quick. I dont have all day.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes you do,\" Mimi stated like a matter of fact, \"you cant get out, nobody knows youre here, and school's officially closed. You got all the time in the world for us!\"<br>\r\nAt least she's brutally honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiped the sweat from your brow and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry! We're not gonna hurt you,\" Mimi tells you, \"...unless you give us a reason to. Anyways, we heard you play the last couple of weeks. You play a wicked-mean guitar! And I mean WICKED mean! With a capital W! And a 'mean' at the end!\"<br>\r\n\"Er... thanks.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm serious,\" she says, \"the way you strummed through the strings of that cool guitar like you were possessed by the God of Music, playing such a wicked haunted melody, hypnotizing the crowd... whatever that 2-bit band youre hanging around with is paying you isnt NEARLY enough!\" You dont know whether you should be flattered she thinks that way of your guitar playing or angry that she's insulting the rest of your band!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and sis have decided to offer you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" she put the mic to her mouth and shouted, \"OF BEING A FULL-FLEDGED MEMBER OF OUR INCREDIBLY SUPREMO AWESOME WORLD RENOWN BAND, 'MIKERU'S ANGELS'!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened. It took you a while to soak it all in, but man did it soak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael's Angels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! MIKERU's Angels!\" Mimi corrected you, \"we're a world famous pop band that's soon to hit the charts and go platinum!\" You've never heard of 'em, but you'd rather not say that out loud! \"Me and sis, Sheshe are the lead singers... we're technically an all-girl band, not counting the tranny, but it'd be wicked awesome to have a cute guy like yourself as our lead guitarist! With our singing and your guitar playing, we'd be an unstoppable force!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this whole episode since day 1, the countless stalking, the sleepless nights, was all to get you to join their little band?! Maybe if they didnt go through all this trouble and invade your privacy, you mightve been gullible enough to accept their offer. But not NOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I'm not interested,\" you politely shoot her down.<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon!\" she wasnt ready to take no for an answer, \"think about it! You'd be set for life! Lots of money, fame, power, the world would grovel to our...er... YOUR feet! You could have anything and everything!\"<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \"That's a tempting offer, but I'm afraid I have to turn it down-!!!\" Suddenly you feel something hard poke at your back. Youre not sure what it was, but for all you know, that could be the barrel of a gun poking you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid 'turning it down' is not an option!\" you hear ANOTHER voice tell you from behind! You turn your head and see the red-haired blue-eyed woman, the OTHER half of the stalker duo, glaring at you! \"youre going to take that magic guitar of yours and youre going to come with us and play like you never played before!!\" She spoke like it was a threat... and did she say 'magic guitar'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi sighed, \"Sheshe! What are you doing?! I already had this!\"<br>\r\n\"No you clearly didnt,\" Sheshe remarked, still poking your back with something, \"listen [yrn], our boss already knows of you and your magic guitar.\"<br>\r\n\"M...magic guitar?\" ...was she talking about your grandpa's guitar?!<br>\r\n\"The Holy Instrument whose melody is said to ease restless souls of the underworld?\" they know of grandpa's fable, too! \"youre one of the very few that can play it. Our band needs you and your guitar, and youre going to join us whether you like it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were getting p'oed. Nobody threatens you like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it!\" you answer, \"tell your boss to find another magic guitar... then tell him where to stick THAT!\"<br>\r\nSheshe poked you again with her unknown weapon.<br>\r\n\"You do realize, we know where you live, right?\" she whispered in your ear, \"I'm sure dear ol' BRYAN and SAMANTHA would appreciate it if you take us on our generous offer!\" The nerve of her to bring up your parents! \"Heck, I'd bet JULIA would love to see her big bro as a rock-star, wouldnt you agree?\" Man, was she pushing your buttons! Your fears were realized, they ARE dragging your family into this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheshe! Cool it!\" said Mimi, \"we gotta make him WANT to do this if he's gonna be play his all-out best for us!\"<br>\r\n\"Stop being so naive!\" Sheshe remarked, \"we can easily make him. We got everything we need to do it.\"<br>\r\n\"More flies with honey than vinegar, sis!\"<br>\r\n\"This isnt about flies! It's about world freaking domination!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they argued over how to treat you, you thought about trying to escape. But obviously it was easier said than done. It was dark, the door's locked, and Sheshe had what might be a gun pointing at your back. Then again, it could just be a bluff. If it was a gun, why bother bringing up your FAMILY as a threat? Just threatening your life should be enough to bend you to their will. Not a well planned hostage-strategy. Not to mention, you took a few martial arts classes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But even if you DO escape, they still know where you live and the names of your family. If you escape TODAY, imagine what they could do TOMORROW...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This Interactive Story is based on Snakehead222's (a.k.a Venom and Anti-Venom) stories.<br>\r\nBut they have their differences.<br>\r\nLet's get to the rules, shall we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1-There MUST be a chaos option;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2-In the chaos option, the character's name MUST be Leon Seiryu. To know who and how Leon is, e-mail me and I'll tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3-In the \"normal\" branch, do whatever you want. Just make sure you use proper grammar, make a good story and no one line chapters, except for choices;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4-I'll allow sex, just don't go overboard (example: don't write about sex every two or five chapters), some yuri (in the Harem choices only), threesomes (only in the Harem choices and with the main character and two of the girls) and foursomes (sex with four persons . Only in the harem choices).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.1 (NEW): Allowed kinds of sex: Normal (Vaginal), Tit Fuck, Blowjob, Anal Sex and 69.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5-Please write a warning chapter when you're going to write about anything that is sex related and say what it contains. Example: Say if the chapter will contain threesomes, yuri, normal sex, etc...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6-Don't kill the main character or any supporting character. That includes Gaito (the main antagonist from season one). But you can kill bad guys that you include and that don't belong to the anime. Mikeru (the main antagonist from season two) can be killed, but he must be reborn as a baby, like in the anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEW RULE! 7: NO adding chapters \"just to fill in\" or \"just for the sake of it\"! If you can't think of a good chapter, then don't write! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n8-I have nothing against the Uchiha clan. But I DON'T want them in this story. The ONLY character I will allow is Orochimaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, here goes a piece of advice: If you have an idea or a few ideas but have little or no confidence in yourself or in your writing skills, then send ME the idea and I'll analyze the idea and then I'll add it or shape it to fit the with the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO FETISHES ALLOWED!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEW!!! Gift Points for those who write GOOD chapters! 300 GP!!!</td>",
