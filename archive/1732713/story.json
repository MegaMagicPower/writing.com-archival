While, you like the fact that you've got two hot girlfriends, and better yet, they have no way of discovering each other, this is the last thing you need. You remember agreeing to bring her a present. \"Urrggh. Why did I start going out with her to begin with?  What can I get that girl?\" you mutter, as you drive towards her house. You're friends have warned you not to date two girls at the same time, but since they're from two diffferent towns, twenty miles apart, you figure its okay. You look out the window, and spot a sign, saying garage sale. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping, you get out of the car, and head up the path, seeing the mailbox saying 'Forester'. A woman, in her tweenties is standing near the door. She gives you a smile. \"Here to buy something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I need something for my girlfriend\" you say. Unfortunately for you, you're talking to Samantha Forester, a witch notorious for turning bad boys (or any type, actually) into girls. She looks at you and guesses your cheating nature. Of course, you don't now this. \"I've got the perfect thing for you. What's your name, young man?\" \"Err Luke. I'm getting something nice for my girlfriend, Brit: you say. She hands you a pendant with a ruby set in it. You look at it delightedly. Britney would love this... You have over twenty dollars, and get into your car. You don't hear what she says to herself. \"Goodbye <i>Lucy</i>. Don't come back, you cheating, jerk.\" You spot another car arrive, as you're leaving, containing a grey haired woman, and a teen with honey blond hair. You recognize the teen a girl from Britney's school, some chick called Hayley. You've thought a couple of times of working your magic on her, even though you haven't seen her for some time, but you keep getting a bad feeling every time you see her. Plus, you don't need a third girlfriend... You drive away, not hearing the grey haired woman ask \"Up to your old tricks, Samantha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was wearing a pink, strapless dress that highlighted her features very well, making her look hot. You had to fight not to drool as she looked at you with an air of impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you look sexy.\" you whispered, without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel did not look impressed. \"Hello, Luke.\" she said, trying to be polite. \"I doubt you came here to compliment and stare at me, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, forcing yourself to look Mel in the eye. \"I... I found a pretty antique for my girlfriend, Britney, at a garage sale a few miles from here,\" you said, showing her the pendant. \"I was hoping John or his friend could give me a history on it.\" you paused, smiling at Mel's beauty. \"Then again, maybe I can persuade you to dump that Harry freak and go out with a real man instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel fought her anger while, inside, her mom (Natalie) held back and silenced a furious Harry in a black tux, who had just asked Mel out earlier that day, hence the sexy dress. Only Mel was quick to recover and smiled at you. \"Why, do you know where I can find a real man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, Melanie.\" you said. \"It's your loss... is John home or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel shook her head. \"He's sick right now.\" she told you. \"I don't think he's in any mood for company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll only take a second.\" you promised. \"May I please come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel paused to turn to Natalie, who shook her head before whispering something to Harry, as Mel turned back to you. \"Sorry, Luke.\" she said. \"Mom told me not to let anyone disturb him.\" she gave you an almost evil smile. \"That's a very pretty pendant, though. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she slammed the door in your face. \"Little bitch.\" you thought, walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Mel had a conversation with her mom after she had slammed the door. \"Poor Luke doesn't realize what he has.\" said Mel with a giggle. \"What do you think we should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie shook her head. \"I will tell Elvira, the head witch, that Luke had purchased a magical item from Samantha.\" she said, seriously. \"After that, it is out of our hands.\" she then grinned. \"We will be having our hands full as it is with John, he should have known better than to try to break up a 'cat fight', least he now knows magic is real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know that John was truly sick and irritable, being hit with a sick day spell after trying to break up a 'fight' between Hayley and Mel. As you got back into your car, you looked at the medallion, thinking. \"Mel probably lied out her ass and is laughing at me right now.\" you thought, glumly. \"Hopefully, I will catch him at school tomorrow, I can't take the risk that Brit will carry out her threat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the medallion, you felt the sudden urge to put it on, not knowing that it was the medallion itself compelling you. It was very pretty and it did seem to match your style, again the medallion playing on your mind. \"Maybe I'll just keep this and forget about Britney.\" you muttered. \"She was a pain anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thirty minutes later, you're home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella, I need...\" you say, only to have your sister look at you coldly. \"Britney called me. I warned you, you jerk.

You're not fooling anyone\" Bella says over her shoulder, but you ignore her since you can feel something shrink. Desparately, you take a look, again ignoring Bella, and her disgusted look. As you feared your manhood has shrunk but is still there, only the size of that of a little boy. Fearfully, you turn to Bella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this possible? What did you do to me? Change me back, now!\" you demand to your puzzled sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You're telling me it worked! I'm not a witch. Did you do anything to another girl, 'little' brother?\" Bella grins meanly. You shrug, still unaware that the medallion caused Bella's wish to come true, and will make things a lot worse for you later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec. I've got something more comfortable\" she says, smiling even more meanly, as she runs to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"stop. Don't leave me\" you say frightened, partly because you're afraid of what she's going to do. She returns a minute later, with something behind her back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You recognized them as Rachel's, that you stole from her panty drawer one day that you were at her house. Where did Bella get them? You whined, and then said, \"No! This can't be happening!\" As you said it, you grabbed the panties out of her hands and ran to the bathroom. You were not content until you were wearing them, and you had to admit, they felt wonderful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward, you tried to sneak out of the bathroom, but Bella was waiting, and walked up to you, \"It worked! Didn't it?\" She jumped up and down, \"Now you can learn what it is like! Only, you don't deserve to be male at all. I wish you had a pussy and all that goes with it, just like a normal girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelled, \"No! Please don't!\" Even as you said it, you could feel you tiny penis fade away and pull inside of you. Then you felt other changes inside of you. Soon, where it counted most, you were a fully functional female. You tried wishing yourself back, but it didn't work for you! Then you begged Bella, \"Please! Change me back! I will do better! I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella sneered at you, \"You don't get off that easy... sister. I will do this for you. I will wish you back to normal 'if' you do one thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got your hopes up, \"Yes! Anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, \"Good. You have to tell Britney and Rachel the truth about each other, then come back here.\" You started to protest, but she just smiled and said, \"Or get used to peeing sitting down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no choice, \"Oh, okay. You win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella smiled, \"Good, but I have a wish to go with you. I wish that any lie you tell to them or any other girl, or any lie that you tell a guy about a girl, will boomerang back onto you, but only you and I will see or know of the changes.\" Before you could protest more, she said, \"You better go before you are in a dress and makeup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurried out!</span></div></div>",

You haven't gone far when you run into some of your best buddies, Joel and Rob. You can't just walk past them, so you stop and chat. However, they soon sway the subject when Rob says, \"Hey! Are you still seeing both Rachel and Britney?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you say you are, Joel asks, \"Why do you bother with such a square girl as Rachel when you are dating Britney? I mean, Britney is much sexier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll to quickly, you forgot about your sister's wish, and you lie to them, \"You would think, huh? But it is not what it seems. Sure Rachel 'acts' square, but she is one horny bitch! When she sees a guy, she always wonders what his cock would feel like inside of her. And she gives the greatest blow jobs! She even loves the taste of cum! On the other hand, Britney is sexy, but she is looking for a guy who wants to get married and raise a big family.

You could feel the pussy between your legs tingle and begin to get wet as you wondered what his cock would feel like between your legs! Worse yet, you started wanting to taste his cum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get out of her and get this over with! \"Um, sorry guys. I gotta go. Talk to you later!\" You almost ran off! You had to!

Strangely, whatever you did to yourself seems to have given you basic knowledge of those things.

You don't know how much time passes. You call the Witch back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch sits down expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does the best possible version of Laura mean exactly,\" Bella asks, while you stay silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For each person, it's different, so I can't tell you exactly.\" She eyes you meaningfully. But some people who have been the best versions of themselves include Einestien, Mozart, Lincoln, Joan of Arc, King Arthur---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't they burn Joan at the stake?\" Bella asks. You only kinda know who Joan is. Bella was always a better student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but she still changed the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath. Bella looks at you while you consider.  Finally you nod ever so slightly to your sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe back mouths \"you're sure.\" You nod.</span></div></div>",

A whispered scream echoed from your throat as you found that you had somehow shrunk to the size of a child!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!

First came a foundation with a large brush, making your entire face one color tone. Then, they moved in with smaller brushes, adding some light red blush, pink lipstick, and light blue eyeshadow before they moved on to your nails, shaping and painting them a candy pink. Seeing yourself in the mirror made you feel ill but you were still unable to move as the girls then moved on to your hair, giving it a more crimped and curled look and adding honey blond highlights at Samantha's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might pinch a little, dear.\" said one of the girls, working on you. \"Don't worry, though, it will pass quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, you heard yourself reply, \"Okay, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at the mirror while the girl rubbed alcohol onto your earlobes and saw Samantha grinning at you madly. Your mind spun, desperately trying to think of a way to get out of the nightmare you were in but then everything stopped when you felt a tinge of pain in your right earlobe, quickly followed by an identical pain in your left ear. Before you knew it, you were wearing pink heart shaped earrings. You wanted to scream but instead, you saw yourself smile before hearing yourself say, \"They're beautiful, I love them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad we could cheer you up, sweetie.\" said the beautician, smiling. \"We are done with you, go show your new look to the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally able to move, you gladly jumped out of the seat but Samantha had your wrist in an iron grip before you could take your second step. She then paid for the makeover and dragged you out of the store while Mel rolled her eyes, shaking her head....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Samantha take you next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Feeling nothing in your crotch, you briefly heft your new B-cup breasts in your hands, then pull at your hair, which now reaches the middle of your back. Panicking, you look at your mother and Bella, who are just staring at you in shock, then back down at your newly-female body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change isn't done yet, though. You feel your clothes moving and shifting around your body. You can feel your underpants shifting, and you feel the cloth touching your crotch more closely than it should. You pull your pants out a bit, and see that your underpants are now plain white panties. Immediately afterward, you feel your undershirt mostly vanish, except for a part which tightens around your new breasts while the part on your shoulders thins to mere straps. You check and confirm that it had become a plain white bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sneakers change as well: They become smaller and shift to fit closer around your feet, and their tops lower and they become black, becoming simple flats. Your socks, meanwhile, just become low top socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's still not done, though. Your pants change from jeans to cloth, and the legs start widening. The pant legs quickly become wide enough to be touching, and start to fuse together. The outside of your merged pants smooths out, while the cloth separating your legs vanishes, turning your pants into an ankle-length skirt. The skirt and your shirt then both become a light blue color and begin to fuse together, merging at the waist. You try pulling them apart but to no avail; they move like a single piece of cloth and soon had fuse completely, leaving you wearing a simple modest blue dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare down at the dress you're now wearing in shock for several seconds, then back up at your mother and Bella. \"What's happening?\" you mutter quietly, \"Why am I... a girl?\" You pull at the dress with one hand, then drop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your mom and Bella. Nothing else seems to be happening, the change is done. \"Why am I a girl?\" you repeat quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella giggles. \"Luke's been cheating!\" she laughs, \"and now Luke's a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom nods hesitantly. \"Perhaps this has resulted from your treatment of females...or is a karmic response, at least. Bella, take your bro-<i>sister</i> to her room, and we'll figure out what to do about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella takes your arm and leads you upstairs. You're too stunned to resist, and she pulls you to your room. She opens the door and pushes you in, then follows you. Fortunately, your room is unchanged - only your body and clothes (<i>all</i> your clothes, though you don't know that yet) changed. But...</span></div></div>",

Lisa.\" said Bella, giggling. \"Now then, let's get your diaper on, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes bugged out as Bella then reached into a baby bag and pulled out some baby oil and began to rub it onto you, the smell was not that bad but you were horrified that she was actually treating you like a baby. Next came a bulky plastic diaper. she lifted up your feet and slid it under before grabbing some baby powder and sprinkling it onto your feminine groin and your bottom before placing you down and sealing you inside the diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a gooood girl.\" she cooed, still teasing you. \"Big sis is going to now put you in a very pretty dress and brush your hair, yes she is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed against the large pacifier but all that came out was a mumble, causing Bella to squeal and giggle in delight as you had been a terror to her lately and she was finally getting some payback. She turned around for a moment then came back with a large pink flowered dress. Seeing it made you feel sick, you knew that she had every intention of making you wear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby Lisa is going to love her pretty dress, yes she is!\" said Bella. \"After you are all pretty, big sis will show you to mommy and she will see how much better you are, staying this way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you screamed but in no avail. Bella freed you from the straps, holding you onto the changing table then forced you into the pink dress before dragging you out to see mom, who was still on the telephone, talking to Dr. Thompson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, doctor.\" said mom, still shaken. \"He changed right in front of us, will you please come and take a look?\" she listened, as Dr. Thompson replied, then sighed in relief. \"Thank you, doctor. We will be waiting, good bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging up the telephone, she turned find Bella holding you firm as you sulked. She barely contained her laughter as she saw you in nothing but a pair of diapers and a small pink dress. Seeing her reaction, Bella grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was all I could find that would fit her, mom.\" she said. \"I had to diaper her up like a real baby or she'd probably end up getting a rash or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough concerned by your new condition, Mom giggled slightly, seeing the predicament you were in, while you looked up at her, your eyes begging for help.

You're too  stunned to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG\" you moan as something white starts to form above your fingers. It quickly wraps around your hand, then up your wrist.  This pulls you out of your shock. Somehow you're becoming a girl. \"How can something like this happen?\" you wonder, seeing that the white thing, or glove is half way up your forearm. You wonder if pulling hte ring off will help, or just change your other arm. As you move your other arm to remove the ring, you glance down at your leg. Something white is crawling up it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" you moan as you see the white thing is a wedding gown. It already past your groin, and you see that your clothes are beginning to disappear as the gown moves closer. Within minutes, it completely moved over your other leg, and is starting to creep up your waist. \"Do something, Luke\" you say to yourself, but your body is unresponsive. You know the gown is changing your body, as you feel your legs and waist slim, hips and rear flare out, and something is twisting in your gut. A glance at your arms tells you that the glove has grown to a few inches short of your shoulder on the ring arm, and is just short of your elbow on the other. You don't realize that your hair has grown almost to your shoudlers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This gown is gorgeous, just like my ring. no, its getting harder to think\" you say, realizing that the changes aren't restricted to your body. Terrified you try to push the gown down, but you find yourself pulling it up further, the top having split into two, sits over your flat chest. The strapless gown, now in its final position starts to do its work, as two mounds begin to inflate. The rest of your body fills into feminine proportions, as your breasts finish growing to a c cup, causing a smile to form as you look at your breasts partly covered by your gown. Another, conflicting thought snaps you out of it. \"I have to get this ring off!\" you think as your mind begins to fill with feminine thoughts. \"No, I'm a man\" you repeat, but each time you do, it sounds less convincing. Now dominated by your new fewminie self, you grin and say \"OMG. Yes I'l marry you\"</span></div></div>",
