            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was rather early in the morning, but this was one morning you would never forget for the rest of your life. Today was the first day of your new life as a Chunin ninja of the Hidden Foot Village, a village made up of those all cursed by the same ninja once upon a time, but have since made a life for ourselves in this secluded space. You rub your eyes, get dressed in your traditional ninja garb, which has been passed down from generation to generation until it has finally been given to you. Due to the lack of resources, instead of a traditional ninja headband, yours was made of rock and woven fibers of grass rather than metal and fabric. Once you're happy with your appearance, you head off to see the Ashikage, the leader of the Hidden Foot Village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the elderly man. Standing firm, you coil your right hand into a fist and press it over your heart in salute, \"Lord Ashikage, you requested to see me this morning?\" The elderly man looked up into your eyes from his sitting position and smiled, \"Ahh... one of our newest Chunin. Your instructors tell me of your great skill with taijutsu. Truly remarkable!\" You nod and smile, flattered, \"Yes, sir. I have worked hard in the service of the Foot Village.\" The old man then lowers his eyes and crosses his arms, \"Indeed you have. And it is that hard work which tells me that you are ready to undertake the village's longest-standing mission: the retrieval of any and all information pertaining to the Reduction Curse placed upon our ancestors, so that we may once again live amongst our human brethren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are taken aback, to be given this chance so early? Your tireless training these many years has finally paid off! You can't help but shout in excitement, \"Do you really mean it, sir? I can go on that mission? Woohoo! That's awesome!\" The old man chuckled. You were a young man, and only people tasked with this mission or with the gathering of resources are allowed to leave the village because of their own safety.  But now, you were finally able to leave the village once and for all and see what there is to see beyond the walls of the Hidden Foot Village!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man clears his throat and nods at you, \"Now, go forth and find any clues you can on the Reduction Curse's whereabouts and any research on how to break such a curse.\" You nod, absolutely ecstatic, \"Yes, sir!\" With that, you rush out the door and pack your things, because this was normally a mission that took months just to get to the target village, and years to gather the proper intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany have undergone this mission, and only a few have actually returned. None were successful, many who returned never talked about what happened due to the terror that befell them. There was one who returned. He talked all about the wonders of the outside world. And you had a special interest in his stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a small handful of the village knew that you were gay. But focusing on survival and finding information, there was no time to worry about trivialities like that. But even with that known to some, no one knew that, unlike the rest of the village who were terrified of their mountainous human brethren, you pictured their massive sizes in your head in your sleep. You imagined giant men taller than any of the trees surrounding the village looking down at you, and you felt nothing but lust for them. It was for this reason that you trained so hard. You wanted to be one of the many sent out in search of clues of the Reduction Curse. Not that you actually cared about the curse. Your primary goal was to be sent out to meet a giant and enjoy yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, with a satchel of all of your essential belongings in your pack along with a set of weapons necessary for slaying the viscious monsters that plague the outside world, you set off for the village you would be spending the rest of your life in, not that your village knew that.</span></div></div>",

There have been one or two reports about the Reduction Curse possibly being in the Hidden Leaf Village, and the Hidden Leaf Village was also where the Uchiha Clan resided. Surely one of their rank would know about the curse, so you will be sent there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe months of travel were surprisingly uneventful, but there were certainly days where the trek was significantly harsher than others, Wolves and Foxes usually paid him little mind, but you were forced to fend off the occasional squirrel and large insect, which you were able to handle without too much effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after all of those months of travel, you finally arrived at the gates of the Hidden Leaf Village. It was incredible! The walls stretched into the heavens. There were two guards standing outside. They looked like gods to you! But you couldn't get distracted. Besides, these guys would probably notice you right away and crush you like a bug. So you instead wandered right inside the gates and looked around. Surely you could find someone fun to hitch a ride on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have to wait long. In a brief lapse of perception, a sandal-clad foot slamed right in front of you. It greatly startled you, but you took this opportunity to leap onto the side of the sandal. But who was the owner of this sandal?</span></div></div>",

Almost immediatly, the sandal you were on got off the ground and the sheer speed and strength of the movement flattened you against the blue fabric of the shoe. You couldn't move at all nor see anything of your surroundings, everything was reduced to a confusing blur around you. You remained unable to move for several minutes, each step pushing you further and further into the fabric and pushing all air out of your lungs. Eventually, thankfully, the giant boy walked into a building and, as the light went dim, the movement stopped.<br>\r\n\"Guuuh....\" You put your hand on your forehead, fighting weakly the intense headache that came with the experience. That was quite similar to motion sickness, but it was the first time your vehicle was another human's footwear - could a footwear even be considered a vehicle ?<br>\r\nAs your mind started to become clear, you sat up and let your eyes wander around you. The nearest thing to you were huge, pink hills of human flesh:. the giant's toes. The thought of being so close to these made you blush, but your life came first, so you disregarded them for now ; they didn't move and weren't an immediate threat. Towering far above you were the legs of the boy, wearing bright orange pants. Behind those, a huge bed. You couldn't see his face, but you assumed he was sitting on the edge of his bed and let his upper body lay down on the bed. Since this titan of a man wasn't moving, you had the occasion to make your move, but you had to be quick.<br>\r\nYou touched your headband to give yourself some courage and got on your feet, looking up to the gigantic landscape that was this boy.

Having fun right away and possibly dying wasn't something you wanted in the slightest, your priority was to make sure you'd survive ! Your hand rushed to the pouch on your leg and you grabbed a kunai then, with a swift jump, you took off the blue sandal. You reached the trousers' leg in a couple seconds, thanks to your ninja skills ; you couldn't even imagine how hard it'd be for a tiny civilian to climb on a giant body. You raised your kunai and gathered some chakra in your feet, then stabbed the thick orange fabric and started climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ascent along the leg took longer than expected. Thankfully, you realized after a couple minutes that the boy was sound asleep, as you could hear a faint snore in the distance. However, even though the behemoth was motionless, his leg twitched sometimes on its on, as if the boy's veins were always flooded with adrenaline and he was unable to stay still, even in his sleep. When you finally made it on top of the knee, you were greeted by a breathtaking view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loose trousers didn't let you guess how the boy's body was shaped. Now you could easily realize he was quite muscled as his orange jacket was open and the black shirt underneath it was partially lifted, showing the titan's toned abs. His arms were spread on his bed sheet, in a cross-like position. Even farther from you, far enough to look slightly blurred to you, was his face. Round, with full cheeks and whisker-like markings, a turned up nose and surrounded by golden hair, it looked gorgeous to you. Maybe the mountainous kid was a couple years younger than you, but he was definitely your kind of boy, both because of his size and of his looks. And of course, the leaf headband on his forehead didn't go unnoticed to you, but you thought you could deal with a genin, even a giant one, if you needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your cheeks flushed with excitation, you started running along his thigh without paying much attention to you surroundings, your mind focused on the giant's body.</span></div></div>",

You grabbed it for dear life so you wouldn't fat all he kept walking forward, each step he took making you feel more likely to fall to the ground below.  Eventually he opened the door to a nearby house and proceeded inside.  At least here you would be safe from the other villagers outside and it would be easier to catch his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked into another room and sat down on the floor against the wall, muttering something to himself you quickly realized now may be your only chance to engage him.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Hey, guys! I'm back with a new interactive! Gonna try to keep up with this one as best I can!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>SYNOPSIS:</b></font></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce upon a time, there was a powerful ninjutsu user who specialized in one particular form of curse which caused the ninja's enemies to shrink down to the size of ants. However, it was a member of the Uchiha clan who dealt him swift justice by replicating his technique and using it on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCenturies have passed since then. Many of the ninja's victims were killed, either being stepped on, being eaten, or in other more horrifying ways. However, a young man with a special communication jutsu connected with other victims of this ninja and, together, they formed the Hidden Foot Village. In the present day, were the inhabitants the same size as their normal-sized counterparts, their village would tower over the others, a true monument to perseverance and ingenuity, largely out of necessity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is the Hidden Foot Village that you belong to. You have been given the rank of Chunin by your ninja instructors, and your job, like many other ninja of the Hidden Foot Village, are to go out into the world, and find the curse so that the village may regain its proper size and truly become a force to be reckoned with. You have been looking forward to this day, but for not quite the right reasons. Your entire village would think you insane, but you have an appreciation for your size compared to normal humans and you are fascinated by the mountainous giants, even attracted to them, and you want to take this time to explore your fetishes, whether the giant ninjas are aware of your presence or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>RULES:</b></font></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to write these rules up 'cause not everyone likes the same kinda stuff, and I'm no different. If there's no rule about it, either message me and ask or you can try your luck. In either case, I'll add it to the rules below as it happens. These rules are mostly for the sake of common sense, common courtesy, and keeping the interactive nice and neat for a pleasurable experience for any reader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should also point out that, even though I created the interactive, I will be following these exact same rules that you will. If I step out of line on my own rules, please feel free to call me out on it. Everything I'm doing is to maximize the quality of the interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1.</b> No Female Interaction. Chapters featuring this content will be deleted. There are plenty of them about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2.</b> No killing off the main character unless the character is already about to die in a previous chapter. (<i>ex: Naruto sticks you in his sandal and stuffs his foot in. Choice: <span class=\"cblue\">You get compressed into the material and you live</span> OR <span class=\"cred\">The pressure's too intense and you get crushed underfoot.</span> Obviously, if you were to write a death chapter, you'd write it for the <u>second</u> choice.</i>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>3.</b> Unless the main character dies, the story does never ends. (<i>In the past. I have seen chapters that read \"And Naruto keeps you as his slave forever. The end\". That's not allowed.</i>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>4.</b> The main character is always willing to do anything, except die. \"You can't treat me like this, I'm a human being\" or \"Please stop!\"-type behavior is <b>not</b> allowed. There are a TON of other interactives with unwilling/non-consensual stuff in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>5.</b> A decent grasp of English language and grammar are necessary. I'm not expecting Shakespeare, but I am expecting something that other people can read. Remember your capitalization, your punctuation, your spelling, and your formatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>6.</b> The main character does <u>not</u> have a name. This is so that the reader can insert themselves into the story as the main character. Don't give the main character a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>7.</b> Any character in the anime, alive or dead, will be alive and well in this interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>8.</b> Any character can be in this interactive as long as they are from Naruto and they are biologically male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>9.</b> No change-hands chapters. (<i>example: Naruto is enjoying seeing you licking his feet. It is not allowed for Sasuke to suddenly come in and take you away from Naruto.<u> If you want a story with Sasuke in it, go write a story with Sasuke in it. Don't interrupt Naruto's story.</u></i>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>10.</b> Have fun! =D<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>CRITERIA FOR CHOICE CHAPTER ADDITIONS:</b></font></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you want to add a choice chapter. Awesome! I'm making this interactive so anyone can carve their own pathways out! But due to issues in several past interactives, I'm going to set up a special set of criteria for adding Choice Chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">First, what is a Choice Chapter?</font></b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA choice chapter is a chapter which includes a small amount of text followed by a choice. This is usually used at the very beginning of an interactive story to determine your starting point in the story. Do you start with Naruto? Or do you instead go with Kiba? Or maybe you're not even in the Leaf Village, maybe you're in the Sand Village and you want to pay Gaara or Kankurou a visit? With choice chapters, the starting point is far easier to get to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Why are there guidelines for Choice Chapters?</font></b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past, many would-be authors would add choice chapters to various interactives, but would not start or even contribute to a story. Many have used Choice Chapters in this fashion and, as such, many interactives could read that they have 500 chapters, but maybe 490 of those chapters are choice chapters with no content. So I want to put up some guidelines to make sure that, if and when this interactive hits 500 chapters, 490 of those chapters are full of content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">A Choice Chapter <span class=\"cblue\">MUST</span> have</font></b></u>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Two or more options. (<i>It's not much of a choice if there isn't, is there?</i>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Before a story begins, an indiscriminate <u>\"Other\"</u> choice. (<i>ex. You decide to add a Choice Chapter for Gaara and you have one free choice available. That choice must be <u>\"Other\"</u> or something similar. Also, if you have more than one free choice, the \"Other\" choice must always be the final option at the bottom of the list.</i>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-A chapter leading from the choice chapter you started, selecting one of the options that is not the \"Other\" choice. (<i>ex. You finish adding the Choice Chapter for Gaara, and your only other choice is the \"Other\" choice. Because you are the author of this choice chapter, <u>you must be the one to begin Gaara's story.</u> So you would write the first chapter of Gaara's story.</i>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><u><b>A Choice Chapter <span class=\"ctan\">can have, but does not require</span>:</b></u></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-More than a line or two of text. You can add it if you want to, but you are not required to. Just briefly explain what choice is happening, reflect that in the title, and you'll be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The maximum number of choices. Sometimes you don't need three choices in a chapter in an interactive, and that's okay. Just pretend the third choice isn't there. Or, if you really want to see what others would think up, feel free to put an \"Other\" choice, or even multiple \"Other\" choices as filler, just so others like yourself can add to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><u><b>-A Choice Chapter <span class=\"cred\">CANNOT</span> have the following:</b></u></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Less than a single sentence of text. You have to describe what the choice is. I'm not asking for an essay, just a sentence, maybe two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-A title reflecting what the choice is. The title of the chapter must also describe the choice, but in fewer words. This is so every choice chapter that's added isn't titled \"Other\". I don't want to see 20 chapters in the story outline called \"Other\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Before the story starts, an option that is already present in another chapter. Obviously, Naruto is going to be the first option I'm going to write about. That much is obvious. And that is Naruto's storyline. There shouldn't be any other choice chapter that adds Naruto as an option because he is already an option somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinal Remarks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want this interactive to be fun for everyone. It may seem like there are a lot of rules and guidelines. And there certainly are! But true and honest writing is all about remembering the rules of writing so well, that you don't even think about the rules when you're writing. You just follow them without thinking. One of the biggest accomplishments for any early writer is writing a flawless piece of work that you can feel proud of. Yeah, this isn't going to be that piece of work. But this is very good practice! If you try hard here, the next time you write something for real, you don't have to worry so much because you're in the practice of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, for the readers, please enjoy!</td>",
