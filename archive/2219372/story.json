            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Brian Hawkins; I\u2019m 13 years old and I live with my parents and my 7-year-old sister Mackenzie.  My life hasn\u2019t been the easiest lately, ever since my Dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.  I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve gotten through it all without my friends; Eric, Carrie and her twin brother Collin. The four of us have known each other since Kindergarten and were damn near inseparable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy am I telling you this? Because something happened to me just before I was to start 8th grade; something I can\u2019t quite explain. I was out in the woods behind my house, playing hide and seek with Mackenzie when I suddenly blacked out. When I regained consciousness, I thought that only a short time had passed.  Little did I know how wrong I was; what was only a few hours for me, was years for everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat comes next is the story of how I attempt to rebuild my life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>July 27, 2014</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said the last few days hadn\u2019t been stressful; with my dad having been admitted to the hospital after his condition took a turn for the worst.  He\u2019d been working his office when he suffered a seizure that resulted in him hitting his head on the side of his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after 9:00 in the morning and my mom was getting ready to leave to visit my dad at the hospital.  I was upstairs in my room, playing <i>Dead Space 3</i>, when I heard a commotion from downstairs.  After I paused the game, I went downstairs and found Mackenzie following Mom around like a lost puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie\u2019s had a hard time since my dad\u2019s diagnosis; when she wasn\u2019t with her best friend Emily, she was following Mom or me around the house.  Grabbing her jacket, Mom turned to look at Mackenzie and said, \u201cMackenzie, sweetie, I know you want to come with me; but your father doesn\u2019t want you to see him like this.\u201d Spotting me in the hallway, Mom said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you spend some time with your brother; and I\u2019ll be back in a few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll admit to being slightly annoyed by mom\u2019s suggestion.  I\u2019d had a busy week at school and wanted to relax with the video games; not babysit my clingy little sister.  Choosing not to act on my annoyance, I looked at Mackenzie and said, \u201cCome on Mac, let\u2019s go watch a movie or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Mackenzie focusing on me, Mom made a break for the door.  After a moment, Mackenzie said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go out and play in the woods or something?\u201d with a heavy sigh, Mackenzie looked at me and said, \u201cBeing outside always makes me feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, I feel I should mention that, since I woke up this morning, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I shouldn\u2019t go outside.  It was like a part of me thought something was going to happen if I stepped out the door.  Looking down at Mackenzie, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, Mac; I\u2019m not really feeling it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d grabbing my arm, Mackenzie said, \u201cIt\u2019s finally stopped raining, and mom says I can\u2019t go in the woods without you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew enough to realize that Mackenzie wasn\u2019t going to stop until I agreed to go outside with her.  \u201cOkay fine, we\u2019ll go play some hide and seek in the woods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie ran out the door into the backyard; I was about to follow her when I heard my cell phone ringing from upstairs.  Running upstairs, I grabbed it off my desk and saw that it was Eric calling.  He\u2019d spent the last month out in California with his Aunt and Uncle; his folks and Emily had flown out yesterday to bring him home.  Answering the phone, I said, \u201cHey man, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing I noticed was Eric\u2019s voice sounded a little different; almost as if it was higher than it should\u2019ve been.  \u201cNot much; we\u2019re in Chicago waiting for our connecting flight.\u201d Taking a breath, Eric said, \u201cThere\u2019s something important I want to talk to you about; are you going to be home tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I don\u2019t have any plans.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s so important that you can\u2019t tell me over the phone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather tell you in person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m heading outside to play hide and seek with Mackenzie, but I\u2019ll be free tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, you\u2019re the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour had passed since Mackenzie and I started playing hide and seek. We were taking turns being the seeker; it was currently Mackenzie\u2019s turn to search for me. She had just started counting and I was running to find a hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of searching, I found a small rock outcropping I could hide behind. I sat behind the outcropping for a few moments, listening as Mackenzie tried her best to find me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was watching some birds fly around overhead when I was suddenly overcome by an unbearably loud noise. I tried covering my ears in an attempt to drown it out, but it didn\u2019t work. I started feeling a little light-headed; the next thing I knew, I blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up again, I found myself _____.</span></div></div>",

But even that knowledge wasn\u2019t enough to prepare me for the teenage girl standing in the doorway.  Her dark blonde hair was now brown, and down past her shoulders.  She was not at least a foot taller; with breasts and a figure to boot.  But there was no denying it; I knew it was her the moment she walked into the room.  \u201cMackenzie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Mackenzie ran over and practically jumped onto the bed in order to hug me.  I quickly reciprocated the hug; although I was more than a little disturbed by the feel of Mackenzie\u2019s breasts.  After hugging me for what seemed like an eternity, Mackenzie stepped back and looked at me.  \u201cHow is it possible you haven\u2019t aged a day in 6 years?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m as puzzled as you are, Mac.\u201d Squirming a little in bed, in an attempt to hide the erection I found myself with, I said, \u201cThe last thing I remember was the two of us playing hide and seek; the next thing I know, we\u2019re practically the same age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite; I\u2019m actually 4 months older now.\u201d Wincing a little, Mackenzie said, \u201cI guess that makes me your older sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Mackenzie spent the next hour, interspersed with a few trips to the bathroom for Mom, catching me up on what I\u2019d missed.  It seems Mackenzie got worried when she hadn't seen me for 30 minutes; so she ran back to call Mom.  The police searched the area for months in the hopes of finding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas they never found any trace of me.  In the meantime, Mom became involved with one of the detectives on my case; they ended up getting married a few years after I disappeared.  \u201cHenry\u2019s a great guy; I think you\u2019d like him, Brian.\u201d With a tinge of sadness, Mackenzie said, \u201cHe\u2019s been really supportive; helping mom and me after Dad died.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone else been up to for the last 6 years?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Emily and I are on the cheerleading squad at school.\u201d Taking a breath, Mackenzie said, \u201cCarrie\u2019s attending college in New York; while Collin\u2019s at Penn State.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great for them, I guess.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWhat about Eric?  What\u2019s he been up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Eric, he...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mackenzie trailed off, I got worried that something had happened to Eric.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cMac, is Eric alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll simply say that things have changed with your friend, Brian.\u201d Looking at me, Mackenzie said, \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to say what; that\u2019s something for the two of you to talk about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...\u201d confused, I said, \u201cDo they even know I\u2019m alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in here with you for the last hour.\u201d With a bit of an attitude, Mackenzie said, \u201cWhen would we have had the chance to tell them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was more than a little put off by Mackenzie\u2019s sudden change in attitude.  \u201cGeez, I\u2019m sorry I asked.\u201d Looking at her, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bite my head off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Composing herself Mackenzie said, \u201cI\u2019ve been under a lot of stress lately; it just came out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom walked out of the bathroom at the point.  Looking at Mackenzie, she said, \u201cMackenzie, sweetie, why don\u2019t you head down to the car.  I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Hugging me again, Mackenzie said, \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re back, Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too, Mac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mackenzie left the room, Mom turned to me and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your sister\u2019s attitude just now.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cShe\u2019s had it rough the last couple weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t go into detail; suffice it to say, your sister is becoming a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a bit confused by that statement; until I suddenly realized what Mom meant.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cMac\u2019s having her period?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right; her first one.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cHer mood swings make the ones I experienced during my first trimester look tame by comparison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the warning, Mom,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, sweetie.\u201d Hugging me, or at least the best she could, Mom said, \u201cYou have no idea how happy I am that you\u2019re back; alive and well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we just have to figure out why I\u2019m the same age I was when I disappeared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we can work on tomorrow.\u201d Smiling, Mom said, \u201cYou should probably get some rest; we\u2019ll come by in the morning.\u201d </span></div></div>",

I was feeling incredibly anxious about the prospect of seeing my friends again; wondering how they\u2019d changed and how they\u2019d react to seeing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nurse wheeled me into the conference room, I saw two people hanging around the table.  Even after six years, I instantly knew who they were; my friends Carrie and Collin.  Every one of them went silent when they realized I was in the room.  After a moment the silence became unbearable, so I said, \u201cHey guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollin, who was no longer the short chubby kid I remembered, was the first to respond.  \u201cThis has to be some kind of joke, right?\u201d turning to my Mom, and Mac, he said, \u201cHe looks exactly the same as he did six years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really him, Collin.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cThe doctors ran a DNA test, and his fingerprints matched the ones the police had on file.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was the next to step forward; giving me a chance to see just how little she\u2019d changed over the years.  She\u2019d always kept her hair short; to the point where she was often mistaken for a boy.  Her hair was just as short now, the only difference being that it was a light brown color now.  \u201cIf you\u2019re really Brian, then tell me something only he would know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give it a shot.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhen we were in 7th grade, you kissed me in the boy\u2019s locker room after school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie\u2019s eyes went wide when I said that; while Collin laughed and said, \u201cYou kissed <i>him</i> in 7th grade?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that Collin was teasing Carrie for kissing me, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal if she kissed me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think, Brian.\u201d With a chuckle, Carrie said, \u201cI\u2019m a lesbian; Collin\u2019s just teasing me because I kissed a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Turning to Collin, I said, \u201cSorry, I thought you meant something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright kiddo; you didn\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to ignore the kiddo comment, I said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Eric?  I thought he, of all people, would be here to see me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie and Collin exchanged concerned looks with each other.  It looked as though they were about to say something; when the door to the conference room opened.  I turned to find two girls, one of whom I realized was Emily, standing in the doorway.  The other one looked familiar, but I couldn\u2019t figure out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Emily just stared at me, in shock; the other girl came over and hugged me.  \u201cI-I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was put off by the fact that an unfamiliar girl was hugging me.  Gently pushing her away, I looked at her and said, \u201cDo I know you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, resembling a slightly older version of Emily with bigger boobs, just stared at me for a moment.  Then a look of realization appeared on her face; as if a light bulb just went off.  \u201cBrian, you knew me as Eric.\u201d</span></div></div>",

My best friend was now a girl; and I had had no idea.  <i>Or had I?</i>  The more I thought about it, the more I realized there\u2019d always been something different about Eric.  Don\u2019t get me wrong; we both liked action movies and video games.  But he\u2019d always preferred horses to cars, and almost always dressed as female characters for Halloween.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the time that I\u2019d gone to visit him when he was home alone; only to see him, through the window, walking around the house in his sister Grace\u2019s cheerleading outfit. <i> What kind of friend was I, that I hadn\u2019t seen that?</i> \u201cA-Are you happy...Andrea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy, Brian.\u201d With a smile bigger than I\u2019d ever seen her make, she nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019m the real me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019m happy for you, too; I just wish I\u2019d been there to help you through this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re here now, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Looking at me, with a smile, she said, \u201cPlus it would mean the world to me if you approved of my boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment I realized she\u2019d gotten up and was standing next to Collin.

It didn\u2019t matter to me that Collin was now 5 inches taller than me and could easily beat me up; I wanted to punch him for saying that.  Thankfully Andrea came over before anything happened.  \u201cBrian, he didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d <br>\r\nGlaring at Collin for a moment, Andrea turned back to me and said, \u201cYou were gone for so long, we have to get used to having you back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what; your birthday is in two weeks,\u201d with a smile, Andrea said, \u201cI promise you we\u2019ll be there to celebrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone said their goodbyes, Mom and Henry walked them to the lobby; leaving me alone in the conference room.  I started to get a little lonely until the door opened and Emily walked into the room.  I was vaguely aware that she and Mac had left earlier to go off somewhere.  Gesturing to a bottle of soda in her hand, she said, \u201cHey Brian, I thought you might like a drink or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Em.\u201d Chuckling, I took the soda and said, \u201cIt\u2019s been 6 years since I had a soda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re back; even though I\u2019m looking right at you.\u201d Sitting next to me, Emily said, \u201cI keep expecting to wake up and find this was all just a dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA part of me wishes this was a dream; that I\u2019d wake up and realize I hadn\u2019t missed the last six years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us just sat at the conference table and talked; in that regard, it was as if six years hadn\u2019t passed since I last saw her.  The others used to tease me for it, but I was just at home hanging out with Emily as I was with them.  It was weird to think the teenage girl sitting next to me was the same one I taught how to wrestle when she was 6 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Emily I remembered could have easily passed herself off as a boy; I rarely, if ever, saw her wearing skirts or dresses.  That was no longer the case now; everything from her breasts to her budding figure screamed that she was a girl.  Her brown hair had gotten darker over the years and, instead of being shorter than Mackenzie, she looked as though she was only a few inches shorter than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird to think of her that way, but I couldn\u2019t help but think she was attractive now.  At that moment I realized neither of us had said anything for a few minutes; we were just staring at each other.  After a moment, Emily said, \u201cIt feels weird to admit it, Brian...but I had a bit of a crush on you when we were...I mean when <i>I</i> was younger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Emily, dumbfounded, for a second before saying, \u201cY-You did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I just never said anything because of the age difference.\u201d With a smile, Emily said, \u201cBut here you are now, and somehow we\u2019re practically the same age.  How is something like that even possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour guess is as good as mine, Em.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI\u2019d really like to know where I\u2019ve been the last six years, and why I haven\u2019t aged.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie came into the room at that moment; an annoyed look on her face.  For a moment I thought it was towards me, but instead, she looked at Emily and said, \u201cFinally! I\u2019ve been looking all over for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Mac; I was talking with Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell come on, Alicia\u2019s here to bring us to the mall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Brian, but it looks like I have to go too.\u201d  Emily stood up and hugged me, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you later, Em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Emily and Mac left the room, leaving me alone once again, I thought back to what Emily had said.  She had a crush on me years ago; was there anything stopping her from acting on it now?</span></div></div>",

As we got into the car, Henry looked back at me and said, \u201cSo Brian, what do you feel like doing first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Buckling my seatbelt, I said, \u201cCould we just drive around a bit?  I\u2019d love to see what\u2019s changed over the last six years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Glancing towards Mom, a grin on his face, Henry said, \u201cI suppose I\u2019d want to do the same thing if I were in your position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo everything decided, Henry started the car and we left the hospital parking lot.  As we drove towards town, I figured the town wouldn\u2019t have changed that much in six years.  It was one of those small, historic towns in eastern Pennsylvania; it was a big deal when Costco decided to open a location on the outskirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did I realize just how wrong I was \u2013 the town had changed a lot since I\u2019d disappeared.  For starters; an empty lot across from the elementary school had been turned into a condo complex and even the movie theater had gotten bigger.  I was a little disappointed to find that Easy Eats BBQ, my family\u2019s favorite restaurant, had closed down.  Other than that, the town had stayed relatively the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter driving around town for an hour, Mom announced that she had to use the bathroom.  Luckily for her, we were close to a Dairy Queen so we pulled into the parking lot.  While Mom waddled to the bathroom, Henry and I waited for her by the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that we were both nervous around each other.  For me, I was still trying to process the fact that my mom had remarried while I was gone.  Henry, no doubt, was trying to figure out how to act around me.  After all, it had just been him, my mom and Mac, for the last few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter neither of us had said anything for a few moments, Henry got up from the hood of the car and said, \u201cHow about I buy you some ice cream, Brian; then perhaps we could have a little talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Looking at him, I said, \u201cTalk about what, exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious you\u2019re having trouble with the fact that I\u2019m here.\u201d Leading me towards the line, Henry said, \u201cI just figured we could talk; to reassure you that I\u2019m a good guy and that I have no intention of replacing your dad.\u201d</span></div></div>",

We were both in a fragile condition, but we helped each other through it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to worry about where Henry was going with this.  Looking at him, as bluntly as I could, I said, \u201cWere you having an affair with my mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, at least not in the physical sense.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cYour mom was an emotional wreck; what with you missing and your father in the hospital.  With no one else to support her, I guess I became her source of emotional support.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I couldn\u2019t really fault them for being there for each other, but hearing this dampened my opinion of Henry and my mom.  <br>\r\n\u201cHow soon after my dad died did you two become involved?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was close to a year before we started dating, but that doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t in the picture.\u201d Looking at me, Henry said, \u201cI helped your mom with housework, and even helped Mackenzie with her problems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of problems?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat your sister went through, I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone; losing her brother and father in the span of a month.  I\u2019d be lying if I said she handled it well.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cShe was suspended from school several times for fighting, she got in trouble for stealing a bottle of soda from a gas station.  She\u2019d even wake up screaming in the middle of the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat at the table; trying to process what Henry had told me.  I had a hard time believing that the person Henry was describing was my sister.  The Mackenzie I knew was not the type to get into trouble.  \u201cDoes Mac still have those problems?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankfully she\u2019s worked past those issues.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cNow she\u2019s just a 13-year-old girl; something that brings its own challenges.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should be grateful that you were here for them.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cStill, I wish my dad was still here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father was a great man, Brian.\u201d Looking at me, placing a hand on my shoulder, Henry said, \u201cI want you to know that I have no intention of replacing him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know what came over me at that moment; but, without saying a word, I hugged Henry.  Henry returned the hug, and that was the position Mom found us in when she walked out of the bathroom.  \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re both getting along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was never going to be an issue.\u201d Getting up, Henry kissed Mom and said, \u201cBrian\u2019s a great kid; you did a great job raising him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Henry.\u201d Smiling, turning to me, Mom said, \u201cSo, sweetie, what do you say we go home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m not sure how I would\u2019ve felt had it been completely different.  As the three of us got out of the car, I could hear music playing in the backyard.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in the backyard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably your sister.\u201d Grabbing her purse, Mom said, \u201cShe\u2019s probably lounging around the pool with Emily and Allison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pool?</i> \u201cWhen did you put in a pool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe put it in a few years ago.\u201d Looking at me, Henry said, \u201cMost of your things are in storage; so if you want to use it, you\u2019ll have to borrow one of my swimsuits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of us walked in through the garage, Mom said, \u201cYou may want to ask your sister if it\u2019s alright, first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need her permission, Maureen.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cContrary to what she thinks, Mackenzie doesn\u2019t decide who uses the pool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cAt least go out and say hello first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked through the kitchen to the backdoor; opening it to find the back deck had been expanded around a decent size in-ground pool.  I was so focused on the pool, I barely heard Mackenzie when she said, \u201cOh God, what are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess Henry hadn\u2019t been joking when he said Mackenzie was now a typical teenage girl.  I was amazed by the 180 she\u2019d taken since yesterday; going from being thrilled I was back to annoyed that I was in the same room as her.  \u201cMom and Henry said that I should check out the pool, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I turned my attention to Mac, Emily and who I could only assume was Allison; I was taken aback by their appearance.  If I\u2019d been having trouble accepting the fact that my kid sister and her best friend were now teenagers, seeing them in bikinis wasn\u2019t helping me any.  \u201cFine, just don\u2019t bother us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison, a cute looking blonde girl, looked at me in confusion.  \u201cWho is that, Mac?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be my <i>little</i> brother; the one who was missing for 6 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried my best to hide my annoyance over the emphasis Mac put on the word little.  Thankfully, before I could say something I'd regret, Allison spoke up.  \u201cWait, he\u2019s the one whose picture you have on your desk?\u201d looking at me, Allison said, \u201cIf he\u2019s been missing for six years, how does he look the same as in the photo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one knows.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting a little put off by Mac\u2019s attitude; so after introducing myself to Allison, I quickly turned around and walked back into the house.  I barely made it into the kitchen before I heard someone call my name, \u201cBrian, wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around to find Emily coming towards me; giving me an up-close look at her in a bikini.  \u201cHey Em, y-you like great in that bathing suit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear I caught a brief glimpse of Emily blushing; before she said, \u201cThanks.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Em; she had a rough morning, don\u2019t take it personally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to take it personally when I come back after six years and my sister wants nothing to do with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know how teenagers can be; one minute they\u2019re all happy, the next minute they\u2019re all doom and gloom.\u201d Smiling, Emily said, <br>\r\n\u201cIf it makes you feel any better, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder if Emily still has that crush on me.</i> \u201cThanks, Em, that does make me feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get put on a suit and come join us?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll admit that I agreed for two reasons; I felt like relaxing, and I\u2019d be a fool to pass up a chance to hang out at a pool with two attractive girls (and my sister).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry had an old bathing suit that fit me, so I put that on and quickly went back outside.  The first I did was a running jump into the pool; inadvertently splashing Mac and the others in the process.  That got me a glare from Mac, but smiles from Allison and Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few laps in the pool, I returned to the deep end to find Allison and Emily sitting on the edge with their feet in the water.  As I went over to them, Allison said, \u201cSo what\u2019s the weirdest change you\u2019ve noticed since being back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean aside from my mom being pregnant, and my sister being four months older than me?\u201d with a chuckle, I said, \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m still trying to process the fact that I disappeared for six years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us spent the next 20 minutes or so talking.  Despite my best efforts, I occasionally found myself staring at Allison and Emily\u2019s chests.  I tried to look away, but I honestly couldn\u2019t stop myself; both of them were quite good looking.  Given Emily\u2019s revelation about her crush on me, I wasn\u2019t surprised to find her staring at me; I was surprised, however, to find Allison staring at me too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look half bad in that suit, Brian.\u201d Looking at me, Allison said, \u201cI\u2019ll bet you had girls breaking down the fence for a chance to see you, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really.\u201d My face turning red from embarrassment, I said, \u201cThe pool didn\u2019t get put in until after I disappeared, so...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could finish my sentence, I was interrupted by Emily forcibly clearing her throat.  \u201cBrian, could you bring us some drinks, please?\u201d staring angrily at Allison, Emily said, \u201c<i>Some</i> of us need to cool off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Climbing out of the pool, barely noticing the glares I was getting from Mac, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked back towards the kitchen, I heard Emily say, \u201cStop flirting with him, Allison; I told you how I felt about him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped around the corner, out of sight, so I could hear Allison\u2019s response.  \u201cSorry Em, it\u2019s just he\u2019s <i>really</i> cute.  You might have some competition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big grin appeared on my face as I walked into the kitchen.  I hadn\u2019t even been back for a day, and here I already had two attractive girls fighting over me. </span></div></div>",

I followed the girls into the house to say my goodbyes.  After saying goodbye to Mac, Allison went a little overboard with her goodbye to me \u2013 giving me a peck on the cheek.  <br>\r\nBoth Emily and Mac glared at her as a result, although I suspected it was for different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily\u2019s goodbye was a little more subdued; as she gave me a hug, she said, \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re back, Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too, Em.\u201d Hugging her, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mac and I waved goodbye to them, as they walked down the sidewalk, Mac closed the door.  I started heading towards the kitchen to make a sandwich when she suddenly spun me around and shoved me against the wall.

I stood there in stunned silence, trying to process what just happened.  I don\u2019t know what happened to make her that way, but <i>that</i> was not the Mackenzie I remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still standing in the hallway, a few minutes later, when the front door opened.

I almost made it to the driveway when I heard Emily\u2019s voice behind me.  \u201cHey Brian, wait up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around and saw Emily running towards me; no longer wearing the dress from earlier.  I felt a sudden pang of disappointment; because I thought she looked really great in the dress.  I shook my head in an attempt to get those thoughts out of my mind.  I shouldn\u2019t be thinking of Emily like that; just two days earlier she\u2019d been a 7-year-old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Emily caught up to me, I looked at her and said, \u201cHey Em, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a new ice cream parlor that opened downtown; I was wondering if you\u2019d like to try it out.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cIf you\u2019re worried it might be awkward, I promise it won\u2019t be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOkay, I guess that could be fun.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cMaybe you can teach me how to use social media while we\u2019re there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big smile flashed on Emily\u2019s face before she looked at me and said, \u201cSure, we can do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us started walking down the road, I said, \u201cI want to thank you for being willing to help me, Em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me, Brian; that\u2019s what friends are for.\u201d Looking at me, Kat said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d do the same thing if the roles were reversed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us had been at the ice cream parlor for close to an hour; eating our ice cream while Kat helped me with my phone.  I had a basic understanding of social media from six years earlier, but things had changed a lot since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily, to her credit, was very helpful; she had the patience of a saint as she taught me the ins and outs of Snapchat and Instagram.  We finally reached a point where Emily figured I\u2019d learned enough; so, after getting some milkshakes, we just sat outside and talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be weird for you; starting 8th grade again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did pretty well the last time, so I\u2019m not too worried.\u201d Taking a sip of the milkshake, I said, \u201cThe weirdest thing is the fact that you and Mac will be my classmates; no offense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI imagine you\u2019ll draw a lot of attention from our classmates, especially once word gets out that you\u2019re back.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cYou\u2019ll probably even have a lot of girls after you as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Emily say that had me thinking; there was one girl in particular whose attention I was interested in.  \u201cI\u2019ve only been back for a few days, but I think there\u2019s one girl in particular that I like.\u201d Looking at her, with a sly smile, I said, \u201cThe question is, does she feel the same way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Emily\u2019s face turn red as she started blushing.  She stared at me for a moment, silent, before she leaned over and kissed me.  <br>\r\nAfter getting over the initial shock, I reciprocated the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe did that for a few moments until we were rudely interrupted.  \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and I immediately broke the kiss; looking in the direction of the voice, we saw Mac glaring at us.</span></div></div>",

Looking at her, I saw her shake her head feverishly.  I sat back down and tried to calm myself; looking at Mac, I said, \u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was getting my nails done with Allison; I saw you guys over here, so I thought I\u2019d stop by.\u201d Looking at Emily, Mac said, \u201cCome on Em, let\u2019s go; I think Brian\u2019s taken enough of your time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou go, I\u2019ll catch up; I have to use the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited until Mac had crossed the street before getting up.

We had \u2018secret meetings\u2019 that were protected by a sign that said <b> No Girls Allowed </b> \u2013 I wonder how Andrea and Carrie felt about that.  <br>\r\nWe spent whole summers zip-lining across the yard, we had a blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treehouse took on a new role after Dad was diagnosed; when he was having a bad day, I would climb up and think back to when he was healthy; when all he cared about was making his kids happy.  After his first round of chemo, I hung up a picture of the two of us showing off the completed treehouse.  Even after all these years, I was glad it was still there.

On the other hand, with <i>my</i> friends currently 6 years older than me, I didn\u2019t have anyone my age to hang out with.  \u201cI appreciate the gesture, Mac.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI suppose it wouldn\u2019t hurt to start making friends of my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d With a hint of condescension in her voice, Mac said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you two will hit it off; you both like all that geeky stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to ignore that comment, I simply walked past Mac and reentered the family room.  \u201cSo, uh, you want to go upstairs and <br>\r\nplay some video games?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I guess.\u201d Feeling about as awkward as I was, Cameron said, \u201cWhat games do you have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us walked upstairs to my room, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, all my things are 6 years out of date.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cBut I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find something interesting to do.\u201d</span></div></div>",

One major difference, however, was that he\u2019d had 6 years of practice; so he kicked my ass every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got tired, after a while, of having my ass handed to me; so we eventually stopped playing games and just watched some TV.  During a commercial break, I turned to Cameron and said, \u201cForgive me if I\u2019m out of line here; but why exactly are you friends with Mac?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, she\u2019s on the popular side; and you\u2019re...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can say it; I\u2019m a nerd.\u201d Sitting back against my bed, Cameron said, \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know why Mac associates herself with me.  I think having Allison as my sister is a big part of it; the other, well, I think I reminded Mac of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can see that; I mean we both have the same interests.\u201d Looking at Cameron, I said, \u201cHave the last six years been as bad for her as I\u2019ve been told?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe even slightly worse than you\u2019ve been told.\u201d Sighing, Cameron said, \u201cShe got suspended for two weeks because she broke a kid\u2019s nose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the third person who\u2019s told me something like that.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m just having a hard time picturing that; the Mac I knew would never get into fights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s been through a lot, Brian; with you disappearing and your dad dying.\u201d Looking at me, Cameron said, \u201cHaving those happen so close together would break anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to respond when suddenly there was a knock at the door.  Mom poked her head inside and said, \u201cCameron your mom called; it\u2019s time to go home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Mrs. Tucker.\u201d Getting up, Cameron turned to me and said, \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too, Cameron; I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Cameron left, Mom came over and took a seat on my bed.  \u201cYou seem to be adjusting rather well, Brian.\u201d With a sly smile, she said, \u201cNot only do you have a girlfriend, but you\u2019re making new friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Mom?\u201d blushing, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a girlfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d With her right eyebrow raised, Mom said, \u201cThen perhaps you\u2019d care to explain why I saw you and Emily making out in your treehouse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou saw that!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you forgotten the kitchen window looks right into your treehouse?\u201d turning serious, Mom said, \u201cI thought you were going to talk with your sister before you started anything with Emily?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to talk to her, Mom; it\u2019s just, everything happened so fast.\u201d My heart racing, I said, \u201cOne minute we were talking at the ice cream parlor, the next minute we were kissing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour sister mentioned something about that, but she thought it didn't mean anything.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cJudging from what I saw going on in the treehouse, I can only assume she was incorrect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s complicated, Mom; Emily didn\u2019t think Mac could handle the idea of us dating.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell her when I feel the time is right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, that\u2019s all I ask.\u201d Getting up, Mom said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for dinner, why don\u2019t you come downstairs.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I thought it would have been a complicated thing to do, but Henry said that all I had to do was go to the courts and prove that I was who I said I was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, we all decided to watch a movie as a family.  I was in the kitchen making some popcorn with Henry, while Mac and mom were getting the movie set up.  As we waited for the microwave to finish, Henry came over and stood next to me.  \u201cYour mom told me about what happened in the treehouse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Wincing, I turned to him and said, \u201cWhat exactly did she tell you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat you and Emily were tongue wrestling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m 13 years old, Henry.\u201d Groaning, I said, \u201cIf you want to say that Emily and I were making out, then just come out and say it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fair enough.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cSo what brought all of this on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were hanging out at that new ice cream parlor; Emily was helping me with social media.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cOne thing led to <br>\r\nanother; and we started making out when Mac found us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then went into detail about what happened; from Emily lying to Mac to what happened in the treehouse.  When I was finished, Henry looked at me and said, \u201cEmily said that she loved you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she did; and believe me, I was as surprised as you are.\u201d Blushing again, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this conflicted about my feelings for a girl before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be conflicted about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d looking at Henry, I said, \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, Emily was 7 years old only a few days ago.  Now she\u2019s an incredibly attractive girl who\u2019s my age.  I\u2019m not sure how my feelings for her won\u2019t conflict with my memories of her as a little kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe way I see it, Brian; there\u2019s only one person you should talk about this with.\u201d Seeing the confused look on my face, Henry said, \u201cEmily doesn\u2019t appear to have a problem with acting on her feelings for you.  You should talk with her about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that makes sense.\u201d Catching a glimpse of Mac walking around the family room, I said, \u201cFor now I suppose we should be careful around Mac; she seemed pretty annoyed that I was kissing her best friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a problem for another day, Brian.\u201d Grabbing the popcorn from the microwave, Henry said, \u201cFor now, let\u2019s go watch a movie as a family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently followed Henry into the family room.  As I walked behind the couch, I caught a glimpse of Mac\u2019s cell phone as I passed behind her.  I only caught a glimpse of it, but I saw that she was having a text conversation with someone about a party in a few days.  Coming around the couch, I looked at her and said, \u201cHey Mac, can I sit next to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d Putting her phone away, Mac said, \u201cJust try not to bug me, okay?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Walking downstairs, I saw that Mom and Mac had already left for the morning; having planned an impromptu trip to a nail salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Henry and I had a quick breakfast, he gathered the necessary paperwork while I went outside to wait for him.  I was standing by the car when I noticed Emily peek around the back corner of her house.  Figuring Henry was going to be a few minutes, I made my way over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could even say good morning, she pulled me around the corner and kissed me firmly on the lips.

Catching my breath, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have time for it now, but you and I need to talk at some point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s never good when someone you\u2019re in a relationship with says that.\u201d Sighing, Emily said, \u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to talk about our relationship.\u201d Looking at Emily, I said, \u201cBefore we take things any further, I need to know if <i>this</i> will work despite our past friendship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it; as far as you\u2019re concerned I was just a kid a few days ago.\u201d Leaning against the back of her house, Emily said, \u201cI can\u2019t say I blame you; after all, you taught me to ride my bike and suddenly we\u2019re making out in your treehouse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to make this work because I do like you.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI just need to make sure it\u2019s appropriate for us to be together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell that this wasn\u2019t what Emily wanted to hear, but she took it all in stride.  \u201cI waited for six years to have a chance with you, Brian.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI guess I can wait a few weeks for you to figure things out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegardless of whatever happens, there\u2019s something I want you to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d with a faint smile, Emily said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if we aren\u2019t a couple, you know that I\u2019ll always care for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Brian.\u201d Hugging me, Emily said, \u201cI\u2019ll always care about you, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry walked out of the house at that point, so I said goodbye to Emily and went to get into the car.

You hardly look a day over 13.\u201d Turning to Henry, she said, \u201cMr. Tucker, if this is your idea of a joke I\u2019m not amused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever known me to lie, Your Honor?\u201d handing the judge my information, he said, \u201cFingerprints, dental records, DNA; they all say that he\u2019s Brian Hawkins, at the same age he was when he disappeared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen where\u2019s he been for the last 6 years?\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t he aged a day in that time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Your Honor.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI was playing hide and seek in the woods with my sister when I suddenly lost consciousness.  When I woke up again I was in a hospital bed and my mother was suddenly pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are no clues as to what happened to him, Your Honor.\u201d Looking at me, Henry said, \u201cFrankly, we\u2019ve decided not to look for any clues; if something falls in our lap then so be it, but we won\u2019t be actively looking for it.  So far as we\u2019re concerned, Brian\u2019s back and that\u2019s all any of us could wish for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess there\u2019s no sense looking this gift horse in the mouth.

As I walked up to the door, I couldn\u2019t help but be a little anxious.  It was hard to tell Andrea\u2019s tone from her text, but part of me suspected that she wasn\u2019t happy with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must\u2019ve seen me coming up the driveway because she was standing at the door when I got up there.  I was beginning to notice a pattern with her; every time I\u2019d seen Andrea she was wearing a dress or some other feminine outfit.  Today was no different; she was wearing a dress that showed a fair amount of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened the door, I looked at her and said, \u201cYou wanted to talk with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, come on in.\u201d sighing, her tone of voice neutral, Andrea said, \u201cI\u2019d rather not do this in public.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore worried than ever, I followed Andrea into the living room and sat down on the couch.  As she took a seat across from me, I said, \u201cAndrea, if this is about Emily...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the best thing for you to do, for the time being, is to let me talk.\u201d Looking at me, clearly annoyed about something, Andrea said, \u201cWhat I want to hear, right now, is why I had to find out about this from my little sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything happened so fast, I wasn\u2019t sure if it meant anything.\u201d Taking a breath, as I tried to calm myself, I said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to tell you if it turned out to be nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t buy that for a minute,\u201d getting up, Andrea walked over and sat next to me.  \u201cWhen I first started my transition, <br>\r\nI was more worried about coming out to you then I was to my family.  But no matter how scared I was, I still wanted to tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the same thing, Andrea; you were undergoing a life-altering change.\u201d Sitting back, I said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out my feelings for a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this girl, shall we?\u201d sitting back, crossing her legs, Andrea looked at me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a pretty attractive guy; even I had a crush on you for a little bit.  You could get any girl that you wanted, why would you decide to take an interest in Emily?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to ignore the fact my best friend had a crush on me, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve always cared about Emily; she was like a little sister to me.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I wound up in this situation that I realized, if the conditions were right, that I could be attracted to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I get that; she\u2019s good looking for a girl her age.  But come on, you can do so much better than her.\u201d Leaning close to me, Andrea said, \u201cJust between you and me, she\u2019s kind of annoying.  She\u2019s always borrowing my clothes and makeup.  You could do so much better than her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know exactly what caused it to happen, but one minute I was listening to Andrea talk, and the next minute I snapped.  <br>\r\nJumping to my feet, I got right in Andrea\u2019s face and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you ever say that about Emily!\u201d unable to calm down, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s the most beautiful girl I\u2019ve ever seen, and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll let anyone talk about her like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea just stared at me with a stunned look on her face.  I thought she was going to call me out for yelling at her like that.  Instead, to my surprise, she said, \u201cWell that\u2019s all I needed to hear.\u201d Turning towards the hallway, she said, \u201cIs that good enough for you, sis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw dropped as I saw Emily come around the corner; a big smile on her face.  \u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at both of them in shock, unable to process what was happening.  \u201cW-What\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Andrea went over to stand next to Emily.  \u201cAs I said, Emily told me everything; even how you weren\u2019t sure if your feelings for her were genuine.\u201d Smiling, Andrea said, \u201cWe concocted this little scheme to see if we could make you realize they were.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You tricked me?\u201d looking at Andrea, I said, \u201cFor a minute there I thought you really were annoyed that I didn\u2019t come to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that part was real; I was genuinely annoyed with you about that.\u201d Smiling, Andrea said, \u201cI thought we promised never to keep anything secret from each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for not telling you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal; just don\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to Emily, I stopped in front of her and said, \u201cYou knew this whole time, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat your feelings for me were real?\u201d nodding, a smile on her face, Emily said, \u201cI knew the moment you kissed me at the ice cream parlor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything around me ground to a halt; as I stared at Emily.  Before I could stop myself, I leaned over and kissed her; coming up <br>\r\nfor air just long enough to say, \u201cWill you be my girlfriend, Emily Rogers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKissing me, Emily said, \u201cOf course I will, Brian Hawkins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us kissed for a few minutes until Andrea brought us back to reality.  \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you guys, but there\u2019s one thing that you\u2019re both forgetting about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d exchanging confused looks with each other, we both said, \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe part of the relationship where the parents meet the boyfriend for the first time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must\u2019ve looked worried after that because Emily looked at me and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Brian; my parents have known you for years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stayed over at Emily\u2019s for a little while longer; making out with her on the couch.  As I got up to leave, Andrea stopped me just outside the door.  \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, Brian; but I want you to know something.\u201d Getting a stern look on her face, Andrea said, \u201cDon\u2019t you ever do anything to hurt Emily; or so help me, I\u2019ll make sure you never make the same mistake twice.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I was still feeling really good about the way things went with Emily; I\u2019d been back for a few days and I already had a girlfriend.  While I was annoyed by how they tricked me, I had to give Emily and Andrea credit for giving me the push I needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting hungry so I was in the kitchen microwaving a personal pizza when I heard the doorbell.  Thinking that perhaps it was Emily, I walked down the hall to the front door.  I lost all color in my face when I saw that it was the reporter from the courthouse.

All I could do, while watching him leave, was think that I\u2019d just made a terrible mistake.  Closing the door, I ran into the kitchen and grabbed the phone.

That wasn\u2019t to say we didn\u2019t have cause to celebrate; after all, I was now legally alive again.

I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Emily and I honestly wondered if she was thinking about me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after 9:15 when I heard a noise coming from the outside my room.  My sense of curiosity got the better of me, so I climbed out of bed and went to investigate.  I followed the noise to Mac\u2019s bedroom door; I slowly opened the door and notice Mac\u2019s window was wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon further examination I realized that Mac wasn\u2019t in the room, so I ran to the window; just in time to see her running around the far corner of the house.  <i>What the hell is she doing?</i>  Going back to my room, I quickly got dressed so I could follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know I should\u2019ve told Mom and Henry, but at that moment I decided not to.  Going downstairs, I went outside to see if I could find her.  Running to the end of the driveway, I caught sight of her a short distance down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed after her; the whole time wondering what she was doing.  After walking for about 15 minutes, she turned up a nearby street.  I ran to catch up to her; watching from a distance as she approached a brightly lit house with about a dozen cars parked out front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got closer, I started to suspect this was a teen party; my suspicions were soon proven correct when I spotted three girls sitting on the hood of some guy\u2019s car with beers in their hands.  <i>Mac, please don\u2019t be doing what I think you\u2019re doing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way past some drunken teens, who barely acknowledged me.  Walking into the house, I could hear Mac\u2019s voice coming from the kitchen.  There was some loud music but I could still make out what she was saying, \u201cThanks for inviting me, guys; I\u2019ve been looking forward to this all week,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing towards the kitchen, I stopped in my tracks when I saw what was going on in there.  I kept trying to tell myself I was imagining things; but sadly I wasn\u2019t.  There she was, my little sister, wearing the kind of skimpy outfit you\u2019d find college girls wearing at spring break.  On top of that, she had an open bottle of beer in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to control myself, I walked over and smacked the bottle out of her hands.  Looking at me, daggers in her eyes, Mac said, <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell, Brian!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should be asking you the same thing, Mac.\u201d Trying to stay calm, I said, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mac could answer, the sound of police sirens could be heard coming from the front yard.  <i>Oh crap.</i></span></div></div>",

Of course it helped that there was rain in the forecast for the next four days; so it wasn\u2019t like I was missing anything outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent most of my time reading or catching up on 6 years of TV.  But, most importantly, it gave me time to think; mostly about my new relationship with Emily.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I was thrilled by the thought that we were dating; but there were times when I still felt weird about our relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mom and Henry told me that such thoughts were normal at the start of any relationship; especially one between two people who\u2019ve known each other for years.  Speaking of Emily, I was in the middle of watching an episode of Grey\u2019s Anatomy when there was a knock at my door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that it was Mom, or Henry, checking up on me; I went to open the door.  Seeing how I wasn\u2019t supposed to be allowed visitors, you could imagine my surprise when I saw Emily standing outside my door.  \u201cEm?

But it wasn\u2019t as a neighbor, and long-time family friend; no, this time it would be as the boy dating their youngest daughter.  Looking at Emily, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything I should know about before I go over there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is the first they\u2019ve seen you since you came back, so be prepared for the \u2018where have you been\u2019 and \u2018why haven\u2019t you aged\u2019 questions.\u201d Pausing, Emily said, \u201cOther than that, I\u2019m not 100%; I wasn\u2019t even home when they met with Collin about his relationship with Andrea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I have a sinking feeling that they won\u2019t be alright with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they?

There will always be someone around to ensure that you two do nothing more than kissing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI caught a glimpse of Emily poking her head around the corner.  She waved at me, but I didn\u2019t respond.  Turning back to Mrs. Rogers, I said, \u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo long as you can abide by our rules, we\u2019ll give you permission to date our daughter.\u201d Standing up, Mr. Rogers said, \u201cTo tell you the truth; I\u2019d much rather let her date you than someone from school that we didn\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Rogers.\u201d Standing up, I said, \u201cBefore I leave, I\u2019ll never let any harm come to Emily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying my goodbyes, I left and started walking back towards my house.  Before I could cross over to my yard, I heard footsteps behind me.  Looking back, I saw Emily walking towards me.

But that didn\u2019t mean today wasn\u2019t going to be stress-free \u2013 after all, it was the first day of school.  I was certain that I\u2019d get a lot of confused looks at school; but with the help of Cameron, Emily and Allison I knew I wouldn\u2019t have a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re probably wondering what happened with my planned date (no, not that kind of date) with Andrea \u2013 the one where we\u2019d hang out and play video games all day.  Well if my being grounded hadn\u2019t kept that from happening, then I\u2019m sure Collin\u2019s surprise weekend getaway would have.  I couldn\u2019t blame Andrea for bailing on me; after all, it\u2019s not every day a college freshman can afford to take his girlfriend to a luxury spa for the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, back to the first day of school.  Henry dropped me and Emily off by the main entrance if only to ensure that we got there safely.  After saying goodbye to him, the two of us got out and met Allison and Cameron in front of the flag pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked up to them, I noticed Allison looking at us holding hands.  Remembering how she was flirting with me at the pool, I said, \u201cI hope there are no hard feelings, Allison; but, uh, Emily and I...have a history.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Brian; I figured it was only a matter of time before you two got together.\u201d Chuckling, Allison said, \u201cBesides, I was only flirting with you to mess with Emily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Emily glared at Allison, I couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed \u2013 this whole time, I thought Allison was actually interested in me.  \u201cOh, I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison quickly realized her mistake; looking at me, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that, Brian; you\u2019re actually quite good looking.\u201d Blushing, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s just, you\u2019re not really my type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we started walking into the building, Emily leaned over and said, \u201cIf you were her type, then we\u2019d have a problem; because she goes for the jocks.\u201d Kissing my cheek, Emily said, \u201cI\u2019ve always had a thing for the quite, smart type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we got into the building, I said, \u201cJust one thing before we go inside; Henry managed to keep Mac\u2019s name out of the paper regarding her arrest.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cIf anyone asks where she is, we\u2019re supposed to say she\u2019s home with mono.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably a good idea.\u201d Looking around at some of the girls nearby, Allison said, \u201cThere are kids here who\u2019d jump at the news that Mac\u2019s an alcoholic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Cameron said, \u201cHow\u2019s she doing, by the way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s being stubborn; yesterday they called and said she broke a nurse\u2019s thumb in a door.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cApparently she wasn\u2019t exaggerating when she said she doesn\u2019t remember what it\u2019s like to be sober; because the doctor in charge of her case said she\u2019s rarely seen adults go through withdrawals this bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Would it be alright if I came up with you guys the next time you see her?\u201d turning quiet, Cameron said, \u201cI-I want her to know that I\u2019m here for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My first class of the day was Gym; and I was dreading it.  It wasn\u2019t because I wasn\u2019t the athletic type; it was because I was worried about not being around my friends.  I noticed some boys looking at me in the locker room, talking to each other in hushed tones.  They must\u2019ve realized that I was the boy from the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignored the whispering and went out to the gymnasium.  My earlier concerns were proven fruitless when I saw Allison sitting on the bleachers nearby.  Once she saw me standing there, she smiled and waved me over.  As I walked over and took a seat next to her, I said, \u201cAt least there\u2019ll be one friendly face in this class.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cA lot of the guys were talking about me in the locker room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I blame them; after all, your sudden return is pretty unusual.\u201d Looking at me, Allison said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to tell you this, but you\u2019ll find out soon enough.  Your mom and Henry made arrangements with the school to have Emily, Cameron, or myself in at least one of your classes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was touched by the thoughtful gesture.  As more students started to trickle in, I noticed several girls walking towards us.  I couldn\u2019t help but notice the looks on their faces as they saw me sitting with Allison.  One of them, a blonde who was surprisingly well developed for a 13-year-old, looked at me and said, \u201cSo Allison, I heard your dear leader is in rehab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the \u2018dear leader\u2019 remark wasn\u2019t enough; the instant the girl mentioned rehab, I knew she was talking about Mac.  I let my emotions get the best of me and, before Allison could stop me, I was right in the girl's face.  \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, go away loser.\u201d Shoving me, the girl said, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMegan, this is Mac\u2019s brother \u2013 the one who\u2019d been missing for six years.\u201d Getting right in the girl\u2019s face, her tone and demeanor changing, Allison said, \u201cNow if you don\u2019t want <i>your</i> little secret to get out, I suggest you keep your mouth shut for a change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan huffed for a moment before walking away; the two other girls glaring at us before they joined her.  As Allison sat down again, thrown off by her sudden change in attitude, I said, \u201cI, uh, wow...that was something,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that; sometimes my inner bitch comes out without warning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing concerned, I looked at her and said, \u201cDoes that happen to Emily too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt happens to every girl, Brian; especially during our time of the month or when someone just pisses us off.\u201d Turning to me, Allison said, \u201cWord of warning, don\u2019t annoy Emily during her time of the month.  You won\u2019t like what happens next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat back on the bleachers for a moment; trying to process the idea that Emily, my girlfriend, could have a dark side I didn\u2019t know about.  Since coming back, and learning about her problems, I\u2019d assumed Mac\u2019s dark side was because of the drinking \u2013 but now, I wondered if the drinking just made it more noticeable.  Turning my attention to Allison, I said, \u201cHow could Megan have heard about Mac being in rehab?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho knows; that girl has ways to find things out.\u201d Looking at me, Allison said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry though; she won\u2019t say anything if she knows what\u2019s good for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly remembered Allison\u2019s veiled threat to Megan.  \u201cThat reminds me; what exactly is <i>her</i> little secret?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of an open secret; since every girl in our grade knows about it.\u201d Leaning towards me, whispering in my ear, Allison said, \u201cMegan\u2019s stuffed her bra since the 7th grade; she\u2019s pretty flat-chested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin formed on my face; I suspected something was off about Megan\u2019s chest.  There was no way a 13-year-old girl could be <i>that</i> big this early.  Looking at Allison, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Getting up, Allison said, \u201cNow come on; class is about to start.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gym class was okay, I had a lot of people staring at me, but thankfully Allison was there for moral support.  The same couldn\u2019t be said for my second class, math; I was on my own for that one.  Thankfully no one seemed too interested in me, so it was smooth sailing till lunchtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the lunchroom, I saw a long line of people waiting for food.  I groaned; because I figured the food hadn\u2019t improved much in 6 years.  After getting my food, I spotted Emily and Allison sitting at a table in the corner.  I didn\u2019t see Cameron but I figured he was around somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking my way over to the table, I put my tray down and went to kiss Emily.  You can probably imagine how surprised I was when she not only recoiled but also pushed me away.  \u201cDon\u2019t do that here, Brian; everyone\u2019s watching.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what; who cares if they see me kissing my girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned in for another kiss, this time Emily shoved me hard enough for me to land on the floor.  Stepping up to me, she said, \u201cGet away from me, loser.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea what was going on at this point; Emily hadn\u2019t acted remotely like this when Mac found us together.  Getting to my feet, desperate for answers, I said, \u201cEm, what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust stay away from me, Brian; I want nothing to do with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point I was fairly certain that my relationship with Emily was over; so without saying a word, I turned and walked out of the cafeteria.  I found a secluded stairwell and sat down to cry.  I was there for a few minutes until I heard footsteps approaching, I looked behind me and saw Emily standing in the doorway.  Wiping tears from my eyes, I said, \u201cYou come to yell at me some more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Brian, I-I\u2019m...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stopped mid-sentence as she walked over a planted a kiss on my lips.  I reciprocated briefly until I remembered what happened only minutes ago.  Breaking the kiss, I shoved Emily away and said, \u201cNo Em, kissing me won\u2019t make up for what you did back there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking wounded, Emily said, \u201cBrian, let me explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt better be one hell of an explanation; because until now I thought you were my girlfriend.\u201d Looking at her, angry, I said, \u201cIf this is how you treat your boyfriends then I hate to break it to you, but you won\u2019t have many of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell that Emily was trying to figure a way out of the hole she\u2019d dug for herself; I could practically see the gears turning in her head.  After a moment, she looked at me and said, \u201cWill you just shut up for one second!\u201d with a hint of emotion in her voice, tears beginning to form, Emily, said, \u201cI am your girlfriend, Brian; but...it\u2019s complicated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore today I\u2019d never guffawed in my life, but I did so now in response to Emily\u2019s statement.  \u201cHow could it possibly be complicated?  It seems pretty clear cut to me; we\u2019re either a couple or we\u2019re not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s more to school then just grades, Brian; I\u2019ve worked hard to become one of the most popular girls in our class.\u201d Sighing, clearly dreading what she was about to say, Emily, said, \u201cI love you, but being your girlfriend isn\u2019t helping my status any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt the same way I did when I found out my dad had died; like someone had punched me in the stomach.  \u201cWell then, I\u2019ll make it easier for you.\u201d Shoving her as I walked by, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re through, you\u2019re not my girlfriend anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear I could hear Emily collapsing against the stairwell wall as I left; but at that moment, I didn\u2019t care.  All I could think about, as I walked through the halls, was how conflicted I had been when we first got together; how I tried to convince myself it was wrong to feel that way about her \u2013 but I got past that.  If Emily truly loved me, then it shouldn\u2019t matter what our classmates thought about our relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as I walked into the bathroom to compose myself, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019d made a terrible mistake.</span></div></div>",

With nothing to do but sit at the computer, I decided to see what information there was about my disappearance on the web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that Henry and the others were right; there were tons of wild conspiracy theories about my disappearance.  Now that I was back there were theories about that as well; some people thought I was a clone while some thought I was from another reality.

While waiting by the parking lot I noticed Emily walking towards me with Cameron and Allison.  I had hoped to patch things up with Emily, but the looks she was giving me told me that wasn\u2019t going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Allison stepped up and said, \u201cAre you two really going to break up because of what happened at lunch?\u201d looking at us both, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen how good you are together, it\u2019s clear the two of you are meant to be a couple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I agreed with you, Allison; but I don\u2019t.\u201d sighing, glancing at Emily, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t be with someone more concerned about her social life than her boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked as though she was going to yell at me; until she caught herself and said, \u201cAnd I can\u2019t be with someone who won\u2019t support me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be supportive of?\u201d incredulous, I said, \u201cThere\u2019s more to life than being popular, Em; the sooner you realize that the better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt bad for Allison and Cameron, as they were caught in the middle of mine and Emily\u2019s fight.  I honestly expected them to side with Emily; solely because of the fact they knew her longer than me.  So I was pleasantly surprised when Allison took the middle ground.  \u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys take some time to think things over, it\u2019s never good to make decisions based on anger.\u201d Looking at the two of us, gesturing to Cameron, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll support you guys in whatever you decide; just please don\u2019t make any rash decisions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom drove up at that point, along with Allison and Cameron\u2019s mom behind her.  As I climbed into the front seat, I saw that Emily was still standing on the sidewalk.  \u201cAre you coming or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys go.\u201d Shaking her head, Emily said, \u201cI\u2019m going to walk home; it\u2019s only a mile and I could use the time to think.\u201d</span></div></div>",

While we waited for them to answer, Henry looked at me and said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice you\u2019ve been in a particular dour mood today.  Did something happen at school today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, something happened at school.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cEmily and I got into an argument at lunch; then we broke up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom already heard it all during the car ride home, but she still gasped when she heard me say it just now.  Looking at me, Henry said, \u201cThat must\u2019ve been a pretty big argument; what was it about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was at lunch, I walked over to where Emily and Allison were sitting; I went to give Emily a kiss but she recoiled and shoved me to the floor.\u201d  Leaning back in the chair, sighing, I said, \u201cCome to find out, she\u2019s more concerned about her image than her boyfriend\u2019s feelings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmily\u2019s at a difficult age, Brian; she\u2019s trying to figure out where she fits in.\u201d taking a breath, Henry said, \u201cPart of that is because of your sister; whatever Mac did, Allison and Emily would emulate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat there soaking in what Henry had just said, as horrible as it may sound, I found myself blaming Mac for my relationship problems with Emily.  Ever since they were kids Mac had been, for lack of a better word, the Alpha in their friendship; and it seemed to still be the case six years later.  \u201cWhat do you suggest I do, Henry?\u201d Looking at Henry, I said, \u201cDespite what happened today, I still care about Emily.  There has to be something I can do to fix things with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe best advice I can give you is to give Emily her space; perhaps, given time, she\u2019ll realize her feelings for you are more important than her social status at school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom had stepped out into the hall at some point during our conversation; she walked back in and said, \u201cI\u2019m on hold; they\u2019re going to get Mackenzie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that all concern I had about Emily faded away; as my thoughts turned to Mac.  I knew it had only been a week since we dropped her off, but I hoped against hope that Mac was doing better.  Sadly that hope vanished when her voice, seething with anger, came over the speaker.  \u201cWhat the <i>hell</i> do you guys want?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever since I\u2019d learned about Mac\u2019s aggressive behavior at the Clinic, I found myself hoping that it was just an anomaly, that she was just going through withdrawals.  After listening to her screaming over the phone for five minutes those hopes were dashed; as she bombarded us all with an expletive-filled tirade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou f**king bastards are going to pay for this; I\u2019ll f**king kill you if I ever get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went on like that for a while; as she ranted about how the staff was torturing her.  The worst part, for me at least, was when she said, \u201cThis is all Brian\u2019s fault; this wouldn\u2019t have happened if he hadn\u2019t disappeared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said that didn\u2019t wound me; all I could do was gasp in shock at Mac\u2019s remarks.  Taking one look at me, Henry turned to the phone and said, \u201cYour brother\u2019s disappearance has nothing to do with this, young lady; so don\u2019t go blaming him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever Henry; you\u2019re not even my real father, so stop acting like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d had about enough at that point; I got up from the table as Mom took her turn yelling at Mackenzie.  After losing my girlfriend, I didn\u2019t need to hear that Mac blamed me for her problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking upstairs, as the screaming continued in the background, I went down the hall to my room and closed the door.  That muffled the screaming a little bit, but I could still hear it in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat down on my bed, I spotted a box sitting on the floor by my desk.  The box contained some home movies that I\u2019d found in the attic a few days earlier.  Getting up, I grabbed the first DVD I saw and put it in the player.  I didn\u2019t even know what was on the disc until the video started; as Mac and Emily ran through the family room dressed in cowboy outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled; realizing this was the last Halloween before I disappeared.  Back before things went to hell.  Dad must\u2019ve been behind the camera because I saw Mom chasing after Mac so she could adjust her hat.  \u201cHold still Mackenzie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly my voice came over the speakers; \u201cEric wants everyone to promise they won\u2019t make fun of him because of his costume.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked up at the camera before looking offscreen, \u201cWe promise, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the video moved to the staircase where Andrea and I stood, in all our 12-year-old glory, wearing our costumes.  <i>The Avengers</i> had just come out a few months earlier; so I wasn\u2019t surprised to see that Andrea and I were dressed as characters from the movie \u2013 myself as Iron Man and Andrea as the Black Widow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused the video at that point; moving closer to get a better look at Andrea.  In retrospect, I suppose it was obvious, even back then that something was different about Andrea.  She\u2019d always insisted on dressing as female characters for Halloween; but she went all out for this particular year, buying some fake breasts and a corset to give herself a figure.  Add that to the form-fitting costume she was wearing, she easily passed for a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m glad you were able to become your true self, Andrea.</i><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the next 30 minutes watching more of the home movies; taking note of how different Emily and Mac were from 6 years earlier.  They were far from the rambunctious, and energetic, kids that I remembered them as.  My sister had developed a drinking problem; while Emily was obsessed with her popularity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment I heard a knock on the door, followed by Mom slowly walking into the room. Pausing the movies once more, I looked at her and said, \u201cI take it you finally had enough of Mac\u2019s yelling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour sister\u2019s problem is more severe than we thought; it\u2019s been a week since we dropped her off, and she\u2019s still experiencing withdrawal symptoms.\u201d Sighing, as she took a seat next to me, Mom said, \u201cShe attacked another nurse yesterday; they\u2019re thinking of sending her to a more secure facility.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that got me thinking about what Mac had said earlier.  \u201cNone of this would have happened if I hadn\u2019t disappeared.\u201d Lying back on my bed, I said, \u201cThis whole thing is my fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself for this, Brian; your sister is solely responsible for her situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Mom; if I hadn\u2019t disappeared then she wouldn\u2019t have started drinking.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cMaybe I could\u2019ve kept Emily from turning out the way that she did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeenage girls can be very unpredictable, Brian; especially when they\u2019re Emily\u2019s age.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cIf it makes you feel better, I have faith that you\u2019ll work things out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love your optimism, mom; but you weren\u2019t there.\u201d Staring at the ceiling, I said, \u201cWe both said things in the heat of the moment, things we can\u2019t take back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate to break it to you, Brian; but that\u2019s all part of being in a relationship.\u201d Leaning up against my wall, Mom said, \u201cDo you think Henry and I get along 24/7?  About a week before you came back, I yelled at him solely because he didn\u2019t put the mouthwash cap on tight enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that wasn\u2019t just some pregnancy mood swing, Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it was, but my point still stands.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cJust because two people are in love doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t get angry from time to time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of bed, I turned to face Mom.  \u201cEmily and I weren\u2019t in love, Mom; we were only together for a week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuring that week I saw how the two of you were with each other.\u201d Looking at me, with a \u2018mother knows best\u2019 look on her face, Mom said, \u201cTell me this; if you two weren\u2019t in love, then why are you so upset over the fact that you two broke up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood there, I started to realize that perhaps Mom was right.  \u201cOkay, let\u2019s say you\u2019re right about Emily and me.\u201d Sitting next to her, I said, \u201cHow could we have possibly fallen in love so quickly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt may not have always been love between you two, but you\u2019ve both cared deeply for each other for a long time.  How often do you see a 12-year-old boy willing to spend so much time with his best friend\u2019s 7-year-old sister?\u201d looking at me, Mom said, \u201cNow that the age difference is no longer a factor, your feelings for each other took the next logical step.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was silent for a moment as I processed everything.  \u201cWhat do I need to do to get her back, Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid this is something that Emily has to figure out for herself, Brian; is her love for you more important than how your classmates feel about her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should just give her some space.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Smiling, Mom said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what; it\u2019s been 6 years since we had one of our mother/son outings.  What do you say we have one tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Dad\u2019s diagnosis, Mom set aside time to spend with Mac and me individually.  We did things like bike riding, rock climbing, etc.  I knew Mom couldn\u2019t do any of that stuff at the moment, but I couldn\u2019t resist the temptation.  \u201cHow do you feel about going to the indoor rock wall?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, kiddo; I doubt they\u2019d let me in my current condition.\u201d Smiling, Mom said, \u201cWhat do you say we visit your father\u2019s grave, then we can decide from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd been back for almost 2 weeks, but I hadn't seen my dad's grave yet. I suppose, in retrospect, I was just nervous about seeing it. Looking at Mom, I said, \u201cOkay, that sounds nice.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I was kneeling behind the rock outcropping as I watched Mac searching for me in the distance. <i>Everything seems normal here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything changed suddenly when I noticed a bright light appear behind me; turning around I saw what appeared to be a portal of shimmering light floating just above the ground. <i>Okay, I don\u2019t remember that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over my shoulder to see that Mac had disappeared behind a boulder, I turned my attention back to the portal. I felt this overwhelming urge to reach out and touch it; so that\u2019s what I did. Everything seemed fine until I realized I couldn\u2019t pull my hand back. <i>What the hell?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, some unseen force was starting to pull me towards the portal. \u201cHelp! Somebody, please help me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy pleas were unanswered; if Mac heard them, she was too far away to do anything. I struggled in vain to escape but was eventually pulled through the portal. What I saw inside was difficult to describe \u2013 it looked almost like the inside of a kaleidoscope; with colors changing all around me. I saw a bright light ahead of me and decided to go towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I stepped through, I found myself back at the same spot I left; only this time I swear the ground was wet. I was suddenly overwhelmed by a high-pitched whistling noise; overwhelming to the point where I simply collapsed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I woke up back in my bedroom, my entire body drenched in sweat.

Looking at her, I said, \u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry, Mac; I missed so much of your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have nothing to apologize for, Brian; it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Moving to the edge of the bed, Mackenzie held me close and kissed my forehead.  \u201cWho would have thought you\u2019d disappear for 27 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie and I remained in that position for a while; as I cried and she did her best to console me.  The longer it went on for, the more it dawned on me that she was responding the way a mother would towards her child.  After a while, she stepped out of the room to make a few phone calls; leaving me alone with my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just walked out of the bathroom when Mac walked back into the room; still talking on her cell phone.  \u201cI don\u2019t need a DNA test, honey; I just know this young man is my brother.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to stay here for a while; Allison\u2019s sleeping in one of the on-call rooms.  Kiss the kids good night for me, alright? I love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mackenzie hung up the phone, I looked at her and said, \u201cWho was that on the phone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be my husband, Duncan,\u201d putting her phone away, Mackenzie said, \u201cI think you\u2019d like him; he\u2019s a lot like Dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point I realized, with everything going on, that I hadn\u2019t thought about Mom and Dad. \u201cHow are Mom and Dad?\u201d looking at her, I said, \u201cDo they know I\u2019m alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tried to call Mom, but I got her voicemail.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Mackenzie sat down and said, \u201cDad, unfortunately, died about a month after you disappeared.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Looking at me, she said, \u201cI had a <i>very</i> rough childhood after that; I even started drinking in 6<sup>th</sup> grade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked.  \u201cMac!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought it was the only way I could get on with my life.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI finally stopped after I got arrested for being at a high school senior\u2019s party.  I haven\u2019t had a drink in 20 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us talked for a few more minutes until a nurse came into the room.  \u201cMrs. Dawson, your daughter is asking for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Looking at me, Mac said, \u201cI won\u2019t be long Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be here when you get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle, Mac said, \u201cYou better be, mister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat there on the bed, with no one else in the room, for a few minutes; processing everything that I\u2019d learned in the last few hours.  <br>\r\nYou\u2019d think ending up 27 years in the future would be the most shocking thing to come from this; but, honestly, I was more shocked to learn that my little sister was a grown woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI eventually got bored so I decided to watch some TV; the problem was, I had no idea had to work the TV.  I was about to call a nurse for help when I heard a ringing noise coming from Mac\u2019s purse.  I don\u2019t know what compelled me to do so, but I decided to dig through Mac\u2019s purse to see what the noise was coming from.  <i>I hope she won\u2019t mind.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of searching, I came across what I could assume was a cell phone.  I was about to set it aside when I noticed who was calling \u2013 Mom.  Before I knew what I was doing, I answered the call.  Suddenly an image of my mom, albeit older with grey hair and wrinkles, appeared on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were both stunned for a moment; she was the first to finally speak.  \u201cBrian?\u201d</span></div></div>",

But now that I had time to process everything, I was able to recognize minute details in people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman\u2019s smile, for instance, was a dead giveaway as to who she was.  Looking at her, a smile of my own, I said, \u201cHey Emily, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d coming over, Emily practically squeezed me to death as she hugged me.  \u201cPlease tell me this isn\u2019t some twisted practical joke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me, Em.\u201d Catching my breath, I said, \u201cYou look good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman standing before me was most assuredly Emily, but I still had some difficulty believing it.  I felt weird thinking this, since the last time I saw her she\u2019d been 7 years old, but she\u2019d grown into quite an attractive woman.  Barely an inch taller than Mac, she could\u2019ve easily passed for a woman in her mid-20s.  \u201cOh please. I look like crap.\u201d Chuckling, Emily said, \u201cI spent the last 12 hours in surgery, I barely had time to take a shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mac\u2019s phone started ringing; after checking to see who it was, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute.  Em, can you keep an eye on Allison?  She\u2019s out here in the hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Glancing at me, Emily said, \u201cThis\u2019ll give me a chance to catch up with your brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mac walked out of the room, I turned my attention back to Emily.  \u201cSo what happened, I thought you wanted to be a teacher when you grew up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did; up until my junior year of High School.\u201d Pulling up a chair, Emily said, \u201cI took an AP anatomy class, and I just got hooked.  So 11 years later, after racking up a <i>considerable</i> amount of debt, I became a board-certified pediatric surgeon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed; then again I always knew you were smart.\u201d Leaning back in the bed, I said, \u201cWhat else have you been up to?  You married?  Got any kids?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a 13-year-old daughter named Callie; I got pregnant a few months into my residency.\u201d Taking a pause, Emily said, \u201cAs for being married; well, I haven\u2019t found the right guy yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s out there, don\u2019t give up hope.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI kept forgetting to ask Mac about my friends; do you know what they\u2019ve been up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing well; Collin and his wife, Andrea, have two kids.

What\u2019s he been up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily went silent for a moment; which started to make me worried.  After a moment, Emily said, \u201cEric is...well, he\u2019s been through a lot.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cSo much so that I don\u2019t think you\u2019d recognized him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to say, Brian; that\u2019s something you two need to discuss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was worried; did something bad happen to Eric while I was gone?  I didn\u2019t have long to dwell on it, because suddenly a teenage girl walked into the room.  \u201cHey Mom, Allison wants something to eat from the vending machine.  Can I have a few bucks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo long as it\u2019s not anything too sugary.\u201d Digging through her purse, Emily said, \u201cBefore you go, there\u2019s someone I want you to meet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, who I now realized was Emily\u2019s daughter Callie, moved closer to her bed.

I did not fully realize what it was until Emily introduced her.  Looking at her, I could immediately tell that Callie was Emily\u2019s daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie was the first to speak after the introduction; reaching her hand out, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Brian.\u201d Blushing a little bit, Callie said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard stories about you pretty much my entire life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d  Turning to Emily, an eyebrow raised, I said, \u201cPeople have been telling stories about me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be fair, you did become famous after you vanished.\u201d  Smiling, Emily said, \u201cYour disappearance became something of a mystery since they never found a body or a suspect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I guess that\u2019s fair.\u201d  Turning my attention back to Callie, I said, \u201cSo did I live up to all the hype?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly.\u201d With a slight frown, Callie said, \u201cI kind of thought you\u2019d be taller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 13 years old I was still only about 5\u20198,\u201d so I shared Callie\u2019s disappointment.  \u201cBelieve me, so do I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Mac appeared in the doorway and gestured for Emily to step out into the hall.  \u201cCallie, I\u2019ll be right back; why don\u2019t you stay and talk to Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, Mom; no problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Emily left the room, I looked at Callie and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay here if you don\u2019t want to.  It\u2019s not like we know each other or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind staying here with you.\u201d Chuckling, Callie said, \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve got nothing else to do this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the next hour just talking with Callie; she did her best to bring me up to speed on everything I missed over the last 27 years.  I reciprocated by telling her some stories about when her Mom was a kid; although I chose not to tell her anything embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe also took the time to get to know each other a little better; as it turned out, Callie and I shared many of the same interests.  She liked playing video games and going outdoors as much as I had.  \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, though; I\u2019ve got no problem showing off my feminine side if I need to.\u201d With a grin, Callie said, \u201cJust because I\u2019m a girl doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like getting down and dirty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re your mother\u2019s daughter, alright.\u201d Chuckling, I looked at her and said, \u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t be surprised how many times they were mistaken for boys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I believe it; I saw some old photos of them when they were younger.\u201d Smiling, Callie said, \u201cI guess it runs in the family; when I <br>\r\nwas younger I went through a phase where the only hairstyle I would want were buzz cuts.  It made for some interesting conversations when Mom would bring me into the ladies\u2019 room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went by, the two of us began talking like we were old friends.  We were in the middle of talking about some TV show Callie thought I\u2019d like when Mac and Emily walked into the room.  \u201cOkay Cal, I think we\u2019ve taken up enough of Brian\u2019s time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so, Mom.\u201d Getting up, Callie looked at me and said, \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Brian; perhaps we can hang out once you get out of the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like that; it\u2019s just a question of when I\u2019ll get out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Callie and Emily left, Mac turned to me and said, \u201cYou two seemed to hit it off pretty easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cIt helps that we have a lot of the same interests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re out of here, I\u2019ll give you her phone number.\u201d Pausing, Mac said, \u201cIn the meantime, the doctors want to take you for an MRI.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn MRI?\u201d suddenly worried, I said, \u201cWhat for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey noticed some peculiarities in the scans they took after you were brought in.\u201d trying to sound comforting, Mac said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Still worried, I said, \u201cHave you heard from Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot since they boarded the plane; don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As we got out of the elevator, I turned to her and said, \u201cMac, you don\u2019t need to stay with me 24/7; you have your own family to take care of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be foolish Brian; you\u2019re my family too.\u201d Placing a hand on my shoulder, Mac said, \u201cForgive me for not wanting to let you out of my sight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I couldn\u2019t blame her from wanting to be close by; especially since I\u2019d been missing for the last 27 years.  If I were in her position I\u2019d likely be doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat quietly in the wheelchair as the nurse turned down a hallway leading to the MRI.  No one had said anything for a few moments, so I decided to break the ice.  \u201cI suppose you must\u2019ve heard a lot about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, the nurse said, \u201cNo, not really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d I was surprised to hear that.  \u201cI thought it was a big story back then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt probably was, but I was a little girl then.\u201d Looking down at me, the nurse said, \u201cIf it didn\u2019t happen on Disney Junior, I didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that just made me realize, even more, how much everything had changed.  My little sister was now a grown woman and my nurse couldn\u2019t have been older than 4 years old when I disappeared.  It made me wonder how many other hospital staff had been kids when I disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us rounded a corner heading towards the MRI; the nurse was about to wheel me in when a doctor stopped us at the door.  Looking at Mac, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am, but only patients and medical staff are allowed past this point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my brother, doctor.\u201d Getting defensive, Mac said, \u201cI\u2019m not letting him out of my sight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor wasn\u2019t having any of it; he looked as though he was going to call security when the nurse stepped in.  \u201cDoctor Amherst, this is the boy who disappeared 27 years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor looked from me to Mac for a moment.  With a sigh, he said, \u201cOkay fine, but don\u2019t touch anything and stay out of my way.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I went to lie in bed while Mac went to get me a glass of water.  She returned a few minutes later with both a pitcher of water and some cups.

After a moment, I settled on one in particular and said, \u201cHow\u2019d you go from being one of the detectives on my case to being married to my mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe became friendly early on; offering each other emotional support.\u201d Looking at me, Henry said, \u201cYou see, I was going through a pretty nasty divorce at the time.  Your mom helped me with that; while I helped her cope with your disappearance and your father\u2019s declining health.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me for asking this; but did you two become involved while my dad was still alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t become involved until about a year after your father died.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t in the picture.  I helped out with the housework and  even helped Mackenzie with her problems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMac mentioned she had a drinking problem when she was younger.\u201d Taking a pause, I said, \u201cHow bad did it get for her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish what your sister went through on anyone; not even my worst enemy.  Losing both her brother and her father in a month took its toll on her.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cShe was suspended from school several times for fighting; she got in trouble for stealing a bottle of soda from a gas station. We didn\u2019t find out about the drinking until she got arrested at a party a few blocks away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d known about the drinking but the rest was all a big surprise.  I had a hard time believing that the person Henry was describing was my sister.  Looking at Henry, I said, \u201cHow did she finally work past all that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe got through it with some help from your mom, me, and her friends.\u201d Pausing, Henry said, \u201cShe resisted at first, but finally came around after your brother was born.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMac didn\u2019t tell me a whole lot about Aaron; only that he\u2019s on Spring Break right now.\u201d Looking at Henry, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great kid; smart as a fox.\u201d Smiling, Henry said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like him; you both have similar interests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to work past the fact that I was born before my older brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Henry said, \u201cGive it some time, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac came walking into the room at that moment.  \"I'm sorry to interrupt, but there's someone outside who wants to speak with Brian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" looking at Mac, I said, \"Send them in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac leaned out the door and waved at someone I couldn't see.  I watched as a woman, in her early 40s and wearing a business suit, walked into the room.  With everything going on, I figured she must've been from Social Services or something.  But I couldn't shake the feeling that she looked familiar.  Whoever she was, I watched as Henry stood up and made his way towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac and Henry left the room; leaving me alone with the woman.  Looking at me, she said, \"I couldn't believe it when Mac told me you were back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine I look very different from the last time you saw me.\" stepping closer to the bed, the woman said, \"My name is Andrea, but you knew me as Eric.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I stared at the woman in disbelief; there was no way she could have been Eric.  For one thing, she was a woman.  The silence in the room was deafening; as we both just stared at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment I finally got up the nerve to speak.  \u201cForgive me, but there\u2019s no way you\u2019re Eric.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI mean you\u2019re a woman, and Eric was a guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was never a guy, Brian; it just took me a while to finally become who I was supposed to be.\u201d Sighing, Andrea said, \u201cThere has to be something I could do to prove I\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re Eric, then tell me something that only he would know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea pulled up a chair next to my bed; she sat down and looked at me. \u201cWhen they brought you into the ER after your zip lining incident; the nurse asked you how many fingers she was holding up.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cShe was holding up 6, but you said \u2018Spider-man.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I had been drinking any water, I probably would\u2019ve done a spit take.  As impossible as it seemed, the woman sitting before me was my best friend.  \u201cIt\u2019s really you, Eric?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease call me Andrea; I haven\u2019t gone by Eric in almost 30 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went silent again as I tried to process everything.  Andrea was an attractive woman; a little on the tall side for a woman but with a nice figure.  The more I looked at her though, the more I was able to see hints of my friend in her face.  \u201cI thought Mom and Mac had changed since I saw them last, but you\u2026\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cWhen did all of this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you remember, the day you disappeared, when I called you on the phone?  I told you I had something important to talk with you about.\u201d  Gesturing to herself, Andrea said, \u201cWell, this was it.  I went to my aunt\u2019s house to start my transition in secret; you were the first one I was going to tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me if I\u2019m being awkward, but you look amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I go to the gym three times a week.\u201d Leaning closer, Andrea said, \u201cJust between you and me; it\u2019s nice to know I\u2019m still considered attractive at my age.  My kid\u2019s friends are always complimenting me about how I look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have kids?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cDid they make some medical breakthroughs while I was gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSadly no, a woman like me is still unable to get pregnant.\u201d Pausing, Andrea said, \u201cI did things the old fashion way; Emily donated some eggs while Grace carried them to term.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re an excellent mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like to think so, but there are times when my kids think I\u2019m terrible.\u201d Chuckling, she said, \u201cThankfully Collin is there to help clear things up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, I'm a little surprised to hear that you married Collin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just celebrated our 19th-anniversary last month.  I don\u2019t blame you for being surprised by that; after all, I had a crush on someone else until he disappeared on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took longer than I wanted to admit before I realized she was talking about me.  \u201cYou had a crush on me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a <i>huge</i> crush on you since the 7<sup>th</sup> grade, but I never said anything because I knew you wouldn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d Blushing a little bit, Andrea said, \u201cAfter I started my transition, I dreamed of the day when I could be your girlfriend.  But then you disappeared, and I eventually started dating Collin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry you never got to be my girlfriend.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI trust that Collin and you are happy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s the love of my life and the father of my children.\u201d Pausing, Andrea said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade him for anyone else in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us talked for a few more minutes about married life and Andrea\u2019s kids.  It seemed that Andrea was truly happy with her life; and I, in turn, was happy for her.  \u201cSo what do you do for a living?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in charge of the Woman\u2019s Fashion department at Bloomingdales.\u201d Smiling, Andrea continued, \u201cIt\u2019s my dream job; even if I have a 90-minute commute each way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute; its 10:00 on a Wednesday, why aren\u2019t you at work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a doctor\u2019s appointment; one, I might add, that I\u2019ve had to reschedule three times.\u201d Pausing, Andrea said, \u201cI figured I\u2019d kill two birds with one stone; go to the appointment and then stop by to see you before going to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in that case, I won\u2019t keep you any longer.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s great to see you again, Andrea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see you again, Brain.\u201d Hugging me, Andrea said, \u201cI never thought this day would come.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I was still trying to wrap my head around everything I\u2019d learned; my best friend had become a woman and was married to another of my friends.  Not only that, but she had two kids that were only a few years older than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was sitting in bed when Mac entered the room.  \u201cNow you understand why Mom and I couldn\u2019t tell you what happened to Eric.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been appropriate for anyone but Andrea to tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for pestering you guys about it so much.\u201d  Sitting up in bed, I said, \u201cI\u2019m still trying to get a grasp on all of it; growing up, I had no idea that she was trans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean to tell me that you had no idea?\u201d sitting in the chair next to the bed, Mac said, \u201cAndrea was your best friend; if anyone should\u2019ve noticed something it was you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back on my memories of spending time with Andrea.  The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I had noticed some inexplicable incidents when we were kids.  \u201cNow that you mention it, I did remember catching her wearing Grace\u2019s cheerleading outfit one time.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI did always find it weird that she always dressed as female characters for Halloween.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume that she told you about her crush?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we talked about that for a few minutes.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI\u2019m glad she ended up with Collin; after all, relationships at that age rarely last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe never forgot about you, Brian; you always had a special place in her heart.\u201d Tearing up a little, Mac said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if she told you this, but she named her son after you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was my turn to tear up; learning the impact I had on my best friend\u2019s life even after I disappeared.  \u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything about that, but she did say that I would meet them at the party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was suddenly a knock at the door, followed by mom poking her head inside.  \u201cThey\u2019re here, Mackenzie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, thanks, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Mac, I said, \u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this to seem like a revolving door of visitors, but there are some people I\u2019d like for you to meet.\u201d Mac stood up as a man appeared in the doorway with a boy and a girl.  Looking at me, Mac said, \u201cYou already met Allison; so it\u2019s only fair to meet the rest of my family.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I spent almost 30 minutes talking with the rest of Mac\u2019s family; her husband Duncan, her oldest daughter Megan and her son Marcus.  While Duncan and Megan were willing to talk with me, I could tell that Marcus was less than enthusiastic.  I guess I couldn\u2019t blame him since I was the same way at that age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan, as it turned out, is a history teacher at the High School; Megan did gymnastics on the weekend and Marcus was on the peewee football team.  After a while Megan and Marcus left the room, leaving me alone with Duncan and Mac.  Turning his attention to me, Duncan said, \u201cSo Brian, did your sister discuss your living arrangements after you get out of the hospital?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, but I figured it was only a matter of time before Mom told me.\u201d Shrugging, I said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be weird moving away from here, but I think I\u2019ll like it in Florida.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan and Mac exchanged curious glances with each other until Mac turned back to me.  \u201cBrian, sweetie, I think there\u2019s been a misunderstanding.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be staying here with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t at all what I had been expecting.  \u201cWhat?\u201d in shock, I said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m living with you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s your only option unless you want to go into foster care.\u201d Looking at me, Mac said, \u201cThe retirement village where Mom and Dad live won't allow anyone under the age of 55 to live there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was so much about that sentence I wanted to discuss; chief being that Mac had referred to Henry as Dad.  But I decided to focus on the fact that I was being forced to live with Mac and her family.  \u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019ll be allowed to let me live with you.\u201d Scoffing, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re my little sister for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, Brian; I\u2019m a 34-year-old woman and you\u2019re only 13 years old.\u201d Getting frustrated, Mac said, \u201cYou may not like it, but I\u2019m well within my legal rights to become your legal guardian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d live with Aaron before I lived with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac rolled her eyes out of sheer frustration \u201cGod, I forgot how stubborn you could be.  Listen to me, young man; Aaron doesn\u2019t even know who you are.  Do you think he\u2019d let a 13-year-old boy live with him?  For all you know, he\u2019s living in some bachelor apartment.\u201d Stepping closer to me, raising her voice, Mac said, \u201cYou may not want to hear this, but I know more about how these things work than you do.  Maybe, somewhere down the line, we can discuss this some more; but for time being you have to listen to what I say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recoiled slightly as Mac got closer to me; taken aback by the sudden change in her tone.  It brought back memories of when Mom would use the same tone with me as a kid.  I certainly didn\u2019t like it; but Mac was right, I had to accept that she was the adult and I was the kid.</span></div></div>",

Despite having aged almost 30 years since I last saw them, I knew immediately that Collin and Carrie had walked into the room.  Carrie looked pretty much the same except her hair was now a short buzz cut; Collin, on the other hand, looked as if he lost a considerable amount of weight since I last saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their credit, they had the same surprised looks on their faces that everyone else had.  Carrie was the first to do anything, as she came over and hugged me.  \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it when your sister said you were alive.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cBut how are you the same age you were when you disappeared?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll stop you right there, Carrie; I have no idea why I haven\u2019t aged at all.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cEveryone\u2019s been asking me that same question and I\u2019m, honestly, getting sick of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s understandable.\u201d Smiling, she said, \u201cRegardless, I\u2019m thrilled to have you back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too, buddy.\u201d Walking over, Collin shook my hand and said, \u201cI can\u2019t say I ever expected to see you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be back, man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the basics were taken care of, the three of us spent the next hour or so talking.

Brian, my namesake, was a spitting image of Collin; while I could a little bit of Emily in his daughter Grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel terrible that I wasn\u2019t there for Andrea during her transition, but I\u2019m glad you guys were there for her.\u201d Turning to Collin, I said, \u201cI was surprised to hear that you guys got married.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI initially had no interest in dating her; but then one day she walked into school looking incredible.\u201d  With a smile on his face, Collin said, <br>\r\n\u201cSuddenly I wanted nothing more than to be her boyfriend; and the rest, as they say, is history.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI imagine your folks needed time to adjust to something like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as much as you\u2019d think.\u201d Chuckling, Carrie said, \u201cI\u2019d come out by that point and was already dating; they figured that if they supported me, then they\u2019d have to support Collin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I missed so much your guy\u2019s lives.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a few hours since Carrie and Collin left, and I\u2019d been alone pretty much since they left. To be honest, I was starting to get a little stir crazy; I wanted to leave the hospital.  Considering my past experiences with hospitals, you can understand why I didn\u2019t like them very much; what with my injury and my dad\u2019s cancer diagnosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was flipping through the channels on TV; noting, with annoyance, that some of my favorite shows were now considered classics.  I had just started watching an episode of <i>Grey\u2019s Anatomy</i> when Mac walked to the room; phone in hand.  Seeing me, she said, \u201cHey Brian; I was thinking of calling Aaron, you want to talk to him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why not; sure beats watching TV.\u201d Sitting up, I said, \u201cBesides, he\u2019s my younger brother after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac let out a little chuckle after I said that; before catching herself and said, \u201cSorry, it\u2019s just that\u2019s funny; since technically you\u2019re <br>\r\nhis younger brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I was born before...you know what, let\u2019s not get into that right now.\u201d Moving over so Mac could sit down, I said, \u201cI must admit I\u2019m a little nervous; what if he doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re brothers; why wouldn\u2019t he like you.\u201d Dialing Aaron\u2019s number, Mac turned the screen towards me.  \u201cHe may be out with his <br>\r\ngirlfriend, so I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the dial screen was replaced with the face of a young man with brown hair.  \u201cHey sis, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got some time, I was thinking you\u2019d like to meet Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Becky and I are leaving for dinner shortly; but I suppose I could meet him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngling the phone towards me, Mac said, \u201cBrian, meet your brother Aaron; Aaron, meet your brother Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us just stared at each other for a few seconds; neither of us quite knowing what to say.  There was no way to tell over the phone, but I suspected that he was quite tall. He was pretty muscular and had brown hair; from what I could tell he looked like a younger version of Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was the first one of us to speak. \u201cSo you\u2019re my older brother, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you could say that; I mean you are physically older than me, even if I was born first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter in the long run; so long as we know we\u2019re brothers.\u201d Looking closer at the screen, Aaron said, \u201cI can see a little of Mom in you, but I\u2019m guessing you mostly took after your dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, there are pictures of my dad when he was my age; I looked almost identical to him.\u201d Getting a little emotional, talking about my dad, I decided to change the subject.  \u201cSo what was it like, growing up and hearing stories about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, Brian; it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d Sighing, Aaron said, \u201cBecause of what happened to you Mom and Dad were very protective of me; to the point where it got excessive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI caught sight of a naked girl, who I assumed was Aaron\u2019s girlfriend, scurry past in the background.  Turning my attention back to Aaron, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man, don\u2019t apologize; it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Chuckling, Aaron said, \u201cIf it makes you feel better, Mackenzie and Mom told me nothing but good stories about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an inquisitive eyebrow, I glanced at Mac as I said, \u201cOh really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah; they even showed me that photo of you wearing Mackenzie\u2019s ballet outfit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mackenzie was 6 years old, my parents had convinced her to try something girly; so she signed up for ballet.  She only lasted for a few months before quitting out of sheer boredom; but by that point we\u2019d gotten Dad\u2019s prognosis so the ballet school was sympathetic.  Blushing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll have you know, I only did that on a dare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got a chuckle out of Mac; while Aaron responded, \u201cIf you say so, man; you seemed to know the moves pretty well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to ignore that comment, I said, \u201cI have to remember to delete that video.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the girl from earlier, now wearing a rather elegant dress, came up next to Aaron.  \u201cAaron, honey, we\u2019ve got to go or we\u2019ll miss our reservation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Beck, I\u2019m just talking with my brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a confused look on Becky\u2019s face; but it quickly disappeared.  Looking at the screen, she said, \u201cSo you\u2019re Aaron\u2019s brother, the one who disappeared?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to say; Aaron was quite surprised when he heard you suddenly reappeared.\u201d Pausing, Becky said, \u201cAll this must be so strange for you; hell, I hadn\u2019t even been born yet when you disappeared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an adjustment; but I\u2019m getting through it with help from my mom and sister.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI won\u2019t keep you guys any longer; I hope you have a nice dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so, too.\u201d Chuckling, Becky said, \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s our 2nd anniversary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Aaron in the background putting on a suit jacket.  Turning back towards the camera, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the party this weekend, Brian.  I can\u2019t wait to meet you in person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging up the call, I returned the phone to Mac and said, \u201cHe seems like a nice guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great guy; I think you two will get along great.\u201d Leaning closer, in a whisper, Mac said, \u201cJust between you and me; Aaron said he\u2019s going to propose to Becky tonight.  If all goes well, you\u2019ll get a brother and a sister-in-law.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaron mentioned the party this weekend.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cAm I going to be out of the hospital by then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI forgot to mention; unless something changes, the doctors say you\u2019ll be free to go tomorrow.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I had ended up almost 30 years in the future and, aside from seeing changes at the hospital, I hadn\u2019t really seen anything futuristic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for Mac and Duncan, the only other people there to see me off were Mom, Henry, and Emily.  It was incredibly cheesy, but Mac couldn\u2019t resist recording me leave the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to Emily, who had to go back to work, I followed Mac and Duncan through the parking lot to their car.  The first time I saw it, all I could picture were the cars from that Will Smith movie <i>I, Robot</i>.  The car looked almost identical to the ones in the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI climbed into the back seat while Mac and Duncan got in the front.  Given how far in the future we were, I suppose I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when all Duncan had to do was press a button and say \u201cHome.\u201d  The car immediately started driving on its own, while Mac and Duncan\u2019s chairs spun around to face me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a small table came up out of the floor, Mac looked at me and said, \u201cDuncan and I discussed it with Brian this morning; he\u2019s not too thrilled about it, but you two will be roommates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took until last night for Mac to tell me that her family was living in the house I grew up in.  While I was excited to see what it looked like after close to 30 years, I was a little surprised to hear that Mac and Duncan hadn\u2019t made many changes to it.  Sleeping space was still at a premium; so while the girls shared a room, Brian had a room to himself.  At least he did until I came along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy first introduction to my nephew hadn\u2019t been the best; in fact, I was pretty sure he disliked me for some reason.  I could only hope that sharing a room would fix that.  Looking at Mac, I said, \u201cNot that it matters; but is it my old room or your old room?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry; it\u2019s your old room.\u201d pausing, Mac said, \u201cJust so there are no surprises we did make some changes, like repaint the walls, but it\u2019s still largely the same as it was 27 years ago.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sure there were some cosmetic changes; the outside was a different color and there was no a roof over the front porch, but other than that was still the house I grew up in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the car pulled into the driveway, I saw Allison, Megan, and Marcus standing outside; each of them holding onto a large sign that said \u2013 Welcome Home Brian!!  A thought came to mind as I saw that sign; so, turning to Mac, I said, \u201cPerhaps you guys should explain to me how I\u2019m going to get my life back.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve been legally dead for 27 years; so I assume that\u2019s no easy task.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got an appointment at the courthouse tomorrow morning; to get all that settled.\u201d Sighing, as she got out of the car, Mac said, \u201cOnce you\u2019re legally alive again, I\u2019ll file the paperwork to become your legal guardian, and then we\u2019ll look into getting you back into school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know what disturbed me more; the fact that my sister was going to be my legal guardian or the idea that I\u2019d be going to school with people whose parents were in 2nd grade 27 years ago.

It was pretty much as I\u2019d expected; after all, Mac had said they didn\u2019t change much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn\u2019t mean nothing had changed; the carpeting in the house was already pretty old when I disappeared, so I wasn\u2019t surprised to find that had been replaced at some point.  The kitchen was where the most changes had occurred; there was a kitchen island with a stove built into it, and there was now a large bay window overlooking the backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was staring out the window, happy to see that my old treehouse was still there when I heard footsteps behind me.  Turning around, I saw Megan walking into the kitchen.

But I could still tell that it was a teenage boy\u2019s bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI honestly wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I learned that Marcus had some Playboys hidden in the air vent under the bed.

She was forcing us into a situation neither Marcus nor myself wanted to be in.  \u201cI agree with Marcus, Mac; I think you should\u2019ve given us the courtesy of talking this over.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cAfter all, I changed your diapers; this is the least you could do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac stared at the two of us; trying to figure out her response.  \u201cLet\u2019s forget for a moment that I\u2019m an adult and you\u2019re both children.  Where exactly would I find the space for both of you to have a private room?\u201d seeing the looks on our faces, Mac said, \u201cThat\u2019s right; I considered the possibility for a brief time.  But then I realized that not only would it not be fair to Megan and Allison; but it might force you two to grow up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus started stammering, as I looked at Mac.  \u201cThat\u2019s funny, coming from you; after all, I seem to recall you have a hissy fit at the mall because Mom wouldn\u2019t let you buy a doll you wanted.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cSo the next time you tell us that we need to grow up; why don\u2019t you look in the mirror.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately regretted what I said; because the look on Mac\u2019s face was all I needed to know that I\u2019d hurt her.  Before I could say anything to apologize, she turned and walked out of the room.  I went to follow after her; but Marcus grabbed my arm and, with a surprisingly tender tone, said, \u201cI\u2019d give her a little while, Brian.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I figured he was just mad that Mac had made him sleep in a sleeping bag so that I could use the bed.  Having a pair of eyes staring at me, especially when they belonged to someone who didn\u2019t like me very much made it difficult to fall asleep.  It seemed like forever before I could finally fall asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to suddenly be shaken awake; I was certain that Marcus had decided to kill me in my sleep.  \u201cGet off me!\u201d  I only calmed down once I saw that it was Mac.  Sitting up, I looked at her and said, \u201cGeez Mac; you know I don\u2019t like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d with a chuckle, Mac looked at me and said, \u201cYou looked pretty worried for a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing; I just\u2026thought Marcus was trying to kill me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that; nobody\u2019s going to hurt you, sweetie.\u201d Running her hand through my bed-head, she said, \u201cI just wanted to make sure you were awake; this isn\u2019t something we want to be late for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly remembered the appointment at the courthouse; the one where I\u2019d be declared legally alive once more and, well...my younger sister would become my legal guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly took a shower and got dressed; making my way downstairs to the kitchen where I found everyone else was already at the kitchen table.  I look a seat as Mac placed a plate of pancakes in front of me.  \u201cI made them just like the way you liked them.\u201d<br>\r\nA cursory look down showed that was the case; chocolate chip pancakes smothered in whipped cream, maple syrup, and a side of bacon and eggs.  Once everyone had eaten, we all got into the car; Marcus and I sat in the middle row while Megan and Allison sat in the back,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was still acting as though he wanted nothing to do with me; so I paid him no attention either.  Instead, I found myself thinking about the fact that my little sister was about to become my legal guardian.  Would that mean I had to call her mom now?  Would that make Mom my grandma as well? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything about the last few days was just confusing and difficult to process; especially the fact that Mac was now old enough to be my mother.  Hell, even her best friend Emily had a daughter who was my age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's daughter. Callie. She seemed pretty cool and cute\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, I started thinking about Callie; I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d become lost in thought until I realized we\u2019d arrived.  Unbuckling my seat, I was about to get out of the car when I noticed that I had an erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could do something to hide it, Marcus blurted out, \u201cWhoa; something got you excited.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMARCUS! WATCH YOUR MOUTH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Duncan pulled Marcus aside to lecture him, Mac came over to check on me.  <i>God, she was already treating me like a kid.</i>  Looking at me, she said, \u201cWe'll wait a bit for it to go down\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs if this whole situation wasn\u2019t embarrassing enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you thinking about Callie?\u201d I felt myself start to blush as my erection stiffened again.  Mac could only chuckle at my response.  \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what; once we get all this legal stuff taken care of, I\u2019ll call Emily to see if Callie would like to hang out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to make a fuss about Mac teasing me, but the idea of hanging out with Callie sounded nice.  \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was finally calm again, Mac and I rejoined the others at the bottom of the stairs.  As much as I didn't want the government thinking I was dead, I was still anxious about Mac, my sister, becoming my legal guardian.</span></div></div>",

That didn\u2019t keep me from being surprised, however, when I recognized the judge that we were meeting with.  She was older, with a small number of wrinkles and slightly greying of her hair, but I recognized her instantly.  \u201cJessica!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n27 years earlier Jessica Rogers had been this reserved 17-year-old girl who lived across the street from us.

I suddenly lost consciousness before waking up in the hospital; later finding out that 27 years had passed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking everything in, Judge Thomas turned her attention to Mac and said, \u201cI hesitate to bring this up, but what are the chances this is some kind of trick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZero; the Hospital confirmed that he is Brian Hawkins, albeit with one minor difference.\u201d  Seeing the look on Judge Thomas\u2019 face, <br>\r\nMac said, \u201cThe injury he sustained during the zip line accident isn\u2019t there anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking over the documents that proved my identity, Judge Thomas turned back to us and said, \u201cI suppose the big question now would be \u2013 where was he for 27 years and why hasn\u2019t he aged?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know, Your Honor; and to be quite honest, I\u2019m not interested in searching for answers.\u201d Placing a hand on my shoulder, Mac said, \u201cIf something were to fall in our lap so be it; but, as far as my family is concerned, Brian is back and that\u2019s all any of could ask for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I can\u2019t blame you for that; after all, why look a gift horse in the mouth.\u201d Looking at Mac, Judge Thomas said, \u201cApart from declaring him legally living again, what else can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not thrilled about the idea, but I\u2019d also like to petition the court to become his legal guardian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll understand that I can\u2019t just grant you legal guardianship, even if he is your brother.\u201d  As she signed some papers, Judge Thomas said, \u201cI\u2019ll contact Social Services and have them send over a caseworker who will check things out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac and I looked at each other, worried; I don\u2019t know about her, but I was wondering how the caseworker would feel about Marcus\u2019 feelings towards me.  Turning back to Judge Thomas, Mac said, \u201cThank you, Your Honor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thanking Judge Thomas, who pulled me in for a hug this time, Mac and I left with the paperwork declaring me legally alive once more.  Allison and Megan both congratulated me, while Marcus gave me a forced smile and begrudgingly congratulated me as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that everything was taken care of, we were on our way to ride the Go-Karts.</span></div></div>",

As we walked inside, I was in awe of how expansive it was; not only was there the Go-Kart track and trampolines but a large area filled with video games.  \u201cWow, this is amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing my arm, Callie pulled me over to the Go-Kart counter, \u201cYou ready to get your butt kicked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d always been pretty competitive so when Callie said that, I said, \u201cHey, I'm never ready to lose.\u201d As we signed the waivers, I said, \u201cJust so that you know, I was unstoppable back in the day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to me, her hands on her hips in a confident pose, Callie chuckled and said, \u201cBring it on, old man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m sure people nearby thought otherwise, but Callie and I were just interested in having a friendly competition.  After that, Callie and I made our way to the track where we saw four other kids waiting to ride.  The go-karts were a bit more advanced than what I was used to, but I quickly got the hang of it as I passed three of them in rapid succession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe go-karts allowed me to forget all about everything that happened, even if only for a little while \u2013 I was having fun again.  Before I could take the lead however, Callie came zooming past; no one had ever been able to pass me, but it looked like I now had a rival.  What transpired was a constant back and forth where we jockeyed for the lead.  Eventually the session came to an end with Callie having beaten me by less than two seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting out of my kart, I walked over and helped Callie from hers.  \u201cNo one\u2019s ever outpaced me before, you\u2019ve got some mad skill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI spend a lot of time here; but I have to admit you were really good out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we left the track, I found myself looking at Callie \u2013 she seemed so cool and confident...and cute.  I had to mentally slap myself to keep from daydreaming again; the last thing I wanted was a repeat of what happened in the car.  \u201cAnything else you feel like doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing to the trampolines nearby, Callie said, \u201cYou feel like bouncing around for a little while?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie and I ran across the room to the trampolines, thankfully the line to get in wasn\u2019t too long.  It wasn\u2019t long before we were inside and jumping around.  As I began bouncing, I was relieved to see that trampolines hadn\u2019t changed all that much since my time.  Up and down I went, minding my own business as I went up and down in the air. Until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was suddenly bumped from behind; I almost lost my footing as Callie said, \u201cOops, my bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining my footing, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went back to jumping around, only to find myself bumping into Callie a few minutes later.  \"Oops\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle, Callie said, \u201cHey, at least we\u2019re even now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before she bumped into me again.  Every now and then I\u2019d glance over at Callie, seeing how happy she looked.  I almost started daydreaming again when\u2026Callie and I bumped into each other once more and we both fell to the ground.  Sitting up, I looked at Callie as she sat up next to me.  \u201cSorry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us looked at each other for a moment until we just started giggling.  \u201cIt\u2019s all cool, dude.\u201d Getting back to her face, Callie said, \u201cWe\u2019re all clumsy on trampolines.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got back to my feet, I noticed Marcus watching us from the sidelines \u2013 the look he was giving me was unsettling.  While he hadn\u2019t been nice to me since my return, there was something different about the look he was giving me \u2013 it was almost threatening.  I quickly shelved those thoughts; as I didn\u2019t want Marcus ruining my fun with Callie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually our session came to an end; as we were putting our shoes on, I said, \u201cHow are you at Street Fighter?\u201d<br>\r\nI honestly had no clue whether Street Fighter was still popular after 27 years; but I was relieved when Callie said, \u201cYou wanna find out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was kind of surprised to find that in the 27 years since I\u2019d vanished, they\u2019d only gotten up to Street Fighter 7.  But what surprised me even more was how the button layout had changed; there was more of them now.  It would be an understand to say that I was clumsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Callie beat me twice in a row, I said, \u201cI give up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, we\u2019re having fun.\u201d Smiling, Callie said, \u201cMy mom said the older games had a different layout, I can help you if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI happily accepted Callie\u2019s offer to help, but my attention was soon drawn to Marcus once again.  He was standing nearby, giving me the same evil look as before. \"Did you understand all that?\" Callie's voice brings me back to the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn\u2019t been paying attention, but I didn\u2019t want her to know that.  \"Yes, I think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go easy on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Callie took the seat next to me, I noticed Marcus squinting his eyes \u2013 he looked even meaner than before, and angrier.  It suddenly dawned on me just what Marcus could mad about right now.  <i>Does Marcus have a crush on Callie?</i></span></div></div>",

I couldn\u2019t help but notice the looks we were getting from Mac and Emily, as if they knew something was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I took a bite of my cheeseburger, Callie looked at me and said, \u201cNow that you\u2019re back from the dead, are you going to be start school again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how I have any choice; I\u2019m only 13 years old.\u201d Putting my sandwich down, I said, \u201cBesides, I\u2019m pretty sure Mac would make me go to school anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll certainly have an interesting first couple days; after all, you\u2019d be the oldest student in the school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought hadn\u2019t occurred to me until just then.  \u201cI didn\u2019t think of it like that, but I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d  Looking at her, I said, \u201cNone of the students were even born before I disappeared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, but we all grew up hearing about your disappearance.\u201d Leaning closer, Callie said, \u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, you\u2019re a bit of a legend around the school yard; a story that older students tell to scare the younger kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t particularly thrilled to hear that; looking at her, I said, \u201cWhat kind of stories do they tell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re all basically the same thing; some evil demon found you in the woods and took you away.\u201d Seeing the color drain from my face, Callie said, \u201cBut I knew better than to believe those crazy stories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to deal with that for a while, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, you know how teenagers can be; give it a week and you\u2019ll be old news.\u201d Smiling at me, Callie said, \u201cThen again you are pretty cute, so who knows; you might be popular for all sorts of reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us realized what Callie had said at the same time; leading both of us to blush as I said, \u201cY-You think I\u2019m cute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Callie struggled to think of what to say, I noticed Marcus nearby with a pained look on his face.  I ignored that for the time being as Callie finally said, \u201cIf I\u2019m being on honest, I\u2019ve been thinking about you pretty much nonstop since the hospital.\u201d Leaning closer, Callie said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you because I figured you didn\u2019t feel that way about me; after all, you did grow up with my mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d trying to keep my voice down, I leaned over and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about you as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should probably get to know each other a little better, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Callie tried to hold her excitement as she said, \u201cWho knows, maybe we\u2019ll have some classes together at school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything, I felt someone slam into me from behind; causing my drink to spill over when I bumped the table.  As I watched the soda spill all over Callie, I noticed Marcus rushing past me with the same angry look.  I knew instantly that he was the one that bumped into me - <i>I hate that kid</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie\u2019s shirt was covered in soda at this point, her face a mix of embarrassment and anger.  I tried my best to help her dry off, but I was careful not to go near her chest.  Emily and Mac had rushed over by that point, with Emily saying, \u201cCome on honey, I\u2019ll help you with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Callie and Emily made their way to the bathroom, I turned to find Mac looking at me.  \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Seeing Marcus walk out of the bathroom area, glaring at me, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know Mac, why don\u2019t you talk to your son.\u201d Pointing to him, I said, \u201cHe\u2019s the one who bumped me and caused my soda to spill all over Callie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you do or say anything that might\u2019ve set him off?\u201d looking at me, Mac said, \u201cI know my son, Brian; he wouldn\u2019t lash out in public without a reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the foggiest idea what could\u2019ve set him off, Mac.\u201d Sighing, as I wiped some soda off my leg, I said, \u201cOne moment Callie and I were both saying we thought the other was cute; the next minute she\u2019s covered in soda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I know what may have set him off.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Mac said, \u201cDo you remember, growing up, how you had a big crush on our babysitter Kelly, and how upset you got when you found out she had a boyfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly Roberts was a girl that lived down the street from us; from the time I was 9 years old to 12 years old, she would babysit for Mac and me.  I had the biggest crush on her, like Mac said, and was disappointed to find out that she had a boyfriend already.  In hindsight it wouldn\u2019t have worked out anyway, since she was 6 years older than me at the time, but it still hurt.  \u201cWhat does that have to do with Marcus hating me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t see it, do you?\u201d looking at me, Mac said, \u201cMarcus has had a crush on Callie for the last year or so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything started to make more sense.  \u201cOh boy, I see where you\u2019re going with this.\u201d seeing Marcus come out of the bathroom nearby, I said, \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m trying to steal Callie from him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far; after all, he\u2019s only 12 years old.\u201d Sighing, Mac said, \u201cIf you truly care for Callie, and I suspect that you do, you shouldn\u2019t let Marcus get in the way of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try my best, but he\u2019s not going to make that easy.\u201d Looking at Mac, I said, \u201cYour son hates me, Mac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcus doesn\u2019t hate you; he barely knows you.\u201d Looking at me, Mac said, \u201cHe just has issues with meeting new people; but he\u2019s not a bad kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Callie walk out of the bathroom at that moment, looking rather annoyed.  I decided it was best to go and apologize for what happened.  Walking up to her, I said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Callie, I must\u2019ve lost my grip on the cup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the truth, but I didn\u2019t want to tell her about Marcus.  \u201cYou got soda all over my favorite top, Brian.\u201d Callie looked at me for a moment, until her annoyed expression started to soften.  Taking a deep breath, she said, \u201cBut it was an accident, so I forgive you; besides, you tried to help as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t want Callie to hate me, after all she was the first friend I\u2019d made since coming back.  I was relieved when she forgave me, though.  \u201cSo we\u2019re cool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re cool.\u201d Looking at me, blushing ever so slightly, Callie said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what; how about you come over to my house tomorrow and we can go for a swim in the pool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of going swimming was appealing, if only because of the possibility of seeing Callie in a bikini.  Trying to hold my excitement, I said, \u201cSure, I\u2019d love to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</span></div></div>",

In the meantime, I scoured the internet for any advice on what to do when \u2018a cute girl invites you her to place.\u2019  Let\u2019s just say the results were less than helpful; eventually I got tired of searching and just stared up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before my thoughts turned to Callie, as I quickly started to imagine her wearing a bikini.  I quickly quashed those thoughts; having no intention of messing things up with her.  Callie was my first real friend in this era and, assuming I didn\u2019t mess anything up, she could end up being my first girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy train of thought was interrupted by a knock at the door; turning towards it, I said, \u201cCome in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Megan walked inside, a smile on her face.  \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much; just bored.\u201d looking at her as she got closer, I said, \u201cDid you need something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to me on the bed, Megan stared at me with a look that reminded me of when Mac was a kid.  \u201cI\u2019ve only heard stories about you from Mom; I figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to get to know the real you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that wouldn\u2019t hurt; after all, we\u2019re family.\u201d Sitting up, I looked at her and said, \u201cMac said you did gymnastics, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we have practice tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but notice the frown on her face, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s just...\u201d looking at me, Megan said, \u201cI enjoy gymnastics but I\u2019m not as good as the other girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing to be upset about, Megan; there\u2019s always going to be people better than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but the other girls make fun of me; saying that I'm the worst they've ever seen.\" sighing, Megan said, \"I don't want to tell Mom, because then she might pull me out of gymnastics\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to see where this was going.  Mac used to be bullied a lot as a kid; the only difference being that she was bullied by boys.  I didn\u2019t want to get involved, but then I realized this was my new family; which essentially made me Megan\u2019s older brother.

Jumping off the bed myself, I decided to go downstairs and check out what types of video games Marcus had.  That was where I found Allison playing with some dolls in the living room.  Looking up at me, she said, \u201cDo you wanna play?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't want to play with dolls, I\u2019d came downstairs to play some video games while Marcus was gone.  \u201cUh, actually I was...\" I didn't want to play dolls, I was hoping to play one of Marcus's video games while he was away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison suddenly put on the saddest little face ever; complete with puppy dog eyes.  <i>She's her mother's daughter.</i>  Mac used to do the same thing when she was little, doing everything she could to make it seem like she was going to start crying.  I didn\u2019t want to upset Allison, so I hesitantly sat down and said, \u201cI suppose I can for a little while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison\u2019s face immediately lit up as she handed me one of the dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison and I played for a little while, until I decided to stop and check out Marcus\u2019 games.  \u201cOkay.\u201d Getting up, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to play a game now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt Allison grab my shorts from behind me, as she whined, \u201cBut Peppa Pig will be on soon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy first thought was how that show could still be on after almost 30 years.  My second thought was that I wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with a whiny brat.  \u201cBut I need the TV.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison once again put on her sad face, saying, \u201cWatch it with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't want to upset her, so I gave in and turned the TV to the proper channel so Allison could watch her show.  The show was so boring that I almost fell asleep a few times; in stark contrast to the attention Allison was paying the show.  Once it was finally over, I got up to use the bathroom; only for Allison to run up and hug me.  \u201cThanks for spending time with me, brudder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again it felt strange having my little sister\u2019s girls calling me their brother; although I was beginning to suspect that they were using me to compensate for Marcus\u2019 lack of attention.  It did, however, feel nice to be part of a family again.  Hugging her back, I said, \u201cNo problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter coming out of the bathroom, I turned my attention to Marcus\u2019 videogames.  I quickly realized there were no cases as I focused on the oddly shaped console \u2013 looking like a basketball.  \"What the hell?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom wouldn't like you saying that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, I turned around and saw Megan walking in from the landing.  \u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcus likes all his games in digital form; he says physical copies take up space.\u201d Pressing a button the top, she said, \u201cBy the way, that\u2019s how you turn on the Sony PlaySphere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Megan walked up the stairs, I thought about the name of the new console \u2013 Sony must\u2019ve done away with the Playstation at some point.  While scrolling through the library interface, I noticed several surprising things.  Instead of the usual preteen stuff like Call of Duty or Fortnite, I saw that Marcus had mostly platformers and some weird Japanese games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but chuckle when I saw Final Fantasy XXX listed on the screen.  \u201cThey seriously still make those?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also some more obscure titles - <i>Aura Break, AlienSword Tales</i>, etc. I realized something about Marcus as I looked through his games.  \u201cHe must be a closeted nerd; that might explain his antisocial behavior.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I made a mental note to ask Marcus about them, until I realized he\u2019d probably kill me for touching his stuff.  <i>Oh well</i>, thinking to myself, <i>I\u2019ll just talk to Callie about it tomorrow.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the family room, I was about to go upstairs until dinner when I heard a noise coming from down the hall.  Curious what the noise was, I followed it to what used to be my dad\u2019s office.  Poking my head inside, I saw Duncan sitting behind the desk talking with someone on the phone.  \u201cYeah, I can take a look at that once I\u2019m back in the office.\u201d Glancing at me, still on the phone, he said, \u201cI\u2019m dealing with some family stuff right now, so I\u2019m afraid that takes priority.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking further into the room, I sat down on the couch by the window as Duncan finished his call.  Once he was finished, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cSounds like you\u2019ve got a lot of work waiting for you, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more than usual.\u201d Getting up to join me on the couch, Duncan said, \u201cHow are you coping with everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty good, I guess; despite the fact that Marcus looks like he wants to kill me.\u201d Looking at Duncan, I said, \u201cI know he\u2019s my nephew and everything; but his attitude makes it <i>really</i> hard to be around him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan looked at me for a moment, as if he were trying to figure out what to say next.  After a moment, he said, \u201cI suppose it <br>\r\ndoesn\u2019t help that he thinks you\u2019re stealing his girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to snap at Duncan for saying that, until I realized he was only joking.  \u201cHey; if I\u2019d known Marcus liked Callie, I would\u2019ve done things differently.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cAs it is, I\u2019m not sure she feels the same about me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m pretty sure she does, Brian.\u201d With a smile, Duncan said, \u201cI saw the way she was looking at you on the trampolines; it seems pretty obvious that she has feelings for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m thrilled about that; but it seems a bit strange.\u201d sighing, I said, \u201cWe\u2019ve only known each other a few days; add to that the fact that I grew up with her mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe heart wants what the heart wants, Brian.\u201d Taking a breath, Duncan said, \u201cCallie, just like your nieces and nephew, grew up hearing stories about you.  I think she fell in love with the <i>idea</i> of you a long time ago; now she\u2019s got a chance to be with the real deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking that to heart, I said, \u201cI\u2019m supposed to hang out at her house tomorrow; what should I do if she, you know, tries to kiss me or <br>\r\nsomething?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a teenage boy, Brian; that\u2019s not something you need me to answer.\u201d Placing a hand on my shoulder, Duncan said, \u201cJust go with the flow, do what feels right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Duncan.\u201d Getting to my feet, I said, \u201cI really appreciate the advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big smile on his face, Duncan said, \u201cHey, what are brother in laws for.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Megan, Duncan, and Mac all knew the reason; while Allison was more than a little confused why I was acting that way.  The only response anyone, including me, would give her was \u2013 You\u2019ll understand when you\u2019re older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the time came for us to leave, I was standing in front of the door holding a towel and a bag with a change of clothes.  I saw Mac taking her sweet time walking down the hall, so I said, \u201cCome on Mac, can you walk <i>any</i> slower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Intentionally slowing down some more, Mac said, \u201cDoes this help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny, Mac; now seriously, can you walk faster?\u201d Seeing the amused look on Mac\u2019s face, I curtly said, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing, I just haven\u2019t seen you this excited to go to someone\u2019s house since Andrea\u2019s attractive cousin was spending the weekend.\u201d Looking to me, as she opened the door, she said, \u201cYou really have a thing for the woman in that family, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chose not to comment on that, but deep down I suspected Mac was right; it did seem as though every crush I\u2019d ever had was on members of Callie\u2019s family.  Once we got to Callie\u2019s house, I jumped out of the car before it came to a complete stop.  <i>God, I hope Callie isn\u2019t watching right now.</i>  Emily was waiting the door, dressed in her scrubs, with a dejected look on her face.  I got worried for a moment, especially as she turned to Mac and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been called in for emergency surgery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Looking towards me, Mac said, \u201cDoes that mean Brian can\u2019t hang out with Callie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got a problem with them being here alone; it\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to do anything inappropriate.\u201d Turning to me, Emily said, \u201cCallie\u2019s out back by the pool; why don\u2019t you head out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Emily.\u201d As an afterthought, I turned to Mac and said, \u201cSee you later, Mac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning through the house, I caught a glimpse of the backyard and knew I was going in the right direction.  Stepping out onto the patio, I only managed to take a few steps before stopping in my tracks.  Callie was looking at me with a smile on her face; wearing a bathing suit that made her look like the most beautiful woman I\u2019d ever seen in my life. </span></div></div>",

I could feel something stirring in my pants, I just hoped Callie didn\u2019t notice it.  After a moment, she walked over and said, \u201cSo what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment I wasn\u2019t sure what exactly she was referring to, so I tried my best.  \u201cI\u2019m a little jealous; I always wanted a pool in my backyard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle, Callie said, \u201cI\u2019m not talking about the pool, dummy.\u201d Smiling, gesturing to her appearance, Callie said, \u201cHow do I look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right.\u201d Realizing my mistake caused me to blush even more than I already was.  \u201cY-You look good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood?\u201d with a frown, Callie said, \u201cI\u2019m the first girl you\u2019ve seen in a bikini in close to 30 years, and all you can say is good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I was being honest, I didn\u2019t have much experience seeing girls in bikinis prior to my disappearance.  My only close female friend was Carrie, and she typically wore a men\u2019s suit and t-shirt in the water.  I suppose, in hindsight, that should\u2019ve been my first clue that she was a lesbian.  \u201cYou look great, Callie; it\u2019s just...I wasn\u2019t expecting you to look like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, just because I act all macho doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have a feminine side.\u201d Walking over with a glass of lemonade, Callie said, \u201cI\u2019m still a girl, Brian; I can show off my figure when I feel like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to worry that Callie was going to focus on my perceived slight the entire time.  \u201cGive me a break, Callie; like you said, I haven\u2019t been around girl\u2019s for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie just stared at me for a moment, her face all serious, until she smiled and said, \u201cRelax, I\u2019m just messing with you.\u201d Leading me towards the pool, she said, \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t really like wearing bikinis; I just thought today would be an appropriate time to do so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us spent the better part of the next two hours both in and out of the pool; we played Marco Polo, had a cannon ball contest, we even just sat in the chairs and talked.  Eventually the topic of Marcus came up, to which Callie said, \u201cI kind of figured he would lash out if he saw us hanging out together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat kid scares me to death; I have trouble sleeping at night because I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to kill me or something.\u201d Looking at Callie, I said, \u201cI\u2019m terrified of what he might do when we start dating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was unfortunate enough to have Callie staring right at me as she spit out her lemonade all over my face.  While I went to wipe off the lemonade, Callie just stared at me.  \u201cWhat do you mean <i>when</i> we start dating?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Seeing her looking amazing in her bikini wasn\u2019t helping, as I felt something growing in my swim trunks.  I was suddenly reminded of what Duncan had told me the previous night \u2013 \u201cThe heart wants what the heart wants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, without thinking, I leaned over and pressed my lips against Callie\u2019s.  I started panicking as I could feel her body tensing up, <i>Idiot, the first girl to ever show interest in you, and you just blew it!</i>  I was about to pull away and apologize when, out of nowhere, Callie gradually started returning my kiss \u2013 her lips pressing against mine as she maneuvered herself next to me on my chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to slow down for us as we kissed; but, frankly, I didn\u2019t really care.  All I could think about was sharing this incredible moment with the girl I loved.  Unfortunately for both of us, that meant neither of us realized someone else had entered the backyard.  \u201cCallie, do you know...WHO THE HELL ARE YOU!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie and I immediately broke our kiss; turning to find an angry man standing at the back door holding a small tool bag in one hand.  Seeing the look on the man\u2019s face, I slowly started to get up, which only served to enrage him even more.  The man had dropped his bag and was moving towards me before I\u2019d even cleared the chairs.  I thought he was going to kill me, until <br>\r\nCallie stepped between and said, \u201cDad, wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?\u201d looking at Callie, I said, \u201cI thought Emily wasn\u2019t married?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring my comment for a moment, Callie looked at the man and said, \u201cDad; this is Brian, Mom\u2019s friend from childhood.  I know she told you he was back, I was in the kitchen when she did so.\u201d Turning her attention back to me, Callie said, \u201cBrian; this is my dad, Cameron.  He and Mom, well, they were married shortly before I was born but divorced when I was 3 years old.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came over to fix your mother\u2019s sink.  But,\u201d turning to me, Cameron said, \u201cI would\u2019ve appreciated a heads up about there being a boy alone with my daughter. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew I was in hot water with Cameron; if I said or did anything wrong, it\u2019d probably make him want to kill me.

I could only hear bits and pieces, but I had my suspicions about what they were talking about.  Eventually Emily left and Mac joined me in the family room, \u201cSo, I heard you\u2019re dating my god-daughter now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re dating yet, Mac.\u201d Muting the TV, I sat back and said, \u201cAll we\u2019ve done so far is make out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is true; but that\u2019s still a big step, especially for you.\u201d Looking at me with a smile on her face, Mac said, \u201cI remember how weirded out you were after kissing Carrie; and for you that was less than a year ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac was right; I was weirded out after kissing Carrie.  Not because I\u2019d just kissed a girl, but because of who I\u2019d kissed.  Carrie had been one of my closest friends for years; to me she\u2019d been one of the guys.  \u201cThat whole thing with Carrie felt forced, neither of us really wanted to do it.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cBut with Callie it was different; we both wanted it to happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy for you, Brian; with everything going on you deserve some happiness.  But,\u201d turning serious, Mac said, \u201cThere\u2019s one thing I suspect you haven\u2019t thought of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take a genius to realize what Mac was referring to \u2013 Marcus.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cDo I have to tell him?  He\u2019s just going to hate me even more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to just get it over with, Brian; instead of him finding out some other way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking note of the diplomatic tone Mac was using, I chuckled and said, \u201cYou know, you\u2019ve really got this mom thing down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re raising 3 children.\u201d Getting up from the couch, Mac said, \u201cNo come on, Marcus is upstairs in your room; why don\u2019t you go talk to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to resist but sensed there was no getting out of this.  With a heavy sigh, I walked up the stairs to our bedroom.  Walking inside, I found Marcus watching a movie on the TV.  \u201cHey Marcus, can we talk for a moment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuting the TV, in a surprisingly calm tone, Marcus looked at me and said, \u201cSure, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no easy way to say this; especially given your feelings on the matter.\u201d  Sitting next to him, I said, \u201cCallie and I...are kind of a couple now.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I quickly moved to block another punch, which led to me falling off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was too stunned to do anything as Marcus hit me repeatedly.  A few seconds went by before the noise attracted some attention; out of the corner of my eye I could see Megan running into the room.  \u201cMarcus, stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Marcus shoved Megan to the side, causing her to slam her head on the floor.

Handing it to me, she said, \u201cHere, this\u2019ll help control the bleeding until we get to the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hospital?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Brian, the hospital.\u201d Helping me to my feet, Mac said, \u201cYour nose is broken; and I think you\u2019d be better off having a professional set it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reluctantly realized that Mac was right and followed her down the stairs.  We barely made it to the front door before Megan came running down the stairs, \u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac looked as though she was going to protest, but decided against it, \u201cOkay sweetie, you can come along.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Looking around the room, I said to myself, How'd I get here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning over to see if there was anyone around, I suddenly realized that everything seemed off \u2013 as if everything around me, the bed included, was bigger than it should have been.  \u201cWhat's going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice that came out of my mouth gave me pause; it didn\u2019t sound like mine but still surrounded familiar.  \u201cWhat's wrong with my voice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter once again hearing the high-pitched, and squeaky, voice coming from my mouth I instinctively covered my mouth with my hands.  Only then did I realize that my hands looked funny too - my fingers seemed tiny.  Suddenly a young woman, wearing nurses scrubs, walked into the room.  \u201cIs everything okay, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found that I had to look up at the woman; despite appearing to be in her 20s, she seemed much taller than I expected.  Looking at her, with my funny voice, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be scared of, sweetie.\u201d Kneeling in front of me, the nurse said, \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find your Mommy and Daddy soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was started to get annoyed with how the nurse was speaking to me \u2013 like I was a child or something.  \u201cI\u2019m not a baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, sweetie.\u201d Chuckling, the nurse said, \u201cYou're a big boy after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was definitely wrong; what with everything appearing bigger, my voice sounding different, and the way the nurse was speaking to me.  Before I could ask what was going on, she looked at me and said, \u201cHow old are you, sweetheart?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"13.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re using those big boy numbers, I see.\u201d Giggling, the nurse said, \u201cBut we really need to know your age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus, I\u2019m 13 years old!\u201d starting to get worried, I said, \u201cWhy, how old do I look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking confused, the nurse said, \u201cIf I had to venture a guess, I\u2019d said no older than 6 years old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went silent as the nurse handed me a mirror.  Taking it in my hands, I looked at it and couldn\u2019t see my reflection in it at all.  Well I did, but not the one I normally saw.  Instead of my 13 year old self, I saw a little kid staring back at me.  Somehow I\u2019d turned into a little kid.  \u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy screams kept me from finishing that sentence; the nurse tried unsuccessfully to calm me down.  I was inconsolable as I started crying.  The nurse, sitting in bed next to me, said, \u201cIt\u2019s ok sweetie, we'll figure this out\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManaging to calm down ever so slightly, I said, \u201cI want my Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, sweetie; do you have a number for us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse left a few minutes later to call the number I\u2019d given her.  Once I was alone again, I picked up the mirror and stared at my reflection. I was confused as to what had happened to me.  It suddenly dawned on me that I was now the same age as Mac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, the nurse walked into the room and said, \u201cSweetie, there\u2019s someone here to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at the nurse as someone else enters the room.

As I looked at her, I thought there was something familiar about her.  Growing concerned, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping at my bedside, the girl ran her hand through my hair, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be afraid, we\u2019ll help you find your parents.\u201d <br>\r\nLooking at me for a moment, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s weird, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I know you from somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a feint smile, I said, \u201cI feel the same way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stared at me for a moment until she gasped and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I totally forgot to introduce myself.\u201d Smiling, she said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Mackenzie Hawkins, but everyone just calls me Mac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s no way I could have heard that right; no way this teenage girl was...my baby sister.  Why was she suddenly a teenager, and why was she suddenly so girly?  Before I could think about what to say next, I said, \u201cMac it\u2019s me, Brian!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed Mac\u2019s concerned face briefly turn angry; forcing herself to smile, she said, \u201cCan we not play this game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, I\u2019m your brother!\u201d my voice getting louder, I said, \u201cI taught you and Emily how to ride a bike!  You had this teddy bear that you\u2019d sleep with and take to school with you every day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly not amused, Mac faked a chuckle and said, \u201cEveryone has a teddy bear when they\u2019re little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but you named yours after me; so you\u2019d always feel like I was watching over you when you were lonely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence filled the room; until, after several seconds, Mac\u2019s eyes went wide.  \"Oh my God!\" Wrapping her arms around me in a tight hug, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s really you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled to breath under her tight grasp, as tears fell down her cheeks.  \u201cMac, you\u2019re squeezing me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac loosened her grip as she stared at me, looking rather upset.  \u201cWhere have you been!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?  One minute we were playing hide &amp; seek, the next minute I found myself here.\u201d Confused, I looked at her and said, \u201cHow\u2019d you get so big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrian, you\u2019ve been missing for close to 7 years.\u201d Wiping tears from her face, I said, \u201cWhy do you look like a 6-year-old?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow has it been 7 years; when it\u2019s only been a few hours for me.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cAs for your other question, I haven\u2019t the faintest idea why I\u2019m suddenly 6 years old again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mac lifted me out of the hospital bed; causing me to yell out as she shifted me in her arms, \u201cHey, put me down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything\u2019s going to be okay; we\u2019ll figure this out together.\u201d Planting a kiss on my forehead as she held me close, Mac said, \u201cI\u2019m never going to let anything bad happen to to you ever again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac\u2019s words were so direct that it started to bother me; almost as much as the fact that my sister was now older than me and treating me like a little kid.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhere's Mom and Dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting my back on the bed, Mac said, \u201cMom\u2019s waiting outside; she can\u2019t really do walk very fast at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing a smile on her face, Mac said, \u201cWe-We\u2019ll talk about that later; for now, Mom needs to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Mac turned and left the room; leaving me there to decide whether I should follow after her or wait.</span></div></div>",

Jumping out of bed, I let out a yelp when I hit the floor \u2013 a painful reminder that I was now much shorter than I\u2019d been only hours earlier.  Running towards the door, I could hear Mac talking with someone outside, \u201cMom, you\u2019ve got to believe me; that little boy they called us about is Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest smile in the world formed on m face as I heard Mom\u2019s voice; only to be somewhat dampened as I heard what she had to say, \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying isn\u2019t possible, Mackenzie; if your brother were still alive he\u2019d be 7 years older, not 7 years younger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that Mac was in over her head, I walked out of the room \u2013 stopping in my tracks when I saw mom standing nearby.  She looked pretty much the same despite 7 years having passed; but what surprised me the most was her large baby bump.  Feeling uncertain, I said, \u201cMom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked at me for a few moments, and I mean really looked at me.  The longer she looked at me, the more I sensed that she was starting to realize Mac was telling the truth.
