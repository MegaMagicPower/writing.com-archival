He had practically turned his house, his car, his office, and his lab upside down, but he was having no luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere could it be?\u201d he wondered aloud. \u201cHow could I be so careless? Oh, nonononononono...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was worried. If his creation fell into the wrong hands, there was no telling what might happen. He feared that it was already in some stranger\u2019s possession, but he continued to search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same night, not far from Percy\u2019s house, Ben, Sabrina, Eric, and Maggie were walking back to their college dorms after seeing a movie together. They were chatting away about the things that people their age usually talked about. Classes and homework, upcoming social events, relationship rumors, and the quality of the movie were all among their subjects of conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they neared the dorms, Ben noticed something peculiar on the ground, and reached to pick it up. It appeared to be some kind of remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you got there, Ben?\u201d Maggie asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Ben answered, examining the many buttons on the device. They had labels like \u201cbody\u201d, \u201cpersonality\u201d, and \u201cactivate\u201d. There was even a small screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like a tv remote. Nothing special,\u201d Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why is it so weird?\u201d Sabrina asked. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen one like this before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina reached to take the device from Ben, and in the process, some buttons were pushed. There was a flash of light, and when it faded, Ben and Sabrina were shocked to see that they had swapped...</span></div></div>",

It looked like Sabrina was now wearing an outfit identical to his, and she was looking back at Ben with a shocked expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSabrina, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ben asked his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBen... your body... MY body...\u201d Sabrina answered slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ben looked down at his own body, and suddenly he could see the problem. It wasn\u2019t his body. It was Sabrina\u2019s. That meant that Sabrina wasn\u2019t just wearing Ben\u2019s clothes. She had his body as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen slowly brought one of his manicured hands up to his face to examine it. He then couldn\u2019t help but notice his cleavage peaking out from Sabrina\u2019s pink blouse. Bringing his new hand back down to his chest and grabbing a handful of boob, he felt a wave of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBenjamin!\u201d Sabrina exclaimed, slapping Ben on the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, guys...\u201d Eric suddenly chimed in. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what\u2019s the problem\u2019?\u201d Sabrina responded. \u201cDo you not see this?\u201d She asked, gesturing at her own head atop Ben\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what?\u201d Maggie asked sincerely. \u201cIs this some kind of game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then realized that in his/Sabrina\u2019s other hand, he still held the remote.

All three of them could now clearly see a tent in Maggie\u2019s skirt. She didn\u2019t just have a penis now. She had an erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you guys... want to... familiarize yourselves?\u201d Sabrina asked, turning to face the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould one of us go in the bathroom?\u201d Ben asked Maggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point? We\u2019ve obviously both seen our own privates before,\u201d Maggie pointed out. \u201cI say we both just drop everything and take a look right here. On three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen took a deep breath, then agreed. Maggie counted to three, and the next thing they knew, Ben\u2019s pants and Maggie\u2019s skirt were on the floor. Underwear was next, and the two friends found themselves facing each other in just their shirts, with swapped genitals completely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind if I... touch it?\u201d Maggie asked, staring at her hardened cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as long as you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess this is why we did this. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ben, sliding three fingers between his legs and sending an unfamiliar wave of pleasure through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so... hard,\u201d said Maggie, her heart beating faster as she gently caressed her new member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can help you with that if you want,\u201d Sabrina chuckled, still facing the wall. She them gasped. \u201cOh my god, did I say that out loud?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did,\u201d said Maggie. \u201cAnd honestly, I\u2019d be willing to take you up on that offer.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Maggie then began to discuss makeup with Ben.

Did I say that out loud?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen suddenly remembered that he had been part of the swap as well. His hand went to his own crotch, where he felt an unusual emptiness. \u201cThis is so weird,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I would prefer that you not get handsy,\u201d said Sabrina. \u201cHow long are we staying like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA day, maybe?\u201d Ben suggested. \u201cLong enough to really see what it\u2019s like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.

They sat at a card table in the corner of the room and looked around to see who else was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting cross-legged in another corner was Lexi, who had her laptop, and was working on some homework. Lexi was a brown haired girl who usually wore contacts, but had instead opted for glasses today. She was wearing a pair of black leggings and a green tank top. She was barefoot, and her exposed toes were painted purple. Her fingernails were a matching purple, and her hair was tied up in a messy bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying at the pool table in the center of the room were Jess and her boyfriend Mark. Mark was dressed in a tight grey tee shirt that showed off his muscles, khaki pants, and grey tennis shoes. His hair was brown and curly, although it was mostly covered by a white Adidas hat, turned backwards. Jess was dressed in short white socks, floral print leggings, and a blue hoodie she had stolen from Mark. Her platinum blonde hair was tied in a ponytail, and her fingernails were painted pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, sprawled across the couch, watching tv, was Macy. She must have just recently gotten out of the shower, because her hair (which was dyed black, although her naturally dirty blonde roots were showing) was still wet. She was dressed in black Vans, skinny jeans, and a red AC-DC tee shirt. Unlike Lexi and Jess, her fingernails were short and unpainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, who\u2019s our first victim?\u201d Ben asked, making sure not to speak too loudly. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve got it.

Jess\u2019s body was now the one dressed in Mark\u2019s khakis and form-fitting gray tee shirt. Instead of accentuating Mark\u2019s muscles, the shirt was now showing off Jess\u2019s perky boobs. Her now messy hair hung down from Mark\u2019s white cap. Mark\u2019s body was dressed in Jess\u2019s floral leggings and his own stolen hoodie. And since Jess\u2019s hair had been in a ponytail, there was a hair tie in the back of Mark\u2019s short, curly hair, but it wasn\u2019t accomplishing anything other than making Mark\u2019s hair look silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn.

She looked in Maggie's side of the closet and found that everything was now resized to fit her. Sabrina tried on some heels, they looked so expensive, but fit her perfectly. She was so envious of Maggie before but now felt so happy that even for a day, were now her's. <br>\r\nJust then Maggie came into the room, wearing Sabrina's old bath towel.<br>\r\n\"Enjoying your new friends\" Sabrina said pointing at Maggies new chest, which now looked huge on her tiny frame.<br>\r\n\"Oh, trust me, I'll put these new guys to use\" Maggie said while playing with her new breasts. \"So what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, just trying on my new shoes, seeing which one's would be best for tonight\". Sabrina replied.<br>\r\nThen sitting down, Maggie replied, \"Why don't you just buy new ones?\"<br>\r\nSabrina looked puzzled \"Won't your dad be upset if I spend money?\"<br>\r\nMaggie got up after putting on yoga pants and a tight longsleve shirt with a deep cut (Trying to show off her new assists).<br>\r\n\"Hey Sabrina, I told you about my cousin and how he buys stuff for his car collection, and will just spend 40 grand on a car like that\" Maggie then snapped her fingers. \"Just remember that his father is the Vice President of the Company and <i>your father</i> is the president. And trust me he'll be ok with it as long as you're happy.\"<br>\r\n\"Would you be fine wearing clothes I buy?\" Sabrina asked.<br>\r\n\"Sabrina you're too modest, but yes I would wear them if we switch back\". Maggie stated. \"Here how about I set you up on a spa morning to get your hair and nails done, then after that you can go on a shopping spree and please have fun, and when you come back to the dorms we can switch back\".<br>\r\n\"Ok, well what will you be doing today then?\"<br>\r\n\"Just relaxing, might go out to brunch with our mutual friends, and if its fine I'll just take a 100 dollars out of your wallet to use\".<br>\r\n\"Well <i>Sabrina</i> sounds like a good plan, I'm off for a message and shopping, then dinner\".<br>\r\n\"Oh wait before you go heres our last switch\"<br>\r\nwith that Maggie pressed a button but nothing seemed to happen.<br>\r\n\"What did you just do?\" Sabrina asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just switched out language skills trust me you'll have a much better time this way\". Maggie said, with that Maggie then gave you a friendly push out the door, and closed it, then reopening the door to hand you her former purse. As you approached the car (A new Tesla) you looked through your now purse. It was weird seeing a drivers license with your face on it but Maggie's name on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving was a blast, and was much more powerful than your old car. When you got to the message place you noticed how nice and fancy it was, and you noticed the prices, 2 grand for half a day? You turned around ready to head out but you heard the receptionist call out your name (Well Maggies name). The receptionist told you that it was already paid with your card on file, and then what Sabrina experienced next she couldn't believe, feet messages so good that Sabrina felt she might have orgasmed, hair and nail treatment so good that she didn't even think her nails would ever be nice as they would ever be. However a funny thing happened during this, when the nail receptionist spoke Chinese, Sabrina could understand and she found it fun injecting herself into the conversation speaking perfect Mandrin. What was funny was that Sabrina was now known as that unknown super rich Chinese girl, who only comes in with her mother. Then Sabrina got a nice back message complete with stones and a sexy guy giving her a back rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Sabrina decided since she was living in paradise she might as well live it up. She got a new Louis Vuitton handbag and whats funny is that when she decided to get a dress, She described to the dress designer what she wanted in French (She didn't know she could speak that). She ended up getting a business style dress that cost way to much, but to be honest looked fantastic on her. And with that she then went to her new Dad's place <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mr. Chan called her sun daughter and she called him daddy (which was weird). Mr. Chan mentioned that they were an hour away from dinner and to relax a bit before dinner happens. Sabrina then navigated her way towards her new room (which Maggie explained by memory). She looked at all the photographs on the wall of her body in various locations like Paris, Hong Kong, and London. She also then took a tour of her new walk in closet. So many clothes and dresses that now ware all specialize sized to fit her body. Looking at the photos on the wall Sabrina lamented on how lucky Maggie was and how bad she wanted to visit those locations. How bad she wanted to be that girl in the fancy clothes in the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was nice, it was brought out by servants and Sabrina had the best steak she ever had in her life. What happened next surprised her, her new dad wanted to take her to Hong Kong and Singapore, and just wanted her to attend one meeting. Her new dad also suggested buying an apartment on campus just to make her more comfortable and mentioned that he could have the chef drive there once a week to make a meal for her. Sabrina wanted to say yes, but didn't want Maggie committed to anything she did. She just kept saying maybe and that she'll think about it. Sabrina eventually left and went back to the apartment, she was going to miss all that wealth, and her new car. Maybe Maggie could stay like this for awhile longer while Sabrina was in Singapore. When she got back to her dorm room Maggie wasn't there, and then Sabrina got a text saying that she won't be home tonight and that they could switch tomorrow at lunch. Sabrina secretly smiled as she started to drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

But now she could be free from her dad, no longer having to worry about embarrassing the family, she could finally live the day freely and experiment the way she liked it. That instant Maggie got in Sabrina's old car (putting the remote in the trunk) and went to the Twisted Sister bar on campus (aka the lesbian bar) and went there. When she walked in the door she was happy on the license that it said Sabrina's name on it. In the bar she looked and spotted Deanna, the long tall redheed with nice curves. Deanna then came over and asked and asked if she wanted to dance. Maggie said yes. Maggie was waiting for this for so long, the normal faces in front of her dad, the lack of freedom she felt in her life. Just trapped to live a lie. Her Dad always told her to never embarrass the family and with her secret it seemed like she was going to have to live a lie. But not now, not today, because she was not in her family, she was in Sabrina's. Even for a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two danced together and kissed on the dance floor, the kiss felt so soft and so right. Maggie did not want to give up this new position. On a personal level she now felt her old nickname appropriate, the girl who had everything now applied to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two found themselves soon in the bathroom, with Deanna's hand down Maggies pants. Maggie could feel herself becoming wet. During this moment, Maggie asked if Deanna liked big breasts and she said \"Like yours, of course\". Maggie just smiled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after Maggie got herself invited to Deanna's apartment, Maggie stated that she needed to pick up some things from the apartment in order to stay the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the car she was thinking about the remote, thinking of ways to stay as Sabrina longer</span></div></div>",

Plus if she was to program Ben having a crush on her old life (Maggies old life, Sabrina's current), Sabrina would have a tough time switching back into her life. (Maggie just remembered all the time Sabrina took to make herself look nice in the mirror hoping for Ben to notice).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Maggie got to Ben's Dorm door, she was greeted by Ben rushing her into her room. <br>\r\n\"Sabrina, did you find anything more about the remote?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah Ben, just take a look at this\" and in that moment Maggie pressed the program button on the remote. Ben's face went completely blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Ben\" Maggie started, \"Who do you currently have a crush on?\"<br>\r\n\"Macy\" Ben stated.

Sabrina got up and looked in the mirror, she spoke perfect Mandarin to herself, then did a little french. It's like she knew this all her life. After a while Sabrina got a text telling her which business class she needed to go to. Sabrina then sent Maggie a text telling her what class she needed to attend for Biology (she was hoping to become a Dr). Maggie and Sabrina then decided to meet up for lunch, were Sabrina insisted she switch. The need for a switch came further while attending business class, she hardly understood what they were talking about. Sabrina headed to lunch, she still had to wait 30 minutes for Maggie to get out of her old class. Then out of the corner of her eye she saw Ben come over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is this seat taken\" Ben said with a little tremor in his voice.<br>\r\n\"No go ahead, I'm waiting on <i>Sabrina</i>\" She sighed, ready to be over this.<br>\r\n\"So, um Maggie you like movies right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do\" Sabrina stated, wondering where Ben was going with this, I mean usually he was a lot more confident, and sure of himself.<br>\r\n\"Well I was hoping that the two of us could see a movie together, and if your hunger we can get something to eat\" Ben said. Sabrina was stunned, she wanted this, and now she gets this in the wrong life!<br>\r\n\"Umm let me look at my schedule and i'll get back to you\". Sabrina said<br>\r\n\"If not tonight, we could move it\".<br>\r\n\"Let me look into this, listen Sabrina is going to be here soon so you should get to class.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, see you later Maggie, think about it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was sat in silence thinking about this new development. Sabrina then saw Maggie come with what looked like  <i>Deanna eyeing Maggies butt?</i> Sabrina didn't focus on that and put it aside thinking it was nothing. <br>\r\n\"Hey <i>Maggie</i> hows life? anything interesting happen yesterday or today, how was the trip to see your dad\".<br>\r\n\"Well I knew you were rich but I didn't know you were mega-rich, the salon was nice you set up for me. And your dad was nice and we had a good dinner\".<br>\r\n\"Awesome, I'm glad to hear it, anything happen this morning?\" Maggie replied<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Ben asked you out on a date to the movies.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, your crush secretly asking you out? What movie are you going to see? or Am I going to see if you want to switch back?\". Maggie replied enthusiastically.<br>\r\n\"I didn't day yes, I said I would look at my schedule, and besides you don't want to switch back?\" Sabrina asked questioningly.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm happy being you for a week, and besides if i was you and I had the crush on Ben I wouldn't want to switch back, I mean who gets to test drive a date?\" Maggie replied.<br>\r\n\"But what if I screw this up\" Sabrina said vulnerably.<br>\r\n\"<i>Maggie</i>, test drive the date, so if you screw up you can learn from it next time\". <br>\r\n\"You sure ok staying like this for a few more days? Who am I kidding I can't take your class I don't know a thing about Business\" Sabrina replied.<br>\r\n\"Well how about this, using the remote we exchange biology knowledge and business knowledge with each other, and you take Ben for a couple of dates, maybe a movie tonight and a fancy dinner Wednesday where you can dress as fancy as you want, meanwhile I'll keep up your life and enjoy these tits\" Maggie stated grabbing her now large tits. <br>\r\nSabrina thought about it for a minute. \"Alright sounds good, let's do this\". Sabrina said excitingly.<br>\r\nMaggie pulled out the remote and switch the knowledge between the two. Sabrina now felt that the morning class not only made sense, but was a little easy thinking back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth went their separate ways, but this time Sabrina took the remote, and she replied that she could see a movie tonight to Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maggie replied. Sabrina gave her a dirty look. \"For when you start dating for real\". Maggie replied defensively.<br>\r\nSabrina put on a dress that showed off her skinny body that fit her like a glove, she thought this dress would have looked better if she had her old breasts.<br>\r\n\"Hey I want to show you something\" Maggie said, Maggie went into her old drawers and unlocked a case, when it was opened Maggie revealed a pearl necklace. \"Here, wear this, my mother gave it to me when I started college and said she always wore it for good luck, and now since it's technically yours, you should wear it\". Maggie then put the necklace on Sabrina. Sabrina was stunned at this development, but she didn't want to take it off incase of insulting Maggies gift. And besides it looked good on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen came up and was a gentleman, they went to the movies and Sabrina used some of Maggie's money to buy popcorn and tickets. Sabrina, bought tickets to a movie out for a while, knowing there would be a small crowed. Sabrina did this so that she could put the moves on Ben if needed. Things started out slow, they didn't hold hands until halfway in the movie, then Sabrina had a thought, if she was aggressive with Ben, it wouldn't effect her status with Ben when she goes back to being Sabrina. So there was no harm because, to her knowledge, Maggie wasn't instead in Ben. And on the plus side, Sabrina didn't know how long she was going to be Maggie, so she thought it was no or never to make a move on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina quickly moved her hand to Ben's crouch, gave him a quick look, mouthed if it was ok to do this (to which he nodded back yes) and quickly started to grope him. Eventually things escalated and Sabrina and Ben quickly left the movie theatre. To which Sabrina booked the hotel room. The sex was great, what was funny was how much Ben liked Sabrina's new breasts. The two quickly feel asleep.</span></div></div>",

She also felt a bit constricted by the tight jeans that she wore. In Sabrina\u2019s mind, these were brand new experiences. She was uncomfortable, but intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the girls were in their room with the door locked, Maggie began to change into her pajamas, and Sabrina followed suit. Sabrina had seen Maggie in her underwear a million times. She had even seen Maggie\u2019s bare breasts a few times. Sabrina liked boys, so seeing Maggie like this did nothing for her, but this time she found herself carefully and discreetly studying Maggie\u2019s movements. Trying not to get caught staring, Sabrina watched as Maggie unhooked her bra, then tried to do the same. It was more difficult than it looked, but after a few tries, Sabrina successfully removed her own bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina now stood topless, staring down and unable to look away from her chest. She slowly brought her hands up and grabbed the soft mounds of flesh that she believed were Ben\u2019s. A feeling of pleasure coursed through her. They were so sensitive. Sabrina closed her eyes and continued squeezing. Without thinking, she began to move one hand down to her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSabrina!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sabrina cried, snapping out of her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... uh... yeah,\u201d Sabrina stammered, covering her naked chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you seriously about to start masturbating right in front of me? You know we have a bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry... I just... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Embarrassed, Sabrina turned away and opened her dresser. She was greeted with a collection of feminine tops. Digging around a bit, she found a plain green tank top and threw it on. She then slid out of her shoes and jeans and got in her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I would complain if you wanted to put on a show for me,\u201d Maggie joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need sleep,\u201d Sabrina managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Maggie said, turning off the light and getting in her own bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it was true that she was tired, Sabrina had trouble falling asleep. The alien feeling of her boobs changing position every time she shifted her weight was enough to keep her awake. Eventually, she did fall asleep, and she dreamed about being back to what she remembered as normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sabrina woke up the next day, she saw that it was almost noon. She sighed, and sat up, again feeling her boobs shift with every movement. She saw that Maggie was gone, so she decided to spend the afternoon...</span></div></div>",

That way, we\u2019re more likely to have the theater to ourselves, and we can talk about the remote in private.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how about <i>In Your Shoes</i>?

For the next hour and a half, Ben and Sabrina got more than familiar with the genitals that they had no idea were originally theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the credits started rolling, the lights came on, a custodian came in, and the two friends left together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBen! That was amazing! I\u2019ve never felt anything like that,\u201d Sabrina whispered. \u201cNow I know why other girls buy all those toys...

When you\u2019re into girls, but most of them have the same parts as you, you learn how to use a toy or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how was your experience?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally good.

Hey, this thing is not gonna pop up any time soon, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if you did a good enough job. Male equipment has to take time to recharge.

Ben made eye contact with Sabrina one last time before putting her dick in his mouth and beginning to bob up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a few points, Ben nearly gave in to his gag reflex, but he powered through. As he moved his head up and down, Sabrina began to moan. This feeling was pure ecstasy, and she was unable to think coherent thoughts.

As expected, it was a bad movie. But they enjoyed it because they were together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over, Sabrina stood up. \u201cSo... what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.

He was quite handsome for a man his age. He was dressed in a plain black shirt, blue jeans, and a white lab coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hello,\u201d Sabrina greeted the stranger. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, for starters, you could open the door all the way and let me get a good look at you,\u201d the man said, looking back and forth between Sabrina and a device in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina did as he said, revealing her entire body to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally,\u201d the man said, seeing the definitely male body standing before him. \u201cI\u2019ve found you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Percy Edwards. And I\u2019m looking for something that belongs to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, don\u2019t play dumb with me, Miss...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreen. Sabrina Green. And I don\u2019t think I know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Green, three years ago, I lost a device. My logs say it was used four times that day, but not once since then. I\u2019ve spent the last three years coming up with a way to track it\u2019s signature. Well, now I\u2019ve found it. You have been swapped, Miss Green.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. My. God. The remote that we found on the ground at the end of our freshman year,\u201d Sabrina realized. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream? That actually happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you do know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe... we used it to switch bodies, but we switched back,\u201d Sabrina said, remembering the swaps that she had been able to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou... switched back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh. And then we... destroyed it the next day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou did what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember... not wanting it to fall into the wrong hands, so we destroyed it and threw away the pieces. But I guess we both decided that it was all just a dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I suppose it\u2019s just a dream that you\u2019ve had a man\u2019s body below your neck all this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Green... Sabrina, was it? Look at yourself. Can you think of any other women who have bodies like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sabrina said, thinking about it. \u201cTransgender people exist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that isn\u2019t what I mean,\u201d Percy frowned. \u201cMiss Green, I think you should come with me. At my house, I have a device that will give you back your real memories. Then, we can work from there to get you back to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina pondered what Percy was saying. As far as she could remember, this was the body she had had her entire life. Then again, Percy\u2019s words made sense. She couldn\u2019t think of a single person aside from herself and Ben who had bodies typical of the opposite sex. But if Ben\u2019s body was really hers, then going back to \u201cnormal\u201d would mean Sabrina would be the pregnant one. And what would Ben think of all this anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at her phone, Sabrina saw a text saying that Grace was close by. Sabrina closed her eyes. This was crazy. But she had to make a decision. Opening her eyes, Sabrina decided to go...</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re the only girl I\u2019ve ever been friends with that has the right parts to satisfy mine. I\u2019d be willing to dress up however you want. You can say no, though. I know this is a crazy thing to ask someone that I\u2019m not even really dating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBen, look at me,\u201d said Sabrina, forcing him to make eye contact with her.</span></div></div>",

Unsurprisingly, they felt as soft as they looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Mags,\u201d he heard someone say. He sat up and saw Maggie dressed in the sweatshirt and leggings he had put on just moments ago, believing that she was Sabrina. \u201cWhat\u2019s that by your hand? Is that the remote Ben found on the ground last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did he give it to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, it\u2019s junk, so he didn\u2019t want it, but it looks cool, so I took it,\u201d Ben lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie shrugged and put it out of her mind. \u201cSo, speaking of Ben...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got Ben\u2019s attention, and he watched as Maggie sat down to apply makeup to her face in Sabrina\u2019s style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought about what you said last night,\u201d she continued, \u201cand I think I\u2019m going to ask him out today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet!\u201d Ben said. \u201cUh, I mean, good for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll say yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen knew that his life was currently being lived by the real Sabrina, but she believed that she was him. So she would do everything the way he normally would, right? And if Sabrina Green asked him out, he would say yes. So if Maggie is basically Sabrina, and Sabrina thinks she\u2019s Ben, then surely Sabrina would agree to go out with Maggie. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaggie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was just thinking about something. What was the question?\u201d Ben asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think Ben will say yes if I ask him out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled. \u201cI cam confidently say that I believe Ben would love to date you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie smiled. \u201cHow\u2019s my makeup? Should I change clothes? I feel like I should change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMag- uh- Sabrina, calm down,\u201d Ben spoke softly, trying to think of what Maggie would say if she were herself. \u201cBen will like you no matter how you\u2019re dressed.

But what kind if shirt? Is it a tank top, or-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yeah, it\u2019s a tank top,\u201d Ben quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMacy, have you seen Sabrina\u2019s yellow tank top?\u201d Yasmine turned and called to her roommate. While her back was turned, Ben took the opportunity to use the remote, switching bodies with Yasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d came Macy\u2019s reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, we don\u2019t have it,\u201d Yasmine said to Ben, her accent now coming out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Have a great day,\u201d Ben said, smiling. His plan was coming along nicely. He decided that he would wear Yasmine\u2019s body for the day, tweaking it here and there to make her extra hot, then switch back with her later. Then, he would switch back to his own life and ask her out. It was perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen wondered where he should go to make his upgrades.</span></div></div>",

He decided to keep the flats on, since he wasn\u2019t quite ready to deal with the wide world of women\u2019s shoes. He then grabbed Sabrina\u2019s purse, made sure her phone and keys were inside, threw the remote in, and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen made his way downstairs and outside to Sabrina\u2019s car, then hopped in and headed for the beach. On the way there, he wondered how he could improve Yasmine\u2019s body. She was already attractive, but he figured a few changes here and there couldn\u2019t hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived at the beach, he looked around in Sabrina\u2019s car to see if there was a more practical bag he could use than a fancy white purse. Sure enough, he found a green drawstring backpack. He transferred Sabrina\u2019s phone, keys, and wallet into the bag, keeping the remote out so he could use it. Then he carefully hid the purse so no one would be tempted to break into the car, locked the doors, and headed for the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben walked down the beach, he kept his eyes open for anything he could steal to make Yasmine\u2019s body smokin\u2019 hot. He figured hair should be first. He spotted a few girls that would make for interesting choices, but he ended up settling on a girl who had a straight, blonde, shoulder length hairdo, dyed pink at the ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was boobs. It took a while, but Ben eventually found a woman with huge tits that pretty much matched Yasmine\u2019s skin tone. After that swap, every step Ben took made his new boobs bounce, which he enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Ben changed was Yasmine\u2019s voice. He overheard a woman who spoke with a very high pitched, breathy voice, like a cheerleader in a porno. He wondered what that voice would sound like with Yasmine\u2019s Arabic accent, so he took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy with the new haircut, chest, and voice he had picked out for Yasmine, Ben decided he was ready to head back.</span></div></div>",

Instead, she made her way back upstairs and to her room, where she saw that Maggie had gotten Eric\u2019s body dressed in a white, off-the-shoulder blouse and a pair of black leggings. The blouse came down a decent ways, but not far enough to hide Eric\u2019s package, which was proudly displayed as a sizable bulge in Maggie\u2019s leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel better?\u201d Maggie asked, looking in a mirror and putting in her nose ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d Sabrina lied, sitting down on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSabrina, do you want to talk about what happened last night?\u201d Maggie asked, turning to look at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sabrina sighed, letting herself fall onto her back and staring up at the ceiling. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.

I remember being white, and having blonde hair, and a different voice. But you clearly remember this reality. And so does Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou talked to Ben?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup. He\u2019s swapped too. But he doesn\u2019t realize it.

Until this morning, Sabrina and Ben had been the only ones to touch the remote. And Sabrina was the closest person to it during the night. Was it possible that what Sabrina said was true?

He now sported Sabrina\u2019s pink blouse, with black bra straps showing, as well as her very tight fitting jeans and pink flats. Ben now also had expertly applied makeup on most of his face, a white bracelet on his wrist, and a medium sized white purse over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina, still laughing, pulled at her pants so she could see her underwear, only to confirm that she was wearing Ben\u2019s boxers, which could only mean he was wearing her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Maggie, meanwhile, didn\u2019t see what was so funny. To them, everything was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen studied the strange device in his hand. It was obviously responsible for this. But how? How was this possible?

We should head back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Sabrina gave in.

He opened up his closet and saw several blouses, dresses, skirts, even a pant suit. He also saw a rack of women\u2019s shoes. Everything from flats, to heels, to tennis shoes, to sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen ultimately chose a frilly white blouse with purple and yellow flowers on it. He didn\u2019t change his bra, because he didn\u2019t want to waste time struggling with it, but he did change panties before pairing the blouse with a pair of purple pants that were just as tight as the jeans had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the selection of shoes, and went with a pair of white sandals. It was then that he noticed his toenails were painted white. He also noticed that his legs were not shaven. Apparently body grooming didn\u2019t fall into the clothing category, but he decided that if he wanted smooth legs, he would just use the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen struck a few poses in the mirror, laughing at himself, before heading out for the day, making sure to bring the white purse from last night with him.

There were two other girls in the hallway, but neither one seemed to notice anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen quickly ducked back into the stairwell before Deanna noticed him, noticing immediately how jiggly his large, braless boobs were.

After all, with a body like this, there was certainly fun to be had without clothes. But Deanna had specifically requested that he <i>not</i> do anything \u201cgross\u201d.

I mean, Deanna... is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll find out,\u201d said Eric, getting his phone out. \u201cWhen you left the room, you still had Ben\u2019s clothes on. His phone is probably still in his pocket. You go be Deanna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina smiled, picked up the remote, then left the room and headed for the stairs. When she arrived at Deanna and Janelle\u2019s door, she saw that it was closed, but not locked. When she had switched bodies and rushed back downstairs earlier, Deanna/Ben must have closed it for her. Heading inside and locking it behind her, Sabrina then crept to Deanna\u2019s bed, being careful not to disturb Janelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, fatigue set in. A lot had happened in the last few hours, and Sabrina was just now feeling it. Speaking of feeling things, as she drifted off to sleep, she couldn\u2019t help but imagine that she would be pretty sore in the morning thanks to the number Eric did on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Sabrina was pulled out of her sleep by Janelle\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeanna,\u201d Janelle spoke, \u201cSabrina is at the door. She wants to talk to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sabrina? Oh, right. Ben</i>, Sabrina thought. As she stood up, she noted that she was indeed sore. She pondered whether or not getting with Eric was a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, <i>Deanna</i>,\u201d said Ben, dressed in a purple tank top, pink pajama pants, and white ankle socks. \u201cCan we talk? In private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJanelle, do you mind?\u201d Sabrina asked Deanna\u2019s roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Janelle said, grabbing her phone and heading across the hall to the girls\u2019 common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then came all the way in, and closed the door. \u201cAlright. What\u2019s going on?\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that\u2019s you, Sabrina. I went to my room to switch back with you, and your body insisted she was the real me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I should have seen that coming,\u201d Sabrina noted. \u201cHow did you know where to find me? Did Eric tell you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEric was asleep. But I asked your body if she saw anyone else come in the room last night, and she told me about \u2018Deanna\u2019. So I figured that you must have switched places with her,\u201d said Ben. He then took a deep breath. \u201cYou fucked Eric, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina looked down, embarrassed. Ben wasn\u2019t supposed to find out, but it was her own fault for not switching back when she had the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d said Ben. \u201cDid he know it was you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot until after.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo he knows about the remote?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Wait, aren\u2019t you mad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I be mad?\u201d Ben asked. \u201cYou probably just got drunk with power and made a decision in the heat of the moment. Hell, the only thing stopping me from trying to get with Maggie was knowing that she thinks I\u2019m you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGross. Although I guess I\u2019m not in a position to pass judgement right now,\u201d said Sabrina, feeling a little better. \u201cWell, what now?\u201d</span></div></div>",

She eventually managed to let out a simple, \u201cOh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can test the remote now, but I need to be dressed up in time to meet Maggie before eight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid... did you ask her out?\u201d Sabrina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen suddenly remembered what Maggie had said last night. Sabrina liked Ben too. And Maggie had confessed to Ben when he was in Sabrina\u2019s life, so the real Sabrina had no knowledge of Maggie\u2019s crush. And Ben, acting selfishly, had taken advantage of the situation to make Maggie think that she had Sabrina\u2019s blessing. \u201cActually, she asked me out,\u201d Ben admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. I had no idea that she liked you,\u201d Sabrina said, trying not to show any emotion. She then reached for the door. \u201cI think I need to go talk to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen panicked. If he allowed Sabrina to talk to Maggie, then surely she would find out what Ben had done. Ben didn\u2019t want Sabrina to be angry with him <i>or</i> Maggie.

And of course Ben could see her bulge in those sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was the only girl Ben knew with a male body. Likewise, Ben was the only guy Sabrina knew with a female body. Neither one had admitted anything, but they both secretly figured that they would eventually end up together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then headed back into his own room, where Eric was fast asleep, and slipped out of his clothes. First, off came the pink flats. Then the jeans, then the blouse. He then put on a gray camisole and a pair of pink pajama pants. The last thing he did before going to sleep was put the remote in his purse, which was sitting on top of his dresser.</span></div></div>",

She definitely liked boys, but there was always a part of her that was curious. Sabrina\u2019s features were so soft. Now was as good a time as ever for Maggie to finally find out what it was like. And if it had to be with anyone, she was glad it was with Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls kissed time and time again, their hands began to drift. Maggie had a firm grip on Sabrina\u2019s breasts, and Sabrina found her way to Maggie\u2019s vagina. Carefully, methodically, Sabrina\u2019s fingers made their way in and out. Slowly at first, then faster. Faster. Faster. Maggie let out a loud moan as she orgasmed, making eye contact with Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy turn,\u201d said Sabrina. Maggie smirked, then began kissing Sabrina\u2019s neck. Maggie\u2019s kisses then began to move down. Breasts. Nipples. Stomach. Finally, Maggie\u2019s kisses found their way to Sabrina\u2019s crotch. Her lips and tongue began to perform a sort of dance. Eventually, Sabrina was on the verge of climaxing, at which point Maggie quickly repositioned herself to kiss Sabrina\u2019s lips once again. The two shared a final, long, meaningful kiss as Sabrina orgasmed, her moans muffled by Maggie\u2019s face pressed against her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over, both girls ended up on their backs, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d whispered Maggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I came on to you like that,\u201d said Sabrina. \u201cSomething just came over me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d Maggie said, kissing Sabrina on the cheek. \u201cGood night, Sabrina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night,\u201d Sabrina answered, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fell asleep side by side.

I guess,\u201d Ben muttered as he watched her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina made her way back into her own room, and found Maggie putting on her pajamas. Without changing any settings, Sabrina aimed the remote at her roommate and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FLASH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina, now having Maggie\u2019s personality and bi-curious thoughts, once again took off her shirt to reveal her braless breasts. \u201cHow do you feel now?\u201d she asked in a shy but sultry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie, now having Ben\u2019s personality, was instantly turned on by the topless girl in front of her, and didn\u2019t know what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you want to do this, Maggie,\u201d Sabrina said, slowly stepping forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie\u2019s heart began to beat. \u201cI do...

Each girl\u2019s mouth and hands covered every inch of the other\u2019s body. Having both only done it with boys in the past, they noted the softness of every kiss, and the impeccable tenderness of every touch. Of course, with Ben\u2019s libido, Maggie moved with much more purpose than she had ever used with a partner before, but her petite frame seemed to counteract her attempts to really rough Sabrina up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two girls finally finished, they ended up cuddling, and eventually fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Maggie was the first to wake up.

She showed this to Ben and laid out the ground rules. \"Ok after we switch lives, body's and those traits we selected, we have to land a date with the others approval.

Then Ben felt a hand grabbed his now smaller hand.<br>\r\n\"Hey, <i>Sabrina</i> does not swear nor say that sentence, the only way this is going to work is if we keep up appearances. Now the two people I have a crush on right now is Devin and Booker and they will both be at a party later tonight, if you can convince either one of them to be my boyfriend before I get you a girlfriend, you win, and don't worry, with my sexuality it won't feel weird hitting on them\".

After that, Ben went for Yoga at the Campus gym, he was so excited to finally be in a women's locker room but when he got in he was really disappointed. The best way to describe the locker room to him was that it was just uneventful and when he looked at the topless girls all he could think of was that <i>Those are breasts</i>. Nothing more, nothing less. After Yoga, (which with Sabrina's Yoga ability he felt he was really good at), He texted Sabrina that he wouldn't mind dating Yasmine or Macy. Then he went to her dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw that Maggie was out and he got into Sabrina's bed. While in bed he took off Sabrina's bra which felt so good for him. After which he started rubbing his breasts, and found himself doing little moans while working himself up. After awhile he felt a dampness in between his legs, and he started playing with his clit. Eventually his mind wondered off and thought about Chris Evans and how good he looked in those Captain America movies, to which he climaxed to.<i> I'm Definitely straight in this body</i> Ben thought.

First Ben had to do Sabrina's hair, in order to get a guy like Devin or Booker to date Sabrina. First he took a shower and knew exactly how to take care of women's hair, using the right shampoo and conditioner for the style he was going for, which really excited him. Then he did curls in Sabrina's blonde hair until he got the hair just how he liked it. After, he looked at his hair in the mirror liking the results (not doing too much, but doing just enough to show he cared about appearances). He noticed small imperfections relating to his pores on his (technically Sabrina's) face, which he wouldn't have noticed if it hadn't been for the knowledge switches Sabrina made. Afterwards he expertly put on makeup which shocked and amazed him all at the same time. Then finally, Ben dug through Sabrina's closet and found a dress that showed off currently his best asset, Sabrina's breasts. Ben was also lucky enough to find a pair of heels to match the outfit, and took a few practice steps, amazed at how easy this was to him. Then Maggie stepped into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen could look at her and tell she had been at the salon getting her nails and hair done because they looked amazing. Maggie also had a dress in a bag she brought in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG Sabrina, you look amazing, you\u2019re totally going to nail it out of the park tonight, I'm glad you took my advice on your hair, curls are perfect for you\". Said Maggie as she was headed over to her mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, thanks, I\u2019m going for something new tonight\" Ben replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you going to take my other advice tonight and make your move on Ben tonight?\" Maggie replied. Ben was surprised by this as he had not realized that Sabrina was trying to hook up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no, actually I'm going to go after Booker or Devin tonight\" Ben replied truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww Ben's lost\" Maggie stated. \"Hey, incase you get any of those guys and need a place tonight, just text me and I'll rent a hotel room for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, thanks\" Ben replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Maggie and Ben were both going to the party, they just gossiped amongst each other, it was fun for Ben to be apart of girl talk, in which he talked about boys and makeup (something he was glad to be knowledgeable of and be able to contribute to). As Maggie ordered the Uber, Ben put the remote in his purse and left to go out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did the party go?</span></div></div>",

Jennifer had a scholarship for Gymnastics and had a killer body as a result of the workouts she did. Ben took the remote and made the switch for her body, (making sure to keep Sabrina\u2018s best asset, her boobs).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change was felt immediately. He felt a lot more flexible and stronger. More importantly, he was more toned and his butt was super attractive to any guys. Ben then went over to Maggie and asked her where Booker went and Maggie told Ben that he was invited to a sorority house or cheerleader house. Ben, not eager to blow the night, used the power of the remote on a cheerleader and Sorority member (Sigma Chi, a more difficult house to get into) he made Sabrina into a cheerleader and Sorority member. Ben then made a switch with Emma, known in school as one of the hottest girls, to take her reputation of being one of the hottest girls in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Maggie came over, \"Any cute guys come and ask you out?\".<br>\r\n\"Only one so far\" Ben replied, though as he looked around the room he noticed a lot more guys staring at him.<br>\r\n\"Ok, well as a show of good faith I'm going to get a hotel room tonight, so bring whoever you want home. Also remember to study hard for that big test on Monday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn it, that stupid test</i> Ben thought, he didn't want to worry about the test on Monday so with one final switch, he swapped his intelligence for the smartest kid at the party (who also happened to be the smartest kid in Ben and Sabrina's class).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen hadn't realized that he was literally drunk with power, and thought that after tonight he could just undo the swaps to make things right. Anyways with Devin gone, he focused his attention on Booker and used his new sisters to help him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, who did Ben end up with at the end of the night?</span></div></div>",

His own voice. <br>\r\n\"Seriously, I have a headache, you just go, I want to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n\"No, we talked about this, part of being me is being able to handle my commitments.\u201d<br>\r\n\"Well lets just switch back places and you can go.\u201d<br>\r\n\"No I can't, not per our agreement, I really need to study for Biology and with you being the smartest kid in class you can skip a study session\"<br>\r\n\"Wasn't our agreement just to do a one night stand with someone each of us approve of?\"<br>\r\nSabrina smiled, thinking that Ben was just playing with her. \"Come on Ben, that was <i>my goal in your body</i>, your goal was to try and maintain a relationship with how busy my life is. I mean I wasn't just going to give you a softball, and besides it would be really cruel to hook up with me just so you can brag about it to your guy friends,\u201d Sabrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen really thought about it, remembering all the changes he made last night. Ben then realized that he made Sabrina one of the hottest girls on campus (with the reputation to go along with it), and one of the busiest too. It was no wonder the original agreement changed when reality changed. Not wanting to upset Sabrina, he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm just joking. I'll get up and go. I just didn't realize this body\u2019s limit last night and now have to pay the price\". <br>\r\n\"Good, now hurry along. If you leave now you won't have to rush your makeup. When you come back you can quiz me on this upcoming test,\" Sabrina replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen took the remote and the cheerleader gear to Sabrina's car. When the coast was clear he took out the remote, ready to press the the reset button. What guy wanted to be a cheerleader? <i>Where is that reset button</i>, Ben thought. As he searched for two minutes on the remote he made a startling realization. There was no reset button. Ben now had a choice, he could switch his cheerleading duties with some random girl on campus, or go to cheer practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ben hated yelling and screaming inspiration quotes, but yet he knew all the lines to say and the dance moves. At the end of practice the head cheer leader Marissa stated that they needed to be ready by next Saturday for the football game, so they were fitting in extra practices to be ready. Ben was not looking forward to it and hopefully, he thought, He and Sabrina could switch out of it before then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben was walking back to campus he noticed all the guys looking at him. What was weird was that Ben didn't appreciate some of the dorks looking at him, but appreciated some of the better looking guys at the school looking at him.

There was a flash, and Ben\u2019s body now looked confused. Maggie\u2019s body winked at Sabrina to confirm that it was Ben in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Ben,\u201d said Sabrina, \u201cthanks for breakfast.
