He had practically turned his house, his car, his office, and his lab upside down, but he was having no luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere could it be?\u201d he wondered aloud. \u201cHow could I be so careless? Oh, nonononononono...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was worried. If his creation fell into the wrong hands, there was no telling what might happen. He feared that it was already in some stranger\u2019s possession, but he continued to search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same night, not far from Percy\u2019s house, Ben, Sabrina, Eric, and Maggie were walking back to their college dorms after seeing a movie together. They were chatting away about the things that people their age usually talked about. Classes and homework, upcoming social events, relationship rumors, and the quality of the movie were all among their subjects of conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they neared the dorms, Ben noticed something peculiar on the ground, and reached to pick it up. It appeared to be some kind of remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you got there, Ben?\u201d Maggie asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Ben answered, examining the many buttons on the device. They had labels like \u201cbody\u201d, \u201cpersonality\u201d, and \u201cactivate\u201d. There was even a small screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like a tv remote. Nothing special,\u201d Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why is it so weird?\u201d Sabrina asked. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen one like this before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina reached to take the device from Ben, and in the process, some buttons were pushed. There was a flash of light, and when it faded, Ben and Sabrina were shocked to see that they had swapped...</span></div></div>",

It looked like Sabrina was now wearing an outfit identical to his, and she was looking back at Ben with a shocked expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSabrina, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ben asked his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBen... your body... MY body...\u201d Sabrina answered slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ben looked down at his own body, and suddenly he could see the problem. It wasn\u2019t his body. It was Sabrina\u2019s. That meant that Sabrina wasn\u2019t just wearing Ben\u2019s clothes. She had his body as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen slowly brought one of his manicured hands up to his face to examine it. He then couldn\u2019t help but notice his cleavage peaking out from Sabrina\u2019s pink blouse. Bringing his new hand back down to his chest and grabbing a handful of boob, he felt a wave of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBenjamin!\u201d Sabrina exclaimed, slapping Ben on the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, guys...\u201d Eric suddenly chimed in. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what\u2019s the problem\u2019?\u201d Sabrina responded. \u201cDo you not see this?\u201d She asked, gesturing at her own head atop Ben\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what?\u201d Maggie asked sincerely. \u201cIs this some kind of game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then realized that in his/Sabrina\u2019s other hand, he still held the remote.

We need test subjects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds good to me,\u201d said Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie agreed, and the three made their way to the common room down the hall. They sat at a card table in the corner of the room and looked around to see who else was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting cross-legged in another corner was Lexi, who had her laptop, and was working on some homework. Lexi was a brown haired girl who usually wore contacts, but had instead opted for glasses today. She was wearing a pair of black leggings and a green tank top. She was barefoot, and her exposed toes were painted purple. Her fingernails were a matching purple, and her hair was tied up in a messy bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying at the pool table in the center of the room were Jess and her boyfriend Mark. Mark was dressed in a tight grey tee shirt that showed off his muscles, khaki pants, and grey tennis shoes. His hair was brown and curly, although it was mostly covered by a white Adidas hat, turned backwards. Jess was dressed in short white socks, floral print leggings, and a blue hoodie she had stolen from Mark. Her platinum blonde hair was tied in a ponytail, and her fingernails were painted pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, sprawled across the couch, watching tv, was Macy. She must have just recently gotten out of the shower, because her hair (which was dyed black, although her naturally dirty blonde roots were showing) was still wet. She was dressed in black Vans, skinny jeans, and a red AC-DC tee shirt. Unlike Lexi and Jess, her fingernails were short and unpainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, who\u2019s our first victim?\u201d Ben asked, making sure not to speak too loudly. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve got it. Let\u2019s swap Mark and Jess. That would be hilarious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I was thinking one of us should trade places with someone,\u201d suggested Maggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, let\u2019s make Ben a girl,\u201d Sabrina said, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I\u2019m gonna be a girl, I should get to pick who it is,\u201d said Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was joking, but we can make you a girl if you want,\u201d said Sabrina. \u201cUnless Maggie want to go first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you swap me with anyone,\u201d Maggie said to Sabrina, \u201clet me me keep my body.

She looked in Maggie's side of the closet and found that everything was now resized to fit her. Sabrina tried on some heels, they looked so expensive, but fit her perfectly. She was so envious of Maggie before but now felt so happy that even for a day, were now her's. <br>\r\nJust then Maggie came into the room, wearing Sabrina's old bath towel.<br>\r\n\"Enjoying your new friends\" Sabrina said pointing at Maggies new chest, which now looked huge on her tiny frame.<br>\r\n\"Oh, trust me, I'll put these new guys to use\" Maggie said while playing with her new breasts. \"So what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, just trying on my new shoes, seeing which one's would be best for tonight\". Sabrina replied.<br>\r\nThen sitting down, Maggie replied, \"Why don't you just buy new ones?\"<br>\r\nSabrina looked puzzled \"Won't your dad be upset if I spend money?\"<br>\r\nMaggie got up after putting on yoga pants and a tight longsleve shirt with a deep cut (Trying to show off her new assists).<br>\r\n\"Hey Sabrina, I told you about my cousin and how he buys stuff for his car collection, and will just spend 40 grand on a car like that\" Maggie then snapped her fingers. \"Just remember that his father is the Vice President of the Company and <i>your father</i> is the president. And trust me he'll be ok with it as long as you're happy.\"<br>\r\n\"Would you be fine wearing clothes I buy?\" Sabrina asked.<br>\r\n\"Sabrina you're too modest, but yes I would wear them if we switch back\". Maggie stated. \"Here how about I set you up on a spa morning to get your hair and nails done, then after that you can go on a shopping spree and please have fun, and when you come back to the dorms we can switch back\".<br>\r\n\"Ok, well what will you be doing today then?\"<br>\r\n\"Just relaxing, might go out to brunch with our mutual friends, and if its fine I'll just take a 100 dollars out of your wallet to use\".<br>\r\n\"Well <i>Sabrina</i> sounds like a good plan, I'm off for a message and shopping, then dinner\".<br>\r\n\"Oh wait before you go heres our last switch\"<br>\r\nwith that Maggie pressed a button but nothing seemed to happen.<br>\r\n\"What did you just do?\" Sabrina asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just switched out language skills trust me you'll have a much better time this way\". Maggie said, with that Maggie then gave you a friendly push out the door, and closed it, then reopening the door to hand you her former purse. As you approached the car (A new Tesla) you looked through your now purse. It was weird seeing a drivers license with your face on it but Maggie's name on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving was a blast, and was much more powerful than your old car. When you got to the message place you noticed how nice and fancy it was, and you noticed the prices, 2 grand for half a day? You turned around ready to head out but you heard the receptionist call out your name (Well Maggies name). The receptionist told you that it was already paid with your card on file, and then what Sabrina experienced next she couldn't believe, feet messages so good that Sabrina felt she might have orgasmed, hair and nail treatment so good that she didn't even think her nails would ever be nice as they would ever be. However a funny thing happened during this, when the nail receptionist spoke Chinese, Sabrina could understand and she found it fun injecting herself into the conversation speaking perfect Mandrin. What was funny was that Sabrina was now known as that unknown super rich Chinese girl, who only comes in with her mother. Then Sabrina got a nice back message complete with stones and a sexy guy giving her a back rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Sabrina decided since she was living in paradise she might as well live it up. She got a new Louis Vuitton handbag and whats funny is that when she decided to get a dress, She described to the dress designer what she wanted in French (She didn't know she could speak that). She ended up getting a business style dress that cost way to much, but to be honest looked fantastic on her. And with that she then went to her new Dad's place <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mr. Chan called her sun daughter and she called him daddy (which was weird). Mr. Chan mentioned that they were an hour away from dinner and to relax a bit before dinner happens. Sabrina then navigated her way towards her new room (which Maggie explained by memory). She looked at all the photographs on the wall of her body in various locations like Paris, Hong Kong, and London. She also then took a tour of her new walk in closet. So many clothes and dresses that now ware all specialize sized to fit her body. Looking at the photos on the wall Sabrina lamented on how lucky Maggie was and how bad she wanted to visit those locations. How bad she wanted to be that girl in the fancy clothes in the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was nice, it was brought out by servants and Sabrina had the best steak she ever had in her life. What happened next surprised her, her new dad wanted to take her to Hong Kong and Singapore, and just wanted her to attend one meeting. Her new dad also suggested buying an apartment on campus just to make her more comfortable and mentioned that he could have the chef drive there once a week to make a meal for her. Sabrina wanted to say yes, but didn't want Maggie committed to anything she did. She just kept saying maybe and that she'll think about it. Sabrina eventually left and went back to the apartment, she was going to miss all that wealth, and her new car. Maybe Maggie could stay like this for awhile longer while Sabrina was in Singapore. When she got back to her dorm room Maggie wasn't there, and then Sabrina got a text saying that she won't be home tonight and that they could switch tomorrow at lunch. Sabrina secretly smiled as she started to drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

But now she could be free from her dad, no longer having to worry about embarrassing the family, she could finally live the day freely and experiment the way she liked it. That instant Maggie got in Sabrina's old car (putting the remote in the trunk) and went to the Twisted Sister bar on campus (aka the lesbian bar) and went there. When she walked in the door she was happy on the license that it said Sabrina's name on it. In the bar she looked and spotted Deanna, the long tall redheed with nice curves. Deanna then came over and asked and asked if she wanted to dance. Maggie said yes. Maggie was waiting for this for so long, the normal faces in front of her dad, the lack of freedom she felt in her life. Just trapped to live a lie. Her Dad always told her to never embarrass the family and with her secret it seemed like she was going to have to live a lie. But not now, not today, because she was not in her family, she was in Sabrina's. Even for a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two danced together and kissed on the dance floor, the kiss felt so soft and so right. Maggie did not want to give up this new position. On a personal level she now felt her old nickname appropriate, the girl who had everything now applied to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two found themselves soon in the bathroom, with Deanna's hand down Maggies pants. Maggie could feel herself becoming wet. During this moment, Maggie asked if Deanna liked big breasts and she said \"Like yours, of course\". Maggie just smiled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after Maggie got herself invited to Deanna's apartment, Maggie stated that she needed to pick up some things from the apartment in order to stay the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the car she was thinking about the remote, thinking of ways to stay as Sabrina longer</span></div></div>",

Sabrina got up and looked in the mirror, she spoke perfect Mandarin to herself, then did a little french. It's like she knew this all her life. After a while Sabrina got a text telling her which business class she needed to go to. Sabrina then sent Maggie a text telling her what class she needed to attend for Biology (she was hoping to become a Dr). Maggie and Sabrina then decided to meet up for lunch, were Sabrina insisted she switch. The need for a switch came further while attending business class, she hardly understood what they were talking about. Sabrina headed to lunch, she still had to wait 30 minutes for Maggie to get out of her old class. Then out of the corner of her eye she saw Ben come over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is this seat taken\" Ben said with a little tremor in his voice.<br>\r\n\"No go ahead, I'm waiting on <i>Sabrina</i>\" She sighed, ready to be over this.<br>\r\n\"So, um Maggie you like movies right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do\" Sabrina stated, wondering where Ben was going with this, I mean usually he was a lot more confident, and sure of himself.<br>\r\n\"Well I was hoping that the two of us could see a movie together, and if your hunger we can get something to eat\" Ben said. Sabrina was stunned, she wanted this, and now she gets this in the wrong life!<br>\r\n\"Umm let me look at my schedule and i'll get back to you\". Sabrina said<br>\r\n\"If not tonight, we could move it\".<br>\r\n\"Let me look into this, listen Sabrina is going to be here soon so you should get to class.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, see you later Maggie, think about it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was sat in silence thinking about this new development. Sabrina then saw Maggie come with what looked like  <i>Deanna eyeing Maggies butt?</i> Sabrina didn't focus on that and put it aside thinking it was nothing. <br>\r\n\"Hey <i>Maggie</i> hows life? anything interesting happen yesterday or today, how was the trip to see your dad\".<br>\r\n\"Well I knew you were rich but I didn't know you were mega-rich, the salon was nice you set up for me. And your dad was nice and we had a good dinner\".<br>\r\n\"Awesome, I'm glad to hear it, anything happen this morning?\" Maggie replied<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Ben asked you out on a date to the movies.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, your crush secretly asking you out? What movie are you going to see? or Am I going to see if you want to switch back?\". Maggie replied enthusiastically.<br>\r\n\"I didn't day yes, I said I would look at my schedule, and besides you don't want to switch back?\" Sabrina asked questioningly.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm happy being you for a week, and besides if i was you and I had the crush on Ben I wouldn't want to switch back, I mean who gets to test drive a date?\" Maggie replied.<br>\r\n\"But what if I screw this up\" Sabrina said vulnerably.<br>\r\n\"<i>Maggie</i>, test drive the date, so if you screw up you can learn from it next time\". <br>\r\n\"You sure ok staying like this for a few more days? Who am I kidding I can't take your class I don't know a thing about Business\" Sabrina replied.<br>\r\n\"Well how about this, using the remote we exchange biology knowledge and business knowledge with each other, and you take Ben for a couple of dates, maybe a movie tonight and a fancy dinner Wednesday where you can dress as fancy as you want, meanwhile I'll keep up your life and enjoy these tits\" Maggie stated grabbing her now large tits. <br>\r\nSabrina thought about it for a minute. \"Alright sounds good, let's do this\". Sabrina said excitingly.<br>\r\nMaggie pulled out the remote and switch the knowledge between the two. Sabrina now felt that the morning class not only made sense, but was a little easy thinking back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth went their separate ways, but this time Sabrina took the remote, and she replied that she could see a movie tonight to Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is that the remote Ben found on the ground last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did he give it to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, it\u2019s junk, so he didn\u2019t want it, but it looks cool, so I took it,\u201d Ben lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie shrugged and put it out of her mind. \u201cSo, speaking of Ben...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got Ben\u2019s attention, and he watched as Maggie sat down to apply makeup to her face in Sabrina\u2019s style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought about what you said last night,\u201d she continued, \u201cand I think I\u2019m going to ask him out today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet!\u201d Ben said. \u201cUh, I mean, good for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll say yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen knew that his life was currently being lived by the real Sabrina, but she believed that she was him. So she would do everything the way he normally would, right? And if Sabrina Green asked him out, he would say yes. So if Maggie is basically Sabrina, and Sabrina thinks she\u2019s Ben, then surely Sabrina would agree to go out with Maggie. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaggie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was just thinking about something. What was the question?\u201d Ben asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think Ben will say yes if I ask him out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled. \u201cI cam confidently say that I believe Ben would love to date you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie smiled. \u201cHow\u2019s my makeup? Should I change clothes? I feel like I should change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMag- uh- Sabrina, calm down,\u201d Ben spoke softly, trying to think of what Maggie would say if she were herself. \u201cBen will like you no matter how you\u2019re dressed. But, if you\u2019re nervous about facing him, why don\u2019t you text him instead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t asking someone out through text kind of... i don\u2019t know... blah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you know. Like, meh. Like, really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... think I understand. But trust me. Ben won\u2019t care about that sort of thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d Maggie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well, he\u2019s a guy. You know?\u201d Ben tried. \u201cAnd besides, if you text me- uh- him, then I can be right here with you the whole time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie/Sabrina thought about Ben/Maggie\u2019s advice, and decided that she would ask Sabrina/Ben out...</span></div></div>",

He eventually stopped at what he thought was the right door, but he wasn\u2019t sure. He knocked anyway though, and surely enough, it was Yasmine who answered the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Sabrina. Is there something I can do for you?\u201d Yasmine asked politely in a thick Arabic accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m looking for a shirt,\u201d Ben lied. \u201cI can\u2019t remember who I loaned it to.

But what kind if shirt? Is it a tank top, or-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yeah, it\u2019s a tank top,\u201d Ben quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMacy, have you seen Sabrina\u2019s yellow tank top?\u201d Yasmine turned and called to her roommate. While her back was turned, Ben took the opportunity to use the remote, switching bodies with Yasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d came Macy\u2019s reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, we don\u2019t have it,\u201d Yasmine said to Ben, her accent now coming out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Have a great day,\u201d Ben said, smiling. His plan was coming along nicely. He decided that he would wear Yasmine\u2019s body for the day, tweaking it here and there to make her extra hot, then switch back with her later. Then, he would switch back to his own life and ask her out. It was perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen wondered where he should go to make his upgrades.</span></div></div>",

He decided to keep the flats on, since he wasn\u2019t quite ready to deal with the wide world of women\u2019s shoes. He then grabbed Sabrina\u2019s purse, made sure her phone and keys were inside, threw the remote in, and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen made his way downstairs and outside to Sabrina\u2019s car, then hopped in and headed for the beach. On the way there, he wondered how he could improve Yasmine\u2019s body. She was already attractive, but he figured a few changes here and there couldn\u2019t hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived at the beach, he looked around in Sabrina\u2019s car to see if there was a more practical bag he could use than a fancy white purse. Sure enough, he found a green drawstring backpack. He transferred Sabrina\u2019s phone, keys, and wallet into the bag, keeping the remote out so he could use it. Then he carefully hid the purse so no one would be tempted to break into the car, locked the doors, and headed for the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben walked down the beach, he kept his eyes open for anything he could steal to make Yasmine\u2019s body smokin\u2019 hot. He figured hair should be first. He spotted a few girls that would make for interesting choices, but he ended up settling on a girl who had a straight, blonde, shoulder length hairdo, dyed pink at the ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was boobs. It took a while, but Ben eventually found a woman with huge tits that pretty much matched Yasmine\u2019s skin tone. After that swap, every step Ben took made his new boobs bounce, which he enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Ben changed was Yasmine\u2019s voice. He overheard a woman who spoke with a very high pitched, breathy voice, like a cheerleader in a porno. He wondered what that voice would sound like with Yasmine\u2019s Arabic accent, so he took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy with the new haircut, chest, and voice he had picked out for Yasmine, Ben decided he was ready to head back.</span></div></div>",

Again, he saw Sabrina\u2019s underwear instead of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality must have changed to accommodate the new body that Ben sported below his neck. He immediately knew what he wanted to do. Stripping out of the clothes he currently wore, he intended to get dressed in something of Sabrina\u2019s, but he got distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had already played with his new breasts quite a bit, but it was the lower part of the body that now had his attention. He had a vagina. Sabrina\u2019s vagina. Slowly, carefully, Ben brought two manicured fingers down to feel it. He suddenly felt a wave of pleasure unlike anything he had ever felt before. He began to let out a moan, but covered his mouth, remembering that Eric was asleep only a few meters away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked back and forth between his new genitalia and his dresser, ultimately deciding to...</span></div></div>",

She just wanted to go to sleep. Maybe in the morning, this nightmare would be over. \u201cUh, sure,\u201d she answered timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve wanted to ask you for a while now, and it\u2019s a bit awkward. It involves your... um... well, your penis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay?\u201d Sabrina said, getting more nervous by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know that I think I might be bisexual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re the only girl I know with a penis. I want to try doing stuff with a girl, but I don\u2019t want to just jump right in, you know? I need a transition of some kind. Something in between boys and regular girls. You know, someone like... you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, um... are you asking to have sex with me?\u201d Sabrina asked, her mind no longer on the Ben situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot <i>sex</i> sex. But maybe just... let me suck it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina didn\u2019t know what to say.

Before long, it was up at attention, and Maggie began to put her lips on it. Sabrina closed her eyes, intending to keep them closed as Maggie did her work, but her curiosity again got the better of her. Sabrina opened her eyes and looked at her friend. She realized that Maggie wasn\u2019t getting the whole shaft. So, in a moment of lust-fueled autonomy, Sabrina grabbed Maggie by the back of her head, and forced her to deepthroat every inch of Ben\u2019s cock. In, and out, and in, and out. Sabrina made sure that her balls touched Maggie\u2019s chin with every thrust. When Sabrina finally reached her climax, she put <i>both</i> hands on Maggie\u2019s head to make sure she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they finished.

She had had sex before, but she had her own body at the time. But in this new reality, those other guys would remember her having Ben\u2019s body. So, did the boys remember doing it in the butt? Or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sabrina answered honestly, although she chuckled at the thought of some of her exes with a dick in their mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie then handed Sabrina a pair of Ben\u2019s sweatpants, which Sabrina changed into. Sabrina looked up and made eye contact with Maggie, then scooted over so there was room in her bed for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie smiled, turned out the light, then got in bed with Sabrina and pulled up the covers. \u201cThank you,\u201d Maggie whispered, kissing Sabrina on the cheek, before both girls fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho woke up first?</span></div></div>",

She cared about her hygiene, but she wasn\u2019t too keen on getting that personal with this body yet. She did, however, put on some deodorant and brush her hair before putting on a plain hoodie and jeans. The same white shoes from last night were the finishing touch, and she headed downstairs to see if Ben was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached Ben and Eric\u2019s room, she knocked on the door, and she was greeted by Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Eric.

He was still wearing the pink blouse and blue jeans that Sabrina had worn to the movies last night. He didn\u2019t see Eric, but he could hear water running, and he deduced that Eric must be in the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen took this opportunity to get dressed in a new outfit. He opened up his closet and saw several blouses, dresses, skirts, even a pant suit. He also saw a rack of women\u2019s shoes. Everything from flats, to heels, to tennis shoes, to sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen ultimately chose a frilly white blouse with purple and yellow flowers on it. He didn\u2019t change his bra, because he didn\u2019t want to waste time struggling with it, but he did change panties before pairing the blouse with a pair of purple pants that were just as tight as the jeans had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the selection of shoes, and went with a pair of white sandals. It was then that he noticed his toenails were painted white. He also noticed that his legs were not shaven. Apparently body grooming didn\u2019t fall into the clothing category, but he decided that if he wanted smooth legs, he would just use the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen struck a few poses in the mirror, laughing at himself, before heading out for the day, making sure to bring the white purse from last night with him. As he walked outside, he received a text message from Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Want to meet up for breakfast?</b> it read.</span></div></div>",

She stood up and slowly removed Ben\u2019s jeans, then his underwear. It worked. An ebony cock now hung between Sabrina\u2019s ivory legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a dick,\u201d she whispered, eyes wide, unable to look anywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand, Sabrina covered her mouth. With the other, she began to play with her new member. She poked it a few times, then she reached down to feel the testicles. She was taken by surprise when she began to get an erection. Slowly but surely, it got harder and harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe it\u2019s true what they say about black guys</i>, Sabrina thought. It was definitely bigger than that of anyone she had ever dated before. Even when she wrapped both hands around it, there was plenty of shaft left over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was so caught up in the moment that she had pretty much forgotten she wasn\u2019t alone. Eric turning over in his sleep quickly brought her back to reality. She wanted so badly to keep going, but she didn\u2019t want to risk making noises. She could easily just go in the bathroom and close the door, but even then, she feared the new experience might cause her to react loudly.</span></div></div>",

But I\u2019m not doing anything sexual with you. I mean, to me, you just look like Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina knew she had the power to change how she looked, but where would she find someone else to swap with at this hour?

It was late, after all. Nevertheless, she knocked again, much harder this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the door opened.

As she made her way back down to the first floor, she noted how different Deanna\u2019s body felt. Her strides were longer, and her boobs were much more bouncy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina made it back to Ben and Eric\u2019s room and headed in, not even bothering to knock.

As it started to harden, Eric quickly put on his protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two began to get more and more intimate, Eric\u2019s mind cleared.

She was dressed in a pair of khaki pants, a plain black hoodie, and black tennis shoes. When she finally saw Ben approaching her, she rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was wearing a tight turquoise sweater, a white pleated skirt, and the same pink flats she had worn last night. It didn\u2019t go together, but she figured he tried his best. What he didn\u2019t try to do at all, though, was makeup. He had clearly gone to sleep without removing any of the makeup he already had on, and hadn\u2019t bothered trying to fix it in the morning. That said, it looked fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe skirt was a brave choice,\u201d Sabrina remarked when Ben sat down. \u201cClose your legs when you sit, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen did as he was told. \u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t going to put on another pair of your tight-ass pants. And a skirt seemed like a better choice than a dress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair,\u201d Sabrina said. When she looked at Ben again, she noticed something else. \u201cBen, are you wearing a bra?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ben said, avoiding eye contact. \u201cToo much trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god. I\u2019m going to look like a total slut when we switch back,\u201d Sabrina sighed. \u201cWhat did Maggie say when you left looking like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. I left while she was in the shower. We didn\u2019t really talk last night either. She was too tired. What about you and Eric? Anything I should know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina hesitated. Should she tell Ben about her awkward encounter with Eric last night? He wouldn\u2019t be happy about it.</span></div></div>",

His gaze now shifted to his panties. More specifically, he was interested in what they covered up. Slowly, he reached one hand down inside and felt what was between his legs. A strange new sensation flowed through him. He was tempted to keep going, but he didn\u2019t really want to invade Sabrina\u2019s privacy like that. Instead, he turned off the lights, and went to bed, still wearing nothing but a bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, the pair decided to spend their day at...</span></div></div>",

She showed this to Ben and laid out the ground rules. \"Ok after we switch lives, body's and those traits we selected, we have to land a date with the others approval.

After that, Ben went for Yoga at the Campus gym, he was so excited to finally be in a women's locker room but when he got in he was really disappointed. The best way to describe the locker room to him was that it was just uneventful and when he looked at the topless girls all he could think of was that <i>Those are breasts</i>. Nothing more, nothing less. After Yoga, (which with Sabrina's Yoga ability he felt he was really good at), He texted Sabrina that he wouldn't mind dating Yasmine or Macy. Then he went to her dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw that Maggie was out and he got into Sabrina's bed. While in bed he took off Sabrina's bra which felt so good for him. After which he started rubbing his breasts, and found himself doing little moans while working himself up. After awhile he felt a dampness in between his legs, and he started playing with his clit. Eventually his mind wondered off and thought about Chris Evans and how good he looked in those Captain America movies, to which he climaxed to.<i> I'm Definitely straight in this body</i> Ben thought.

First Ben had to do Sabrina's hair, in order to get a guy like Devin or Booker to date Sabrina. First he took a shower and knew exactly how to take care of women's hair, using the right shampoo and conditioner for the style he was going for, which really excited him. Then he did curls in Sabrina's blonde hair until he got the hair just how he liked it. After, he looked at his hair in the mirror liking the results (not doing too much, but doing just enough to show he cared about appearances). He noticed small imperfections relating to his pores on his (technically Sabrina's) face, which he wouldn't have noticed if it hadn't been for the knowledge switches Sabrina made. Afterwards he expertly put on makeup which shocked and amazed him all at the same time. Then finally, Ben dug through Sabrina's closet and found a dress that showed off currently his best asset, Sabrina's breasts. Ben was also lucky enough to find a pair of heels to match the outfit, and took a few practice steps, amazed at how easy this was to him. Then Maggie stepped into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen could look at her and tell she had been at the salon getting her nails and hair done because they looked amazing. Maggie also had a dress in a bag she brought in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG Sabrina, you look amazing, you\u2019re totally going to nail it out of the park tonight, I'm glad you took my advice on your hair, curls are perfect for you\". Said Maggie as she was headed over to her mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, thanks, I\u2019m going for something new tonight\" Ben replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you going to take my other advice tonight and make your move on Ben tonight?\" Maggie replied. Ben was surprised by this as he had not realized that Sabrina was trying to hook up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no, actually I'm going to go after Booker or Devin tonight\" Ben replied truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww Ben's lost\" Maggie stated. \"Hey, incase you get any of those guys and need a place tonight, just text me and I'll rent a hotel room for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, thanks\" Ben replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Maggie and Ben were both going to the party, they just gossiped amongst each other, it was fun for Ben to be apart of girl talk, in which he talked about boys and makeup (something he was glad to be knowledgeable of and be able to contribute to). As Maggie ordered the Uber, Ben put the remote in his purse and left to go out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did the party go?</span></div></div>",

He even had a boy try to flirt with him, Ben had to turn him down gently but it was a good start. <i>If I'm getting guys interested in me this early, then Devin and Booker would have to be interested in me later.</i> Ben thought. Ben quickly figured out that Devin was talking to Deanna, and Booker was with his group of friends. Ben was hoping to talk to Devin after Deanna stopped talking to him, and if that didn't happen then he hoped he could join into Booker\u2019s group of friends organically. Ben then noticed his body come in and was off in the corner, while Yasmine was dancing alone. Ben thought he would throw Sabrina a bone while he waited for his opportunity with Devin and Booker. Ben took two shots like he normally does to get a buzz going then he hit the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Ben didn't realize is that two shots for Sabrina's body gets her a little drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Yasmine danced on the dance floor and over the music yelled to Yasmine, \"Hey Ben's looking at you, you two should definitely date\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you had a thing for Ben? Are you sure you're cool with it?\" Yasmine yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, totally have fun\" and with that Yasmine walked over to Sabrina in the corner and started a conversation, after which Ben got two victory shots for himself (or herself for the time being) and downed them. Normally this would get him to a comfortable level of drunk in his regular body, but now he was really feeling intoxicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse yet, he saw Deanna and Devin making out and Booker not even around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then asked Maggie where Booker was and was informed that Booker left for another party, and then Maggie caught Ben looking at Devin and Deanna making out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sabrina, you would have to look like that cheerleader Selina to make Devin give up Deanna tonight\" Maggie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen quickly looked at the remote in his purse.</span></div></div>",

She wasn\u2019t terribly interested in having big muscles, but she did like to run on the treadmill. She also liked playing basketball, and she wasn\u2019t afraid of lifting weights every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, no, that wasn\u2019t right. Sabrina never used the treadmill. She liked to jog outside. Jogging... and volleyball... and yoga. Those were things she remembered doing, but for some reason, she didn\u2019t want to do those things anymore. Now she wanted to use the treadmill, play basketball, and lift weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ben arrived. He was wearing a muscle shirt, a drawstring backpack, Nike shoes, and an old pair of high school gym shorts that he hadn\u2019t worn in a while because of how short they were. Sabrina also noticed that Ben had already begun to work up a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, have you been working out already?\u201d she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I jogged here,\u201d Ben answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never jog,\u201d Sabrina said, beginning to put the pieces together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! But for some reason, it\u2019s what I wanted to do. And I think I know why. It\u2019s the remote,\u201d Ben said quietly, patting the bag on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think it worked,\u201d Sabrina inferred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do,\u201d said Ben, \u201cI think we switched personalities, and I think we should switch back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... what if I don\u2019t want a girly personality?\u201d Sabrina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t want to go back to normal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that this could be the <i>new</i> normal.
