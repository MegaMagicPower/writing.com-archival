It might have been when he lost the puppy fat around his face, maybe when his muscles became more defined. If Sasuke had to guess though, it would be last week when he watched the blonde gorge himself, the massively stuffed boy's stomach protruding outwards, rising his jacket up towards his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That', the raven-haired teen thought, 'that gut I want to be a permanent fixture... Just softer.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why the two of them were currently found at the barbeque, the blonde happily stuffing his face while Sasuke filled up the blonde's grill with more and more meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Sasuke wanted to make Naruto's gut a permanent part of the blonde, then he would need to try and keep the blonde as stuffed as possible for as long as possible each day. He didn't expect Naruto's filled-to-the-brim stomach to stop the blond from exercising. Maybe though, maybe the massive influx of food would override Naruto's quite tough training, so hopefully it would soften the blonde up, bit by bit, pound by pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had far to much money anyway, so he had nothing against throwing a ton of money at food for the younger boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burp left Naruto as he finished his current serving, his hand resting on his bloated stomach, a blissful expression on his whiskered face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You full?\" Sasuke asked, sending a teasing smirk at the resting teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his stomach, he sent a smirk back at the raven, smacking the barely covered gut. \"Ya kidding? I can stuff myself way past this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke had to hide his happy smile at that as he went towards the counter for more food, and in his minds eye, a slowly fattening Naruto growing bigger and bigger.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week later we find the duo back at the barbeque restaurant, Sasuke enjoying what has become a quite common view for him as he stared at the blonde who stuffed his face enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been surprisingly easy to keep the teen constantly filled to the brim, Sasuke having underestimated just how much Naruto liked to stuff his face. Not that Sasuke was complaining, enjoying the round globe he could watch wobble around every day. Ending each day with a trip to Ichiraku was a stroke of genius Sasuke found out, the blonde going into overdrive when he had basically unlimited amounts of his favorite ramen to gorge on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had tried to pay for at least some of the food Sasuke was showering him in, but the Uchiha quickly managed to convince the whiskered boy that he had absolutely no problem with paying for any food the blonde ate, saying he could probably pay for the village's food bill for an entire year before he had to stop. Naruto's lone gluttony was basically nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had decided to take Naruto to the bath house the previous day before breakfast. He didn't expect to see any difference in the teen quite yet, and he seemed to be correct in his assumptions... That is, until the blonde sat down, and his stomach bunched up slightly, showing a layer of flesh that he had completely overlooked. He could barely keep himself from staring at it, though he couldn't help but glancing at it. Thankfully, Naruto seemed to have completely missed the repeated looks sent towards his slowly softening midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to stop himself from drooling at the end of yesterday's ramen gorge, the blonde so stuffed he was delirious, and the button on his pants oh so close to bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, that hit the spot.\" Naruto moaned as he caressed his bloated stomach, the stuffed gut pressing harshly against the T-shirt he was wearing, though not making it rise up just yet. That, Sasuke knew, would slowly change as the day progressed. He couldn't wait for the day Naruto's T-shirt was constantly stressed due to fat, love-handles, chest-fat, back-fat and gut basically making him burst out of it, though a food-filled gut would tide him over for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems to have filled you up good.\" And it was true, the plates was stacked pretty high, a bunch of different meat having disappeared into the gaping maw of the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" The blonde hummed as he massaged his stomach, reaching underneath his T-shirt to do so. \"I guess I can have another round or two.\" He mumbled in contentment, breaking Sasuke's mesmerized stare at the tanned stomach. \"Maybe we can take a trip to your house afterwards, letting this digest.\" He ended, smacking the stuffed mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something that had surprised him about Naruto in his full state. They had, basically after every meal, taken a break somewhere for Naruto to rest, the thought about training seemingly having left the blonde's mind as his hunger was constantly satisfied. Of course, even when Naruto rested, Sasuke still had a snack or two close by, the younger teen happily munching it down despite his tight-fitted stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven put the meat on the grill, listening to Naruto talk as he day-dreamed about a bigger Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he could speed it up...</span></div></div>",

Plus, with the cooks having free reign over Naruto's food, it would hopefully taste even better, which in turn would make the blonde eat even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes,' he thought as he meet up with Naruto.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><u>Week one</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud burp resounded throughout the Ichiraku ramen stand, followed with the booming laughter of the ramen chef as the originator of the burp was far too full to even think about blushing at the far too loud sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that's the sound of a satisfied customer!\u201d Teuchi chortled as he moved the large stack of bowls, leaving the massively bloated blonde alone with the staring Uchiha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke couldn't stop himself from staring at Naruto, the boy's stomach so large, and the waist of the pants so tight that his eyes were constantly drawn towards the tanned mass of flesh that was slowly pushing in and out as the blonde took long-but-small breaths as he cradled his overfilled gut, the teen's eyes closed in a combination of bliss and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the heat in his stomach roaring throughout his body, he still noticed the small flashes of pain that coursed through Naruto's face. Flicking his eyes downwards, he noticed the culprit: The heroic button that was doing its best to keep the pants in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing in Naruto's stomach a bit (Earning a disgruntled groan from the blonde) he quickly un-buttoned the orange pants, Naruto's gut falling forward a bit more than before, sending another rush of heat through Sasuke's body. Looking back at the whiskered teen's face, he couldn't help but smile a bit as the slightly pained look was exchanged with an euphoric expression, a relieved sigh leaving the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being able to help himself, he softly let his hand rub across the smooth surface, a happy moan leaving the delirious blonde at the motion. So firm, yet with the slightest softness to it, earning a happy sparkle in the Uchiha's black eyes as Naruto's new diet seemed to have started doing its job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying the feeling of the bloated smooth skin underneath his palm for a few more minutes, he finally pulled his hand back, another groan leaving the blonde at that, though Sasuke couldn't really tell if it was a happy or sad groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Naruto, time to get you home.\u201d Sasuke sighed as he stood up from his seat. After throwing a small bundle of money on the table before them, he put his arm under the blonde's shoulders, and after a bit of struggle they managed to get Naruto standing. (Understandable really, with that massive gut the blonde was sporting)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they half-waddled back to Naruto's apartment, Sasuke couldn't help but have his hand run along the blonde's side, enjoying the new softness there that was lacking before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Week two</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, I can't believe Kiba gave up that quickly. I ate like five more plates than him!\u201d Naruto bragged as he laid on the grass, grinning and rubbing his stomach in satisfaction at his victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he's not as big of a glutton as you are.\u201d Sasuke teased back, quite enjoying the view of the blonde massaging his stomach, the mass of flesh becoming more malleable and a more permanent feature for each day. The chuckle leaving the blonde made the gut wobble, enrapturing the raven even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, yeah maybe.\u201d A satisfied sigh left the blonde as he put both hands behind his head, his T-shirt riding higher on his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never seen Naruto and Kiba duke it out over a food filled table before, but he had heard the stories. He had thought the two of them would be evenly matched, so it was with some surprise when Naruto plowed right over Kiba, the dog-nin staring at the blonde in shock as the teen continued on after Kiba threw in the towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke watched Kiba glance at the beginning love-handles the blonde had, the new flesh having started to make his usual black T-shirts pretty snug on the blonde even when his stomach was empty, and Sasuke wondered how the dog-loving teen would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo Sasuke happiness, he watched the brown-haired teen's eyes harden in determination, the boy sizing up Naruto properly, apparently getting ready for some gut-busting training to catch up with the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke watched the blonde nap, and he couldn't help but feel satisfied. Hopefully, with Kiba and Naruto's competetive nature, the dog-nin would unknowingly help Sasuke in chubbing up the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Week three</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo froze where they sat at the sound of something snapping, rapidly being followed by something small hitting the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red face the blonde sported, and the expansion of his bloated gut told Sasuke everything he needed to know, and he could feel himself tremble faintly on the spot at the mere fact that Naruto had just busted his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto himself was edging between being embarassed due to basically outgrowing his pants like that in public, and some sort of pride at being able to munch down on enough food to bust the pants in the first place. The thought that his clothes was already pretty tight before he started his breakfast was niggling at the back of his mind, but it was quickly pushed aside at his current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even during his most intense glutting had he ever done anything like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Sasuke, his embarassment basically died at the look Sasuke sent his midriff. He had almost never seen the raven so excited before, and the fact that it was himself that made the Uchiha like this basically made the blonde swell in glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smacked his stomach with a grin, ignoring the jiggling most of his torso did at the hit. \u201cHeh, guess this tanks starting to get a life of it's own, ehh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking out of his stupor, Sasuke shook his head to clear his mind before meeting the blonde's eyes, a pretty happy smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, seems like it... I'm not really complaining though.\u201d His eyes raked over the other teen's body, taking in the almost skin-tight T-shirt. It could barely cover the teen when they meet that day, and now it had risen up, exposing a good amount of his torso. The blonde's love-handles basically grabbable, and his chest having softened from its usual hardness just made things even better. Even the pants were still pretty tight, due to the teens thickening hips, legs and butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven his face had softened, loosing some of the sharpness to it, and a double-chin forming whenever the blonde looked downwards. There were even a hint of it even when the blonde was staring straight ahead, something which Sasuke found himself more and more enamored by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Naruto was looking pretty good to Sasuke's eyes... He could still be bigger though. He hadn't busted out of any off his shirts after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed the plate filled with different kind of sushi towards his weighty friend, his smirk widening at the hungry look he sent the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're not done yet, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde picking up the chopsticks and resuming his stuffing told Sasuke everything he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Week four</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA creak left the bed as Naruto sat down with a sigh, his hands moving to his exposed stomach, rubbing the hefty gut in a soothing manner. His T-shirt was unbearably tight after everything he'd stuffed himself with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday had been a good day, the growing teen decided. Breakfast at Sasuke's place, where he was served pancakes until he almost got sick which was followed by a nap on the raven's couch, the teen having been gracious enough to lend it to the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch he and Sasuke had met up with Kiba at the barbeque place, where they got into another one of their eating competitions, which led to another victory to the blonde. The dog-nin seemed to have worked hard on his eating though, the blonde noticed, as he managed to keep up with Naruto for longer than expected. Naruto could even spot, after their great meal, the start of love-handles on the tattoed boy, his waist having been exposed due to his great gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two gorged teens were basically stuck where they sat though, their overfilled stomachs basically keeping them in place, so they had talked for a while, catching up on the going-ons... Well, it had mostly been the two of them teasingly ribbing each other while Sasuke brought them a large amount of ice-cream, the frozen treats more than enough to keep the two of them filled up, though not enough to keep them stuffed for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why Naruto's gut, while still feeling pretty filled and full, groaned in hunger that night, which is the signal that the competetive teens needed to split up for the day, Kiba trudging towards his home while Sasuke and an almost waddling Naruto found themselves at the ramen stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was glad that he had chosen a stretchy pair of pants that day, as he had no doubt that any of his buttoned pants would have burst even before the ramen gorge. Heck, he had even had problems getting them on at all lately, which is really the reason as to why he had gone for stretchy pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that these pants were much better, at least around his tights the blonde mused, feeling how they stretched around his legs. A part of him had actually been a bit worried they would split when he waddled home, Sasuke supporting him a bit as his gut was probably the biggest it had ever been, due to all the eating he had done that day... Not that it lessened any with the bag of buns the raven had bought, the blonde somehow managing to find room to munch them down before getting home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Guess it's time to hit the bed.' He mused to himself before stretching. At it's peak, a rip was heard, and he could feel one of his sides hit the air more than before. Lowering his arms, he heard his T-shirt rip some more, and a blush stained his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he just...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYanking off the tight material, he stared at the rip in disbelief. He broke his shirt. Staring at the hefty gut, somewhat chunky chest and pretty big love-handles told him everything he needed to know really. Not that his legs were any better, pushing as harshly as they did against his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat there for a moment, thinking, before a yawn left him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd worry about this tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

The lower part of the soft mass jiggling free from the constraining material, having started to obscure his feet somewhat, and part of his lovehandles were also seeing the light of day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to stop himself from giggling though, as he kinda looked like someone had stuffed a soccer ball down his throat. A small part of him had to admire that he managed to eat himself way bigger yesterday to bust that shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pants were thankfully not as bad, if only due to the stretchy waist. Despite how large his butt had grown, and how snug the seat of his pants felt across his expanded waistline, it still had enough stretch in it that Naruto could with confidence say that they wouldn't rip... At least not yet. His legs were another matter entirely, though he had nothing else to wear, so he had to accept that he looked a bit like an overstuffed sausage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with a huff that Naruto opened his door that morning, Sasuke standing there mid knock, the raven raising an eye-brow at the irated chunkster before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's up with you this morning?\u201d He couldn't help but ask, though the tight attire that the blonde wore told him everything he needed to know. (The soft, round, uncovered mid-riff and the tight pants stretched across his growing booty sending an appreciative shiver down his spine)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my problem.\u201d He smacked his gut, the reserved teen's cool fraying slightly at the small tremors sent throughout the fat teen's torso, every single jiggle visible due to his tight clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManaging to collect himself, he gave the blonde his best deadpan stare, sending as much apathy as possible towards Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean the weight? Really, why does that matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause... Because it does! And none my clothes fit me right anymore, I mean, look at this!\u201d Grabbing his protruding belly, he gave it a shake, Sasuke twitching as the malleable mass swayed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm.\u201d Rolling his eyes, his deadpan stare increased in strength. \u201cBe honest with me, is it the fat, or the clothes that is the actual problem here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d The chunky ninja hesistated for a moment, contemplation appearing on his face. \u201cIt IS mostly the clothes, I'm not exactly made of money, and getting a whole new wardrobe ain't exactly cheap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I am completely willing to help with that.\u201d Here, the Uchiha draped one of his arms around the slightly shorter boy's shoulders, leading him through the village in search of a clothing shop the raven found fitting, while at the same time enjoying the softness the blonde sported. \u201cAnd really, when has being fat ever actually slowed a ninja down any? There's a bunch of pretty huge ninja's out there that is strong AND fast. I mean, while I will say that I am a lot faster than Chouji, he could outrun most of the newbie jounins in the village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you're right.\u201d Our fat hero agreed, knowing that with Chakra, even the fattest of people could do everything a skinny ninja could... With certain mobility limits of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, hold on!\u201d He stopped abruptly, forcing Sasuke to stop with him. \u201cWhat do you mean you'll 'Help me with my clothes'?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sharingan wielder stared at his fat friend, an eyebrow raised. \u201cIt's exactly what it sounds like. I'll help you find new clothes, and I'll pay for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gaped at the other teen, warring between indignity and happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you're already paying for the food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?

Obviously, his eyes drifted towards his standard orange clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did I even ask.\u201d The raven asked, earning a shrug and a smirk from the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, orange is great, okay.\u201d At that he trudged over to the jacket-pants combo, Sasuke following along, enjoying the rear-view he was getting while also taking note of where the blonde's customary black T-shirts were located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the blonde contemplate the sizes, he couldn't help but let out another sigh. \u201cYou've got no idea how big you are, do you?\u201d Naruto's sheepish grin told him everything he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight then.\u201d Grabbing the excitable boy, while also borrowing a measuring tape from a passing employee, he dragged the stumbling teen towards the changing rooms, pushing him in before entering himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShirt and pants off.\u201d He ordered, already unfurling the tape, Naruto staring at him for a moment before shrugging. Sasuke couldn't help but suck in a silent breath as he stared at the undressing blonde, for the first time getting a proper look at the round gut the other teen was sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how he was struggling with his pants, he smacked away the rotund blonde's fumbling hands before getting a decent grip on the tight material, and with a couple of hard tugs he got them down the chubby boy's legs, Naruto kicking them off afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping almost flush to the shorter teen, he draped the tape around the waist, dragging his hands over the fleshy sides, the fat giving away to his touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So soft.' He mused, rubbing the almost pillow-like flesh. Taking a hold of them he gave them a jiggle, sending a ripple through the torso, almost as if the teen was filled with jello, earning a snort from the blonde that had directed his face towards the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, Sasuke?\u201d The teen giggled, raising his arms behind his head to give Sasuke a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, it's interesting.\u201d He could admit that much to the blonde at least. Giving them another rub and squeeze, he finally dragged his hands to the front of the tanned teen. \u201cMaybe I should use you as my personal buddah.\u201d Another giggle left the almost naked teen, Sasuke giving the gut a rub in demonstration. Pushing in on it, he was surprised that while it was soft, it had a surprising firmness to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving it a pat, he finally got back to work. He fully encircled the teen with the tape, and as he took a look at the number, he had to admit that he expected it to be a bit higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d Our chubby hero asked, feeling the tape being removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously you need larger shirts.\u201d He muttered, his fingers poking the soft flesh on the teen's chest. His fingers didn't go that deep. Really, it was simply that his pecks had disappeared under a layer of flesh. Not enough to really call them man boobs yet, though undoubtedly infinitely softer than his previously hard pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really like feeling me up, don't you.\u201d It wasn't really a question, a teasing smirk sent towards the raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI probably wouldn't do this with anyone else. I trust you enough to know I won't freak you out.\u201d With that, he measured the chest, ignoring the blinding smile the blonde sent him at his admittance. Hey, he could be nice if he wanted to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurn around.\u201d He muttered, tapping the teen's fleshy side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting down on his knees, he encircled the teens hips, his eyes constantly dipping down to the ill-fitting underwear, roving over the expanded butt Naruto had attained. Really, it wasn't all that big, though it was definitely much softer and more shapely than the flat bottom Naruto had before. Not being able to hold himself, he took a hold of one of the cheeks and squeezed, sending Naruto into another giggle-fit, the blonde kicking Sasuke's leg a bit, though not really stopping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've grown bigger everywhere, haven't you.\u201d He finally managed to utter, glancing at the number before going down to the legs, feeling a bit disappointed that they weren't chunkier... Nothing that couldn't be fixed with some time and a lot of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say, all that food had to go somewhere, ya know.\u201d He shook his butt a bit, the Uchiha's eyes basically glued on the blonde's ass. He turned around as Sasuke removed the tape from his leg, sending the taller boy a look that said 'what now?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously you need a few sizes bigger in everything, and we should probably pick up clothes a few sizes bigger than that if we're going to continue feeding you as much as we have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d Rubbing his stomach, a hungry growl left the mass of flesh, a sheepish grin breaking out across his face. \u201cOkay, I gotta admit that I have really enjoyed our time together. That, coupled with all the food and the occasional get-together with Kiba has kinda made these last few weeks really great. And hey,\u201d He smacked his stomach, his grin growing more confident. \u201cIf me getting fatter is the side-effect of our time together, then that's a-okay with me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should definitely get you some sizes bigger than what you need now. Wait here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the Uchiha to throw over bigger clothes for the blonde, and he had to admit that it felt great to finally wear something that fit properly again. As he got dressed again, he could hear the fire user lug a bunch of stuff over to the clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the dressing room, he barely managed to catch the scroll that was thrown at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn there you got several sets of your orange suit, along with T-shirt in the size you're currently wearing, and in this-\u201d Sasuke handed Naruto another scroll. \u201cYou got a few more sets at a larger size, just in case.\u201d Here he patted the blonde's covered gut, smirking all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, thanks for all this, ya rich jerk. Now, I really need to get some grub in my belly!\u201d Sasuke barely repressed a chuckle at the dreamy looks the blonde sported, the chubby boy barely managing to keep from drooling. A lightbulb went on inside Sasuke's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I saw Kiba walk to the steak-house. Want to join up with him?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A groan was heard from the bed of a certain demon-container, the sun hitting him in the face, forcing his mind into conciousness. Cracking an eye open, he glared towards the offending sphere of light before throwing an arm over his eyes, deciding to bask in the post-sleep drowsiness for another minute before having to face the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that this day would be any more difficult than any other day he had gone through recently.The blonde had to admit, the last few weeks had been pretty dang amazing and fulfilling. (In more ways than one)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging out so much with Sasuke was an added bonus to it all, and Naruto had to admit he was pretty happy that their relationship seemed to have grown to an all-new high this last month. Not that it was bad before, it was really only at the start of their genin days that they barely could tolerate the sight of each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it was all of the food he had gorged on. And it was all free, courtesy of Sasuke! Naruto could barely keep himself from drooling as he finally left the bed, the thought of food floating through his mind. He stretched as tall as he was before a content sigh left him as he relaxed, his hand smacking his flat abdo-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused for a moment. Something felt off. He gave his stomach another pat, feeling it give under his palm. His stomach felt a lot less firm, and a lot more bloated than he was used to. Taking a peek down, he came face to gut with... Well, a gut. He blinked for a bit, mildly confused at the somewhat malleable mass that used to be a pretty trim stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to admit that he was a bit curious about it, so he trudged towards the mirror to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" Naruto mumbled as he stared at himself in the mirror, rubbing the soft mass. \"That's new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't all that big really, not on the level of Chouji or Teuchi Ichiraku. Barely a potbelly if anything. It was there though, and while it was soft, it still had a certain firmness to it. He played with the thought of himself simply being bloated from the day before. (Barely stopping himself from drooling again at the thought of all the ramen he ate yesterday.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not it though, as he felt the beginning pangs of hunger slowly entering his mind. His gut agreed, emitting an audible grumble at its current non-stuffed state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving his new addition another rub, he took an inquisitive look at the rest of himself. Rubbing his sides, he felt that yes, there was definitely more flesh there, he couldn't really grab any of it though, so it didn't really worry him at all. His chest was a bit less defined, and a bit softer to the touch, but nothing really noteworthy. Arms and legs had another extra layer of flesh on them, same with his hips, though all it really did was give him a slightly wider look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving his face a scrutinizing look, he tried to see any visible changes. It might be a tiny bit softer, though he couldn't really tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave his body another look before shrugging, starting his morning routine, banishing any thoughts about his body from his head. It was nothing to worry about. There was a lot of ninja's out there that was pretty damn rotund. Heck, Chouji's entire clan all varied from pretty chubby to huge, and they were all kickass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, some extra pounds basically just gave him the excuse he needed to continue eating out with Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just finished his morning wash when a knock was heard on his door, the Uchiha's familiar voice piercing through the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One moment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at the two orange pants in front of him, the two of them basically identical to anyone but the blonde. Should he go with the buttoned-up pants, or the stretchy sweat-pants...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother growl left his stomach, basically making the choice for him as he dropped the buttoned pants. Stretchy it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing on one of his black T-shirts, (Which he noticed was a tighter fit than expected) he threw open his front door before almost bolting out, basically dragging Sasuke with him as he strided through the streets, missing the appreciative looks the raven-head sent him, and ignoring the complaints that was thrown at him from his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Sasuke was all that miffed, seeing as this was a pretty normal occurence, the whole being-dragged-somewhere-else thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked around, his mind going over the alternatives before his gut gave another growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted something filling today...</span></div></div>",

Instead a piece of chocolate cake was shoved into his mouth.

That's all.  Now please enjoy.\"  Sasuke told him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke took another scoop of the cake and forced Naruto's lips open.  It was hard because Naruto had nearly bit down through his lip to keep the food from entering, but since his arms were tied securely in chains there wasn't much he could do.  The piece eventually made it's way in and Sasuke held his mouth shut until he saw the food gulped down.  Naruto glared at him in anger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It taste good doesn't it?  Why don't yo cooperate?  It will be much more enjoyable.\"  Sasuke tried to coax his teammate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourteen year old spat at him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke sighed and reached for the cake again. He forced the rest of the cake down the blondes throat and grimaced as a finger was bit.  He really wished Naruto would just relax and eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t eat peacefully I\u2019m gonna have to put you on the tube.\u201d  Sasuke insisted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just glared angrily back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing Sasuke took out a tube and began the tedious trial of getting it all the way down Naruto\u2019s throat.  It took nearly an hour but eventually the deed was done.  Henged Sasuke attempted to smile reassuringly at the blonde but it was obvious Naruto wouldn\u2019t be warming up to this idea any time soon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke took a blender out and liquefied all the pasteries he had set out.  Shoving it into the tube he watched as it began to slide down and into Naruto\u2019s mouth.   Sasuke looked at the time.  He\u2019d leave it in for an hour or so\u2026 that would be safe.  Then he\u2019d try the hand feeding again tomorrow morning.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lifting the tray up and placing it on the bed in front of the blonde Sasuke looked towards Naruto with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful stuffed french toast!\"  Sasuke declared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grimaced, but didn't fight Sasuke as he cut the pieces and placed them in the blondes mouth.  Sasuke coud barely stop the grin that was threatening his face as he watched Naruto eat the food he fed him.  After three pieces Sasuke changed it up a bit and started feeding him eggs and sausages.  Naruto gave him a pleading look and a shake of his head after the fifth heavily decked french toast piece but Sasuke thought he could get a little more in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more french toast and a little egg.\"  Sasuke declared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, green in the face and slightly gagging, nodded weary consent.  Sasuke watched in enjoyment as the piecce made it's way down the blondes throat and into his large bloated stomach.  Halfway through the last french toast Sasuke lifted Naruto's jacket and shirt and undid Naruto's pants for him.  The blonde let out a grateful sigh as teh bloated stone like stomach leaned forward the tiniest bit.  Sasuke picked the fork back up and shoved a large bite into Naruto's mouth.  Naruto was breathing hard now and Sasuke would not lie about the fact that it aroused him a bit.  Fighitng back teh urge to continue forcing food into Naruto past their agreement Sasuke got the last of his enjoyment by taking all the eggs left and shoving them into the open mouth.   </span></div></div>",

The digit was bleeding profusely and Sasuke was severely irritated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Naruto was being fed through the tube again.  Vegetables this time.  A lot of them.  And this time he watched as Naruto squirmed against the tube running down his throat and the chains around his body.  Sasuke sighed dissapointedly as he realized Naruto still wasn't showing much, but in his midsection, which was covered by the chains.  He would have to wait longer before Naruto wouldn't be able to move.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow he wished he was the one hand feeding Naruto, but it couldn't be helped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourty five minutes past before Sasuke felt safe to take the chains off.  When they were removed Naruto tried ripping out the tube, but Sasuke held it firmly there.  Naruto's large bloated stomach moved up and done in a fast rythym as it was trying to handle the massive amount of food being forced into it.  Naruto moaned in pain as the jacket tightened unpleasantly against his stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He can take more..' Sasuke thought to himself.  'Kyuubi will make sure of it.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto weakly pushed against his hands, but Sasuke would not be disswayed.  Sasuke could see the area of Naruto's pants that was unbuttoned was yet again pushing against his skin.  Sasuke delighted in the mound of flesh and was excited as the jacket strained.  The last of the liquified food dripped through the tube... more than he'd been forced to eat so far.  Sasuke smiled down as Naruto nearly cried in relief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this will be a lesson to you.  You will eat whatever I give you.\"  Sasuke said calmly despite his excitement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto could handle more than he thought and probably go even further because of the demon inside of him.  The roundness would make his crush look absolutely perfect.  Once Naruto fell asleep Sasuke went out to pick up more food.  Naruto wouldn't be able to move in his condition so there was no real point in putting the chains back on.  Once inside the room again he set up the food for in the morning and he too got some shut eye.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto had finally started filling out.  His pants were no longer loose on his frame, though they weren't uncomfortable yet.  His large t-shirt hid his slightly enlarge stomach and the small layer of fat on his body well.  And then on top of that the jacket covered his arms.  The overly large clothes both excited and irritated him.  Exicited him because Sasuke would be able to watch Naruto literally bursting out of his clothes but irritated him because they hid the weight he'd gained so far.  Patients was not a virtue the Uchiha preached.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday he was going to put Naruto to the test on exactly how much he could handle.  Hands chained behind his back so that Sasuke could have full view of Naruto's enlarging stomach under the jacket and chained to the bedpost behind him.  Sasuke WOULD hand feed Naruto for this test no matter how many fingers got bitten.  Sasuke brought in a heavily iced chocolate sheet cake.  Setting the entire thing down beside him and Naruto before turning to the blonde.  Naruto looked wearily toward the cake.  Sasuke had refrained from mentioning the test to him.  As far as Naruto knew this was a normal feeding.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnforunately he'd been forced to tube feed two other times that Naruto fought, but the good the was, was that Naruto headn't fought the last few times.  Sasuke stuck a fork in the cake and put it into Naruto's open mouth.  Naruto looked resigned as he chewed and swallowed.  Bite after bite he shovedled food into Naruto's mouth and watch the blonde carefully.  Naruto didn't even slow down until Sasuke got about six average sized pieces into the sheet (two feet by one foot) cake.  Sasuke took turns, slowing pouring a fattening concoction of juice to wash it down with, to shoveling cake into the blondes lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the eighth piece Naruto began to struggle.  He looked at Sasuke's henged form carefully, searching for signs that he was going to let up.  Sasuke showed no sign of that though because he had no intention of it.  Sasuke watched as Naruto's stomach once again bloated out as he fed Naruto more and more cake.  On the ninth piece Naruto glared angrily at his dark captor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough. I can't go any further.\"  Naruto said hoarsely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke simply smirked and took advantage of Naruto's open mouth.  Shoveling an especially large bite into Naruto's mouth and keeping his hand tightly over it to stop any resistance.  Naruto glared halfheartedly at him.  Too sick to his stomach to put up much of a fight.  But he kept the food in his mouth for nearly five minutes before swallowing, only doing so when Sasuke covered his nose and he coudlnt' breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke scooped up another large bite and tried forcing it through Naruto's tightly closed lips.  He put his other hand around Naruto's throat and began squeezing.  When Naruto gasped Sasuke waited until air entered the blondes throat before pushing the bite into Naruto's mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooperate.\"  Sasuke repeated for the hundreth time.  For the hundreth time Naruto gave him a glare that clearly said 'fuck u!'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke laughed and continued.  Halfway through the cake and Sasuke still couldn't feel Kyuubi's chakra coming yet.  The jacket was badly strained and Sasuke had been forced to undo Naruto's pants again.  Sasuke tugged slightly at Naruto's hair to lift his head up and forced struggling lips to part before pouring his fattening juice down Naruto's throat.  The blonde tried turning away from it but Sasuke's hold was Strong and Naruto's ability to fight back weak.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the empty cup back onto the table Sasuke couldnt' help the shiver of arousal fill him at the sight of Naruto's extremely bloated and stone hard belly.  And Kyuubi still hadn't interfered yet!  Sasuke dug the fork into the cake again and came up with another generous piece.  Naruto was hazy eyed as he, to Sasuke's surprise, opened up his mouth with a painful sigh.  Sasuke grinned and put the food in.  Naruto chewed and swallowed.  Leaning forward against the chains Naruto fidgetted against his ever tightening clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree more bites of food and Sasuke felt it.  Kyuubi's chakra.  As Sasuke shoveled in even more bites of food he paid very close attention to how much demonic chakra was running through Naruto's body.  Despite the fact that Sasuke was shoveleing more cake into Naruto's mouth the blonde's face was easing of tension instead of increasing.  He coudl literally see Naruto's stomach lean forward more as Kyuubi apparently healed and stretched the organ.  How big could he make Naruto in this one settting if Kyuubi was not only healing but enlarging Naruto to meet the need?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked at Naruto's relaxing face and made a decision.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke left quickly to pick up more deserts and his special liquid.  Naruto hardly noticed.  His eyeslids were already closing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took an hour and a half to buy what he needed and got back.  Gently he shook Naruto awake.  Still half asleep the blonde simply opened his mouth.  Sasuke smiled widely.  Picking a pie out he began to feed Naruto the treat.  Then cookies and brownies.  The zipper was forced open slightly on Naruto's jacket and the boy grimaced slightly.  Sasuke picked up another brownie and hurriedly shoved it into Naruto's mouth.  The blonde seemed immensely unaware to him, probably due to Kyuubi's healing, as he put more and more food into the blondes mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo full batches of strudals and the zipper on Naruto's jacket ripped open further.  Seven inches of Naruto's stretched shirt shown through.  The blondes pants strained uncomfortably on him.  Sasuke smiled at the sight.  Naruto was becoming perfect.  He hadn't even seemed to have reached his limit yet.  Kyuubi had kept a steady slow of it's healing chakra going.  Sasuke dug his fork into a large round white cake and fed Naruto some more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourty five minutes later Sasuke was reaching the end of the large cake.  The jacket had been ripped open and a large globe now sat leaning forward.  Sasuke, as softly as possible, touched his crushs belly and felt that it was still slightly soft.  He coudl go further.  Sasuke brought a large basket filled with two douzen chocolate chip muffins onto the bed.  Forcing between Naruto's lips and watching the automatic chewing.  One after the other he worked past those tanned lips until only one was left.  Naruot's stomach was now the size of a woman pregnant with triplets.  Naruto breathed hard as Sasuke reached for the last muffin, and last treat.  Taking the paper off Sasuke toar it in half and put it into Naruto's awaiting mouth.  The kyuubi's chakra spiked and Sasuke smirked.  It seemed even the kyuubi had somewhat of a limit.  Sasuke backed off and let naruto fall back asleep once more.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sasuke coudln't be happier.  He'd had to go get Naruto new clothes, much to the horror of Naruto.  The hundred and five pound fourteen year old was now at a hefty one hundred and ninety pounds.  His favorite moment had to have been when the blondes' pants no longer held together.  Naruto's ass had rounded out very nicely in Sasuke's opinion.  Watching the tight pants fighting to stay together when he allowed Naruto to take a shower on the six day had been heavenly.  The orange pants had strained heavily against his wider ass and the sounds of tears opening as he walked had caused a heavy humiliated blush to touch Naruto's cheeks.  His pants had ripped at the seans three days ago, but Sasuke hadn't been too concerns with getting new ones for him, much to Naruto's chagrin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was officially fat.  The blonde had been horrified by Kyuubi's 'healing.'  He'd refused to cooperate with Sasuke the next few days and been forced fed through the tube.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower Naruto had struggled horribly with getting his pants back on all the way.  Sasuke had laughed softly at the sounds of grunts coming from the bathroom as Naruto tugged and pulled to no avail.  He listened intently to the sound of Naruto holding in his stomach in an attempt to bring them up further.  He'd finally succedded in getting them somewhat over his ass but they refused to button in any sense of the word.  The shirt was no better.  Naruto hadn't been able to get it over his stomach at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto begged his captor to get him new clothes throught the bathroom door and even tried to barricade himself in the bathroom in an attempt to hide himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke refused adn dragged the blonde out.  That day Naruto refused again to cooperate and so Sasuke was forced to use the tube again.  Naruto was perfect as he was right then... but Sasuke found himself wanted his crush to be even bigger.  More perfect.  He'd told himself at the beginning that he wouldn't do anything over 200 but he found himself deeply wanted to do far more.  He liked blushing, humiliated, completely adorable Naruto.  And he didn't want Naruto to ever lose it if they went' back to Konoha.  Naruto had to be his.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the large weight gain in such a short amount of time Naruto was now not able to fight back at all.  There was almost no need for Chains except for when Sasuke left the hotel.  Naruto was horrified to find that he coudl barely move on his own due to not being use to the weight.  He fell over easily and walked extremely slowly.  He did not even dare think about what Sasuke looked like or want to imagine Sasuke seeing him like he was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke still hadn't revealed himself to the blonde and didn't plan to for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes Sasuke picked out for Naruto hardly sufficed.  When Naruto quietly slid them on they were slighlty uncomfotable.  The shirt was a net shirt, a large one, but still a net shirt.  When Naruto unsteadily came out of the bathroom in it with shame on his thickened face Sasuke felt the complete opposite reaction.  He loved the way the clothes were tight around Naruto's body (the reason why he'd bought them in the first place).  And couldnt' weight to watch Naruto burst out of them again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He put a blood seal on Naruto's body and held his breath as it sizzled into existence on his shoulder.  Quietly he placed a hankerchief over his mouth so that the blonde would be slighlty drugged when he woke up.  And when Naruto fought back he would be ready.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto finally woke up, the blonde realized he was alone in the room and unhendered from making an escape.  Swaying to his feet because of the feeding (he assumed), Naruto staggered toward the window to escape.  The figure suddenly appeared in front of him and slammed into him.  Dizzy and disorientated Naruto quickly moved his hands into his favorie seal and created six clones of himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure laughed in triumph.  Naruto frowned, as did his clones, before a seal shines on his shoulder and on all the clones.  Suddenly all six of them were trapped in wires.  The dark figure of a man chained each clone up and against the walls.  The smirk on his face so large Naruto felt fear grip him.  What had he done?  Naruto tried to release his clones but to his horror they just looked back at him in confusion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever a shadow clone experiences or feels goes back to the original user once their dissapated.  Isn't that right Naruto?\" Asked the dark figure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tensed.  The figure pulled out six feeding tubes from his bad and smiled.  Naruto suddenly felt very sick to his stomach.  Walking up to each of the clones the figure hooked up the line and left the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't!\"  Naruto begged when the figure came bag in carrying bags.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark figure grinned again.  Silently he went around the room hooking up large bags of liquified food to the tubes and allowed them to start flowing.  The clones all struggled but it was useless.  The figure merely smirked down at his horrified face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what shall I do with you while your clones are... enjoying themselves?\"  The figure asked.  </span></div></div>",

The metal twisted around his wrists and held his legs in place.  Sasuke looked around slowly and got an idea.  He went around the room at a casual pace, zipping down each clones jacket and cutting open the shirt underneath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be fun to watch their stomachs get bigger as I'm feeding you.\"  Henged Sasuke explained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" Naruto demanded angrily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I take great pleasure in it.\" Sasuke said simply.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe touched the stomach of the last clone who glared angrily at him while trying to bite through the tube.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tubes are made of stronger stuff than your teeth.  I wouldn't bother.\"  Sasuke called back as he went out into the hall to drag something in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke brought in a platter filled with Cinnamen buns lathered in frosting.  Setting it on the table Sasuke cut the sticky bun into large bite sized pieces and walked over to Naruto who had his mouth stubbornly closed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want to go through the pain of the tube?\" Sasuke asked.  \"Your already going to experience it six times over.  Why not enjoy eating?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wearily eyed him and then looked around the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you feed me you'll stop before it hurts?\" Naruto asked suspiciously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke frowned and wrinkled his nose.  He wouldn't lie.  Naruto hated liars.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stop just a little past.  I promise.\"  Sasuke said slowly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grimaced but the pain from last night still screamed at him to agree.  Naruto hesitantly nodded and opened his mouth.  Excitedly, Sasuke put the first piece into the blondes mouth and watched him chew.  Then the next and the next.  It always gave him joy to watch Naruto eat.  At the sixth bun Naruto shook his head, signalling that he couldn't eat anymore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one more. Now cooperate or I'll have to force you to eat more than that.\" Sasuke stated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked green, but at the threat he opened his mouth.  Sasuke put a rather large piece in and watched Naruto slowly chew and swallow.  More and more of it he shoved in and each time Naruto got slower and slower.  The last bite was painfully long, but Naruto eventually did it.  Naruto let out a breath of release, leaning against the wires, allowing the metal to hold him up when he'd long since couldn't .  Sasuke wished that Naruto wasn't wearing that big jacket of his but he knew he would just have to satisfy himself with the shadow clones for now.  When the time came that jacket WOULD come off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke turned towards the shadow clones that he'd been ignoring the last fourty minutes or so and blushed as he saw them.  They two were leaning against their chians.  All of their stomachs were pushed out two inches and looked about ready to burst.  Sasuke went by all of them and happily touched their bellys.  He had to make a choice now though... </span></div></div>",

After all it couldn't take too long for the thing to go and he still needed to be in top condition.  If he was gonna do this to Naruto then he needed to be ready to protect him when the blonde couldn't do it for himself anymore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later Sasuke watched the clone spasm in pain, but instead of dispersing red circulated around the clone and began healing and stretching.  Fascinated Sasuke watched.  The kyuubi's chakra was continued to flow through the clone.  This knew development left him absolutely thrilled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that Naruto would freak out if he knew though... Thinking fast Sasuke moved the kyuubi fused clone into the bathroom with the tubed food and chains.  He'd push this one to the limit and then release him in a few days.  Sasuke left the apartment to get prepared for when Naruto woke up. </span></div></div>",

Naruto resisted the spoon being shoved at his mouth, but when Sasuke casually flicked his writs in the direction of the now being tube fed clones Naruto shot him a nasty look before hesitantly opening his mouth.  The ice cream was immediately shoved in.  To Sasuke's vast amusement Naruto was so surprised he swallowed it instantly.  Ice cream was much easier to eat than regular food so Sasuke set up a faster pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Naruto swallow Sasuke had another bite awaiting him.  At two and a half pints Naruto shook his head and turned away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More.\" Sasuke demanded.  He knew that Naruto could eat more than that without it getting painful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tiredly opened his mouth as Sasuke shoved a spoon full of ice cream past his lips.  Naruto struggled to eat bite after bite as Sasuke continued to push it on him until he'd finished off another pint.  Naruto turned his head away again, moaning.  But Sasuke would not be denied.  Sasuke forced Naruto's lip open and shoved a generous amount of ice cream in his mouth before tightly holding his hand over the blondes lips.  It took a few minutes, but when Sasuke pinched Naruto's nose shut the blonde swallowed.  This continued again and again until they'd gotten to four and a half pints.  Behind him Sasuke heard a chorus of moans that echoed Naruto's.  Sasuke finally stopped.  Satified for the moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastard.\" Naruto whispered hoarsely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke chuckled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you have no idea.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke put the rest of the ice cream in the freezer for later before going over and admiring the clones.  Their stomachs were extremely bloated out, pressing threateningly against the button on their pants.  Sasuke smirked and went up to each of them.  He relished in the grateful moan that exhited their lips as he released the buttons and unzipped their pants.  Their stomachs leaned foward from the release and Sasuke felt their hardened skin before moving on to the next one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke decided that he'd check on the clone he'd left tubed up several hours ago in the bathroom.  It would interesting to say the least.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

It was also strangely hard as a rock.  The Naruto clone's hands were holding the giant orb up as best it could but clearly was exhausted and hurting.  Sasuke released the chains knowing full well that the clone wouldn't be able to move.  The clone collapsed and leaned against the wall.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two days had past and Sasuke eagerly looked at his precious crush.  He couldn't tell because of all the clothes on him but there was a definet layer of fat on Naruto's body.  Sasuke knew because the clones whose jackets were opened and shirts ripped showed it beautifully.  Instead of a flat stomach a nice layer of extra skin lay.  Sasuke had spent some minutes simply pinching the fat and wishing there was more to squeeze.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been forced to tube Naruto three more times because of the blondes stubborness but tonight he had a good feeling.  Naruto was terrified to be tubed again and Sasuke thought he'd be able to ge the blonde to eat more than the previous days by hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the clone in the bathroom.  Sasuke looked at the bathroom door and guessed that it was about time to change the bag again.  Still henged Sasuke moved to the bathroom door and entered.  It was a marvelous sight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last two days of continous eating and digesting had done the clone well... in Sasuke's opinion.  He'd have to even remove the chains for larger ones soon.  Chained to the cealing with his arms above his head and feet to the floor the clone angrily glared at him as the last of the bagged food slithered down his throat.  The pants were ripping at the seems.  The clones belly spilled over a full foot outwards and his ass had developed into a nice bubble shape pushing against the straining threads.  An evident developing double chin caused Sasuke to drowl a little and a nice pair of beginners moobs made him sway.  Sasuke surveyed his work... walking around the clone and sqeezing it's ass.  The Naruto copy gave an indignant shriek.  When the clone dispersed... it would be beautiful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke replaced the bag with a new one and wondered when he should reveal himself to Naruto.  He knew he'd have to wait a while... at least until the fourteen year old was at a heavier weight.  The clone protested the new bag as it struggled uselessly against it's confines.  Sasuke ignored it and walked out of the room to where his Naruto was on the bed.  A pot of stew was set up at the table beside the bed filled with fatty meats and a special weight gain formula.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to cooperate tonight Naruto?\"  Sasuke asked unneccesarily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tiredly nodded.  Sasuke filled the first spoon full and blew on it before feeding it to Naruto.  Naruto swallowed and opened his mouth for more.  Sasuke refrained from using bowls, deducing that if Naruto didn't realize how much he was eating he could get the blonde to eat more.  It was far more enjoyable after all when Naruto wasn't fighting him.  Someday he'd be able to feed Naruto to his hearts content without any chains at all.  Sasuke happily scooped up more and more of the soup into his crushes mouth eagerly awaiting the next mouthful.  Naruto ate and ate until one third of the pot was empty.  He could see it.  Naruto's stomach was pushing against his jacket, much to Sasuke's delight.  The evident bump was a wonderful development.  Naruto moved around a bit, obviously uncomfortable.  Taking the advantage to get close to his crush Sasuke moved in and placed his hands on the top of Naruto's pants, unbuttoning them for the blonde and pulling the zipper down.  Being so close to him Sasuke coudl feel the stomach move downward with the release.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now Naruto.  I know you can eat more.\"  Sasuke said strictly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of protesting like normal Naruto simply opened his mouth for more.  Sasuke dug into the pot for another spoonful.  Naruto struggled.  The swallos taking longer and longer, but he still kept eating.  Before either one knew it another one third of the pot was gone.  Naruto's stomach was absalutely bulging against his jacket.  Naruto turned his head away and refused to eat the rest.  At first Sasuke was severely dissapointed, but then an idea occured to him.  Looking back at the five clones that he'd had yet to hook up for their dinner Sasuke grinned.  The Uchiha stood and walked over to one of the clones.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing his hands on the seal that had appeared on it Sasuke took it off.  The clone looked at him with surprise before poofing out of existence.  Naruto too let out a sound of surprise as the clone joined with him.  Turning with a grin to the bed Sasuke noticed that the bulg had smooth out just the tiniest bit as new fat was added.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can eat more now, can't you?\" Sasuke asked in a mocking voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned and shifted in his tightened pants.  Sasuke moved forward with a hunter like gleam in his eyes.  Picking up the spoon he waited for Naruto to admit defeat and open his mouth again.  A girlish delight filled him when the blond did open his mouth.  Sasuke hurriedly moved the spoon in and the eating continued.  When the entirety of the pot was gone Naruto leaned back moaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than happy with the straining coat covering his crush's stomach Sasuke moved across the room to the clones and put four slighlty larger than normal bags up for them.  He'd have more fun with them all tommorrow.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three days had passed and Sasuke felt a smug expression cross his face as he looked at the remaining clones as Naruto slept.  They'd each developed a tummy that drooped a few inches from their pants line.  Each were connected to a large bag this morning and Sasuke planned on them finishing it before Naruto even woke up.  Their stomachs were bloating out even as he watched.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke went to check on the one in the bathroom and for several minutes just sat their and admired his work.  He'd unchained the kyuubified clone yesterday and had to give it larger clothes.  The clone had ripped out of the old ones.  It had reached a wonderfully inticing two hundred pounds.  Unable to walk or escape the clone had resigned itself to sitting on the floor with his hands handcuffed in larger metal behind it's back.  Two hundred wasn't bad for most people but Naruto had always been a shirmp and at the age of fourteen it was depiliating.  A bag was already hooked up to it and a belly fit for a woman pregnant with triplets in her ninth month lay on it's lap.  Naruto would forever be his when he finished with him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke walked out of the bathroom and checked on how the clones were doing.  Half of the bags were gone.  Their stomachs were already getting tight.  Pretty soon the kyuubi would take affect in them and enlarge their stomachs.  He'd make sure that Naruto was too busy to notice his clones abnormal weight gain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke spent his time waiting by filling the room with more food.  He blended special fattening shakes up in preperation for Naruto waking and set them up beside the bed.  After all that was done he checked on the clones again.  They were all using kyuubis chakra by now.  Their stomach's were bloated beyond that of a normal person's in consequence of the forced heavy feeding.  Sasuke smirked and silently went to zip up the jackets to hide the unnattural girth.  It was slightly difficult to do.  The stomach was at least half a foot outwards.  Sasuke worked on the zipper and tugged it over the expanding stomach.  The clone protested the action immensely as it shuddered from the healing.  Finally connecting the two Sasuke forced the jacket upward and closed.  The belly swayed a little as he released it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe repeated the action for the next three.  Then he watched.  All the jackets strained dangerously as the bags continued to empty.  At one point they looked like they'd brake the zipper, but when the last of the bags emptied out all the way and the bellys stopped enlarging Sasuke let out a breath as the jackets held.  Unhookingly them Sasuke went over to Naruto and woke him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond blinked at him owlishly for several minutes before reliing were he was a scowling.  Sasuke noticed that the blondes face was slightly rounder than three days ago and that as he stretched his stomach peeked out and over an inch from the waist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Sasuke gently grabbed and pulled Naruto's head up and began pouring the prepared shake down his throat.  Angry but unable to do anything if he didn't want to choke Naruto began to gulp it down.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was dinner time and Sasuke was excited.  He'd made sure that Naruto didn't notice the clones unnatural sizes throughout the day and it was time to initiate his plan.  After lunch Naruto had once more fallen asleep with his hands over his painfully bloated stomach and had yet to wake up.  Sasuke had begun to loosen the chains length after the forced feedings to allow Naruto more comfort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke hooked up three of the clones to the regular sized bags, leaving the fourth one without a bag.  Tonight was the night that Naruto would finally realize how fat they'd gotten.  He was going to release the fourth clone after Naruto refuses to eat anymore... And by that point the jacket wouldn't be able to handle it.  It would be... inticing.  Once the clones finished those Naruto would be nearing the end of his rope anyways.  The moment he realizes how fat he's gotten... well then he'd allow Naruto to see exactly how much he'd been feeding the blondes clones.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke walked over to Naruto and woke him up.  Tonight he was feeding the blond high calorie spagetti with large garlic drenched bread sticks.  As Sasuke went to feed Naruto his first bite of the night Naruto turned his head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to use the restroom.\" Naruto mumbled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke put down the fork and grinned to himself.  Whenever the blond had needed to go the past five days he'd held him at the end of the chain and under a genjutsu walked him down the hall to the shared bathrooms.  It was funny to watch Naruto struggle walking with the unaccumtoned weight.  Naruto had only gained fifteen pounds or so... not including any of his clones of course, so it was interesting to see him stumble and sway like a drunk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke set up the chain and placed the genjutsu over them both.  Naruto wearily put his feet on the ground and stood up, tipping a bit forward, before adjusting himself.  Placing himself between Naruto and the view of the clones Sasuke walked Naruto to the door, hand going out every time Naruto appeared to almost fall.  Every time this happened Sasuke would 'accidentally' feel the new girth around Naruto's middle.  The huge blush that covered Naruto's cheeks at this caused his smile to widen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were back in the room after business finished Sasuke nudged Naruto to get the other boy to open up his mouth.  Naruto very reluctantly did so.  Breaking a piece of the breadsticks off and plopping them into Naruto's mouth every fifth bite.  Naruto ate without comment.  Long since learning that his captor would shove more food on him if he tried to talk during the feeding.  Sasuke paid close attention to how the jacket began to move outwards in a round curve by time they got to the third bowl of noodles.  By three and a half Naruto turned away from him with his lips tightly closed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Naruto... finish this bowl.\"  Sasuke pressed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto still refused to come towards him Sasuke forced Naruto's face to the front with a tight grin.  Prying his mouth open and shoving a forkfull of spagetti Sasuke sighed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have to be mean if you would just do as your told.\" Sasuke admonished.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto simply snorted at him in disgust as he was forced to chew the food.  When the bowl was gone Sasuke sat back and admired his Naruto.  Naruto's stomach, even through the jacket, was visibly round and tight.  Satified Sasuke looked at Naruto like a hunter eyes it's pray.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a lot more spagetti ready and I think you are going to eat it.\" Sasuke told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto simply gave him a silent incredulous look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke walked over to the clones, hidden from Naruto's view by the piles of food and equipment in the room.  Going to the one who he had force fed dinner to he smiled at the slightly chubby cheeks and body in front of him.  He put his hand on the seal the clone had and released it.  Rushing back to Naruto so as not to miss anything he came upon a look of utter suprise and horror on the blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's stomach stretched out tight against the jacket and the orange cloth strained heavily before a ripping sound filled the air.  The already bloated stomach extended and fell into the cross legged blondes lap.  Naruto's cheeks filled out a bit becoming rounder and a slight second chin sprouted.  Naruto quickly uncrossed his legs as he felt them thickening and gasped as his pants strained and constricted him.  The area where his theighs were ripped a little, leaving a hole on both legs.  Sasuke desperately wished Naruto was standing so that he could see how tight the pants were against the blondes ass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sat there shocked as he stared down at his immensely fattened body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did yo...\" Naruto trialed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I released one of your clones.\"  Sasuke said with a smirk.  \"And all of them are just as deliciously fat as the one you just absorbed.  The bags you see above the food boxes are simply appetizers for them.  Your demon doesn't allow you to die so easily does he?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto simply continued to sit there dumb founded and horrified.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke chuckled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now.  I think you'll like your new weight once we're finished.  And I think now you have plenty of room for Spagetti and bread.\" Sasuke announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shut his mouth tightly closed and glared muderously at his captor.  Dissapointment filled Sasuke.  He'd been hoping that Naruto would like his new girth, he certainly did.  It couldn't be helped though... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then... I guess I'm just going to have to go back to tube feeding, but this time I'll feed you personally through a funnel.\"  Sasuke proclaimed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke took a blender to the spegetti and then hooked up the tube, forcing open Naruto's mouth and down his throat.  He hooked up the funnel and then began letting the food slip down the funnel.  If Naruto wanted to do it this way then he wasn't going to stop until he was satisfied.  When Naruto attempted to kick out at him he chained his legs up.  He was going to rip Naruto's still intact t-shirt open.  He poured bowl after bowl into the funnel until the entire pot was gone.  Ten bowls.  Naruto was swaying and panting from the forced feeding.  His stomach was straining the large t-shirt badly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke sighed in annoyance and wondered silently what the shirts material was made out of.  He could already sense Kyuubi's chakra healing and stretching Naruto's stomach further out.  He gave Naruto a few minutes break as he went through the boxes in search of something else.  He smiled as he found several somethings.  Twinkies... what better to use than something that literally was the epitome of weight gain?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke pulled out several boxes and began blending them.  Naruto would never fight him again afte tonight.  He'd make sure of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came back it was to find that Naruto had managed to lay down.  It didn't matter to him... He could feed the blond sitting or standing or laying.  Sasuke put the new liquid food in much to Naruto's chagrin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you would have just eaten the food I was giving you none of this would be happening now would it?  All you have to do to not have to endure this is eat what I tell you to eat.\" Sasuke said quietly to the heavily panting boy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke paid close attention to Naruto's stomach as he poured.  Halfway through the first batch the shirt ripped.  Naruto's grunt of pain added affect to the event.  Sasuke smiled and kept pouring </span></div></div>",

Sasuke watched the clones eat and swallow what seemed like ours was only a half an hour. Sasuke walked up towards the clones and saw there was fear mixed with angry.

His arms start to gain more fat and it looked like it buried the muscle tone on the arms. his face grew rounder and it showed off his second chin.

Nothing I've done seem to be helping though.\u201d He reached for the bowl the ramen owner put before him, his gut pleading for mercy, yet also pleading for more of that delicious ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can't really say that I'm an expert on that... Have you tried asking your teacher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm.\u201d He grunted, slurping down his ramen. He paused for a moment, \u201cAnd he didn't really have any tips to give, just 'do your exercises' which I've been doing for years, and they're not really helping me with getting any bigger.\u201d And then he went back to his already half-empty bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that's a shame.\u201d Filling up another bowl, he slid it towards the gorging boy, stacking the now empty bowl atop the tower the blonde was creating. \u201cHave you tried asking any of your friends? Maybe they've got some tips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grunt left the boy before he cleared his mouth. \u201cI did, and I'm really grateful for their help, though they didn't really do much, their tips that is.\u201d Another moutful of ramen. \u201cChouji's training really only helps people of his clan, ya know, with getting them all gigantic and stuff, and Kiba's method really only helps you get more in synch with your animal partner. Was a lot of meat in his diet apparently.\u201d And then straight back into the bowl he dived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lot of meat, eh...\u201d Something was coming back to him as he stirred the large pot of broth. \u201cThey've probably got a special diet for their more intense moves, those clans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Slurp. \u201cApparently, they take a lot of energy, not only chakra but also energy from their body, and I can believe that. I mean, they turn into giants and great wolf-beasts, awesome stuff like that has gotta take a lot of energy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lot of energy... Like calories...?\u201d Teuchi mumbled to himself as he put the rest of the ramen in an extra large bowl and gave it to Naruto, ignoring the way the zipper on the gorging teen's jacket was slowly being pried apart by the boy's growing globular gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me a moment, I think I have something back here.\u201d A grunt was his answer, and he shook his head in fond exasperation. Entering the back room, he searched through a few drawers before finding what he was looking for. Taking a quick look through the small book, he gave a nod to himself, satisfied that his inkling was correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the back room, he came upon a dopily smiling teen, the boy's hands resting comfortably atop the overfilled, exposed stomach, jacket having given up the fight with the growing mass with that last bigger serving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSatisfied?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah.\u201d A burp left the blonde, one of his hands softly massaging the tight skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's good to hear. Take this.\u201d The blonde took the book in his hands, looking at it before looking at the aging man, the question clear on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a copy of a cookbook my father made, filled with recipes that he used when he served his clients. I didn't go into the same food-making industry as him though, so I never got much, if any use of it.\u201d He knocked on the hard cover the book wore. \u201cIf that there can't help beef you up to a bigger size, then I honestly have no idea if anything ever will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Giving the book another glance, he soon sent a blinding smile towards the ramen chef. \u201cThank you so much, old man Ichiraku! I'll definitely try this out for a while!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nod and a smile was given back. As the blonde slowly stood from his seat, the chef gained his attention one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a quick warning that basically all of the recipes in that book is really heavy, so don't expect to exercise right after your meal. In fact, I would recommend a short nap after the meals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll keep that in mind.\u201d With another smile, and a small bundle of cash left on the counter, the blonde unsteadily made his way homewards, Teuchi finally moving the tower of bowls over to the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder if I should have told him that my father's clients were traditionally people that needed to gain a large amount of weight in a very short amount of time... Ehh.\u201d He shrugged, starting on cleaning the bowls. \u201cThe kid needs to get some meat on his bones, and the extra poundage'll probably help him punch crooks harder.\u201d Happy with that, and his mind at peace, he slowly worked at the dishes through the night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba and Akamaru couldn't help but stare at the sight before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had seen a lot during his few years as a ninja. Freaky people with extra limbs and heads, gigantic talking animals, gigantic animalistic chakra monsters, he had even seen Chouji say no too a free meal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a sight he hadn't seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, there was nothing new seeing Naruto taking a snooze in the middle of a random training ground or a scenic place in the forest. Neither was there anything new that the boy did so without his shirt on, as Naruto had never been shy about his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large gut, sizeable love-handles, starting man-boobs and a double chin on the other hand, THAT was completely new to the animal loving teen. Even the teens arms had started to loose their definition, the musculature being slightly hidden behind the new adipose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking lower, Kiba could quite clearly see that the blonde boy had already busted the button on his pants, and even then it seemed quite constricting around the waist. He highly doubted it would fall of, even without the button. Snickering at the thought of the blonde having quite the butt on him to make the waist that snug, he stared at the chunky tights, the pants stretching quite alarmingly over them, yet seeming to hold together well enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'With the way he has blown up so far, that won't last long.' Came the fleeting thought, and he couldn't help but agree with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleeping teen shifted a bit in his sleep, and Kiba couldn't help but stare as the gut jiggled slightly, transfixed by the sight. Despite how bloated it looked, (The tanned boy seemingly having swallowed a basketball, if not a bit more) it was quite clear that most of the gut was pure fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffing the rotund teen, Akamaru softly let his snout press into the rising and lowering belly, the gut incredibly soft despite the fact that Naruto had quite clearly been eating not too long ago. (As evident by the stain at the corner of his mouth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising his head, the dog had to hold in a whine of longing, as the portly boy's soft belly would undoubtly be a fantastic pillow. So squishy... Staring at Kiba, he cocked his head to the side, as if to say 'That's him alright. What'cha going to do?' Hopefully convince the blonde to let him use that wonderful belly as a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a shrug back, the fanged boy stared at the fat teen, contemplating on how to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to be nice for once, he took off his sandals and toed one of the love-handles, trying his hardest to ignore how his big toe went into the soft adipose, and how the contact sent small tremors across the torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to get some amusement out of it, and completely not because he wanted a better feel of it, he crouched down beside the slumbering teen and softly took the tanned gut it his hands, feeling his hands and fingers sinking into the softness encompassing the teen. Jiggling it slightly, he watched the tremors travel around the torso, earning a sleepy snort from the fox-boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the flesh a harder, he started to knead it a bit, part curious and part appreciative of the malleable mass that bended under his fingers. Except for another snort and a random arm sent his way, the blonde seemed no closer to waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well,' He mused, standing up as he stared at the stubbornly sleeping teen. 'You asked for it.' Forgoing the more subtle approach, he took one leg over the portly fox before he dropped himself on the blonde's plush lap, his upper body leaning over the quivering mass of flesh that jutted from Naruto's torso, smirking down at the waking double-chinned teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My pillow.' Akamaru grumbled, starring at the jiggling mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting at the sudden weight, Naruto tried to shift over to his side only to fail, the obtrusion on his lap stopping him from doing so. Giving up on getting any more sleep he opened his eyes, drowsily glaring at the smirking dog-boy on his lap. (Overlooking the gut rising from his once thin stomach)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it's you.\u201d With a groan, he threw an arm over his eyes. He had such a good dream too... That he now couldn't remember. \u201cWhat do ya want, dog-breath?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, not allowed to say hi after coming back from a mission, Whiskers? Not everyone's a lazy-ass like you, you know.\u201d Of course, he was completely ommiting the fact that absolutely nothing had happened during the mission. Not that he was complaining, the peace actually being quite nice, but he did find the mission incredibly boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, stuff it.\u201d Removing his arm from over his eyes, he sat up a bit, his sizeable gut dropping down on his lap, and pressing up against Kiba somewhat. \u201cSo, what's up? Anything interesting happening?\u201d Looking at a random bird that flew over them, he totally missed the way that Kiba was staring at the extra flesh pressing up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn.' Looking down, he stared at the way Naruto's softer chest slightly rested on his stomach, the gut and love-handles seeming even larger when pressed up against him like that. He finally had to admit that the weight looked far better on the blonde than the skinny almost-twig he was before. 'Wonder how he'd look if he was even bigger...' Akamaru was nodding along with the thought, unknowingly mirroring his partner's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head slightly, he finally prosessed the questions asked towards him. \u201cNah, nothing's really going on. Just wanted to check if you wanted to hang out? I'd ask some others to join, but I couldn't be bothered looking for them too.\u201d He rested one of his hands along Naruto's side, hoping the other teen wouldn't mind or notice. The softness was almost hypnotizing for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing for a moment, Naruto thought about it for a moment before sending an appreciative smile towards the tattoed boy. \u201cSure, I'd like that. Haven't really been around the others much lately, I've been kinda busy trying out a new bulking method.\u201d Sitting up fully, (And pushing Kiba back slightly with his gut) he smacked his side, overlooking the softness and the jiggling. \u201cDunno how well it's doing, but my clothes has started getting a bit tighter, so I guess it's working.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, I couldn't tell.\u201d Except for the fat gut, the small man-boobs, love-handles and double-chin that is. He had to admit that the double-chin really suited the teen's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Anyway, I was supposed to train, so if you-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'GRRRROWL'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them froze for a moment, before looking down at the origin of the sound. Blushing, Naruto patted the side of his stomach, a sheepish smile stretching across his face. Smirking, Kiba poked the soft flesh, his finger sinking into it. \u201cSounds like someone's hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess a bit.\u201d Averting his eyes, he stared at the clearing around him, his face conflicted. \u201cI was supposed to train though...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Standing up, he reached his hand down for the blonde to take. \u201cTraining on an empty stomach ain't any fun now, is it? Let's fill that monster up before it starts devouring us.\u201d He couldn't help but snort, the gut growling after he said that, apparently agreeing with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was about to argue, but another growl left his stomach, and the first true pangs of hunger started to enter his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well, the training grounds aren't going anywhere.\u201d Grabbing the hand, the two of them hauled him up, Kiba having to use more strength than he thought. Bending down to grab his T-shirt, (Having to struggle a bit, and Kiba watching the pants heroically trying to stay together) Naruto pulled it over his head, the clothing barely reaching down to his belly button, and even then it didn't cover all of it, the love-handles spilling out at the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that reminds me!\u201d He looked at the dog-team, the duo following behind him, getting a good look at his butt, the seat of his pants stretching quite nicely over the growing buttocks. \u201cI've really gotten into making food lately, do the two of you want any?\u201d</span></div></div>",

They saw just how tight Naruto's pants were, and Kiba was right; Naruto's pant's weren't even close to falling off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, after some idle conversation, the three had arrived. Naruto's apartment was messy, but it had seen worse days, and it was actually decent enough for guests. Kiba sat at Naruto's table. \"So let me guess, you're making ramen?\" Kiba asked sarcastically. Naruto just beamed and said, \"What else would I make?\" Kiba then said, \"Well in that case, give me plenty of steak on mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto cooked two pots of ramen in the kitchen, which he kept surprisingly clean now, he said, \"I can really pack this stuff away if I wanted to!\". Kiba said, \"Is that so, dog breath? I bet I can eat more than you in one sitting!\". Naruto brushed Kiba off, saying, \"In your dreams! I can eat a whole pot by myself!\". \"Then let's make it a challenge!\" Kiba said. \"Fine by me!\" Naruto replied as he got another pot out and started making even more, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined, 'You know you're gonna end up just like him?' Kiba said under his breath, \"Don't worry about it. This way, he'll push himself to eat more. Besides, I can just work it off!\" Akamaru seemed satisfied with that answer. He sat by the end of the table. From his vantage point, he'd be able to see both bellies from the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter plenty of hard work, Naruto brought out two pots of ramen, one for himself and one for Kiba. \"I figured since dogs like meat, I just made Akamaru a steak. I hope he likes it rare!\" Kiba then said, \"Akamaru's gonna love it. The rarer, the better!\" Akamaru wagged his tail and barked in agreement. Naruto handed Akamaru his steak, then he sat down with Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began chowing down, right from the pots. Kiba and Akamaru were amazed that Naruto's cooking was actually pretty good. Kiba said \"You make a mean batch of ramen, Naruto!\" between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kiba went to eat the steak first, Naruto went right for the noodles, scooping out lots at a time with his chopsticks. Since Naruto's belly was already quite large, it didn't seem to bulge out noticeably at first. Kiba's, meanwhile, began to distend as he started on the noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued through their ramen, both of their bellies distending out farther and farther as they went. At this point, Akamaru was done and full, so he was watching the show. Kiba unzipped his jacket when he felt it start to strain a lot. This led to his distended belly pushing out a bit, and it was starting to stretch his netted shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, both of them had gotten to the broth. Almost simultaneously, both Naruto and Kiba took their pots and tip them up, letting the broth spill into their mouths. Akamaru watched in awe as their bellies now bloated out at a lightning pace. While Naruto was shirtless and his belly was free to grow, Kiba had his net shirt on, and soon after finishing the broth, one of the strings snapped, causing a chain reaction that broke the front of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was rock hard, and he didn't know if he'd ever eaten this much in his life. Naruto had the layer of fat to keep his soft, but now, the table was starting to cut into it. Naruto then said, \"I guess we need a tie breaker!\" as he got up to bring in the third pot. Kiba was amazed that Naruto was willing to keep going, so he psyched himself up to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto brought out a stack of bowls this time, and whoever had the higher stack would win. Kiba made it through a few more bowl, but at that point, Naruto had eaten half the pot! Kiba let Naruto finish the rest, and he was amazed by the sight. Naruto's belly was now the size of a beachball! He belched loudly before saying, \"Man, that was good.\" He looked at Kiba's stack of bowls saying, \"Looks like someone underestimated me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked green in the face. He was just rubbing his own belly to try to soothe it. \"And the best part is that this food is designed to help people bulk up! I'll be ripped in no time!\" Naruto said. Kiba and Akamaru looked at each other in amazement by how oblivious Naruto was, but either way, that explained why Naruto had gained so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Kiba said, \"I should eat here more often. That was great!\". Naruto joked, \"I should start charging!\". Kiba then said, \"I could help with ingredients.\". Soon after, all three of them had fallen asleep. Naruto snored as his huge belly rose and fell. Kiba was on Naruto's couch in a similar predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ate together for nearly every meal for the next week. Neither of them had much to do, and Kiba's mom and sister were both on long missions. Regardless, as the week wore one, Kiba...</span></div></div>",

He felt the hairy head of his companion rest on his stomach, and he gave the canine a few strokes, a happy rumble leaving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You've chubbed up a bit.' Akamaru finally ruffed, not moving from his spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d The dog-boy agreed, continuing with the petting. \u201cI guess that's why you've really started laying on me though, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huff was heard, neither denying nor confirming, yet Kiba knew the answer, a small grin showing. It wasn't a lot by any means, merely some extra padding here and there, some extra fat around his stomach, nothing to worry about. He hadn't really seen any other results yet though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should up my training.\u201d Kiba muttered, another sigh leaving him, a part of him not wanting to do any more exercising than he was already doing, yet a bigger part really wanted to show off a bit, all big and bulky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At least you're doing more than Naruto's doing.' Here, Akamaru raised his head and poked the padded mass below him with his snout. 'Eating less too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickering at that, he scratched behind one of the dog's ears, the dog going limp at the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan't deny the truth.\u201d It was impressive really. While Kiba had (somewhat) managed to reign in his appetite, not stuffing himself each meal, Naruto seemingly was doing the opposite, filling his gut to the brim each meal. It showed too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder if he's ever going to start with his training again.\u201d His mind flitted to the growing middle the blonde was sporting, apparently oblivious to his rapidly balloning physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's for him to decide.' The hound huffed. 'When he finally realises his size, he'll probably get up from his lazy ass. Plus,' his tail wagged, amusement in his voice, 'when he finally DO notice, it'll probably be hilarious.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickerin with his partner, Kiba finally dragged his comforter over the two of them, getting ready for a good night of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, that'll be great.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Akamaru simply rolled his eyes (as best a dog can do) and went back to cleaning his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, yeah. You've been bragging about that all morning.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that didn't mean it wasn't impressive. If one had to call the dog-lover one thing before his run-in with Naruto, it was thin. Wiry at best, but with no clear muscles to speak off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, he had already started bulking up. Of course, due to the food being ludicrously nutrient and (obviously) calorie filled, a decent amount of what he'd gained had been fat, but due to his pretty intensive training, his fat-filled form had started to attain a pretty strong and visible undercurrent of muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis biceps and triceps were already stretching the arms of his jackets and shirts to their limits, having turned form-fitting after a mere two weeks, and the slight, but noticeable width he had gained across his shoulders didn't help the struggling clothes any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest was broader, along with a soft-yet-solid mass that was slightly protruding from his abdomen, adding to the struggle his clothes faced in increased amounts each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs had also bulked up but not to the extent as the rest of the body. It weren't really all that noticeable underneath his clothes. He should stop skipping leg-day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, he was starting to look solid. He still had a way to go to really start looking like a powerhouse, but this was definitely not a bad start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl filled Kiba's room, and a giddy smile (Giddier than before Akamaru noted) stretched across his unchanged face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, breakfast soon!\u201d Putting on a tight T-shirt and a not-much-better jacket, the teen vaulted out the window, the white hound following along besides the bounding teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So.' The dog started, letting his tongue fall out. 'What do you think he's gonna make today?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno for breakfast and lunch, but I was promised something meaty and greasy for dinner today, and I won't let Naruto get out of that! Plus,\u201d A cheeky grin was sent Akamaru's way, \u201cI think I've earned a splurging day, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure, whatever.' The canine sighed, knowing it wouldn't be his problem if Kiba chubbed up more than he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo landed before Naruto's door, the nin barely knocking before entering the apartment, Akamaru once again rolling his eyes at his nearly salivating partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOy, Naruto, what'cha cooking?!\u201d Kiba almost shouted, Akamaru finally entering the abode in dismay at his loud friend, the dog's eyes landing on the target of Kiba's enthusiasm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGeeze, dog-breath. No 'hello', no 'how are ya', just nagging about the grub. Rude.\u201d While his tone was condescending (Which was a tone they didn't realize he had before they joined him for meals), the teasing smirk and giddy glint in his eyes told a different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoining Naruto's side at the table, Kiba threw a quick look at the nimble clone currently cooking up a feast before his eyes returned to the corpulent blonde beside him, said blonde lazily slumping in his chair without a shirt on, showing off his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, gotta use your lazy ass for something.\u201d He snarked back, earning a kick which he manly (With a tear in his eye and a grimace) ignored in favor of looking the blonde over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn direct contrast with Kiba, Naruto had seemingly forgotten all thoughts about his original purpose of the diet, and had taken this as an opportunity to relax and hang around the dog-nin. And, unlike the dog-nin, had seemed to lose all restraints when it came to gorging himself silly at every chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's face, (Which he noticed had a small spot of chocolate at the corner of his mouth, showing that he had already started the day with a snack) which had lost all the baby-fat from his youth had gained it back several-folds. His cheeks were round, stretching his whisker-like marks out somewhat, and his double-chin covered what neck he had, the hanging flesh seemingly moments away from gaining another friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a lot wider than even a week ago, the fat on his shoulders covering what neck his double-chin didn't, and his arms had blimped up, covering the limbs in several layers of fat, the adipose jiggling whenever he used them. Even the fingers had become bigger, resembling sausages more and more as the days passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest was surprisingly small considering his size, though it still put his female team-mate's own pair to shame. Then again, hers were probably a bit firmer than Naruto's flabby pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis butt and legs had expanded tremendously, quickly forcing the fat blonde to stop using his normal pants and switching over to a larger pair of orange sweat-pants, else he'd rip them apart due to his growth. His thighs had expanded to such a degree that it forced Naruto to waddle wherever he went, sending his entire body wobbling along. Not that he seemed to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the grand prize which expanded further and wider than any other part of him. Sitting a mere inch away from his knees, the massive mass of flesh quivered with each breath and slight movement the blonde did, the great gut a true testament to the blonde's dive into gluttony. It wrapped around his torso, forming several folds and love-handles that made him seem even wider, making his fattened-up arms slightly struggle with resting straight down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he did that much anyway, sitting as he did now, his corpulent arms resting atop that globular gut of his, the mass looking even more bloated after the obviously large snack he had earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the still-thin clone set the food at the table, Kiba rolling his eyes in good humor at the multitude of pots filled with ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d He grumbled, serving himself a large serving of the feast before him, Naruto beside him already having stuffed some noodles in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlurping them up, he sent a grin Kiba's way, raising more noodles to his mouth. \u201cHey, you'll get some delicious meat later, so I get some delicious ramen now.\u201d With that, he went back to the gorging, the clone setting down a nice steak for Akamaru before dispelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was relatively silent as they ate, if one ignored the slurping and grunting from both of them. Even from Akamaru's angle though, it was quite easy to see who ate more out of the two of them, the slowly inflating middle of the blonde quickly telling him the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, the dog curled up for a nap, satisfied with his steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilling up his large bowl with seconds, Kiba sent a glance at his friend, the glance turning into a stare as he looked at the gorging blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving already finished off one of the hefty pots, the blonde had seemingly given up on his bowl and just dove straight into a second pot. His gut,large before the meal, was already looking quite bloated after the first pot, having expanded in all directions. The addition of the second pot, which was gulped up at an extreme pace by Naruto, only increased the bloated look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stared on as Naruto's gut slowly grew, finally passing his knees, and growing wider and wider, making his love-handles look even bigger stretching his sweatpants slightly. Even the top was starting to edge upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the end of the second pot was found, Naruto's stomach grazed the table even with the distance he sat from it. Licking both his lips and the pot clean, he let out a burp and a sigh as he put his arm to the side, letting the pot hit the floor, a smile on his chubby face. Soon though, his eyes zeroed in on the third and biggest pot, and he started to stretch towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesmerized, Kiba lifted the huge, almost over-filled pot of ramen to the blonde, his own bowl and significantly smaller pot forgotten. With a giddy smile Naruto tilted the large pot, sending a steady stream of broth and noodles down his gaping mouth, gulping it up as quickly as possible, not a drop being wasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people would be surprised that Naruto managed to gulp down ramen without spilling any, but it wouldn't surprise Kiba in the slightest if Naruto had mastered the art of rapid ramen consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly growing larger and larger, Kiba watched as the blonde's gut expand, slowly pressing more and more into the table, forcing his love-handles bigger, his pants wider, and pushing his fat pecs higher. As it grew larger though, Kiba noticed that Naruto chugged down the ramen slower than before, apparently nearing his limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This.' Naruto thought to himself as the pressure in his stomach grew stronger. 'Might have been a bad idea.' It was quite understandable too, as the amount of food he had consumed was already more than he had ever eaten in one sitting, and he still had half the pot to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the struggle Naruto was in, Kiba grew an impish grin as an idea sprung to his find. Patting the massively bloated mass in a patronizing way, Kiba gave the blonde a challenging look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on man, giving up already? Laaaaame, I thought you were better than that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a massive burp, Naruto looked at Kiba with ire in his eyes. \u201cSays you who've barely eaten anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, not everyone loves ramen like you do.\u201d His smirk grew wider, slightly pressing into the still-soft mass of flesh. \u201cOr are you telling me you don't love the stuff anymore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemingly did it, as with an angry \u201cI'll show you who doesn't love ramen!\u201d, the blonde lifted the pot back up, regaining his previous fervor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each massive gulp that sent a tremor through his body, Naruto's stomach continued to expand to greater sizes, digging further and further into the table, getting wider and wider, taller and taller. Kiba kept his hand on the expanding adipose, feeling as it slowly moved and rose, the smirk on his face growing wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the end of the pot approached, a sheen of sweat having appeared on Naruto's brow with the absolutely ludicrous amount of food he had forced into himself, far greater than any amount before. As the final drop fell into his mouth, Naruto swallowed, then groaned in both pain and success. He sent a dopey look towards Kiba as the dog-boy took the pot away from him, victory clear on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow... Who doesn't... Love ramen?\u201d He panted, his arms laying limp atop the monumental girth he was sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I dunno. After all, there's still a lot of this pot left.\u201d He lifted the mostly-full pot that was left, which while not the smallest one, it still wasn't as big as the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan Naruto stared at the last pot, a pensive frown on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, it's still delicious.\u201d He let the aroma of the ramen hit the blonde, looking at the calculating look on Naruto's face.</span></div></div>",

Kiba thought to himself, looking at the almost balloon-like sack that expanded beyond reach from Naruto himself, far bigger than earlier. Due to it's overfilled state, not only had it expanded outwards and upwards, but also sideways, making him look even wider than he actually was, stretching his sweatpants even more. Still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh, what's this pot compared to the rest?\u201d He brought the ramen closer to the corpulent blonde, using his foot to sneakily push the table to the side and away from the packed gut to ease the blonde's discomfort while Naruto focused on the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother low groan was his answer as Naruto stared at the noodles, his hunger for ramen still rearing it's head, yet the state of his gut made him hesitate. Another idea flicked through Kiba's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I hold and tilt, and you just gulp it down as fast as possible? We'll probably get rid of it before your gut says no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned as his eyes flicked between the oh-so delicious food and Kiba's eager face. He always wanted more ramen, but this was really starting to overdo it. Still though, it was ramen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl left his gut, and the two of them looked at it in wonder, mistaking the churning sound for hunger. Kiba's gleeful smile stretched wider as he brought the pot over Naruto's head, ready to tilt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the gut has spoken, now open up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no other choice (Not that he was resisting at that point), Naruto tilted his head back and opened his mouth wide, silently pleased when the noodles and broth hit his tongue. Slumping a bit, he gulped it down rapidly, his thick hands slowly massaging his aching gut, feeling the overfilled mass slowly stretch underneath his touch, a small thrill going through him despite the discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, while keeping a steady stream going, kept an eye on the expanding adipose, watching it fill up even more, getting wider and taller, stretching the sweatpants even more, slowly edging further and further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Even Chouji would struggle with this amount.' He mused to himself, feeling the weight in his hands lessen slowly but surely as a steady stream disappeared down Naruto's gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, Kiba had to admit to himself that he was pretty impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, not everything good could last forever, as soon enough, the end of the last pot was rapidly approaching. Just in time too it sounded like, as the chair Naruto was currently slumping in was sending out some rather alarming sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last gulp, Naruto let out a sigh, panting where he sat with his eyes closed. Only drops fell from the pot, and Kiba finally put it back on the table beside his own forgotten (Still warm somehow) bowl of ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh.\u201d The blonde moaned in a food-drunken stupor, arms resting lazily atop his massive belly. \u201cI... Kinda <b>Hic</b> overdid it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Gee, you think?' Akamaru snarked, having woken up when Kiba put the cooking pot back on the table. 'Any more, and he'd probably blow.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoking the blonde's side, he had to agree with Akamaru that yeah, it wouldn't really be a good idea to force any more food into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Seriously though, how're we going to get him outta that chair before it breaks?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou underestimate my stubborness.\u201d Kiba snorted as he gave Naruto's side a few pats, watching the fat jiggle as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOy, we gonna move you now.\u201d With that, he grabbed one of Naruto's hand and janked on it. Naruto, having no other choice, slid off the chair on to his feet, almost falling over due to the overfilled mass that he called a stomach sloshed and jiggled back and forth, throwing off his balance, and the sharp ache that went through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit <b>Pant</b> dog-breath, warn me <b>Pant</b> next time!\u201d Another groan left him after that as he gently massaged what he could of the massively protruding adipose, his arms sinking in despite the ballooning look it had, a small sloshing sound being heard due to all the liquid inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah, whatever. Come here now.\u201d Kiba threw an arm around the blonde as best as he could, sinking into the soft mass as he slowly helped the massively overstuffed teen lumber over to his bed, his body, especially his stomach wobbling all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust woke up, and already going back to bed. Lazy, lazy.\u201d He teased, grinning at the blonde in good humor, the corpulent one rolling his eyes as he slowly sunk into the mattress, the bed only slightly creaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS' your fault, making me eat that last bit.\u201d Still, a gloating smirk stretched across his face as he laid back, his stomach standing tall and proud as a testament to his gluttony even as it sunk a bit to the sides, framing his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlame it on me, will ya. Just so you know, I still expect my meaty dinner later today.\u201d Patting the wobbling adipose, he went back to the table to finish his bowl, a soft \u201cSure\u201d emanating from behind him which was soon followed by soft breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know that look.' Akamaru said, staring at his eating partner. 'You're going to stuff him like a turkey, aren't you.' It wasn't a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJupp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Akamaru gave Kiba a disapproving-yet-playful look. 'I expect some extra meat during meals to keep my silence.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the slumbering blonde, a thought hit the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You sure he'll be able to actually make lunch and dinner though? He looks pretty conked out.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that,\" he slurped up the rest of the ramen. \"Is not a problem, as I know where his recipes are. Worst case scenario, I'll make the food myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning at the canine, he stood up and patted his stomach in contentment. \"After all, if Naruto of all people manages to make some good food while following those recipes, then pretty much everyone should be able to do the same.\"</span></div></div>",

Soon, you'll <b>Hic</b> serve me a meal that's still alive!\u201d Looking to his side, he smirked towards the enraptured dog. \u201cThen again, me and Akamaru would have a fun time hunting it down, eh boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh?' Taking his eyes off the massively bloated blonde, he finally registered what Kiba had said. 'Hunting down a rampart meal? Yeah, sounds like a fun time.' squinting inquisitively at the tattoed boy's middle he couldn't help but add 'Not sure I'd let you get to it though, you'd probably eat it all before I'd get a single bite.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, of course I'd share with you.\u201d He groaned playfully, his smirk widening. \u201cWouldn't want you to go hungry after all. Now this guy,\u201d He said, pointing towards a mildly confused Naruto.\u201d He wouldn't share with either of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would totally share with Akamaru!\u201d He defended indignantly. \u201cNever let it be said I torment the poor dog! You on the other hand wouldn't get a bite, 'cause you'd probably eat it all in a single chomp anyway!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes at the squabbling duo, he went back to his not-so-subtle watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru had been somewhat skeptical about this so-called bulking food that Naruto served. Surely, there had to be some other reason for his extraordinary gain in such a small window of time. Maybe a technique or something that Sakura had come up with to help one of her best friends. He highly doubted it could only be the food, no matter what you put in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, these doubts flew out the window pretty quickly as he watched the two of them slowly inflate with fat for each day, the food and their gluttony being far more effective than Akamaru had initially thought. This was even more exasparated by their competetive spirits, making the two of them basically glut themselves to stupidity during each meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, in just over a week, had already outgrown his clothes. His T-shirts, on an empty stomach, still couldn't cover the bottom part of the growing mass, rising just enough to show the small overhang he had grown, and the love-handles that had been slowly sprouting along his sides. His jacket still closed, if only barely, but the dog knew that either this day or the next day would be the last day the garment would zip up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Akamaru didn't complain too much about that, the new flesh on the dog-boy being quite the comfortable pillow for the hound, the last few days having given him some fantastic nights of sleep. If only he could lie on it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, his pants were not in as bad as a situation, not only due to the fact that most of them were stretchy because of their unique moves. It also helped that he seemed to gain more in his torso than he did in his butt and legs, the buttocks having merely perked up some while his legs had simply grown thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face had softened slightly, though nothing all that noticeable, with slightly thicker arms and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, he was still not as big as Naruto was when they found him napping in the woods. Another week of glutting himself like this though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA creak shifted his attention from his life-friend to the blonde, the home-cook nibbling on some leftover food despite the massive gut resting on his lap, and the fact that the chair he was sitting on was making some alarming sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe might think that Kiba had been chubbing up something fierce, though it was nothing compared to Naruto. Driven on by not only his own obliviousness and his wish to get bigger, but also by the competitiveness he shared with Kiba at every meal, the weight he had previously put on had almost found itself doubled, something both Kiba and Akamaru had thought an impossible task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way around it, Naruto was Fat, with a capital F. With each day, the dog team had slowly watched the blonde's gut slowly grow along his lap. The expanding adipose, while empty, having passed the midway point a few days ago, and having steadily enroached upon the massively bloated teen's knees. Akamaru was surprised at how well the blonde's gut held itself up while he was standing, at least compared to Kiba's growing tum that had already started gaining a bit of a droop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Guess people hold their fat differently.' The mutt mused, glancing between the two once again eating teens, the pair finishing off whatever was left on the table. Really, did they ever stop eating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sparetire that was his love-handles had expanded even bigger, having grown past the handfull that they were before, stretching out and making even the new, bigger shirts they've gotten for him form-fitting, having blown the stitches on the old shirts after he tried them on after their first meal together. The dog found himself enarmored by them. They looked so juicy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde's chest had also grown, turning into a pair of pillowy breasts that rested on his growing gut, the size worthy of a decently well-endowed woman. His face has softened even more, stretching out his whiskers a tiny bit, and the double-chin had grown even larger, covering more of his neck, even finding a friend whenever Naruto looked down, the fat bunching up as he did so. Even the blonde's arms had lost whatever musculature they had left, the tissue being hidden behind the new corpulent flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with his upper body, his hips and legs had also taken a fair amount of the weight, forcing the tubster to waddle wherever he went, which sent his extra adipose jiggling everywhere. That, combined with the inflating mass that was his butt, which had started to outgrow the previously mentioned creaking chair, had basically forced the gluttonous demon-container to invest in a new set of pants. A much larger set of pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, at the rate Naruto was growing, it wouldn't take long before they had to take another clothes-shopping trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was definitely more bottom-heavy than Kiba, though it didn't change the fact that his gut was definitely the biggest part of his body. Especially now, as stuffed to the brim as it was, it wedged itself into the table, the fat spilling onto it, and pushing down at the corpulent legs. Yet Naruto still didn't notice how much further away he had to sit comfortably at the table, nor did he notice just how difficult it was for him to bend towards the food, pushing the globular gut even deeper into the table, almost pushing it back towards Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh well,' The dog finally mumbled, gnawing on his bone. 'It's not our problem I guess.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the glutting teens to finish of the rest of the table, Naruto's chair creaking all the while. With one last sigh and burp, the blonde leaned backwards in his chair, feeling his gut settle as he put his chunky hands on it when-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CRACK</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back finally gave away, and with a yelp the rotund teen tumbled to the floor, a resounding thud going through the apartment as his heavy body crashed into the wooden floor, and the house shaking slightly at the impact. His entire body jiggled as he lay there, stunned at what had just happened, his gut rising towards the ceiling like a small mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them stared at the fallen teen, Akamaru in shock, and Kiba in absolute surprise and hilarity. The dog stared at the blonde, there being no doubt in his mind that Naruto would finally realize just how big he was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Staring at the fallen teen, the seconds ticked by as they waited for his response, Kiba shaking in his seat as he valiantly tried to hold in his laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru watched as the blonde softly rubbed his overloaded gut, the fleshy mountain wobbling under his touch, and while he couldn't see his face, there wasn't a single doubt in the dog's mind that the hamster-wheel in Naruto's mind was finally turning. He would finally realize the extent of his gluttonous ways, which in turn would make Kiba notice the growing gut-on-the-go he was sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes.' He mused, his tail wagging slightly. 'While I enjoy the softness, it is time they finally-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, what a crap chair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever hope he had crashed through the very earth itself as he gaped at the blonde in supreme bafflement, his mind being unable to cope with the sheer denial that Naruto was in. Couple that with the window-rattling laughter that finally burst out of Kiba made him want to find something extremely hard to smash his head into... Repeatedly... For the next five years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why?' Akamaru wailed, hiding his head underneath his paws. 'Why am I stuck with these blind idiots?' Truly, he must have done something absolutely horrendous in his past life... Like being a cat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking shit!\u201d The stuffed Inuzuka wheezed out between fits of laughing and breathing, almost falling off his own chair at the force of his own laughter, gut jiggling all the while. Truly, Naruto had to be the king of obliviousness! His guffawing didn't abate as he watched his fat friend struggle a bit with getting up, not only the fat but also the immense amount of food stuffed inside of his gut hindering him in sitting up properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing a bit with the effort, Naruto grumbled inside himself about poorly made chairs and stupid floors, before wincing as his beyond full stomach finally rebelled at the constant movement. With another huff he finally rolled to his side, finding the new position easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto unsteadily raised himself, (Overlooking how his exposed stomach grazed the floor on the way up, and the jello-like wobbling the rest of his body did) he turned towards the desperately gasping and laughing dog lover, his face red in mild tiredness and embarassment as he glared at his friend, seemingly building up for a scatching insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... <b>Snort</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't hold his pouty glare for long, his lips twitching before a broad smile stretched across his face, finally joining in on the merriment of what had just happened. Snickering along with his still laughing buddy, he eased himself down on another one of his chairs, the wooden object creaking sharply in protest, but thankfully holding up the clueless teen. The small cracks that appeared where the legs started told Kiba that it wouldn't hold for too long though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We were so close.' The hound mourned, looking at the broken back-rest that almost made Naruto realize how fat he currently was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\u2026 At least they got a laugh out of it.' Akamaru sighed, looking at Kiba who finally was getting his breathing back under control, and Naruto who was staring at the broken chair in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap, I gotta buy a new chair now.\u201d Glancing down, and seeing the struggling legs like Akamaru did, Kiba took a moment to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... Maybe you should buy a whole new, stronger set.\u201d Shrugging at the questioning look Naruto sent him, he hid away the slightly excited expression on his face at the though of Naruto breaking sturdier furniture. \u201cIt would be a waste if you got the same stuff that'll just break like that one did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrumming his fingers atop his soft belly, he nodded in agreement. \u201cTrue. I guess I'm lucky there's a sale tomorrow then, as I've got the money since you've started helping with the food bills.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh, I'd feel bad if I ate here every day without giving something back.\u201d With a shrug and a grunt, he stood from the chair and lumbered towards the couch, rubbing his exposed, distended stomach. \u201cNow though, I'm going to sit here and digest.\u201d He grunted as he dropped down on the soft seat, a pleased sigh leaving him. A few moments later, with the floorboards creaking slightly at his weight, the blonde basically fell besides the happily resting teen, making him jump slightly in his seat, and making the apartment shake a bit due to the force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm totally up for that idea.\u201d The blonde sighed as he leaned back, massaging his filled-to-the-brim stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only a few minutes before the massive blonde feel asleep, softly snoring besides the staring Kiba, hands resting atop the slightly jiggling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, he's really gotten big, hasn't he?\u201d He mumbled, his curiosity and excitement getting the better of him as he started softly touching the almost pillow-like love-handle that was exposed after their gargantuan meal. \u201cLook at this, I can't even properly hold it.\u201d He squeezed the fat to show what he meant, only managing to hold parts of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah.' He could barely resist pressing his snout into the massive ball of fat that was Naruto's stomach, the feat being quite simple due to the adipose barely being an inch away from the slumbering teen's knees. 'Are you sure you should grope him like that?' He inquired as he watched Kiba poking and squeezing Naruto's moobs, slightly worried he would wake up from his nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto sleeps deeper than a stone, even blowing up his house probably wouldn't wake him up.\u201d Taking the sizeable breasts in his hands, he gave both a squeeze, marveling at the softness. \u201cDamn they're soft.\u201d He whispered, giving them another fondle before finally letting his hands drop atop the grand prize, Naruto's hands dropping along his fleshy sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen again,\u201d He started, his hands pressing down on the squishy sack of fat, a grin stretching across his face, \u201cEvery part of him is soft nowadays.\u201d Massaging the exposed flesh, he was enraptured by the feeling of the malleable mass moving under his touch, the gut hiding a certain firmness due to the food still stuffed inside of it, and the sight of the flesh wobbling around, sending tremors throughout Naruto's entire torso, even the double-chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder how he'd be if he was even bigger.\u201d He whispered, leaning closer to get more access to the hypnotizing belly, ignoring how his own smaller gut pressed into Naruto's corpulent side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you sure that's smart?' Akamaru finally interjected, gazing sternly at the still massaging teen. 'I know that nothing's going on with missions and stuff, so we don't have to worry there, but he's already really big.' Poking his nose into the gut while trying his hardest not to get enamored by the softness, he gave the fat teen a critical look. 'Then again, with the way he's eating, he will probably get bigger even without our help.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly, he'd get bigger no matter what.\u201d Pushing his hands deeper into the fat, he forced out a burp from the blonde, the teen shifting slightly in his sleep. \u201cPlus, you gotta admit that the extra weight looks pretty good on him.\u201d He gave the dog a grin as he finally nuzzled his cheek into the wobbling dome, deciding that yes, he would serve as a nice pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, he finally gave Kiba a wolfish smile, jumping on the tattoed teen's lap as his partner pressed his back into Naruto's side, grinning in satisfaction at the softness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess you're right.' He finally agreed, laying his head on Kiba's soft belly. 'Plus,' he smirked, glancing towards the kitchen, 'I wouldn't wanna give up his steaks, they're pretty delicious.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle and a headrub, he finally relaxed into Naruto, internally excited about the days to come.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto was silent for a minute, which was really long for him. Kiba's mind raced as he panicked, realizing that Naruto was probably piecing together the idea that he was starting to get fat. Kiba was worried that Naruto would stop getting fatter, and he didn't want that to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, meanwhile, was poking his belly experimentally, as if trying to determine if it was actually there. \"Have I really just been getting fatter the whole time?\" Naruto thought, his face starting to flash red in embarrassment. He had watched it happened to Kiba, but he never thought it'd happen to him, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then said, \"Hey Kiba, I think I'm getting fat.\" Kiba scratched the back of his head and giggled a bit, saying, \"What are you talking about? You just look healthy!\". Naruto, ignoring the comment, said, \"It looks like it's happening to you, too.\" as he patted Kiba's belly, causing him to blush brightly. Naruto figured that he could at least go through this with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba said, \"Yeah, like you're one to talk!\", and he patted Naruto's belly back, enjoying the feeling of it wobbling in response. He wouldn't hold back now that Naruto was aware of his fatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quickly went back to his cheery self, saying, \"Well that means we'll just have to exercise and train extra hard! Let's go!\". Despite his rotundness, Naruto didn't lose his energy. He bounded out the door with Kiba and Akamaru in tow. Both boys had gotten more clumsy with their added weight. Naruto especially almost tumbled over himself as he wasn't used to so much momentum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went to the nearest training grounds in the forest. Even after just getting there, both boys were panting and had to take a breather. The two started sparring, but got tired soon. They tried working on their taijutsu, but again they got tired fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of hours of struggling through a workout, the two were beat. Kiba's belly growled loudly, and he said, \"I'm starting to work up an appetite! I think we've earned a meal!\". Naruto said, \"We need to keep exercising, though!\", but when a loud rumble erupted from his large belly, he said, \"I guess you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba said, \"I'm gonna pick up some meat. I gotta make it up to you somehow!\" and he lumbered off to the Inuzuka area of the village with Akamaru. Naruto said, \"Alright, see you soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba knew a really good butcher. She was an Inuzuka genin who never really went on missions unless necessary. She was a skilled hunter, and she had a huge variety of meats. She was also famous for the quality of her meats. Even the barbecue place bought meat from her! She was a little rough around the edges, but she liked Kiba, and she had watched him grow up. She gave him great discounts and this time, she had a surplus of steaks, so Kiba got some for free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he got back to Naruto's place, and Naruto was busy making noodles for ramen. \"I brought meat!\" Kiba said as armfulls of packages made it onto the table. Naruto put some of it away, but kept out a good amount for Kiba. He knew that Kiba loved meat, so he might as well stick to Kiba's favorite food group!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was soon pulling out food from the kitchen. Akamaru got some chicken and rice this time, while Kiba got a pile of juicy, rare steaks. \"At least I can still out-eat you!\" Naruto said before Kiba said, \"We'll see about that! You'll need to get me more steaks twice before you finish that pot!\" \"Here they go again.\" Akamaru thought as Kiba just grabbed the steak with his hands, taking huge bites out of it. Naruto was getting a stream of pasta going at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, both of them were sitting back with bloated bellies, Kiba's belly being more noticeably just because he wasn't as fat. It stuck out to his knees, being stuffed to the brim. Naruto's belly wasn't as noticeable, but it was bigger sticking out way past his knees, and nearly twice as wide as the rest of his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, the two fell asleep soon afterwards. Now that the two were aware of their fatness, they...</span></div></div>",

His loose pants were starting to be pushed down by his growing muffin top while getting tighter around the ass and thigh areas. His neck was slowly getting thicker and pressing against his collar; Naruto, slightly uncomfortable with the tightness around his neck undid the top part of his jacket zipper a full double chin finally visible for the world to see. His chest, usually hard from all his training and adventures had a slight softness to them and looked slightly swollen. However the biggest gain was centralized in his stomach, the expanding mass already filling his jacket quite nicely in Hinata's opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata needed to get Naruto away from these people before someone decided to be \"helpful\" and point out his weight to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut....Hinata bit her bottom lip; the mere idea of watching Naruto grow out of his own clothes and become panicked or embarrassed in front of all these people excited her more then anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, decisions....</span></div></div>",

I have been training hard, and I do deserve a ramen break. Come on, let's go.\" With that, Naruto grabbed her hand and started dragging her towards the ramen stand where he always ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata, through supreme force of will, just barely managed to avoid fainting. As they headed towards the ramen stand, Hinata couldn't help but smile, not just because Naruto was holding her hand, but because of how well her plan was going. For the longest time, Hinata had admired Naruto and she for just as long she had fantasized about how much cuter he were fat. And not just chubby, but obese. Maybe even, dare she think it, immobile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she recently decided to act upon these dreams and devised a plan to make her dreams a reality and now she was finally putting it into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the ramen stand, Naruto immediately placed his usual order of 12 ramen bowls and Hinata ordered the same, knowing she wouldn't be able to finish it. She ignored the odd looks she recieved, and simply focused on Naruto, immagining how huge he would be once she had completed her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orders soon arrived and as she predicted, Hinata felt too full to finish the rest after the first two bowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-kun, I seem to have ordered too much and I c-can't finish it. Could you please do it for me?\" Hinata whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Hinata,\" Naruto yelled, hating to see food wasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 20 minuites, Naruto had finished all the ramen while Hinata simply watched. By this point, Naruto was feeling pretty full and was getting ready to leave.<br>\r\nWhen Hinata noticed this she said, \"wait, Naruto-kun! Don't you want some more! After all, you've worked so hard, you deffinatly deserve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Naruto couldn't help but agree with her. And so it continued for the next 40 or so minutes. Naruto would eat more and more ramen, ignoring the growing tightness in his stomach and his jacket, as Hinata encouraged him with phrases like, \"you deserve it,\" \"you need to keep your strength up for all that training,\" and \"I know you can finish it Naruto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Naruto could ignore it no more and decided that he had had enough and went to leave. By this point, Naruto's gut was extended like a several inches out, spliting open his jacket and causing his shirt to ride up, and was completely taunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto was standing up, Hinata rushed to his side, after paying for the meal. She immediatly apologized for having made him over eat so much. Naruto just waved it off saying he enjoyed it and that he can easily just work it off in training. still Hinata insisted on walking him home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived, Hinata noticed Naruto making a slight wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-kun! What's wrong?!\" Hinata gasped out in alarm and worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing Hinata, my stomach just hurts a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well here, let me help you, oh I knew I shouldn't have made you over eat so much.\" And with that she led him over to his bed and made him lie down on it, giving him no room for arguement. She then began to gently rub his over stuffed belly, pushing a small amount of chakra in to help sooth Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was soon yawning and fast asleep under Hinata's ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hinata was certain he was asleep, she stopped and made the hand signs for her newest justu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow clone justsu,\" she whispered, being careful not to awaken Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there were three poofs of smoke, and from then emerged three more Hinatas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without any need for communication, they each set off to complete their part of the plan. The first clone set out into Naruto's kitchen, and began replacing all of his ramen, which was the only food he really had, and replacing them with larger, more fattening ones. The second went into Naruto's waredrobe and started to do a little bit of sowwing work, making Naruto's clothes all slightly looser, so that Naruto wouldn't notice his weight gain. The third began to gently inscribe a seal on Naruto's back, after gently rolling him over. The seal would constantly suck chakra out of Naruto, and Naruto, given his short attention span and horrid chakra control, would never notice. This would make all training exercises that much harder for Naruto and would make him think he's done more training than he actually has. She then began to construct a seal that would cast a constant henge over Naruto, hiding both his gain and that his clothes were getting larger, using chakra from the first seal, so as to truely keep Naruto in the dark about it. Finally, she included one last seal which would act as both a chakra transferer and disrupter. Simply put, it will ruin Naruto's chakra control even further, making ninjutsu training much harder, as well as taking the chakra that is absorbed from Naruto and transfer it to another seal that Hinata has allowing her use Naruto's chakra to strength herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she'll need it. Not only does she have to continue tricking Naruto until he is too far along in the fattening process to lose the weight and even then, she still needs to be able take care of him, because as things progress, he will become less and less able to do so himself, until he finally becomes immobile. Oh, Hinata was becoming aroused just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the origional Hinata began the most crucial, and most enjoyable portion of her plan. First, she gently began to rub Naruto's belly again, only this time the chakra was beging used not just to sooth Naruto and keep him asleep, but also to help speed up the digestion process and convert it all to fat. Next, she moved on to Naruto's muscles, only this time the chakra was being used to cause the muscles to shrink, again making training harder for Naruto and preventing him from wokring it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these factors would combine to make Naruto both fatter and weaker, and thus more dependent on her and lazier. If things continued this smoothly, then Hinata would soon become an irreplacable part of the life of an obese Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in mind, Hinata silently crept out with a smile on her face, telling her clones to dispell themselves as soon as they finished their tasks.</span></div></div>",

An extremely large lunch basket in her hands, filled to the brim with delicious food.  She needed to reduce Naruto's frequentcy to Ichiruku ramen.  The second part of Hinata's plan was much eaiser than the first.  She needed to take Naruto to different restaurants each day so that Teichu and Ayame from the Ramen stand could in no way inhibit her plans.  If they noticed Naruto eating more they might comment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto noticed her presence he grinned widely at her, causing the girl to smile shyly in response.  Naruto walked up to her with an easy grace, but she noticed with a great deal of satisfaction, that he did so slower than he normally would.  There was a great deal of sweat on the boys brow as well.  \"What's up Hinata? What are you doing here?\"  Naruto asked curiously.  Now was the time to put her plan into action.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked at the floor, making sure to make her lip quiver, and voice tremor.  \"I... I worked so hard to make this huge picnic for my family, but they canceled on me last minute.  It's going to be very embarressing to walk all the way back to the Hyuuga residence with a full picnic basket.  People might think I was stood up on a date or something.\"  Hinata whispered out.  Oh this was evil, she knew Naruto's kind heart well, and manipulating it was very evil.  In this case though evilness paid by the pound.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised his hands instantly in a comforting motion.  \"Hey, hey there, don't be sad.  Tell you what, why don't we eat as much of it as possible here and then all take the leftovers home so no one sees you with it full.  It's the least I can do after you treated me last night!\" Naruto said with a grin.  Hinata smiled at him.  \"Thank you so much Naruto-kun!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata happily went about setting up the picnic, making sure to place the fattest of the foods in front of the boy, she doubted he knew the difference between extremely loaded potatoes and a small baked potato any way so he wouldn't notice the arrangement.  As they dug into the food Hinata conversed with Naruto the whole time, easily enjoying the blondes relaxed cheerful nature, and carefully eating the lightest and lowest calorie food she'd brought.  When she noticed Naruto slowing down in eating she boldly remarked that only someone with a particularly strong stomach could stand her food and she understood that Naruto didn't want to eat any more.  The alarm and immediate reassurance that she was a wonderful cook followed by the inhaling of food made her feel a bit guilty but she quickly pushed that aside when she thought of the end result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwice more Naruto looked like he wanted to throw in the towl but the quiet comments of self doubt from Hinata had Naruto painfully shoving in the last bread role and swallowing with a large grin.  He looked a little queasy and his stomach looked ready to pop but the young teen had a triumphant smirk on his lips before letting out a rather large burt.  Naruto blushed and rubbed the back of his head with a laugh.  \"Your cooking was absolutely fantastic Hinata!\" Naruto told her sternly.  Hinata smiled and nodded.  \"I'm so glad you liked it, I guess I am a good cook.\"  Hinata said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed in relief, letting himself fall back onto the grass, his large taut stomach follow his lead and sticking out in the air like a balloon.  Hinata got up and walked over to Naruto, sitting directly beside the blonde while he let out a slight groan.  \"Are you okay Naruto-kun?\" Hinata asked gingerly, blushing lightly as she looked at his oversized belly spilling over his pants.  The genjutsu would settle around him in a few minutes and he would look normal.  \"Y-yeah I just ate a little too much.\" Naruto replied.  Hinata smiled.  \"Would you like me to rub your stomach for you?\" She asked softly.  Naruto smiled but nodded his head.  \"I need to get back to training.\"  Naruto told her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely that can wait a few minutes and beside if your stomach hurts you might make it worse by moving too soon.\" Hinata pointed out.  Naruto thought it over and decided that that made a lot of sense.  So Hinata gently tugged up Naruto's black shirt and began her minstruations of the bulging, overstuffed belly, lulling Naruto to sleep in the process.  Hinata giggled.  That had worked ten times better than she'd anticipated.  It was around this time that the genjutsu began to take affect and hid Naruto's newly acquired girth.  She sighed sadly, already missing the extra weight on the boy's form.  She quickly sealed away the basket in a scroll on her waist and stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trained while Naruto slept, slyly using a genjutsu to keep the boy asleep much longer than a normal nap, and waking him up when dinner time arrived.  He awoke with a start and shot up from his lying position.  He noted the darkness around them and visbly frowned.  \"How long did I sleep?\" Naruto asked in shock.  Hinata smiled.  \"When you fell asleep I went ahead and brought my basket home and came back and you were still sleeping.  You looked really tired, probably from all the hard training you were doing before I got here, so I didn't have the heart to wake you.  I decided to train and wait till you woke up, but you never did.  I figured you'd probably want to get out of here.\" Hinata explained easily.  Naruto nodded at the explanation in acceptance.  Hinata wouldn't lie to him after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I don't normally sleep that long, maybe it was cause I ate so much at lunch?\" Naruto asked himself.  Hinata panicked on the inside, but smiled on the outside.  \"I doubt it.\" Hinata said before gracefully standing up.  Naruto moved to do the same and frowned as he felt heavier than he remembered.  \"Maybe I should cut back on the eating.\" Naruto muttered.  Hinata really panicked now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled broadly before sticking out a finger and gently poking the toned stomach the genjutsu showed the world.  \"Seriously Naruto are you going anorexic on me?  Your skin and bones you don't need to cut back on eating.\" Hinata said with a quiet laugh.  Naruto looked down at himself before smiling broadly at her and pretending to be insulted.  \"That is all muscle.\"<br>\r\n____________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata some how convinced Naruto to go to a dango shop for dinner.  Once more she ordered too much for herself, and puppy eyed Naruto into eating his portion as well as most of hers, which was a generous portion indeed.  Then, purely by coincidence and not because Hinata had paid the man off or anything, the chief came out of the back with a huge birthday cake and set it in front of Naruto.  The man began to sing a merry birthday tune when Naruto politely apologized and said that it was, indeed, not his birthday.  The chef then frowned and said that the person sitting at table nine, their table was to have a cake delivered at seven and if the person hadn't shown up then to claim the cake then it would be thrown away.  The chef then smiled hugely and declared that he refused to have decent cake thrown away and that Naruto would take it home with him.  Naruto had gaped at the man, trying to tell him that he really shouldn't be having cake, only to have the man burst into tears and scream about how no one wanted his cake.  Naruto, being the sweet naive soul he was, felt bad and told him he would eat every bite.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef had then turned around with a glint in his eyes and called 'I don't believe you! Prove it!'  Shoving a fork into Naruto's hand.  Naruto had gaped at the man and then at the cake.  However when the chef started to tear up again Naruto had dug into the rather large chocolet cake.  Hinata had watched, silently cackling in glee, and noting that she would be tipping the man big for his wonderful performance.  Naruto looked just about dead as he forcefully shoved the last bite into his mouth.  The teens stomach was enormous and taut.  Four inches more and it would have touched the table.  Naruto loudly groaned and tried to stand up but found that the task was too much.  Luckily Hinata was right there to catch him and slung one of his arms around her shoulder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Naruto-kun, we should get you home.\"  Naruto nodded, unable to argue, before they headed in the direction of his apartment.  When they entered Naruto sat down on the bed with a groan.  Hinata didn't bother asking this time around and quietly began to rub Naruto's tummy, the large thing stretched to the max, Naruto was soon asleep.  As she'd done before she gently used her medical knowledge to will the digestion along and into fat as well as sending chakra into his muscles to weaken them..  Then, quickly, Hinata removed the genjutsu to gain a view of the real Naruto.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed sagged a little.  The belly enlarge several inches.  The shirt was forced away from the extremely bloated stomach.  There were purple stretch marks along the edges.  Hinata knew that it would be a few days before all the consumed food moved to other parts of the boys body but she could wait.  It was fascinating to look at the rather large mound of a stomach Naruto was sporting to the rest of his much thinner body.  She would leave the blonde alone for a couple days after this. After all it was only the beginning of her plans... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a reason that Hinata had started with her plan now of all times.  Every five years there is a series of festival celebrations in the fire capital.  It had taken several strings being pulled with her airess name to make sure that she and Naruto were sent on a mission alone during the same period.  It was a simple mission really.  Deliver an important scroll of information to the capital and wait for the fire lord to reply, which ALWAYS took several weeks, before returning to Konoha.  She even paid the extra money for a nice leaisurely boat ride back down the river so that the most her dear, hopefully extremely fat, Naruto wouldn't have to walk more than a mile or so back to the village.  You see, these series of festivals that lasted two full weeks, was famous for its eating contests and food tasting competitions.  It had caught her eye a few years ago and the idea stuck with her ever sense.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally a single individual was anonymously nominated out of a large barrel of names collected over a series of weeks before the festival began, but her father was well acquainted with the manager of the event and with a few words here and there in her visits to the capital she'd managed to sway the man to have Naruto nominated as one of these 'tastetesters' for the full two weeks.  That would most certainly give Naruto enormous dinners every night.  Next were the eating competitions in the mornings and early afternoons that she knew she could puppy dog plea him into going into to win her whatever silly prizes they gave out.  It was perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata hadn't seen Naruto in nearly a week, silently wondering how much the boy had gained from the rigged extra fatty food she'd stored in his home.  She'd gone to his home only once in mid afternoon the other day to up the size in his clothes.  Today though, today Tsunade had called the two of them into her office, as she expected.  The young Hyuuga easily made her way into the tower, nodding at Shizune the Hokages assistent, before preceding in.  Naruto was there already, but she could see a slight trail of sweat down the side of her face already from the short run from his apartment.  She smiled.  Naruto 'looked' the same, meaning the genjutsu was holding up beautifully, before standing to attention as Tsunade coughed.  The old, young looking woman merely relayed the same information she already knew and announced that they must depart before twelve that afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata left to grab the bag she packed and quickly made it to the North gate to wait for Naruto.  The blonde barely made it by the twelve-o-clock deadline.  He seemed confused by that fact, but pride seemed to be keeping him from saying anything about it because he kept silent.  They took off, Hinata carefully slowing herself down to Narutos slightly sluggish pace, and started to converse with him.  It was like that the whole 17 hour journey, though they had to take five different stops for Naruto, and when they stopped for lunch Hinata was dissapointed to see that Naruto only ate a little.  <br>\r\n______________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night after they'd delivered the scroll and decided upon a joint-room hotel Naruto practically fell asleep the moment he touched the bed.  His body exasted from the travel.  Hinata smiled as she entered Naruto's room and excitedly let the genjutsu drop.  She wasn't dissapointed by what she saw at all.  The hundred and twenty pound shinobi of two weeks ago was now looking to be pushing one-fifty.  She stood there, enjoying the view of Naruto's bulging ass, because the blonde had fallen asleep on his stomach.  The teen now had a thick waist and the pants he wore would be tight on him again soon.  She idly wondered if she could get him on a scale without him knowing but threw the idea out.  She was good enough at gouging a persons size that she felt comfortable that her estimates were correct.<br>\r\n_________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at her incredulously.  Hinata stared up at him, eyes watery and big.  \"A... teddy bear?\" Naruto asked uncertainly.  Naruto looked at the sign.  'Fudge Eating contest' before looking toward the contestents signing up.  They were big.  \"Um... I... I don't think I could beat these people Hinata.  Their huge.\"  Naruto said as he blinked.  Hinata tilted her head in astonishment.  \"Your giving up before you even try?\" Hinata asked, moving her fingers in front of her in the most vulnerable and miserable way possible.  \"I guess I could at least try...\" Hook. Line. And. Sinker.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had to admit that Naruto really did try his hardest to win her the silly bear.  In fact even though he was the smallest person there, even without the genjutsu, Naruto still made it in third place out of fifteen competitors.  Naruto sat at the end of the table, looking as if he was going to throw up, and with his belly unnaturally extented out.  \"Oh, that's okay Naruto, thanking for trying so hard.\" Hinata said sincerely, helping the boy to his feet.  Naruto really was the sweetest guy out there.  They weren't even officially dating and he'd do anything for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite a few people snickered at the blondes protruding gut, causing Naruto to blush horribly, despite feeling a little guilty she found the look adorable.  When Naruto finally realized how big he'd gotten she was sure he would look like this quite a lot.  Blushing adorably.  They sat down on one of the benches in front of the stage that Hinata knew in a few minutes would be announcing Naruto's name as a tasteter.  Naruto leaned back, trying not to think about how much his stomach ached, and looked down at his extended belly.  'Urgh... this will take me a full day of training to work off,' the blonde thought distainfully.  He hadn't even won the fricking bear and now Hinata was dissapointed in him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched as the Manager of the Festival walked on stage and pulled out an envelope.  \"In here are the names of five winners who will recieve the honorable award of being tastesters for the next full two weeks.\"  Naruto heard some murmuring from the people, obviously some kind of change in the usual had been done.  Naruto shrugged it wasn't like it concerned him.  \"The winners must give great consideration to each and every entry.  They will represent the opinion for many wanna be restaurant owners and their futures are in your hands.\"  'No pressure though,' Naruto thought with a laugh.  \"The winners are Saro Rine, Fuji Hoes, Chidorn Lie, Dan Morn, and Naruto Uzumaki.\"  Naruto leaned forward from his laid back position and stared at the man in horror.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!  No, I decline.\" Naruto said immediately.  An arm gripped a hold of his own arm to stop him from going up to the Festival director and telling him.  \"Naruto you can't do that!\" Hinata whispered to him.  He stared at her as if she'd gone crazy.  \"Why not?\" Naruto asked.  \"The position of tastester is considered an extremely honored position for the festival.  Your name was entered so to decline after you've won would be like going up to the fire lord and slapping him in the face.\" Hinata explained to the boy's growing horror.  \"But I didn't even enter my name!\" Naruto told her adamently.  Hinata shook her head. \" It doesn't matter.  And if you tried to explain that to the festival director he would take it as a great offense.  As a Konoha shinobi you can't go against this without damaging the relation between Konoha and the capital.\" Hinata said sternly.  Naruto wanted to cry.  Why him?  How in the world would he lose the weight he was sure to gain with this? Naruto dropped his head in resignation.<br>\r\n_______________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hundred decent bites of cake the first night. Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hot dog eating contest for a stupid elephant the second afternoon. Which he didn't get.  Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowed by tasting a hundred and twenty-five different chilli soups. Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third night he took a fork worth from two hundred types of spagetti. Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForth morning: A large cat toy was the prize for outeating everyone in rice balls. Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForth night he tasted seventy six pieces of dango. Check.  <br>\r\nHinata kindly bought him bigger pants when his ripped in public that very night.  Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifth night he took a bite of two hundred and thirty three pies. Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajor difficulty getting up the next morning. Check.<br>\r\nEighty different squashes he had to take a bite of that night. Check.<br>\r\nHe noticed that strangely enough he really wasn't gaining that much from the binges of tastesting. Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seventh morning Naruto caught Hinata looking longingly at a fluffy fox plushy.  The prize of an ice cream eating contest.  Gave up and volunteered to enter this time.  Won it. Check.<br>\r\nCookies that night.  He was expected to eat one of eat batch out of fifty differnt kinds. Check.    Major vomiting. Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSushi was the eighth night.  A bite of a hundred and eighten of them. Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBread the ninth. Cheese the tenth. Noodle the eleventh. Teas the twelth.  Curry the thirteeth. Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had a horrendously hard time getting up the next day.  All the other tasters were exceptionally large people and had gained very little.  While Naruto looked like he was about a hundred and thirty pounds he felt like he was a hell of a lot heavier.  Hinata was in an immensely happy mood for some reason.  Naruto was just happy to have the damn scroll and that they were leaving first thing tommorow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto attempted to get up but sighed in an annoyed huff when he just fell back onto his back.  Naruto rocked himself, once, twice up-sa-daisy.  Naruto made it to his feet unsteadily before reaching for his pants and tugging them on.  Naruto frowned and looked down.  Last night they'd been so tight he thought they'd kill him, now they seemed a little loose.  Weird.<br>\r\n_________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata Hyuuga could not be happier than she was that fourteen night.  She snuck into Naruto's room and with a squeak of excitement allowed the genjutsu to drop for her eyes alone.  Naruto was officially greatly obese at a whopping... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything about Naruto was now huge. His face ws now round with fat, checks swollen and a definite double chin had formed, making it all the cuter in Hinata's opinion. His arms were now padded with fat, all the way down to his hands, which were starting to look like sausages. His legs were now so thick that Naruto would be waddling more than walking, and running was out of the question. His butt was huge, maybe two feet wide, and Hinata loved every inch of it. But the biggest part of Naruto was his belly. It stuck at least two feet in the air and spilled out around Naruto, framing his once thin frame. And to top it all off, was a pair of moobs twice the size of Hinata's fist resting on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Naruto was gorgeous in Hinata's eyes. She struggled to resist the urge to just jump on Naruto and shower him with kisses, forcing herself to make do with rubbing his enormous belly, sending in more chakra. Soon, thought Hinata, joyfully immersed both in her task and her plans for the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata quietly stepped into Naruto's room, making sure not to wake him as she made sure her genjutsu was firmly in place before she walked over to Naruto's sleeping form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-kun, its time to wake up,\" she said softly, gently nudging his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, morning already,\" Naruto said as he rubbed his eye slowly, moving to try and rise out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata swiftly moved to Naruto's side to help him up. Naruto would have found it difficult to move that much weight before Hinata put her plan into motion. Now that she was so far along, it was a miracle he had began able to get up on his own these few days. Hinata, however, could move him with ease. For as Naruto grew weaker, Hinata had grown stronger, through both the seals and her own training.<br>\r\nWith Naruto now on his feet, Hinata walked out of the apartment to wait for him to get ready. Once outside, she activated her byakugan and watched as Naruto slowly got ready, grinning all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Naruto said with a grin, happy to be leaving at last. And with that, he took off, eager to get back to the village. Or at least he would have, were he about two hundred pounds lighter. As it stands, he just took off in a light jog. Hinata, followed with a smirk on her face, easily keeping up with Naruto\u2019s slow pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon, Naruto began to slow down. He could feel himself tiring, but shock it off, thinking he was imagining it and too stubborn to stop. Soon, he began to pant and sweat was already forming on his brow.  He was forced to stop, breathing heavily, hands resting on his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Naruto,\u201d Hinata raced to his side, voice filled with concern. \u201cOh I was afraid of this, you must be sick. Oh you\u2019re in no condition to go back to the village like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? But we\u2019ve got to get back to the village.\u201d Naruto said, afraid of staying here for the remained of the festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, and given how I already suspected that you were sick, I took the liberty of booking us passage on a ship back to the village. Now here, let me help you.\u201d With that Hinata put Naruto\u2019s arm over her shoulder and, supporting most of his weight, began to lead him towards the docks and their boat.</span></div></div>",

She nodded to the men as she left. They grinned as they passed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the room the captain placed a drink in front of Naruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrink up young man! It\u2019s good for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto hesitated for a minute but then nodded. Taking a sip he coughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is vile.\u201d Naruto announced in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe best medicines are.\u201d The man said solemnly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned before chugging the rest. The captain grinned before motioning for the other crew members to come in with a plate of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Naruto asked suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe medicine has to be taken will food or else it will cause you to get dizzy.\u201d The captain explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto reluctantly shrugged, wishing the man had said that before he took it, before digging in. The thing was that once he took one bite he was surprised to find how truly hungry he was. Before he new it the plate was gone. The captain laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine you should do have quite the appetite.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blushed, but the captain just laughed more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We just stocked up at the last port.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of his hand two more plates appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Naruto muttered embarrassedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging into the food once more he quickly polished off that food as well. Surprised and a little worried at the fact he still didn\u2019t feel full Naruto frowned at the forth plate. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I should eat anymore.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you should.\u201d The captain announced motioning for the people behind him to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026\u201d Naruto suddenly found himself strapped down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to lift himself up, he found to his surprise, that he felt incredibly heavy and couldn\u2019t lift himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d Naruto snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrders. We wouldn\u2019t want you to leave here sick now would we?\u201d The man said with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you\u2026 mmhm!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood had been shoved into his mouth a hand covered it making sure he had to swallow. Enraged Naruto glared at the man, pressing his lips together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTube works just as well Mr. Uzumaki!\u201d The captain said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled out a long plastic tube and forced his lips open. Pouring food down the funnel Naruto felt his stomach filling up unpleasantly fast. A trolley of food entered the room laden with large amounts of sweets making Naruto groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe festival was kind enough to give us their leftovers.\u201d The captain grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlatters of food were poured down the funnel. Naruto felt his stomach pushing against the buttons of his pants. The strangest part was that it didn\u2019t feel painful yet. It should have, but it didn\u2019t. Naruto squirmed in their hold, trying desperately to escape, but finding himself hard pressed to do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact it wasn\u2019t until the trolley was completely empty that the feeling of a belly ache began to overcome him. Unable to talk, and thus unable to protest, the men just kept pouring. He felt his belly grow tight and the sides of the chair became constrictive even though his body clearly wasn\u2019t anywhere near it yet. It felt like it was though. It felt like he barely fit in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Hinata walked in.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She made a motion towards the men for them to step away and he realized in horror that she was the boss. She was the one who ordered this. So surprised was he that when she took the tube out and gently pressed a piece of cake to his mouth that he swallowed without thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Naruto asked in horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look much better this way Naruto.\u201d Hinata murmured, hands moving up and down his stomach like a hungry bear. He could feel chakra move throughout his body and ease his ache. \u201cI\u2019d very much like it if you would keep eating for me.\u201d Hinata continued, picking up another piece of cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned his head away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could you?\u201d Naruto whispered, betrayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve loved you for a long time and I promise to always love and protect you. I can\u2019t do that if you keep throwing yourself into danger.\u201d Hinata whispered pleadingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove? She had been the first person to ever tell him they loved him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo go this far though\u2026\u201d Naruto muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can do this the hard way or the easy way.\u201d Hinata told him gently. \u201cI\u2019ve been taking your strength. You don\u2019t have a chance. It would be much nicer for you to just go along with this. You\u2019ll learn to like it, I promise.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I won\u2019t.\u201d Naruto replied stubbornly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata frowned before nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you weren\u2019t so stubborn I never would have fallen for you.\u201d Hinata said fondly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released the genjutsu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took in a deep breath of horror as his body filled out and spilled over the chair. He could see his pants straining horribly to keep in one piece and his shirt stretch to encompass his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now new why it had been so difficult to fight back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata easily got his mouth open once more and shoved a large chunk of chocolate cake down his throat. His stomach jiggled against Hinata as she leaned forward each time and shoved more and more into his mouth. The chair beneath him groaned under the effort of holding him up, but she still continued. A batch of brownies was forced passed his lips next. His quickly tightening stomach protesting against it. Each time Hinata rubbed her fingers along his stomach it seemed to create a little bit more room though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passed of this gorging and then two. Hinata taking her sweet time, seemingly enjoying every minute of it as Naruto\u2019s stomach spilled out further and further. It was like he was seeing the progressing of a pregnant woman\u2019s nine months sped up. With one last mouthful of pudding Naruto moaned loudly as his shirt finally gave way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe action seemed to send Hinata into a fit of moaning to. Surprised Naruto didn\u2019t resist when soft lips caressed his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to be mine forever.\u201d Hinata murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed renewed in her need to feed him after these words because the food came faster and faster. The tightening of his belly caused his toes to curl. A twelve month baby seemed to hand over his knees inside his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026 how are\u2026 you doing this?\u201d Naruto muttered through forced mouthfuls. \u201cThis.. shouldn\u2019t\u2026 be possible.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m forcing your stomach to expand and heal rapidly.\u201d Hinata muttered, busily forcing down pie bite after pie bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair strained and groaned\u2026 finally breaking down completely. His hands finally freed Naruto found he couldn\u2019t even lift them to push her off. The large mound of flesh wobbled dangerously stretched. Breathing heavily Naruto moaned. It was too much. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And with that, Naruto began to make his way towards his favorite training grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, mind if I join you Naruto-kun?\" Hinata said, easily falling in beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" Naruto said with a grin. As much as the near non-stop eating may have hurt, he had enjoyed spending time with Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the pair arrived at the training grounds and Hinata prepared to put the next stage of her plan into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I know that you have been feeling better recently Naruto-kun, but I still think you should take it easy, just to be safe. If you're still feeling better after lunch, then you should be ready for training.\" Hinata said, her voice filled with sincerity and concern. After all, she did still love Naruto from the depths of her soul and she was well aware that he could hurt himself in his ignorance of his true physical state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I really need to get back to training,\" Naruto said.</span></div></div>",

He had felt this way before, it had started since he started hanging out with Hinata. She was always with him when he ate and told him to eat more. Then he realized...He likes Hinata. It all made sense now, she was always nice to him, she treated him to food, and she blushed and giggled when his stomach growled which caused him to blush and laugh. All this time he spent trying to get Sakura when the real girl for him was always encouraging and cheering him on. But he was so oblivious that he never noticed her. Well that was going to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...Your probably right about taking it easy.\" He said. Hinata looked at him barely able to hide her excitement. \"I mean, Kakashi-sensei did say that after a mission you should rest for a day or two before returning to training. I've been focused on training my whole life that I didn't think of how my body would react. I only thought of getting stronger. Maybe it's finally catching up to me huh?\" Hinata was so happy, Naruto was finally becoming more lazy and soon he wouldn't want to train at all, he would just want to eat and relax. Her plan was going better then expected. Naruto's stomach growled louder, begging for food, the two ninja blushed and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where would you like to go to eat Naruto?\" Hinata asked him with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was thinking.....\"</span></div></div>",

Hinata smiled and nodded in agreement, as they were about to leave, Teuchi walked out and laughed when he saw all the empty bowls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHA well Naruto I know you love ramen, but not this much.\" The old man said. Naruto grinned. \"When it comes to ramen you cant get me to stop.\" He said as he patted what he saw as a small swollen gut.

I'll sign you up right now.\" and with that Naruto and Hinata exited the ramen stand and started walking. Well Hinata was walking, Naruto was more or less walking, take a break, walking, take another break. She didn't mind, she knew that in Naruto's state he would get tired fast. Her plan was working, she knew Naruto would sign up for the contest, that was the whole reason she took him to get ramen. The next step was to make sure he wins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata needed to do a few things. First, she would place a few seals on his stomach so she could speed up his digestion during the contest. Next, she would have to give him some muscle and chakra back so he wouldn't pass out. The final step was going to be tricky, she would need to place the same Genjutsu she has on him on the rest of the village, considering this was a public event. She was the only one who could look at Naruto's fat body. She would need to work fast, the contest was in three weeks. Her attention was turned to Naruto when he stopped walking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on Hinata...huff..huff...I need to take a break.\" He said before siting down on a bench. Smiling she sat down next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must have eaten to much ramen.\" He groaned as he placed his hands on his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that Naruto. You won't win with that attitude.\" She said to him in a quiet but encouraging voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took some deep breaths and thought about what she said. She was right, if he kept acting like this he would sound like a quitter, and he was no quitter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Hinata. I need to stay positive and start training for the contest.\" He practically yelled. It was then he thought of something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hinata, can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was hoping that you would help me train?\" He asked hoping she would say yes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaking an embarrassed blush, she nodded. \"Y-Yes, I'll help you.\" 'The plan is working perfectly.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Hinata! Come to my apartment tomorrow we can start training.\" His stomach decided to make its presents known and growled loudly. The two laughed, and kept walking eventually reaching an Ice Cream shop. As they ate their Ice Cream, Hinata took glances at her crush, imagining what he would look like as a handsome, immobile blob. </span></div></div>",

She had leeched enough to grow her reserves immensely, she could let him have his chakra back for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Naruto-kun, lets go!\" They started out with 20 bowls of assorted ramen. He continued eating nearly for  hours straight without realizing it.  The seals on his stomach kept digesting everything too quickly to let him feel full.

Normally, this would grant at least marginal success. But then, Naruto was normally almost 200 pounds lighter. As it stood, Naruto half ran, half stumbled towards Hinata before throwing a sluggish punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata moved with the fluidity of water, easily slidding around Naruto's sloppy excuse for a punch as her hands shoot forward like lightning, deliverling a single tap that caused Naruto's arm to go limp. But Hinata wasn't done yet, darting to the side and delivering yet another strike, this time to Naruto's other arm, causing it to go limp before Naruto even had the chance to use it. As Naruto continued to stumble forward, from his initally momentum and the shock, it was all he could do to begin turning to face Hinata. And he did so just in time to see Hinata make the move that ended the battle, her hands darting forward and delivering the same taps to each of his legs. This vaused him to fall heavily on his back, having lost what little support his legs were able to provide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had to fight the urge to grin as she witnessed the fruits of her labor. Naruto, in his now weaked state, was all but helpless in a fight, and thus in no condition to further persue the dangerous life of a ninja. Hinata, on the other hand, seemed to have gained all the strength that Naruto had lost and more. What Naruto had just experienced was her absolute bare minimum of Hinata's new found power. If she had wanted to, she could have easily moved over ten times faster and delivered blows that would haver paralysed him instantly and thrown him to the other side of the clearing, despite his added weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn summation, Hinata was now one of the strongest people in Konoha, where Naruto was now one of the weakest. His new weight would have left him nearly crippled in his former condition, now with his muscles severely weakened and his chakra being constantly drained and disrupted, losing that weight was now all but impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Hinata knew better than anyone the strength of Naruto\u2019s determination. He could still move, as slow and unsteady as it was. And with Naruto\u2019s determination, that might be all that he needs to lose the weight and build the muscle again. And if that happened, Hinata would never get another chance to try again. This was the point of no return, and all Hinata had to do was push Naruto over the edge, into a lifetime of immense obesity and dependence on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata fought down the joy that rose in her at the thought, allowing only concern to show on her face as she ran to Naruto\u2019s side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Naruto-kun, are you okay, I\u2019m so sorry, I never meant to hurt you,\u201d Hinata cried, concern and fear filling her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Hinata,\u201d Naruto said from his position on the ground, staring up at Hinata. \u201cApparently you were right, I must need more rest. It was my fault for not listening to you. You think you could release the pressure points on my arms and legs now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Naruto,\u201d Hinata said as she knelt at his side.  \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m not yet skilled enough to unseal them without hurting you. Don\u2019t worry though, they\u2019ll release themselves soon enough, I\u2019m not strong enough to keep someone like you down for long,\u201d Hinata lied to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but what are we going to do in the mean time?\u201d Naruto questioned, not liking the idea of just lying there with nothing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you want to be able to train once you can move, then you need to eat,\u201d Hinata said as she unsealed an enormous picnic basket, stuffed to the brim just for this occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the food, Naruto began to get nervous. \u201cI don\u2019t know Hinata; I\u2019m not even that hungry right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Naruto, how can you expect to get your strength back if you don\u2019t eat?\u201d Hinata questioned softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Naruto trailed off as Hinata\u2019s words made sense to him, but he still wasn\u2019t certain that more food would help him get better. \u201cWait, how am I supposed to eat right now, I can\u2019t even feel my arms, much less use them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry Naruto, I\u2019d be happy to feed you,\u201d a grin crept on to her face as she blushed at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Naruto cried in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s the least I can do for you Naruto,\u201d Hinata said, smiling sweetly. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been so kind to me and always gone out of your way to help me.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hinata, I'm flattered that you would offer to do something like that, but I feel that right now, I just need to rest,\" Naruto said, remembering all the food that's been stuffed into him the past two weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Playing hard to get are we,' Hinata thought to herself. 'Good, oh its that stubborness and determination that made me fall for you in the first place. Now then, on to plan B.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Naruto, I understand,\" Hinata said. Suddenly she perked up and snapped her fingers. \"Oh, wait, I just remembered, I have just the thing!\" And with that, Hinata rummagd through her pockets before producing a small soldier pill. \"Here we are. Take this and I'm sure you'll be back to full strength in no time Naruto!\" Hinata said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Hinata!\" Naruto said as he accepted the pill Hinata presented to him. He chewed for a few seconds before swallowing. \"Alright Hinata, that was just what I needed! In fact, I think I'm feeling better already . . .\" As Naruto said this, his eyelids slowly dropped and his tone become less excited until he trailed off with a gentle yawn before falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled to herself as she stood up. 'Perfect, everything goes according to plan,\" Hinata thought as she turned to the trees and began to wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the signal, Hinata's two clones rushed came out of hiding, dragging a special cart into the clearing. There were three things that made the cart special. First was its size. The cart was simply huge, 10 ft by 10 ft. Were it not for the genjutsu Hinata had learned from her sensei, she never would have been able to conceal it. The second thing was its construction and composition. Most carts were made of wood, being light and cheap, but this one was steel, for carrying the heaviest of loads. The final thing was what actually lined the inside of the cart. The inside of the cart was covered in pillows and padding, there wasn't an inch of it that wasn't soft and comfortable. As heavy as the cart was, Hinata's clones still managed to pull it at a reasonable pace, a testament to the results of her training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the cart was next to Naruto\u2019s prone form, the open back facing him, the two clones moved to take their places, one on each side of Naruto and the original standing at the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright you two know what to do,\u201d Hinata said as she released then genjutsu on Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a poof of smoke, and despite knowing what to expect, the girls were still momentarily stunned by Naruto\u2019s true form. They stood there staring as Naruto\u2019s huge belly slowly moved up and down as Naruto breathed in and out, jiggling the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s so gorgeous,\u201d one of the clones said, mesmerized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just think, he\u2019s only going to get more so,\u201d the other muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if we don\u2019t get to work,\u201d the original said, snapping the other two out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they all nodded in agreement and knelt down by Naruto. Each slid her hands under Naruto flabby form. The original had her hands under Naruto\u2019s wide shoulders, grabbing him by the underarms. The clones had one hand on Naruto\u2019s lower back and the other on his fleshy butt, grinning to each other with a blush on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, lift on three. One, two, three,\u201d the three, channeling a significant bit of chakra, lifted him up easily enough. Then, then slowly and carefully began to slide him into the back of the cart, positioning him to be as comfortable as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was sure he was comfortable, the original Hinata created two more clones and hopped in the cart with Naruto, making sure to grab the picnic basket from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was in, Hinata felt the cart slowly begin to move, a little bit faster than walking speed. Hinata knew that if she asked, her clones could easily pull the cart faster, but she didn\u2019t for two reasons. First, what\u2019s the rush? She was more than happy enjoying her time in the back with Naruto. And second, while that pill would probably keep Naruto out for the entire time, no matter how rough the ride was, why would she risk injuring her beloved?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ride began, Hinata heard a low rumble. She smiled to herself as she turned to face the source, Naruto\u2019s enormous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHungry again already?\u201d Hinata said with a smile. \u201cOh, well then, we\u2019ll just have to fix that, won\u2019t we?\u201d As she said this, Hinata\u2019s hand opened the basket she had brought with her, revealing that it was filled to the brim with the most fattening and calories loaded foods in existence. Pulling out the first of the treats, Hinata brought it to Naruto\u2019s mouth. Naruto, still asleep, gladly accepted the treat and began to chew before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata quietly laughed to herself seeing this, as she drew another of the treats out. \u201cYou know, if you keep eating like this, you\u2019re going to get fat,\u201d Hinata said with another laugh as Naruto ate the second treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis pattern continued for some time until they finally reached their destination.</span></div></div>",

Hinata gently lays Naruto on her bed and takes a minute to catch her breath, he has gotten so Heavy!  Hinata makes a shadow clone and nods to her.  The shadow clone henges into Naruto and walks out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled, before reaching into her nearly depleted picnic basket she fed him the rest.  \"Oh Naruto you will soon be unable to get up from that bed.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used her medical ninjutsu to help speed up his digestion.  Hinata shadow clones then entered the room, having gone to the kitchens first.  All but one dismissed themselves.  Hinata's clone walked over to Naruto and started to feed him.  The four baskets were fed to Naruto and even with the genjutsu he is looking fat.  His shirt no longer covers his stomach.  When he breathes out Hinata can see a small double chin forming.  Hinata fell asleep against Naruto tired from all the chakra she had expended during the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wakes up and stairs at his stomach.  \"How did I get so fat, nani?  Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata jerks a wake.  \"Naruto-kun, you're up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's stomach growls.  Hinata blushes gazing at her paramour, knowing that under the illusion he makes what he looks like now look anorexic.  Naruto tried to stand but leaning over he just flopped back down.  He decided to stand up slowly, using the wall for support.  He managed to stand but was breathing hard.  Hinata said, \"You've relapsed from your sickness you should lay down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto panted, \"No I need to train, to get stronger, to loose this weight.\"  Naruto was growing weaker just standing there.  'Maybe I should take it, no that is quitter's talk, and I am not a quitter.'  He took a step and then another before falling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata picked Naruto up and laid him on the bed.  \"You need to rest, I'll have some food brought up. You'll need your energy to train later.\"  Hinata said in a soft voice.  Standing up to her full height she walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto figures he needs to get away.  More food will not help.  He summons a shadow clone, but it too falls over and then disperses.  Naruto breathes heavier, that took way too much energy he thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata comes back with ramen.  \"Here you go.\" she says.  Naruto stomach growls as he stares at the mountain of cup ramen.  He reaches over and grabs the first one, then another.  He stops before the third.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm full.\"  Naruto lies.  His stomach growls again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiles, \"Oh really?\" She asks.  Hinata hands him the next one.  \"You can't recover if your body is starved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto struggles for a minute before...  </span></div></div>",

Now addicted to the delicious ramen, he refused to stop eating as he was handed more and more cups and let the noodles slide down his throat in an endless stream of constant fattening food. As he continued to eat, some broth drained down his front and his belly continued to increase in size inch after inch until his lovehandles oozed out from under his tracksuit and his bellybutton said hello to the world. Hinata served him cup after cup, fattening him for at least another hour until he had gained over 100 pounds and he never even noticed it. Naruto now weighed at least 514 pounds, but it looked like he weighed no more than 215 pounds with the genjutsu over him. Once he had finished all the ramen Hinata had cooked for him, the small pill she added in the last one caused his sudden addiction to end and for him to fall asleep on the bed with a soft but loud thud that shook the bedroom a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was out cold, Hinata cleaned her love's ramen-covered face and started to remove his dirtied tracksuit while he was unconscious. She wanted him to be comfortable while he rested. When she removed the tracksuit jacket, it was revealed to be rather large since it was removed from the illusion she created over her love. She smiled and tossed the clothes aside to be washed later. But she didn't end it there, Hinata released the genjutsu over Naruto and with a blast of smoke, revealed his newest 514 pound form. Naruto's orange pants were now skin-tight and stretched across his thick jiggling thighs, busting hips, and now his 4-foot-wide fat butt. His belly oozed down over his lap and his white shirt was too small to contain his girth as his stomach reached out over three feet forward. Naruto had two chins now and his face was puffier and chubbier than ever now. Hinata blushed at the size of his new manboobs that were now almost the same size as watermelons but with nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was fatter than ever before and Hinata couldn't contain herself much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she pretended to fall down and landed on his soft and warm jiggling belly. She giggled and blushed as she rubbed his vast stomach and focused her chakra into the seal to make him even bigger. His clothes became tighter and tighter until at last she started to hear his pants rip: RRRRRRRRIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled him over and down between his two large bloated buttcheeks, revealed a set of very large white boxers with red hearts decorated all over each fat cheek. Hinata had given them to him, believing it would make him look sexier once he had gain enough weight, and to her pleasure he was in fact sexier as the boxers looked almost painted on his fat body. Once his pants were torn to shreds from his fat, Naruto seemed to relax on the bed as he rested and the food inside him turned into more fat to weigh him down to almost 600 pounds. He smiled while he was still unconscious, which made Hinata feel even happier in addition to Naruto's newest size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to remove all his clothes until he was in his sexy boxers and replaced his torn tracksuit and headband with huge pair of light-blue pajamas that had lots of room for him to be fattened into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata rubbed his fat cheek and muttered to him with a kiss, \"Oh, Naruto... You beautiful fat man... I'll make sure you come to love your new size... You're so close to immobile...\"</span></div></div>",

With dawn creeping up on the next morning, Naruto awoke with a massive yawn as he sat upright from his bed, his ample pajamas carrying his new weight well enough to give him room to grow. Although, he did have to do a double take as he was in an unfamiliar setting; at least to his own cognition. With the genjutsu in place, Hinata made it look like he had never gained a pound and was as fit as ever, cleverly hiding his quarter ton frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...its good to see you up this morning.\" Hinata entered his room quietly as he looked at her, confused still about what all was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, I don't understand...I know we were on a mission but I swear I was ballooning up with fat and that I was letting myself go and...\" Hinata put a thin finger to his lips to get him to hush up in a gentle way as she lied straight to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While it is true we were on a mission Naruto, by the time we got back to Konoha, you were completely exhausted. I figured that taking you here to the Hyuga estate until you were fully recuperated would be the best thing to do. I never thought I'd see you sleep for so long.\" She said, putting a hand to grope his dome gut as he saw a hand on his washboard stomach. \"As for size, you must have been dreaming since you're still the same old ninja you were when you fell asleep.\" This explanation seemed to be all Naruto needed as he let a huge sigh out, his chins jiggling from the motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, here I thought I was a blimp. Hehe, although all that sleep has made me hungry.\" He said, thinking still that his hunger was more involved with rest than weight as Hinata picked him up off the bed, his large butt smacking the mattress as he arose while she lead him down the hall to the main banquet hall of the Hyuga estate empty save for what was the largest breakfast spread he had ever seen. \"Whoa-ho! You really know how to spoil a guest! Lord knows Shino and Kiba love having dinner here!\" He said, taking the closest chair he could find as he looked over the multiple styled eggs, loads of bacon and ham, loaves of toast. He didn't know where to start as Hinata grabbed a large table cloth like napkin to tie around his blubberous chins leaning in to give his round cheek a small kiss. \"Heh, that tickles.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As it should Naruto. Please, eat to your hearts content.\" Naruto didn't need a special invitation as he grabbed a set of chopsticks and dub in to the feast that was his breakfast. Hinata sat beside him under the guise that she was slowly helping herself, not drawing attention that her \"meal\" was watching his stomach inch out more and more with each gulp he took, the very sight of his love handles digging into the sides of the chair were more than enough to make her blush. She had an exclusive front row seat to probably one of the greatest shows she would ever experience in her whole life. Then again, she was young and if she was going to make Naruto her's, she would have ample opportunity to re-create meals like this again and again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she fantasized about a future with a ten ton Naruto, the present fox ninja was doing well in clearing the table dish by dish as the plates began to stack up around him. With grease and juices dribbling down his chins as he feasts, Naruto's illusion was still in tact that he had no idea that his stomach was growing to the state that it was filling up his pajama pants, going from loose to slightly uncomfortable to skin tight. It didn't help that his butt and hips were accompanying the journey his belly was taking, his moobs helping push up on his top as more of his gut was able to roam free, bouncing around like a gelatin mold much to Hinata's delight. Although his pace was dwindling as he looked like if he ate any further, he'd explode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata...urpp..not that I don't appreciate the meal but I don't think I can stomach anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I think I know what'll help.\" She said, pulling his chair out as her fingers glowed with chakra, kneading his stomach slowly as she wanted to feel his flesh under every nerve of her fingers. Naruto didn't object to the belly rub, moaning in ectasy as he was oblivious to the new aura of genjutsu surrounding him, pacifying him into a semi-conscious state; similar to how he was during his ramen feast earlier. \"Poor Naruto. You need to eat past your capacity if you're going to meet my schedule any time soon.\" Hinata said, sweet yet sounding disappointed as she grabbed a bowl of fruit salad, sitting on his belly as if it was a tuffet, leaning in with a forkful of juicy fruit, pushing it past his dazed lips as he chewed involuntarily, swallowing, and then repeating the cycle as Hinata began to stuff him at her own pace. Granted it was slower than how he fed himself, Hinata wanted to enjoy every minute of alone time she could with him before releasing him from his stupor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she didn't account for someone walking in on her playtime as she was leaning in, giving his lips a soft kiss as the door opening behind her peaked her attention, seeing...</span></div></div>",

But when he walked in and saw his oldest and most beautiful daughter kiss what he could assume was one of the fattest men he had ever seen in his life. At first, he believed it was Choji Akimichi, but he had shorter blonde colored hair and was four times larger than usual. But once he had a better look, he realized that it was Naruto, stuck inside one of the chairs in the main banquet hall and the table was scattered and stacked with used and dirtied plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the last time he had seen him, Naruto had become so fat that his massive butt couldn\u2019t fit inside the chair as the arms of said chair started to bend outward thanks to the bloated sides of his growing ass. His lovehandles oozed out over the bent arms of the chair, and he now had a dome-shaped belly with manboobs the size of which Hiashi couldn\u2019t believe a man could grow as the two fat gelatinous breasts pressed hard against his clothes. It looked like the pajamas Hinata had Naruto wear were now skintight and several buttons at the collar and bottom were about to burst clean off. With all those details in mind, he looked a lot like the Hawaiian musician Israel Kamakawiwo\u2019ole, as far his size was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiashi saw his daughter sit there on the teen\u2019s vast fat stomach and he witnessed her kiss him when she was in the middle of feeding him a bowl full of fresh fruit salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stern and well-conservative clan leader didn\u2019t know what to be more shocked about; that Hinata had kissed a boy, the fact that Naruto Uzumaki had turned into an obese slob overnight, the fact that it was Naruto-let alone an ultra fat version of Naruto that had kissed his beloved daughter, or the idea that she must have been one that fattened him into this new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-Father...\u201d she stammered as she froze and Naruto chewed and swallowed his current mouthful of fruit, which caused his chins to move around a little in a slow slosh as he chewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata left Naruto and ran over to her father; the fat teen behind her was still semi-conscious thanks to that blissful genjutsu Hinata had submitted him into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiashi almost stammered, \u201cHinata... Is that blob over there Naruto Uzumaki?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes that\u2019s him, father...\u201d she said as she nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clan leader asked in a silenced voice, \u201cWhat in the world has happened to him? He\u2019s enormous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had no other choice but to confess to her father of her actions in the dark and her ambitions to make Naruto into an immobile human blob. She told him most of the details from the chakra seals, the food festival, the genjutsu she used on him, the boat ride back home, the cart, and the recent feasts she had submitted him into that made him bloat to his current size of over 631lbs. With this information and with Naruto still lost in ecstasy, Hiashi was astounded at what his daughter had done to basically pacify the once uncontrollable and untamable Naruto Uzumaki. He was silent for a moment but when the silence was over, he shocked his daughter when he let out a small smile or even a small smirk on his stern face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done, Hinata-chan...\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata widened her eyes and looked at her clan leader in shock, \u201cFather?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiashi slid his arms into the opposite sleeves of his magnificent robe and nodded to his talented daughter, at last relieved to see Hinata had come out of her shell and had taken total control over something in her life. While Naruto wasn\u2019t the best suitor he had in mind for his daughter, he was still satisfied that he made her happy and even more so that she had dominated him in such an unusual but blissful manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to admit that I am amazed,\u201d he said, \u201cOnly a truly talented kunoichi would have the skill, determination, confidence, and free will to force a man like Naruto Uzumaki into such blob-like submission. I am shocked but also proud that you were able to do this to him. I would be right to assume this was the reason for that extensive mission a little while earlier, to overfeed him and stuff him at the festival... You are indeed a true heiress to this noble clan, Hinata-chan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt touched and relieved as she asked, \u201cI... I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d nodded Hiashi but then he asked as he leaned in closer to his daughter so that the obese teen at the table couldn\u2019t hear, \u201cBut I have to ask: Is Naruto aware of what\u2019s being done to him? A man of that size would notice that his belt has a few extra holes in it about now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled and answered, \u201cNo. He\u2019s still oblivious to his true size. I have him under an advanced genjutsu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should have known,\u201d Hiashi said, unsurprised that the blonde blob didn\u2019t know, \u201cThat dazed look on his fat face makes it obvious...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, while Naruto sat there on his enormous butt, his stomach let out a low but audible growl, as it demanded for more food. That last chakra surge Hinata had sent into his food-filled belly made a little bit more room in his stomach but also made him crave to eat more. The chakra also caused some of his stomach muscles to stretch out and allow him to eat a lot more food from now on. To him, a normal-sized meal would be a little bit more than the \u201cbreakfast\u201d he was soon about to finish. When this breakfast was over, he would not need to eat another feast for a while, but he could finish that delicious fruit salad and whatever was left on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rested his plump hands and pudgy fingers on his fat belly and rubbed it in anticipation for Hinata to feed him more food. In his current state of mind, Hinata was like his goddess fallen from heaven to feed him with a bountiful amount of delicious food, and he needed her to come back. Still dazed and confused, Naruto looked around, unable to see his angel, so he called out to her in a slightly deepened voice, thanks to the sheer amount of blubber that surrounded his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called out, \u201cHinata-chan? Is there more fruit salad left?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo to him, dear,\u201d said Hiashi as he encouraged his daughter to return to her obese muse, \u201cFeed him the rest of his fill and I will make arrangements for his remainder here at the estate. He can rest in the bedroom down the hall as soon as he\u2019s full. That\u2019s the one with the widest bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled and nodded to her father in a humble manner, \u201cThanks so much, father...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will have the servants clean this mess and start to alter his lunch when it arrives. I\u2019ll have to make a call to Ichiraku Ramen and make a generous order,\u201d he added as he left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her father out of her business, Hinata was free and so she returned to sit on Naruto\u2019s warm and vast stomach. To him, it looked like Hinata had sat down on the left arm of the chair with the bowl of fruit in her smooth and slender hands. Hinata smiled at her morbidly obese crush and cleaned his face a little bit of some fruit juice and a little bit of grease leftover from the dishes he had inhaled earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked him in a seductive voice, \u201cNow where were we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata leaned in closer and used the chopsticks to stick more dices of fruit into Naruto\u2019s mouth and continued to stuff him in a slow but enjoyable manner. She watched him, his eyes dazed but happy, as he chewed and swallowed each sweet, mouth-watering bite. While he was still a slave to the genjutsu, Naruto wished to please his angel Hinata and continued to eat as his stomach started to reach its new capacity and inched out further and further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, Naruto\u2026\u201d muttered Hinata as she took a break and kissed his fat cheek, \u201cEat more and more\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nineteen minutes later, Naruto had finished the fruit salad and Hinata fed him the waffles, various omelets, donuts, porridges, and then one more fruit salad. With all that food eaten, he was stuffed; the corners of his mouth was covered with juices, grease, syrup, sugar, and some small watermelon seeds. Hinata cleaned his face for him while he rested and let her tickle his several chins. In the time it took for him to finish his meal Naruto\u2019s stomach had increased in size. His butt and hips became wider until the pajama pants he wore started to rip at the sides and exposed his elastic heart-decorated boxers. Naruto remained none-the-wiser to the condition of his clothes, even when he let out a sigh and relaxed as Hinata rubbed his belly, focused chakra into his system, and accelerated his digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the food in his stomach started to convert into more fat, his pajamas couldn\u2019t take much more and so the buttons at the collar and the bottom ends burst off and flew out across the hall, so fast that one of them cracked a window on the other side of the hall. Naruto\u2019s gut then surged outward more and Hinata squealed in utter delight. Several seconds later, the arms of the chair he sat on broke with two loud cracks, all thanks to his widened butt and lovehandles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCRACK!! SNAP!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that sudden loud noise, Naruto shook his head and he was broken free of his semi-conscious state. With that said, he realized how full he felt, now that all the food that was once stacked and scattered all over the table was stuffed into his stomach. He still could not see how enormous he was while Hinata moved fast and hid the broken arms of the chair under the table with her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then rubbed his enormous gut and moaned in fullness, \u201cOhhhh... Hinata-chan I am so full... I think I ate too much... Urrpp...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the arms hidden from view and that low manly belch, Hinata decided she would force her crush back into bed to rest and fatten more until his next feast at lunchtime. Whatever Naruto wasn\u2019t eating, she was determined to make sure he was sitting or fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww... Poor Naruto...\u201d she cooed and then convinced him in a somewhat sensual and concerned voice, \u201cYou need to lie down... Come with me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata used her enhanced strength to lift Naruto from his seat, thankful that his butt wasn\u2019t stuck in the broken chair so he wouldn\u2019t notice, but still wished she could later see him attempt to stand with a chair glued to his bloated ass. She let Naruto lean close to her as the two of them walked to the bedroom located down the hall. Well, to be honest, Hinata was the one that walked while Naruto had to waddle the whole time. His large stomach, butt, lovehandles, and hips all sloshed and bobbed around with each little movement he made, like he was filled to the brim with warm chocolate pudding. Hinata felt his lovehandles and even the sides of his manboobs and ass while she half-carried him to his new bedroom. She blushed and couldn\u2019t wait for him to rest so that she could convert the rest of the food she made him eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took five minutes to reach the bedroom and Naruto had to take a moment to catch his breath and clean the sweat from his brow as he observed the new room. The walls had beautiful tapestries and some of the richest and softest carpeting he had ever seen or felt as his plump toes and fat feet sank into the floor. The tall windows had luxurious velvet curtains, and the bed in the middle had the curtains surround it, while the bed itself was more than nineteen feet wide and had the best and softest crimson, maroon, and golden blankets and sheets he had ever seen in his life, complete with over nine soft pillows to rest his head on. It was a bed fit for a king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201d he breathed and smiled a little, \u201cWhat a bed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata held his bloated arm and escorted him into the room as she said, \u201cYou can sit down here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was obedient to Hinata and let her lead him to the bed to sit down. His wide bloated twin-boulder sized butt cheeks sank into the bed, far more than a foot into it, and soon Naruto was overwhelmed and almost fainted at how wonderful it felt to rest on what he had reason to believe was the best and most comfortable bed he had ever had the privilege to sit on. He let out a long breath and soon collapsed into the mattress, rolled on his side like a ball until he rested his head on the numerous pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have chuckled, but soon all that food he ate sloshed around inside him and reminded him how bloated he felt and tried to remain still. Hinata soon followed her crush and started another genjutsu that would make Naruto relax, induce him to fall asleep, and accelerate his fat conversion. She reached out, unbuttoned his pajamas, and started to rub his stomach once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2026\u201d she said in a smooth voice, \u201cThis\u2019ll ease the pain\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto moaned and started to smile and relax as he was supposed to. He felt less bloated and uncomfortable, but that was because the food started to break down faster than it would have on its own. Still, he looked over at Hinata\u2019s beautiful face as she smiled down at him, her cheeks a little flushed as she comforted him. Naruto never felt so comfortable around a woman like he did now. Soon, he smiled at her, unaware that his stomach started to bloat over his waistline within seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned, \u201cOhhhh... Thanks so much... What would I do without you, Hinata-chan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a whole lot now...\u201d she smirked a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto let out a yawn, as his eyelids never felt heavier, \u201cI think\u2026 I\u2019ll have a little sleep... I\u2019m so tired\u2026 all\u2026 the\u2026 sudden... Zzzzzzz\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the blonde fatso in a deep sleep and still growing fatter each minute, Hinata continued the fat conversion and determined his current weight. She didn\u2019t have a scale on hand, but it looked to her that Naruto weighed more than 689lbs, another national weight record broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata continued to rub and comfort the love of her life, she leaned in closer to his face and never believed he could ever look so cute and handsome at the same time. Unable to restrain herself, she leaned in close to his face, smelled his breath, and then kissed him on the mouth. Naruto could have been unconscious, but somehow he returned that same intense passion and kissed her back in his sleep, also on the mouth while his head continued to rest on those overstuffed pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hinata was done and Naruto was unconscious, she continued to rub his belly and make him rounder and heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRest and eat well, Naruto\u2026\u201d she said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Naruto woke up slightly lethargic but none the wiser of the massive ramen feast Hinata tricked him into devouring last night. As far as he noticed through the illusion, he was still at a plump 215 lbs even though his body was just above 600 lbs. Sitting up slowly due to the cumbersome weight, his belly drooped in between his tree trunk sized legs, massive butt spread across the bed like two wobbling boulders of blubber stretching his super extra large pajamas out with no signs of ripping yet. As the fox boy tried to gain his bearings, someone else has a different gain in mind for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Naruto! It's nice to see you up so early!\" Hinata greeted, walking in with a tray full of assorted breakfast that could feed two boys at his size complete with eggs, bacon, toast, and tons of calorie boosters to help him grow into her perfect image. Unfortunately, his mind was focused as she knew too well that if Naruto set his mind to something, not many things would bring him back to Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Hinata. I appreciate the breakfast but I want to start this morning with some good training. I can't let my body hit 300, now can I?\" Naruto explained, not understanding the irony of his situation as he gave his haughty belly a nice slap. \"Maybe I can have a light breakfast after the workout.\" Hinata was secretly sulking on the inside but the gears in her mind spun in motion as this actually had a good way of working out for her. Setting the palate down, she put on her cute shy face as she walked up to Naruto, pressing into his hips as she looked at him with her pearly eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, would you mind if I helped you train? I think I can get your body to the right size.\" The hand on her head confirmed that it was more than okay to accompany him as she raced around the Hyuga estate, gathering things for him as she found a blue pair of sweat pants and a sweat shirt for his training, making his curves stick out much better as his belly was poking out of the undersized sweats. Luckily, they weren't at the point yet of ripping but Hinata knew that no clothes Naruto would gain would even stay in tact if she was around to help accelerate his growth. After an hour of prep, the two ninjas were in the courtyard of the estate in a thickly wooded area as they prepared for the day. \"Alright Naruto, why not start out with some simple stretches?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, everything had two meanings with Hinata. The first part was in hopes that the stretching would tire him out sooner rather than later. The second was that the way his body bounced was all too magnificent for her to take in at once as she watched his melon like moobs bounce on the dome belly, his gut swaying back and forth like a fleshy wrecking ball, his love handles and hips shaking around as if he were a belly dancer. After the first display of blubber aerobics, Naruto wanted to get a start by doing inverted sit ups while hanging from a tree branch. Granted he needed Hinata's help to get up the tree and to find a sturdy enough branch that it wouldn't collapse under his tremendous girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff...one.....hufff....two...\" Much to both their surprise, he was able to manage a few of the sit ups despite his size. Then again, he was getting tired faster than he intended as he loosened his leg grip on the tree, his body smacking the ground with an earth shaking thud as his mass jiggled like a jello mold. \"We've been at this for an hour, right? A quick water break wouldn't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, and I packed us some special sports drinks. They're supposed to hydrate and give you energy too!\" Hinata gave him one of the sports bottles as he sucked down the orange flavored drink, drops of the juice running down his chins. What Naruto was unaware of was that Hinata used the calorie boosters that she had been using on the poor boy to help expand his gut by a good five pounds, visibly swelling like a blimp as he did last night. While entranced with the sports drink, Hinata decided it was time to go in for the gentle fist on his gravid ass, covering the stump with so much of his body that you couldn't tell there was one under him to begin with. Going in for the quick succession of blows, she cooed at the sight of his butt as well as the feel of it under her fingers. Going in for one last jab which was a jutsu that was designed to fatigue the victim, Naruto let out a big yelp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on Earth was that? Something hit my butt!\" He stood up, his mass jiggling as Hinata was looking around in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Naruto, it's just that there was this big bug and it was on your butt. I didn't catch it but it looked entranced with you. Like one of Shino's insects.\" The mere thought of Shino's bug colony freaked Naruto out, his face red as he bolted as fast as a quarter ton teenager could. \"Naruto, come back...I want to see you move...\" she called out under her breath as she followed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep them away from me! I don't want bugs near me...what if they're attracted to fat!\" He yelled out as Hinata caught sight of his body bobbing up and down, back and forth in the track suit as she was so enamored with him that she failed to notice she had passed him. \"Umm...Hinata, a little help please?\" Tracing her steps back, her face was fully flushed as she saw Naruto wedged into a V-shaped tree. To him, he figured that the tree was small enough for his slightly obese body to get caught in. In reality, his fat was totally stuck, his hips and butt sticking out behind him as his belly was drooping out in front of him, love handles smooshed in the crevice of the tree as he tried effortlessly to get himself unstuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Naruto. Don't worry, I have just the solution for this.\" Hinata said, much to Naruto's relief. What he didn't know that Hinata formed a plan to enjoy her boy toy to the fullest extent she could. She decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata walked around Naruto and faced his enormous bloated ass. She smiled and could have drooled at its incredible size and cushion-like roundness, but she had to contain herself somewhat, even while his rear never looked sexier. His sweatpants were so tight and as the two tree branches squished his butt it made the clothes on his ass shine as the sun came in between the leafs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist the need to touch him, Hinata sank her slender hands deep into each of his blubberous butt cheeks. The fat she touched felt so soft and so warm as her hands were submerged into Naruto\u2019s blubber. She used the minimal amount of force she could use as she pressed into his cheeks and made it sound like she tried to work hard to remove him from the tree. All that time, she smiled and watched as his fat trickled between her pale slender fingers and made her want to explore him more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHrmmmm!\u201d she mumbled as she acted like she exerted a lot more force than she used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the overweight teen felt her hands touch his butt and sink into his malleable rear, Naruto blushed almost as red as a tomato while he felt her push and shove. But he was still stuck, like a cork in a wine bottle. He felt so embarrassed and so bad that Hinata had to touch him where no woman would ever want to venture other than a doctor. But as she continued to \"free him\" from the tree, the blonde fatso was a little bit amazed that Hinata worked so hard and did so much to assist him in his embarrassment and in his time of need. He couldn't think of one kunoichi in the whole world that would ever do this for him, not even his teammate Sakura. It made him start to appreciate Hinata as a friend, or even a little more than a friend as he continued to feel her hands sink into his abundant flesh; each time she discovered a new mound of warm fat to touch and sink her hands into. Several times, he felt Hinata used her elbows to shove him out of the two tree branches, and unknown to him, she used this as an excuse to rub her face into his butt and even sneak it an unnoticeable kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while he remained oblivious to Hinata's complete and utter delight, she soon came around the tree and faced Naruto's front once she had her fun after more than 15 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use,\" she said as she pretended to look and sound exhausted, \"I'll have to pull. Here, reach out your arms to me, Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese adolescent nodded and did as she told him to and reached out to her, \"Ok, Hinata! Let's do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata used her chakra to stick her hands to Naruto's non-existent wrists and then she tried to draw him out with brute force. This time she was serious and felt that she had had her fun and decided her handsome fat man should have a shower, relax, and then eat some more food to fatten on. Besides, he had worked out too much with that last run he made and he would be exhausted in several minutes thanks to that earlier blow to his butt. However, Hinata was a little bit shocked at how difficult it was to remove Naruto from the tree. It looked like her love's incredible weight had caused him to sink lower into the two branches while she had fun with his rear end. Now he was even more stuck, and she never noticed it until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrmmmmm!\" the two of them both mumbled as Hinata tried to set Naruto free, \"C'mon! C'mon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto flailed and kicked around as he tried to be free, but all it did was add to the strain he felt. For several more minutes, neither one of the teens moved until Hinata tried one last time to remove her obese love from the branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do this!\u201d she mumbled as she focused more chakra into her muscles, \u201cC\u2019mon! C\u2019mon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she did it, he popped out like a champagne cork covered with hot melted butter and at the same time he released a small but innocent little fart, since he was under so much strain until he was released at last and flew out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA!\" he shouted as he soared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s seductive feeder held her breath and shouted, \"OH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese blonde teen shot forward as Hinata fell backward and her back hit the forest floor in a harmless and soft thud that didn't affect the area around them. But then Naruto followed and landed on her with a loud thud that shook the forest and the trees around them as more than 600lbs of fat landed on the kunoichi, but saved her head and shoulders as the rest of her was smothered under Naruto's warm and immense blubber. The animals and insects were scared from the sudden tremor and fled the area as birds followed and soared out of the trees. The blonde teen sloshed around like he was filled to the brim with gelatin and his released butt had bounced and sloshed like two massive flesh-colored water balloons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOF!\" he had shouted as his vast stomach and manboobs hit the forest floor as well as his trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shook his head from the fall and then he realized in horror that he had landed on Hinata and feared that he could have crushed her under his weight. He started to act frantic and felt even more embarrassed and fearful that he had landed on his dear friend and that her wrath was soon to come for his fat foolish clumsiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe talked as fast as he could and this time he used an affectionate honorific with her name, \"Oh no! Hinata-chan! I\u2019m so sorry, Hinata-chan! I didn't mean to be such a klutz! Please, don't hit me! I-I-I didn't mean it! Honest! Are you ok?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had to hold it all in and remain calm as she was stuck under his vast warm blubber. She didn't think she would ever be under Naruto like this so soon and had often fantasized about him smothering her with his fat, but never this soon and at his current size. It took so much will power not to lose control, like there was a hot fire below her lower intestine, but she resisted and decided to savor the moment at the same time as she blushed and felt his smooth skin and lukewarm blubber cover her. While he weighed more than a quarter-ton, Naruto didn't hurt her when he landed on her thanks to the stolen chakra and muscles she had also taken from him with the seals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I\u2019m fine... it's ok, Naruto...\" she said as she recovered and noticed that her fat blob had not removed himself from her and she was still embraced underneath his soft and warm flab, all thanks to that blow to his butt before he ran into the forest and made him too exhausted to move, \"It didn't even hurt me at all... To be honest... You're... nice and soft...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous blonde shinobi blushed a little bit and stared at Hinata as she smiled at him and never recoiled. He should have been hit about now based on his historical experience with other women he knew. But Hinata never struck him or looked disgusted that she was pinned under a chubby, flabby, blonde teenager. But he would have been more shocked and even feel more touched had he known how colossal he was under the visual illusion that tricked him. Even still, he started to feel a rare affection or attraction towards the wonderful kunoichi that made him want to stick close to her, like he would be lost without her around in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then muttered under his breath but she still heard him loud and clear as she charmed him in those last two words, \u201cI'm... nice and soft?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Hinata fell into her old habits and tried to cover her obvious affections towards him in order to maintain their current relationship and make sure he wasn\u2019t uncomfortable or feel forced into a returned romance, \u201cWell! You know what I mean, Naruto! H-Heh! It\u2019s not like I broke a bone! I feel fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, I think so, too\u2026\u201d he answered back after some hesitation and then he smiled back at her and tried to hide his blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata let Naruto smother her with his flab for a few more seconds before she had no choice but to ask him to move so that she could stand and spoil him more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Naruto?\u201d she asked in a sweet voice, \u201cIt\u2019s a little hard to breath like this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe twitched and sloshed as he realized he was still on her, \u201cY-Yeah! Sorry about that, Hinata-chan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese teen tried his best to roll to his side and released Hinata. He tried to stand on his own, but he was soon out of breath from the moment he rested on his knee and leaned on another tree close to him. He started to sweat and there were wet mark on his armpits, hips, the area between his manboobs, and all over the collar of his shirt and sweat suit. Hinata had at last exhausted him, and made him feel like he had run a marathon across the Land of Fire with Rock Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...huff... I'm so... huff... exhuasted...\" he tried to breathe, \"But... huff... I think one more run... huff... should do it for me... huff... and then... huff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked and soon hid it as she walked over to Naruto and enticed him as she half-carried him back to the estate, \u201cNo... That's the end of our workout, Naruto\u2026 We should head back inside and rest\u2026 You could use a shower and a nice meal\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata let Naruto lean on her while she walked him back to the estate. Our morbidly obese blonde hero continued to pant and sweat bullets while he waddled his bloated frame beside Hinata. It took about seventeen minutes to leave the woods, which was a remarkable feat for Naruto's sheer size. It would have been impossible for him to run far at all with his abundant girth and reduced stamina and strength. The enormous ninja needed to rest several times before Hinata hauled his fat butt back to the original training area, and then the inside of the estate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... huff... need... huff... I need to sit down... one more time, Hinata-chan...\" he panted as the two entered the room to remove their shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded and let Naruto rest his double boulder-sized butt down across the entire bench and she insisted, \"I'll find some water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... huff... Hinata-chan...\" he thanked as he rested on his thighs and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all she returned with a bottle full of actual water with no calorie boosters this time. Naruto needed an actual drink, otherwise he would pass out. After she handed him the water, she leaned against the wall opposite the bench Naruto smothered under his wide butt and watched him drink down the whole bottle. Naruto was so desperate to catch his breath and cool down at the same time that a lot of water fell from the corners of his mouth and drenched his front when he tried to drink and breathe at the same time. The water on his sweat suit caused all the details of his manboobs to be realized, like he was entered into a wet t-shirt contest. Hinata blushed a little bit and decided she wanted to see a little bit more of him once Naruto had drunk his fill, like a valued cattle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata told him in a kind voice, with an ulterior motive in mind, \"Umm... I don\u2019t mean to be rude at all, but you could really use a shower if you like to have one, Naruto. It\u2019ll really help you rehydrate as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overweight teen decided to smell his armpits and had to double back as his nose crinkled at the smell of his own sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew! You\u2019re right, Hinata-chan,\u201d he hollered and then cleared his throat as he blushed, \u201cI think I should take on that shower offer then... Uh, where\u2019s the washroom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed a little bit and tried to resist the urge to smirk as she watched her obese love\u2019s chubby cheeks flush with color in slight embarrassment. She helped him stand up and lead him through the estate to the private bathroom area. She rest her head on him once or twice and made him notice only slightly and Naruto continued to think back to when he collapsed on top of her earlier; what she said and the look on her face when she said it. When the unofficial couple reached the washroom, Naruto discovered it was rather large with a shower big enough to fit at least five people in at once. But for Naruto and his size, it looked like an ideal shower designed for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa...\u201d he said in awe, \u201cNow that is what I call a shower!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata showed Naruto the folded set of his fixed and cleaned clothes to wear when he was done, which were expanded more and made to make him think he lost weight during today\u2019s workout session. Naruto was unaware of this thanks to the genjutsu that was still cast over him, so he never questioned that his tracksuit was more than four times wider than normal. In addition to the cleaned and folded orange and black suit, Hinata also showed him a dark blue bathrobe that he could wear instead if he wanted to. But he insisted that he was fine with his normal clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks so much for all of this, Hinata-chan,\u201d he said with a small innocent smile, \u201cI really do appreciate it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata brushed the side of his stomach with her hand and said, \u201cIt\u2019s no problem at all, Naruto. Take as long as you need. I\u2019ll go change and meet you in the kitchen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated and obese blonde teen remained where he stood as he watched Hinata leave. He sure did stare at her butt for a while as she walked, but then he looked at her and couldn\u2019t help but think back to all the little moments in their childhood, their rookie years, and now when it almost seemed like he spent almost all of his free time with her in what felt like several incredible months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto soon turned on the hot water in the shower and he continued to think about Hinata, while he removed all of his clothes. He flashed back to how nice she was to him and how the two of them were so comfortable with each other now; like the two of them were the best of friends and a little bit more. Naruto started to remove his boxers and he was butt-naked while he then thought about how Hinata had acted and looked at that one moment in the woods<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naruto removed his clothes, alone in the washroom, Hinata used her Byakugan to see through the walls and watched Naruto strip down naked in front of her. She took a tissue and cleaned the blood that leaked from her nose when she saw Naruto shake his lovehandles and revealed his bare, well-rounded, somewhat-tan American-sized butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... Naruto...\u201d she moaned as she continued to snicker and watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flabby blonde fox boy then patted into the shower and he was soaked from head to toe when he dived in. He continued to think about the wonderful girl that had been taking such good care of him and flashed back to the moment when he landed on top of her: the sweet comment she made and the adorable look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018If I didn\u2019t know better... I would think she was in love with me...\u2019 but then he thought, \u2018No... That... that couldn\u2019t be true...\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started to blush as he came to a sudden realization and remembered all the times Hinata had blushed at him and the reason she used to hide her face around him and used to stutter. He blushed so much that even his bare and wet bloated butt cheeks flushed with color. Naruto then started to smile a little bit and this wonderful, enlightened feeling started to rise in his belly that almost made him feel like floating. He rested his hands on his bloated stomach, and then he started to frown and crashed back down to earth. He started to rub shampoo on his big belly while his fingertips explored every inch of fat on his rather large belly. He started to slap his big fat butt and continued to rub and squeeze all the soft flabby bloated inch of human flesh he could touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018No one in the world would fall in love with a dumb fatass like me... Hinata-chan deserves better...\u2019 he despaired a little bit, saddened and feeling about as fat as he looked underneath the illusion, \u2018But... I know this is out of nowhere... But I think I\u2019m starting to like Hinata-chan, too... I mean... I haven\u2019t thought of Sakura in a while now, and when I think about it... I don\u2019t even think she\u2019s that hot. Not now, at least. She acts too much like baa-chan. And now that she\u2019s like that she feels like another mean sister to me... But when I think about Hinata-chan...\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started to blush more and started to feel aroused as he thought about Hinata as she left the washroom, and when he was smack-down on top of her: His manboobs pressed against her boobs, that close contact, the smell of her sweet cinnamon breath, and the detail he failed to notice at the time when their crotches were pressed together had it not been for their clothes. Naruto then started to think, based on her comment at the time, that there was a chance she was attracted to him, even while he was fat. He smiled and continued to wash himself thoroughly to make sure he smelled nice to her and cleaned off all the sweat and stink. He made sure to take all the soap and rub it in-between his folds, lovehandles, bellybutton, hair, hips, arms, face, legs, and all over and in-between his butt. While he started to feel more and more aroused, Hinata watched as Naruto became excited and she almost fainted when he turned around and saw him at a frontal view. She had one last incredible nosebleed and then she retreated to the other washroom with a smile on her face and several tissues over her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Naruto! You beautiful man!\u201d she cheered, \u201cI love him so much!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When he was done with his shower about one hour later, Naruto waddled out, dried, and wore his usual clothes. He noticed that all of them felt looser on him, and he needed to shrink the waist size down several sizes to make sure his trousers didn\u2019t fall down to his knees. Once he was clean and clothed, he walked down to the kitchen and heard some mechanical noises, like a blender. When he entered the kitchen, he saw Hinata (her face now free of blood) had made a milkshake and had it poured into a tall gold-colored plastic cup. She carried the milkshake with both her hands and offered it to her obese love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offered it in a kind voice, \u201cHere, Naruto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde shinobi looked surprised and looked down into the cup to see the milkshake was no flavor he was familiar with. It looked like a mixture of several flavors and had a distinct swirl of caramel sauce in the middle. It looked delicious, but also a flavor of milkshake no one should ever drink often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Um, what\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, curious about the flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata half-lied to him and answered, \u201cIt\u2019s a diet milkshake. It tastes about the same as a normal double-chocolate triple-vanilla Oreo cookie dough syrup caramel sugar milkshake but with a lot fewer calories. Have some. You deserve it after that intense workout we shared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to the lie, he took the shake in his hands; shocked at how thick it looked and that it was the heaviest drink he ever felt, \u201cWhoa... It sure does looks a lot like a normal milkshake to me. And this is diet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat it is.\u201d she lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrugged and then he said, \u201cWell if it\u2019s a diet shake, then bottoms up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde shinobi didn\u2019t use a straw and decided to drink the milkshake and lick at the corners of his mouth as he felt the delicious shake leak a little bit as he drank. It was the sweetest and most delicious drink he had ever had in his life. Naruto didn\u2019t drink shakes that often, but this one was the best and he couldn\u2019t believe that it was still diet. So he swallowed gulp after gulp as Hinata watched him with a wide smile. She watched as the milkshake took effect at once and saw his stomach start to inflate, larger and larger until she could almost see his bellybutton. Naruto almost finished the entire shake before he took a break and Hinata wanted to know how much she knew he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked, \u201cHow does it taste?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm...\u201d he smiled as he licked the caramel from his lips and then he continued to drink, \u201cThat is delicious... And it\u2019s so thick...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe milkshake was filled with all the flavors Hinata had mentioned and more. There were calorie boosters and enhancements added to the mixture that would add an extra boost to the calorie boosters, make Naruto much more tired, and make him want to drink more. Not to mention that it accelerated his digestion process a little bit more and helped to convert whatever was in his stomach and added to his stomach to be turned into more fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled, \u201cYou sure do like it, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm!\u201d he said and took another break to tell her, \u201cI love it, Hinata-chan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad to hear that! I made it myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, could I have more?\u201d asked the fat gullible blonde ninja as he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled and smirked as she started to make a second diet milkshake for her beloved fatso, \u201cSure, Naruto!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been about one week ever since Naruto had awakened inside Hinata\u2019s bed and \u201cworked-out\u201d with her. In that time, he decided to remain at Hinata\u2019s clan estate until further notice, because Naruto was too embarrassed to let his friends and superiors see how fat he had become. Hinata had also made an excuse for him to Tsunade to make sure he wouldn\u2019t be bothered with missions or his team for a while. But while he was on his unofficial vacation, Naruto started to become much closer to his dear friend and started to see her as much more than a friend while she cared for him. And in return, Hinata had been a sweetheart to Naruto; helping him train and workout for what felt like hours to him but were no more than a mere few minutes at the most. All he ever did were sit-ups and stretches; where Naruto tried to lean down and reach his toes while Hinata watched as Naruto showed off his big fat bloated butt. She also made him more of those delicious so-called diet milkshakes, and made sure he had several of them between all his meals. She loved to watch him drink and drink as his vast stomach stretched out and blimped so large that his various shirts and sweat jackets rode up against his growing belly, exposing his bellybutton and lovehandles. Hinata also cooked all his meals for him, and even let him rest in a guest bedroom with an enormous and ultra-comfortable bed. While he was under the assumption that he was on a diet and an exercise retreat, Naruto was in paradise: constant paradise with unlimited food, drink, and entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all of that relaxation, increased laziness, minimal movement, constant abundance of food and drink had taken its toll. Hinata continued to trick him and had him eat entire feasts for almost all his meals: that included fat roasted stuffed chickens, tons of homemade ramen, BBQ soaked meats, burgers, fries, pizza, fried fish, and the most enormous and exquisite desserts. Whenever Hinata created an illusional trance that fooled him, she had him eat entire cakes, with donuts, cookies, more milkshakes, and various other sweets. After each meal she made him eat, she had him rest in bed and convert all the food in his stomach into more fat. Hinata continued this wonderful treatment, as Naruto seemed to get bigger, rounder, and chunkier everyday. But soon his beautiful feeder had to use the absolute concealment genjutsu once several of the other clan members returned to the estate from their clan-related missions. Which meant Hinata couldn\u2019t watch Naruto wobble and slosh around like a water balloon while he was unaware of his true size. She had to settle with the old method she used; where she fed him, induced him into a short coma-state, and unveiled his size at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with that said, Hinata felt it would soon be time to reveal the truth to Naruto and show him how fat he had become. With a little bit of luck he would accept his largeness and might even embrace it and become bigger. She couldn\u2019t wait to release all the illusions on her love and watch his reaction to his new size. Hinata had been so much more manipulative than she once was but now she hoped that she wouldn\u2019t have to be much more if her one true love embraced the lifestyle she intended him to have; one full of food, love, and morbid obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her fantasies and dreams were put on hold at the moment when Hinata realized Naruto was awake. She knew because she felt the floor beneath her feet rumble a little bit; louder and louder, harder and harder until her well fattened love walked into her bedroom, tired and slow. He soon walked into the kitchen area and Hinata smiled at him; even with the genjutsu that disguised his true form he was still fat. But Naruto was not as enormous as he was underneath the illusion. He still had a big belly that fell over his waistline, his shirt tucked into the immense waistband of his pajama pants to hold in his gut, with sizable manboobs, a nice double-chin, bloated cheeks, lovehandles, a wide and round butt that acted as a cushion for him whenever and where ever he sat down, arms filled with fat that almost made his somewhat shrunken muscles invisible, a thick set of jiggling thighs, and a big set of hips. Naruto was twice the size of Choji even with the constant illusion cast over him. It looked like Hinata either had to clean the blue pajamas she had lent to him or Naruto was too fat to wear them now. He still wore the white boxers with the plump red hearts on the butt cheeks that now started to ride up his thighs and look more like traditional underwear as he got bigger and rounder in shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started to smile at his closest friend as he waddled towards her and rubbed his fat stomach. In the last week, between meals, rest, so-called exercise, and snacks, he had formed an emotional bond with Hinata unlike the ones with his other friends and the two of them talked almost all the time. Naruto had told Hinata a lot about his life when she wanted to learn more about him and she in turn told him more about herself. There were no lies and there was no deceit this time around and there were even tears..... Well, Naruto was the one that cried when he talked about his few insecurities, and Hinata reached out and hugged him while he blew his nose with a tissue in a sad but more comical manner. She was a little bit distracted when Naruto embraced his friend and she smothered her face with his manboobs. She had to use all her willpower not to have a nosebleed or pass out, but even that wasn\u2019t enough to hold back a small dribble of blood that escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, it seemed like the emotional connection between the two friends started to grow and blossom into something more than a friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier in the week, Naruto and Hinata had another one of their talks but the two of them both almost leaned in to kiss each other while the two of them blushed, but then her little sister Hanabi had called out to her older sister and asked her for the charger for her handheld game console. Naruto and Hinata both coughed, Hinata looked a little bit mad at her sister, while Naruto tried to hide behind a plant very poorly since he was ten times wider than the plant. After the interruption, the two of them went straight to bed and never brought up the almost-kiss the next morning, which was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Naruto,\u201d she said as she offered her bathroom, \u201cShall we check your weight then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, \u201cYeah, I have a good feeling about this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do I...\u201d she smiled as she followed Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese blonde shinobi waddled as he turned and Hinata stared at his butt as she was aware that it was even bigger underneath the illusion and couldn\u2019t wait to see it and feel it again in her hands. Naruto soon led his mistress into the bathroom with the scale Hinata had rigged. Her blonde beloved was under the impression that he weighed somewhere around 230 pounds, but in reality, he weighed somewhere over 700 pounds. But Hinata had rigged the scale in the bathroom to trick him as he waddled onto the scale, waited, and then looked down to read his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled and almost bounced in the air, \u201cLook at this, Hinata-chan! I lost five pounds!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be!\u201d she pretended to be excited over his fake weight loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde fatso then said, \u201cWe should celebrate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about I cook a nice wholesome breakfast?\u201d Hinata mentioned as she intended to feed her fat piggy with more than what she mentioned, \u201cPancakes? Waffles? Bacon? An omelet or two can\u2019t hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was a huge fan of Hinata\u2019s cooking skills and he was very hungry as he reached and rubbed his large stomach as his thoughts became more focused on food, \u201cThat all sounds delicious! And how about a few more of those diet shakes? I could use one right about now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Naruto,\u201d smiled Hinata as she started to lead him to the kitchen and fatten him up, \u201cYou deserve a nice meal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata almost carried her love to the main dinning hall after a lot of the other clan members had finished breakfast. Hinata let Naruto sleep in as usual while he believed it was almost the crack of dawn. She cooked his breakfast with the aid of her shadow clones and helped him sit his big soft butt down in the widest seat she could find and tied a napkin around his fat neck. She then watched as Naruto stormed into the feast. He stuffed his face as if he were about to die as he ate each item on the breakfast table one at a time, which he finished in a matter of moments. He drank an entire milkshake, ate a meat and cheese loaded omelet, several waffles with butter hidden under whipped cream, ate several slices of bacon, and then drank another shake before he moved on to the various other breakfast foods that were handed over to him. Naruto was not under much influence this time around; all that was done to him was that he remained unaware that there was so much food all made for him while more and more of the fattiest meals were cooked and then slid in front of him to eat. Hinata had done a number on his stomach and made it so that Naruto\u2019s appetite was almost insatiable and the mere mention of her home-cooked meals triggered his need to feast. Which was also the reason he was unable to feel full as he stuffed himself with more breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of Hinata\u2019s clones handed him the last of his breakfast, Hinata treated herself to a normal platter of well-deserved pancakes with strawberries and cream while she watched the love of her life stuff his face with his countless meals. Naruto was under the influence of the illusion, but once it was over he would feel stuffed and think he had no more than two platters full of diet-food and one milkshake while he had more than four of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata rested back and drank a little bit of breakfast tea as she watched Naruto\u2019s stomach inflate with the food he consumed and then she said in a low whisper, \u201cSoon, Naruto... Soon you will be too fat to leave... Just one more week...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So he messed up his leg a bit, big deal. For someone like Tsunade he should be back on his feet in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really have no clue do you?\" Tsunade said. \"Well to answer your question, not for a few months at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Naruto bellowed. \"You've gotta be kidding me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, you really don't understand. This is not just a scrap or cut, you've really screwed up your leg and even for you, it'll take time to heal.\" And then Tsunade leaned in close to Naruto, gently forcing him back into bed. \"And in the meantime, that means you need to take it easy, and that means no training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way I'm just going to sit here in this hospital for months!\" Naruto said, defiance in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that Brat, which is why I'm not going to try and make you.\" At this, Naruto was filled with confusion. Tsunade never let things go so easily, she had to be up to something. \"This hospital isn't equiped to hold you for that long, and the staff can't have you disrupting everything every five minutes just because you're too stuborn for your own good. So, I'm releasing you with another shinobi, who will oversee your recovery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew it, but, for a shinobi to oversee him healing, they had to have medical training, even Naruto realized this. Which meant, just maybe, \"Sakura?\" Naruto questioned with hope, maybe this wouldn't be so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Naruto heard a small squeak as the door slid open and Hinata peeked in. \"Actually, me, Naruto,\" Hinata said meekly, eyes downcast. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Naruto felt terrible. \"No, wait Hinata, you've got nothing to be sorry for. You're great! I know that you'll have me back on my feet in no time!\" Naruto said gleefully, he really hated to see his friends upset, and he really did have faith both in Hinata's skills as a nurse and that he'd enjoy getting to know the shy girl better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Naruto-kun, I'll do my best,\" Hinata said shyly, looking down as hope rose in her chest. 'He is actually looking forward to spending time with me, maybe I'll be able to finally tell him how I feel!' That thought only made her heart pound faster in her chest and blood to rush even more to her cheecks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now remember Hinata, he'd not to train until I say so, so don't let him do anything more that he has to, keep him off his feet at all times. And make sure he eats properly, he needs more than just ramen to get better.\" Tsunade told Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Ramen is great, it has everything I need!\" Naruto exclaimed in defense of his favorite food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, no matter what he says. Now, I have work to do, Hinata, take good care of him.\" Tsunade called over her shoulder as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Lady Tsunade,\" Hinata bowed as she left. She then pushed a wheel chair up to Naruto's bedside. Naruto immediately moved to slide out of bed, but Hinata stopped him. \"Here, Naruto, let me help you,\" she said as she gently lifted Naruto's broken leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, you really don't have to,\" Naruto said, embarrassed as he rubbed the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want to, please let me help you Naruto-kun,\" Hinata gently replied, looking at him timidly. \"You've always done so much for me and your other friends, please let me help you,\" at this point she was almost pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Naruto felt horrible. \"Of course, Hinata, whatever you say. I didn't mean to make your job more difficult, I'm sorry.\" Naruto's tone was apoligetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's face began to heat up, but she forced herself to focus. Naruto needed her, this wasn't the time to faint or run away. \"It's fine Naruto,\" Hinata replied as she gently helped ease his way into his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's subsequent 'thank you' did what seemed impossible as Hinata's face heated further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going anyway Hinata?\" Naruto questioned as she pushed him out of the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 choices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice A: \"Back to your apartment Naruto, I'll be stopping by everyday to take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice B: \"One of the smaller Hyuuga mansions.

He'd encountered Hinata some-where along the way, and they had been having a conversation for a while..well he had done most of the talking but Hinata tried her best to pitch in now and then. He'd been waiting outside a book-store while Hinata had been shopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis interruption in their trip was over, and they returned to Naruto's apartment. The battle from Sora had splintered several chakra cells in Naruto's arms, and he had been forced by Tsunade to take it easy. No Jutsu, no mayhem. Hinata was his care-taker for the time being, and he had enjoyed her company. He had known the quiet girl to become less than confident in his presence and he opted to know why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was about to ask, five hours later, Hinata interrupted with the announcement of dinner. It consisted of a huge amount of chicken soup, with Ramen as a side dish. He was able to eat all of the meal, bloating his stomach. Hinata herself was bloated from the meal as well. Both of the ninja found themselves on the couch of Naruto's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great Hinata! You should cook more often!\" Naruto praised her. He noticed her face turned slightly red, knowing it was an continuous habit in his presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks n-Naruto-kun,\" Hinata replied smiling slightly she got off the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hinata why do you turn red when I'm around?\" Naruto asked her as the Hyuga heir began washing the dishes. She froze up for a second, almost dropping the plate in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't tell him, the closest thing she had in mind would able to satisfy him for now until she was able...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really like your company Naruto.\" she answered him smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto accepted this answer and retired to his room at 8pm. Hinata sighed, finally finishing the plates and went into the guest room. She closed the door and turned on the light, she picked up a book entitled 'How to Make a Man fall in love with you' and flipped to the chapter she was on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was entitled ' The way to a man's heart, is through his stomach,' <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt lucky to be dating such a wonderful girl; she was kind, always supported him, had a nice rack and was an amazing cook to boot! Every day she would bring him huge home cooked meals and encourage him to eat as much as he wanted and then some, Life was good\u2026 Of course he had a teensy complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to get a new washing machine\u2026 And a new wardrobe, I can\u2019t believe all my clothes shrunk. Stupid old piece of junk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whiskered fox boy stretched like a cat while he rubbed his bare belly, he hadn\u2019t been wearing much more then his boxers for the last few days when he was lounging around in his house and was avoiding leaving home to train, all his clothes where becoming uncomfortably snug and so he wanted to avoid wearing them as much as he could.  But no it was not the fault of the washing machine that had put Naruto in a bind, the culprit was none other then Hinata herself or at least her cooking was to blame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth Naruto had been gaining quite a bit of weight since he had started seeing Hinata- not that he really noticed oblivious as he is of course to most it was quite clear. Naruto\u2019s face had plumped up and his chin had found itself doubled, which wasn\u2019t even that evident in comparison to the girth Naruto had gained his stomach. He developed quite the potbelly hanging prominently over his Ramen themed boxers and the spare tire wrapped around his waist line now made the tattoo which held the Demon Fox look much smaller then it really was.  His chest was becoming padded though they couldn\u2019t be called moobs quite yet, arms and legs thickened with added mass and his butt was becoming porkier by the day. Naruto\u2019s appearance was rapidly beginning to become more in line with the members of the Akimichi clan rather then the athletic build of a normal shinobi. Still his unearthly stamina hadn\u2019t changed though he was focusing it more on eating lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had just begun his fourteenth cup of instant ramen when he had heard the knocking at the door. Shamelessly without leaving his meal he created a shadow clone to answer the door while he ate, breakfast was the most important meal and shouldn\u2019t be interrupted was his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the growing fox boy finished his meal his portly shadow clone answered the door to reveal the bashful face of his much beloved girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-good Morning Naruto-kun! I\u2019m sorry to interrupt you\u2019re breakfast.\u201d Before Hinata would have probably fainted at the sight a of a shirtless Naruto out of shape or not but since dating him found her self far more comfortable around her paramour, not to mention after this had happened the first few times it was starting to lose its edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHinata! Is it 11 already? Sorry about that I\u2019m just finishing up. I\u2019ll be done in a minute.\u201d Naruto said as he let her in, the two where going to go find him some new clothes and then go on a picnic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing off a few more cups of ramen Naruto quickly took a shower before getting dressed, something which was becoming a much more daunting task then he had expected. The black shirt with a red spiral he normally wore during his time off clung tightly to his skin emphasizing each of his new curves and showed the slightest amount of skin on his tanned gut, but the hardest part was yet to come. Naruto struggled with the blisteringly tight waistband of his orange shorts he just couldn\u2019t make the button and the hole come together not with his gut in the way. It took some careful manuvering and better part of a half hour but he eventually got the ends to meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeheh. I bet I look silly in such small clothes don\u2019t I Hinata?\u201d Naruto joked childishly modeling the black shirt which rode up his gut and shorts which reminded her a bit of a bag filled with far more then it was meant to hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo not at all Naruto-kun they aren\u2019t that small\u2026\u201d Hinata fibbed but only slightly after all it was him that was getting bigger in reality his clothes hadn\u2019t changed at all. Hinata hadn\u2019t the heart to tell Naruto he was getting fat, he would always look amazing in her eyes in fact something about a chunkier Naruto got the blood rushing to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm\u2026 Maybe Naruto-kun should get some bigger sizes?\u201d Hinata said as Naruto picked up a pair of orange pants in his old size \u201cIn case the drier shrinks them again I mean.\u201d She added after noting the confused look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat idea Hinata! Then I won\u2019t have to get a new washer!\u201d Naruto grinned childishly and grabbed some garments more appropriate to his new size as Hinata sighed with relief. That is until Naruto dropped a coin he was about to pay with and as he was going to pick it up\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIPPPP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seat of Naruto\u2019s to small pants had torn itself trying to stretch itself too thin over his sizable rump, Naruto quickly shot up to hide the tear but unfortunately while doing so\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto exerted far too much force on the front of his shorts and the button which he had taken far too long to do up was sent sailing through the air which let his confined belly hang far more freely then the shorts had previously allowed, though it was embarrassing he couldn\u2019t help but feel relief for his widening waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm perhaps it would be best if you wore you\u2019re new purchases on you\u2019re way out?\u201d The shopkeeper joked lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded quickly his chubby face as red as a tomato as he seized the heavier set garments and quickly dashed to the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata froze up, would Naruto catch on to how the clothes which where supposed to be way baggier fit him like a glove? What if he noticed how much he had gained since she had started dating him? What if he broke up with her? And she had been beginning to warm up to the idea of her teddy bear like Naruto-kun\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t notice how I was packing on the pounds like this! I\u2019m probably looking more like a sumo then a ninja huh?\u201d Naruto paid the shop keep patting his gut as they left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Naruto-kun it\u2019s my fault\u2026 I guess my cooking is to blame\u2026\u201d Hinata said, now down on herself, she gripped the large bento she packed for they\u2019re picnic date. \u201cWe better just throw this out and I\u2019ll stop making your meals all together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on a second Hinata, lets not be too hasty about that!\u201d Naruto blurted out, his thoughts drifting to the thought of Hinata\u2019s cooking, there was no way he could start cutting back now that he tasted good food no matter how big it was making him. \u201cI mean- Uh\u2026 I can start a new diet another time, you just worked so hard on the meal and all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but Naruto-kun\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact you don\u2019t need to stop cooking for me! I\u2019ll just start train twice as hard from now on and you\u2019ll have you\u2019re foxy boyfriend back in no time!\u201d Naruto said sucking in his gut to try and prove his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Naruto-kun so shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto reclined himself back into the grass his gut pushing tightly against his new t-shirt, no matter ho painful the bloat was however it was worth it. \u201cMy compliments to the chef, that was amazing Hinata!\u201d Then a rather loud belch escaped him making his face flush greatly. Hinata just giggled and began to rub the soreness out of the taut flabby tissue causing Naruto\u2019s blush to deepen with gratification. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh yeah definitely worth it, I could get used to this\u2026 Wait did I really think being fat was great!?\u2019 Naruto thought \u2018I can\u2019t be serious! I mean I\u2019ll never be Hokage if I\u2019m this out of shape and Hinata doesn\u2019t want some fat glutton for a boyfriend\u2026\u2019 Naruto thought dejectedly to himself as Hinata snuggled close next to him quickly dozing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, you\u2019re so soft Naruto-kun\u2026 Like my own giant teddy bear.\u201d She mumbled in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Did she just say\u2026? Does that mean she wouldn\u2019t mind if I got even bigger? Am I really considering actually GETTING bigger!?\u2019 Looking at Hinata laying on his chest with her arms wrapped so comfily around his fleshy midsection, Naruto\u2019s thoughts changed again \u2018Then again Chouji\u2019s entire family is full of powerful ninja, an amazing future Hokage like me could totally be a super powerful heavyweight shinobi!\u2019</span></div></div>",

However, this Hinata was not the same small, frail Hinata everyone recognized so easily; this Hinata had an appearance that was suited for an Akimichi.  Yes it was true, the heir to the Hyuga clan had porked up to a very heavy size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face, which was voted by many villagers, especially Naruto, as \"very cute,\" had become much rounder and softer, and acquired a pair of chubby cheeks, and a slight double chin.  Her long, dark blue hair had helped frame her chubby face.  Her arms, which a month ago were very thin and showed signs of muscle, were now plump and thick with jiggly fat.  Her breasts, which were very impressive when she was thin and were the envy of some women, had grown a size up in the last month, and rested on her abdomen.  Her belly, which had become Naruto's favorite part of Hinata, had swelled up to the size of a beach ball as it slightly bounced as she walked and tightly hugged the fabric of the shirt and jacket Hinata was wearing; you could even see her deepened naval through the coat.  Her behind, like her stomach, had also grown to a fairly decent size, padded with fat. Her legs, like her arms, had plumped up, with her thighs almost touching as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hinata-chan!\" Naruto enthusiastically exclaimed as he leaned forward to kiss her chubby cheek, the bellies touching on the way.  Hinata blushed at Naruto's romantic gesture, as he invited her in.  \"So what do you want to do today Hinata-chan? Are you hungry for anything? Do you want to go out to eat anyplace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I think we should just stay inside today and have a good lunch...\" Hinata suggest as she and Naruto sat side-by-side on Naruto's couch, sinking into the furniture.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. \"I like the sound of that!\" The two heaved themselves off the couch and proceeded to make the biggest lunch possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Naruto and Hinata were groaning as they lied on the floor of the apartment, food containers scattered across the floor.  Their stomachs, which each of them were slowly rubbing, had become hard as they slowly digested the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, maybe we ate a bit too much...\" Hinata said in between heavy breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Let's get off the floor and lie on the couch.  It's waaaaaay more comfortable than the floor.\" Naruto said as he slowly lifted himself off the floor.  He then walked over to Hinata and grabbed her hand to help lift her up too.  They laid down on the couch for a few minutes as they became drowsier....they almost....fell into.....a.......deep....sleep.................................................. .when suddenly there was a knock at the door to Naruto's apartment...<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

The plush Hyuga immediately going red faced at the Hokage's scrutiny. Naruto then waddled over to his girlfriends side so she wouldn't be alone during whatever the old woman had planned for them. After a few very tense moments that seemed to last forever Tsunade finally said something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well if I wasn't seeing it for myself I wouldn't believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Hinata's face goes a deeper shade of red and her breathing starts to pick up the poor girl getting dangerously close to a panic attack, while Naruto was also particularly anxious mostly because Tsunade-baa-chan has yet to start screaming at them, we was mentally yelling at the godaime to start yelling at him like she always does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you two, make yourselves presentable and meet me in my office in lets say an hour or two, so we can discuss all of this.\" Said Tsunade while gesturing to the two young shinobi before turning on her heel and marching out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tsunade's office</i><br>\r\nAbout an hour later the two plus sized ninja were sitting in the waiting room outside the Hokage's office, waiting for her to call them in, Hinata was spending the whole time trying to keep her to small shirt from riding up her still bloated stomach, a tinge of pink on her cheeks. While Naruto was glairing at the door wondering what the old hags end game was, it was one thing to make him sit and stew while waiting for the punishment, it was another making poor Hinata-chan suffer too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-kun, Hinata-san, Tsunade-sama is ready to see you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two look up at Shizune, who was clearly trying her best, and unfortunately failing, not to stare at the two as they waddled by her desk and into Tsunade's office proper. It seemed the same as always except sitting on the desk were two rather tasty smelling bowls of fried rice, which despite having eating an impressive meal not that long ago made both of their stomachs rumble slightly in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome you two, sit eat, you probably need a little snack after the long trip over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young lovers carefully squeeze themselves into the now too small chairs Hinata reaches for one of the bowls muttering a very quite and shy thank you, while Naruto stares at the other bowl before deciding he can't take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright what is this some kind of weird form of torture!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever do you mean Naruto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't give me that you psychotic old lady, your probably planning to feed us to the point were ready to explode so we swear off over eating the rest of our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looks at the scoop of rice she was about to eat nervously at Naruto's statement and then slowly and carefully sets the chopsticks back down in the bowl. Tsunade gives off a long suffering sigh before pinching the bridge of her nose to unsuccessfully stave of the rapidly building migraine that seems to follow that boy everywhere he went, how Hinata was able to put up with his nonsense was beyond her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright look, normally I would box both of your ears for doing something so stupid, but for once your lack of foresight benefits us in a big way. you see every couple of years or so there's a big sumo tournament held at the fire damiyo's palace, and every time we send a couple of Akimichi's to do the job, and every year they win it for us, but the problem is the other villages participating in the tournament have signed a petition preventing us from using Akimichi's this year, So the fact of the matter is we need at least one of you to participate or otherwise I, I mean we'd lose a big wind fall. The pride of our village is at stake, so what do you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eye twitched a little knowing in the back of his mind that this somehow had something to do with the old ladies gambling debts.

Standing up, he made himself to get ready and start a new daily routine.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange clad boy made his way down the village.  It had become noontime and unlike his usually training activities, he had decided to try out some new restaurants.  He noticed that they were newly opened and had become extremly popular. Many of the eaters had bloated guts and large bums.  Feeling a bit peckish, he decieded to head down to ichiraku's modest ramen stand.  He has seen Hinata earlier that day and she would be occupied with clan affairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the small eatery and greeted the old man and his young daughter.

I was kinda joking when I said that.\" Naruto decided to do the same as his friend and order a few more bowls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I saw how much fun you where having with the whole getting fat thing, and I though I would try it.  For a bit anyway.\" explained the girl. She had a bit of a blush and was clearly embarassed for having to explain this descision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, but why go wtih this bet.  Why not just forget about it and just get fat on purpose?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be more interesting this way.\" said Sakura with a smirk.

After thinking about it for a moment he simply scratched his head and gave the girl an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I haven't thought about that.  It would be nice...\" The kyuubi-container began to wonder if his girl would actually be willing to get fat with him.  His thoughts of a fatter future where soon interuppted by the girl sitting next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's go over the terms, kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, well you said you would gain and lose it right?  Let's set a proper weight range and time limit for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the looks of how fat yo got, it seems like you gained at least fifty pounds.  So I'll go for 60lbs.  I currently weigh 115lbs so all of that fat would put me at 175lbs.\" said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sounds good.  Now just the time.  How long do you think is fair?\" asked Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, girls tend to lose weight slower than men, so two months will be fine.  I'll have you and Hinata witness my initial weight, my goal weight and my final weight?  Sound reasonable?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!  Now just the winning and losing terms.\" said the boy with a smile.  He was getting quite excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, if I win, you gotta get one of our friends to gain 100lbs.\" said the girl with a bit of a laugh.  She would love to see how hard that'll be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Why?\" exclaimed Naruto.  he had thought she was going to make him pay her all of his cash or something like that.  He had no idea that she would chose something as hard as that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple.  It'll be hilarious to see how the hell you're gonna pull that off.\" At this point Sakura was doing her best not to laugh at her friend's shocked face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Fine, fine.  So if you lose you gotta convince Tsunade-baa-chan to gain as much as your max weight during the course of your bet, and you yourself have to gain till you're 300lbs.  Fair?\"  Sakura's face visably paled at her losing condition.  Not only would she convince her master to get fat, but she nearly had to triple in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair?\" repeated Naruto one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fine.  Deal.\" said Sakura as she extended her hand.  Naruto took it and shook it.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And with that, the contest officially began with Sakura's last slurp of her ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an easy bet after all, at least on Naruto's part. For once, the (now)flabby fox of Konoha could sit back and relax; just lounge around and hang out with his timid girlfriend. He considered it a vacation, his days were filled with cuisine most would consider quite fine, his nights were filled with innocent outings with Hinata, and his meals were filled with all the love she could possibly pour into them. Hinata was happy as a clam to just sit back and cuddle with her big round boyfriend, who seemed to be getting bigger and rounder by the day. At first she had some concerns for Naruto's health, but after a while she had grown quite accustomed to snuggling up against his soft fleshy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura, however, didn't have it near as easy: Her days couldn't have been described as stressful, but they certainly weren't a walk in the park. First of all, gaining enough weight to match Naruto's <i>starting</i> weight in this little competition was hard work. Sakura's rearend was constantly parked, be it at the ramen stand, her dinnertable, or even Naruto's dinnertable, her slowly swelling cheeks never left a seat. This caused terrible wedgies and a really sore tailbone, While not exactly life-threatening, Sakura still felt quite uncomfortable. Another daily pain that Sakura had to deal with was her stomach, which had to be kept full at all times lest lose the first condition of their bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as her weight kept climbing higher and higher, Sakura found it harder and harder to keep up an exercise regime. While packing on enough pounds to match her friend's own girth wasn't easy, finding the motivation to exercise was a lot harder than she thought it would be. And at her size, practicing taijutsu wasn't very practical. If she wanted to get back into shape, she would have to go through basic training just to get to a level where physical labor wasn't nearly as streinuous. Even jogging around the village was out of the question (mostly since she would have to pass the Yamanaka Flower Shop, something that she wouldn't dare due at her current weight)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if anything, Sakura Haruno was persistent! Naruto could lounge around with Hinata all he wanted and get huge all he wanted, <i>no way</i> was she going to lose!<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nNaruto insisted on meeting at Ichiraku's to unveil the results. This was convenient enough for him, since this meant that he could not only officially start his gloating today (he had seen Sakura about a week ago, no way he was losing) but he could also catch some ramen <i>and</i> let Hinata take a break from cooking lunch! Everybody wins, except for Sakura that is. He waddled down the street with his signature grin slapped onto his round face. Hinata, who kept right beside him and attached at the palm, also smiled that meek smile of hers. The past two months had been wonderful for both of them; and it was all thanks to a little bet between Naruto and another woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had spent this little vacation wisely. Like a smart couple, they planned something for every night. whether it be the movies, the buffet, a walk around the village, or hanging out with their friends, they found a way to make it romantic. It was great for their relationship, and to satisfy Naruto's insatiable appetite; which had certainly grown these past few weeks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi had learned to listen for Naruto's heavy footsteps, every time the kid walked in it meant another lease payment lately, and had a bowl ready for him on sight. \"Hey, Naruto!\" he called out to the flabby fox, \"Heads up, got your favorite right here!\" the blond smiled, \"Thanks Mr. Chef!\" he grunted as he sat his heavy rear down on the plush stool. Hinata sat down next to him, ordering a bowl for herself and turning to smile at her boyfriend. Certainly indulging her pudgy paramour wasn't anything to be ashamed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpectedly, Naruto finished a whole bowl before the pinkheaded porker could waddle her own ponderous way down to Ichiraku's. She found herself blushing, it wasn't often that she found herself this nervous. \"Hey, Naruto! Hinata!\" she called out, waving out to the couple, \"Over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two turned to see a very pre-anticiapated sight, Sakura couldn't lose any of the weight she professed. Quite blobby in shape, Sakura's top half took a majority of her weight just like Naruto. In fact, she and Naruto were about par now; they both weighed in at about a whopping 200 pounds. While Naruto hadn't gone completely soft, though one could hardly tell just by looking, Sakura had devoted the prior two months to eating; solely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Naruto said with his usual fervor, \"So, I see you're still chubby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you're still a fathead!\" Sakura noogied him, \"You don't have to be so curt about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\"</span></div></div>",

Warm thoughts of her outgrowing all of her clothes, stuffing herself with Naruto, eating anything she wanted.  A red blush slowly came over her face as she thought over this more and more.  As soon as she was about to give Naruto an answer, he suddenly placed his large hand on her petite tummy.  The small girl flinched a bit as his hand was slightly cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Hina-chan, I think that this will make us both happier.  I mean, I love being this big and I just want to share these feelings with you.\" said the blond as he gently kissed the girl on her forehead.  She placed both her hands on Naruto's as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll do it Naruto-kun.  I want us to grow happy together.\" said the girl as she flashed him a cute smile.  The girl then reached into the basket which she used to carry the hefty feast she fed to Naruto and pulled out a large cake.  It was white and was covered with chocolate strawberries and it was lettered \"For Naruto\" in gel frosting.  Naruto began to slightly drool at the sight of the big pastry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made this cake for you to eat for dessert, but do you mind if I eat it instead Naruto-kun?\" asked the pale girl with an almost pleading look in her white eyes.  Naruto had to look away due to how cute his girlfriend looked.  With a blushing face of his own he simply nodded and watch the smaller girl eat the delicacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum, it tastes so good Naruto-kun!\" exclaimed the girl between mouth-fulls.  Nartuo watched as his girlfriend devoured the sweet treat.  Soon, the girl was finished with her first meal towards her path of fatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here's to the next hundred pounds Hina-chan!\" exclaimed the blond as he wrapped his girl in a tight embrace, pushing her still thin frame into his heavy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? A hundred pounds!\" shouted Hinata in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course.  You're gonna gain until you get as big as me.  We'll focus on fattening up you first, then we'll be able to eat together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's fine.  I'll gain as much as you want Naruto-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" said the boy as he flashed the girl one of his trademarked smiles.  \"Come-on ,it's getting late.

Like test subjects for a new medical treatment, You remember when Chouji ate those pills and lost all that weight right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want gain weight not lose it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m getting to that!\u201d Sakura yelled back, tempted to slug Naruto in his precious belly. \u201cWe where working on a new kind of food pill that would convert chakra into fat instead of the other way around.</span></div></div>",

Not to mention how much more of her delicious cooking I could eat...\" He was almost drooling at the thought. His thought where interrupted by Tsunade's entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!?\" She asked with disbelief \"Are you the volunteer for this experiment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsunade-baachan!\" Naruto shrieked sucking in his gut unable to keep it held in for long it surged back out with gusto leaving him entirely exposed, he hadn't exactly told Tsunade his plans to get fatter yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sized Naruto looking up and down, \"You've put on the pounds since the last time I saw you, You do know that there is a physical standard for shinobi don't you?\" walking up and pinching a generous portion of stomach flab causing Naruto to yelp in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow ow ow ow ow! It was Hinata who got me fat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade merely gave Naruto a look which could only say 'What you talkin about?' and pinched the doughy flesh even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay! I've been a huge glutton lately but I really like being fat and Hinata really likes me chunky now let go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the answer Tsunade let go of his belly letting it jiggle back to its optimal shape with Naruto rubbing the soreness out of his now red love handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've seen people do dumber things when they are in love.\" Tsunade shrugged \"But I hope you know you'll have to work even harder now to carry your own weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto responded with an eager salute and a foxy grin spreading from cheek to chubby cheek<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right lets get you're information down before we start the procedure, so we can measure how much weight you gain.\" Tsunade said ushering Naruto too the clinical scale they had on the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully Tsunade moved the bars trying to gauge Naruto's exact weight \"Hmm... Not even 200 lbs yet...\" she muttered lowering the weight bars, Naruto couldn't help but frown- his fattening plan had slowed down quite a bit after the his initial gain \"There, you're at 183 lbs right now, Naruto.\" doing some mental math which took a lot more brain power then it should have told Naruto he was about 70 pounds up from his original weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade then took out a vial with a bright pink pill in, \"Alright Naruto, last chance to back out of this now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it on.\" Naruto said taking the pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed into his mouth and bit down and swallowed, it tasted like bacon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Naruto felt his chakra coils strain with pressure as if the energies where being siphoned out, the feeling spread to his flesh and changed to tremendous gaseous pain causing Naruto to double over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt the pain intensify as his chakra began to deplete converting into fat tissue swelling his body all around; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with his cheeks growing to obstruct his view slightly and he tried to look down only to feel his second chin pressing further and further down his neck and then felt his skin begin to pinch in the neck hole of his shirt, the muscle in his arms disappeared hidden under the surge of corpulent new flesh pulling apart the shoulder seams. His chest engorged slowly filling out to an impressively sized pair of pillowy boy breasts beginning to droop onto his husky belly as it began to push out and his feet began to disappear from view and the growing draft in his midsection told him his shirts front was slowly began to ride up and grow tighter around his expanding girth, finally his now santa sized gut dislodged itself from the front of his shirt completely and began to fold over the lip of his boxers and his inner tube like love handles pushed his shirt up his back. Tearing noises let signaled that his now very ill fitting shirt tear itself apart at the seams trying to contain far more of his body then it could handle. A similar feeling spread lower his thighs thickening and rubbing together as the plump cheeks of his butt began bulge and sag but luckily his comically leaf print boxers where made of a more durable material growing stretching thin and cutting into him tightly but managed kept his modesty in tact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the pain subsided into exhaustion as Naruto felt his world go black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwakening in a hospital bed 3 days later from a loud gurgle in his empty stomach Naruto brought his hand to rub it but then felt his hand sink into the soft flesh of his now porcine belly and winced in pain. Instantly remembering what he was doing he shot up from his bed then finding his movements clumsy and sluggish and his body sore and heavy caused him to stumble onto the cold floor butt first. Luckily for him now padded enough to cushion the fall, Naruto quickly picked himself up feeling his heavy body jiggle and slosh with every slight movement as he squeaked in shock from the feeling of the cold floor on his bare bottom looking down he noticed he was dressed in an uncomfortable hospital gown which left much of his backside exposed because the strings could not tie the paper like fabric all the way around his rotund physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naruto-kun?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's face lit up like a bonfire upon hearing the tired squeak of his girlfriend come from behind him, apparently she had fallen asleep beside his bed visiting him and he did not notice her presence upon awakening. In attempt to cover up his wide behind Naruto slapped his pudgy hands and sausage like fingers to it and quickly turned around his gut swaying in a few seconds behind the rest of his body to face his girlfriend who's face was at least as red as his, No such luck but from the look on her face it looked like Hinata liked what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly gaining her bearings the petite girl marched up to Naruto and planted one on his lips and he eagerly returned the gesture after however he felt Hinata jab her finger hard into his still sore gut he wouldn't be surprised if the blow was laced with her Gentle Fist style chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard from Sakura that you where put in the Hospital after an experimental medication, I was so worried! Why didn't you tell me you where going to do something so reckless?\" Hinata asked clearly miffed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Hinata, I guess I just wanted to surprise you is all.\" Naruto said calming her \"But it was so worth it! I mean don't I look great\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata couldn't argue with that; Naruto's plump cheeks complimented the whisker marks on them and the wide smile he wore worked well with the layers of flab mounded under his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I take it your happy with the results.\" Came the voice of the Hokage walking in stride was a man in armor bearing a striking similarity to Choji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez don't you ever knock!?\" Naruto cried reaching for a pillow to hide his rump from his new visitors. \"And your even bringing strangers with you!\" he said pointing accusingly at the man who accompanied her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing lightly at his expense the man  bowed \"I'm Chouza Akimichi, its a pleasure to meet you, I'm Choji's father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here to measure you up now Naruto.\" Tsunade chided ushering him to the scale where he found to his delight he was well above the 200 mark pulling a mean 228 pounds he was now heavier then Choji he jumped up and down with glee causing body to quake with jiggles and gave Hinata a big smooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that, that is settled I bet your wondering why Chouza is here.\" Seeing Naruto nod she continued \"As you know that pill was made as a recovery pill for those who have taken the Red Chili pill and it worked quite well...\" She said eying the gut that hung down just a little down Naruto's thighs. \"But we realized with that as you're body is not properly conditioned to move properly with so much more bulk and weight then its used to,  as you are a potential successor to the Hokage Chouza has graciously agreed to teach you in their shinobi arts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eye lit up with exitement, it was rare that outsiders where taught clan secrets turning to Chouza he saw him smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have great expectations for you Naruto, you can help show how strong our clan really is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---</span></div></div>",

Sakura sighed, her friend was always difficult to deal with. She watched him down the broth and noodles, a certain feeling building up inside her. She recalled when the bet first began, how she gorged herself night and day. The stuffed feeling was quite difficult to 'get rid off' and even now, the temptation to gorge herself silly was quite high. Of course she rationalized that she needed the money for her books and tried to stay strong. Placing a hand on her now flat and toned stomach, the girl 'felt' the bulging gut she had managed to gain just a few weeks ago. Naruto stared at the girl, finding her expression quite weird. He doubted that she had any remorse for taking his money and just figured that her weight loss was rough on her. The blonde managed to finish his bowl and stood up to leave, his hefty body feeling especially heavy due to the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for the grub Sakura, but I'm going to take off.\" said Naruto as he shuffled out of the both. Sakura watched him leave and she was left with the tab. When Teuchi, the old chef asked her if she was good to go with the tab, Sakura merely ordered an extra large bowl of pork flavored ramen. She had money to burn after all.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nWalking home, Sakura was conflicted. On one hand, she felt absolutely amazing, having eaten three bowls of noodles after Naruto left. On the other, she had blown through a bit of her winnings and wouldn't be able to afford all of her books. She knew it was foolish, but the pink haired girl couldn't help herself! Reaching her apartment, she found it just like she had left it. During her gain, her floor was covered with discarded clothes that no longer fit her, empty wrappers and jugs of milk and even empty ramen cups. When she went into overdrive in order to lose the weight, soon her fat clothes replaced her thin ones and training equipment was now littered on the wooden surface. Bending down, she picked up a pair of her black shorts that were many sizes bigger than her current figure. They were made of spandex and she could only imagine how her immense rear looked like previously encased in such a tight fabric. Heading towards her fridge, she could see that it was quite empty, filled only with protein supplements that were low in calories and her own 'energy balls' that tasted awful but were nutritious in a sense. Finally reaching her resolve, Sakura knew what had to be done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Time for a fridge run.'<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nNaruto returned home with a sigh. There were very few missions available at the moment and even then, they offered little cash for the blonde. In his living room, he found Hinata happily snacking away on some ice cream that the both got on their last food run. Hinata had offered to buy food many times in the past, most likely to support her own 'wants' but the blonde didn't want to rely on her that much for money. What kind of man would her be if he mooched off of his girlfriend! Hinata noticed Naruto come into the living room and gave a warm smile. Naruto sat down next to her and gave her a small hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it go with Sakura?\" asked Hinata in an innocent tone. Naruto grimaced at such a name but had to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, she's even thinner than you, what the hell.\" complained the blonde, throwing himself against the back of the couch. Hinata frowned at the word 'thin' but Naruto did not see such a subtle motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its fine Naruto, I can give you the money you lost.\" Shooting back up, Naruto had a frantic look on his face. Of course he wanted to take the money but what would that say about the kind of person he was? Taking money from 'poor innocent Hinata' would seem quite heartless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't do that! It wouldn't feel right y'know. I think I just need to get a job, missions have been kinda dry for a shinobi of my caliber.\" Placing a finger to her chin, Hinata began to think of ways that her Naruto could make money without relying on less than savory means. A thought popped into her mind and it felt like a light bulb appeared on to top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Naruto I think I know a way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" The long haired girl nodded, having seen something earlier that could aid him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um today, when I went to go buy a few snacks for myself, I came across a bakery that was hiring. Um we can both work there if you'd like since I kinda want to stop relying on my clan for financial stuff.\" Working in a bakery sounded easy enough and it could help further his own goals as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, let's go check it out early tomorrow, but for now lets get ready on dinner.\" </span></div></div>",

You need to learn to indulge once in a while.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they place their orders, Hinata began to think of overeating with Naruto.  If he could get fat, why couldn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time does she really want to get fat or stay fit? If she gets fat, then she won't be able to take care of Naruto and the life of a ninja can be very dangerous.

Hinata decides that she wants to get fat alongside Naruto and the weight is soon pouring on for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB. Hinata is too concerend about Naruto. How can he be expected to survive missions if he's not in top form? But after everything he's been through, Naruto deserves to indulge himself. So, Hinata will just have to make sure he's taken care of on his missions.</span></div></div>",

Don't you think we've been getting kinda fat lately?\" asked Naruto as he inspected his new, heavier body with a full length mirror in his room.  He and his precious Hina-chan had been eating non-stop since that one night, and only now had the kyuubi-boy began to notice the obvious changes in his body.  A large gut had formed over his formerly flat stomach.  It easily jiggled with the slightest of motions and even poked itself from under his tight black shirt.  His limbs were now thicker and padded with a few layers of fat.  His bum had also grown quite large, which Hinata enjoyed greatly.  His face now became rounded and gave him a softer look.  He already had a full-blown double chin.  His pudgy hands examinded his heavier lower body, the pj pants he was currently wearing was pretty tight against his widened waisteline.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, *slurp* did you say something? *slurp*. said the heavyweight Hyuuga as she ate an extra-large bowl of prawn ramen.  A closer look of the room showed that various food boxes and ramen bowl were littered accross the room.  Eating food in his room had no longer stood as a unkempt tendency.  In fact, it was Hinata that first thought of the idea of the new habit.  The girl, like the boy had engorged herself into fatness.  Currently, she sat on the edge of Naruto's bed, causing it to creek against her heavy weight.  Dressed in only a simple shirt and short shorts, the girl's gain was beautifully shown.  Her stomach had grown large and heavy.  It rolled over her larger waistline and rolled over onto her pudgy paunch.  Her thick and fattened legs hung over the side of the bed.  Once lean and trim, the had become lost in softness.  Her bum had nearly doubled in size.  Each heavy cheek had become round and soft.  Both easily jiggled with each of her steps.  Her breasts, while already impressive before had become swollen with fat.  Both had easily gone up a few cup sizes and rested quite nicely on her flabby tummy.  The girl's face had also become rounder and easily rivaled Naruto's face.  The soft fat made Hinata have an even cuter face.  The girl had soon finished her meal and discarded the bowl onto the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if we had gained any weight lately?\" said Naruto as he pointed to his hefty gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe we've gotten a bit flabby.\" answered the girl as she patted her own belly.  Ever since she had decided to get fatter with her Naruto, she had tried to make their gains not as noticable, despite the obvious physical changes that gaining weight brought.  She was lucky that Naruto hadn't noticed the changes right away.  Naruto moved himself from the front of the mirror and sat next to his plump girlfriend.  He failed to notice the bed straining further under their combined weights.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're more than just flabby...\" began the blond.  Suddenly the legs of the bed gave out and caused it to collapse.  The fat couple sat on the floor in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think we might be fat.\" concluded Naruto. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Naruto and Hinata tried their best to recover from their shock of crashing to the floor, a knock was heard coming from the door.  Naruto heaved and hoed himself up to his feet, albeit a bit of difficulty, and answered the door.  There in front of him were four of his Rookie Nine friends.  And boy, were they different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of the group was Sakura, who looked to be just a \"tiny\" bit smaller than Naruto in size.  The pink haired kunoichi had gained a substantial amount of weight in the last few months.  Where once was pure muscle, was replaced with jiggly flab.  The majority of Sakura's fat had been centered around her belly, which now clung tightly to her red dress so tightly, that her deepening navel could be seen in plain sight.  Love handles were starting to develop on each side of her monstrous belly.  Even though a good amount of her added weight was on her torso, this did not mean that other parts were ignored by the after effects of her eating.  Her breasts, which were in the low B-cup range, had jumped up a size, and now rested sluggishly on her spare tire.  Her behind had over filled her black shorts, becoming a mass that jiggled with each step she took.  Her face had become similar to that of a chubby cherub, complete with two round cheeks and a double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Sakura was the weapon master Tenten.  Tenten had filled out into a much different shape than Sakura or the heavy Hinata: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten (or \"Ten Ton\" as she was known by some of the very rude shinobi of the village) had become a bottom heavy girl...a VERY bottom heavy girl.  Her black pants now had to be two sizes bigger for her jiggly rump to be confined.  Even the bigger size she was wearing now were constraining her bottom.  Her belly was small, but jiggly, and her breasts were only slightly bigger.  Her thighs were, to support her butt, thick and jiggly, and were almost centimeters apart.  Her face support to full cheeks, but there was no sign of a double chin yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two people in the cluster were the newly official couple Ino and Chouji.  Ino, who had long given up on the Konoha avenger and traitor, turned her eyes to a new, bigger prize.  Ino spent as much time as she could with Chouji: going to barbecues, noodle stands, and enjoying (REALLY enjoying) Akimichi banquets.  This new love for Chouji had not only softened her hardened attitude, but also softened her entire body.  Almost every single part of Ino ballooned up slightly, no part of her being more noticeable than the other.  Chouji had not really changed too much, only gaining a little bit of noticeable weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Naruto! How are you?\" Sakura asked as she enveloped him into a bear hug that squished their bellies together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm g-good Sakura-chan...\" Naruto said silently, feeling awkward that he was the biggest one there, second only to Chouji, pand that his fattened for was only being covered by pajamas that were getting tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm... I see you and Hinata have been taking a bit of time off, huh?\" Tenten added, grasping a bit of Naruto's belly flab and giving it a jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and looks like we're not the only ones who've kicked back.\" Naruto said, getting some of his confidence back, as he pointed out each person's own gut with his index finger, none of them phased at all by his action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were wondering if you two wanted to come with the four of us and hang out.  Go shopping, go to hot springs, maybe indulge in a little food...\" Sakura suggested, a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds pretty good!  We'll just get changed quickly and be out soon.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed the door and began trekking to the bathroom to get ready.  Hinata had already occupied his room to change, most likely get her \"new and looser\" jacket and some more decent pants then short shorts.  Naruto began brushing his teeth and combing his hair.  When he felt like he was all set, he eyed something that had been bothering him for quite a while in his bathroom: the dreaded bathroom scale.  He wondered if now would be a good time to find out just how much he gained...</span></div></div>",

He heard it creak slightly under his bulk and waited silently for the results.  He slowly looked down, and struggled to see the numbers over his enlargened gut.  His being went into shock when he read the digits.  After two months of overeating with his precious Hinata, he now weighed 270 pounds.  After recovering from the initial shock, he wondered how exactly everyone else gained.  After he stepped off of the scale, Hinata entered the bathroom.  She had now dressed into more appropriate clothes.  They were simliar to her attire when she was thin, however, they still had differences.  She had long abandoned her old jacket due to her growing gut and fattened breasts.  The heavy girl now wore a much larger jackets that still clinged to her heavy form. Also, instead of her usually ninja pants, she opted for sweatpants which were tight against her huge bum and thunder thighs.  She noticed the look on his face, and a look of concern came over herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-kun, what's wrong?\" said the girl as she approached the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just weighed myself, and found out how much I gained.\" said Naruto in a sullen voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, I suppose it's my turn to she how much I put on.\" stated Hinata with a smile adorned onto her rounded face.  The boy stepped out of the way to give her room to weigh herself.  Like Naruto, the scale groaned under her heavy fat.  A few seconds of silence passed and Hinata looked down.  She also struggled to see due to her jiggley belly in the way.  She had managed to squish it down enough to read the numbers.  They read... </span></div></div>",

There was no doubt about it now: Hinata was now fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason she began to gain weight was that she and Naruto could be fat together.  She just loved the feeling, but knowing how much she weighed just seemed to sadden her mood on the whole situation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well...' thought Hinata, 'Naruto started gaining before me, I wonder I much he weighs compared to me.' Finding out how much Naruto weighed would bring her joy in the fact that he would be bigger than her, and that she would finally know the results of her fattening him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naruto-kun...if you don't mind m-me asking, h-how much do y-you w-weigh?\" Hinata asked, a hint of curiosity in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto immediately looked down to the floor, not seeing much over his belly, and place a hand on his stomach as his cheeks got redder at the thought of how much he had gained: 135 pounds, making him 270 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I weigh...270 pounds...\" he said, not wanting to look up because of his sheer embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's eyes began to bug out of her skull.  'Unbelievable!' she thought, 'he started gaining before me, he eats as much as I do, and he weighed more than me before we started gaining!  How can I be bigger than him?!'  Hinata didn't mind being fat, but her pride was hit at the thought that she weighed more than her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one thing that she did not take into consideration: Even though Naruto ate as much as Hinata when they went out on dates, he would go out and train, to continue his dream of becoming Hokage.  While Naruto was out training, Hinata on the otherhand would either be binging more whiled she was alone at home, or go out to buy bigger clothes that she would later burst out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you Hinata?  How much do you weigh?\" Naruto questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was in a bind now.  'What if he leaves me because of how fat I've become?'  Hinata decided that it would be wrong to lie to her precious Naruto now, because he'll probably learn later.  She took a big deep breath and said \"290 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Hinata just stood in the small bathroom, their friends waiting for them at the door.  Neither said anything just stood there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Hinata.  We'll talk about this later.  Let's go hang out with Sakura and the others and get our minds off this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded and followed Naruto out of the bathroom and towards the apartment door. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He quickly told them and made his way out.  As they made their way down the busy streets, Hinata noticed the weird stares that some of the villagers gave the fatty couple.  Of course, Hinata couldn't blame them.  Both thr couple were dressed in clothes similar to their normal attire.  However, much of their weight gain had caused.  Naruto's heavy gutted jutted in front of him a great deal and showed itself from under his tight jacket.  His pants looked like thy were near it's breaking point as his heavy lower body pressed against the material for space.  Hinata did not fare any better.  Her glorious pale belly was incredbily constrained against her newly bought jacket.  Though, her increasing girth had caused the jacket to be a few sizes too small.  Her fat bum jiggled with each of her heavy steps and her black pants had to be unbuttoned to contain the combined pressure of her large gut and her swollen paunch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hina-chan.  It's alright.\" said Naruto, senseing her waryness as he place his large hand onto her soft shoulder.  Hinata gave him a soft smile, her chubby face adorned with a small blush.  A few minutes later of labored walking, the boy and girl had finally arrived at their destination.  It tool awhile to climb the steps in their present physical conditions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade growled at the papers infront of her.  She simply couldn't believe that something like this could happen so rapidly in such a short span of time.  The village was facing a bit of a problem.  Many of villagers were steadily growing in girth.  It didn't only affect the villagers but regular ninja's as well.  Currently she held both Naruto's and Hinata's medical charts in front of her and grimaced at the results.  Soon after she heard a knocking towards her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter.\" simply said the Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Hinata came into the office and took their respected seats.  Both imediately leaned back into their chairs and hands rested onto their large guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman slightly winced at their apperance for her fears had come true.  <br>\r\nShe let out a sigh as she began to read from their charts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto.

Where was once a flat chest was now a full busom underneath her red shirt, her stomach, once flat had a small but soft tummy and her hips were more bigger and filled out. Her face hasn't changed, but she had a cheerful bound to her hourglass bodied step. She was not as big as Hinata or Naruto though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura! What happened?\" Said Tsunade in surprise. Sakura wasn't this heavy when she left on her diplomatic mission to the Land of Wheat a month ago. She must have put on almost 40 pounds! And around that time Fire and Wheat signed a trade agreement, Fire's goods for Wheat's...wheat products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould that be the reason for the weight gain affecting the village?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news! The Trade agreement passed, and with extra benefits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What extra benefits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As it turns out, Land of Wheat is allowing us to post an embassy at their capital city.

Then she noticed Naruto and Hinata sitting on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Naruto! Hey Hinata! Looking good I see!\" Tsunade's eye quirked. Sakura would have been shocked at their weight gain or something along those lines, yet she seems as cheerful as a schoolgirl. What could have Wheat done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sakura-chan! Me and Hina-chan are in a relationship now. I take it Wheat as been good to ya?\" Asked Naruto, patting his hand down next to him. The pinkette walked over and plopped down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Solo mission success. And I'm glad you two are together,\" Sakura smiled. She couldn't keep her eyes off their bellies though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Sakura-san!\" Beamed Hinata, glad that someone approved of their relationship. Tsunade has been pondering as the trio seemed to get comfy on her couch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...Well in that case I have another mission for you, as you two as well,\" said the Hokage. She had all three of their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Mission?\" Muttered Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Sakura, you are to bring Naruto and Hinata with you back to Wheat. You three will be the co-supervisors in overseeing the construction of the new embassy there. This will be a B-rank diplomatic mission. I trust that you three can handle it?\" Asked the blonde leader. All three nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can count on me Hokage-sama!\" Bowed Hinata. Tsunade gave a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You leave in three days. Get packed up ready for a hike there,\" '<i>Maybe the trek there can make them loose a few</i>' thought Tsunade to herself. All three of them got up and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething nagged at the busty blonde, and she placed a finger on her intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Hokage-sama?\" Asked the secretary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's possible can you bring me some noodle lunch, preferably from the new Land of Wheat brand if possible?\" Asked Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" The intercom went silent.</span></div></div>",

The capital city  is so quaint and everyone is so nice too.  Plus the food is to die for!  The portions are kinda big, but the taste is impeccable.  Basically anything that involves wheat is their forte.  So you have your pastas, your breads and even desserts,\" explained the girl, recalling sweet memories from her previous food related indulgences.  Sakura was sent on this emissary mission all by her lonesome and the trek there was highly uneventful, without any random nin ambushes or problems like that.  After a few day of travel, enormous fields of golden wheat came into view.  Sakura was awestruck at such natural beauty.  Off in the distance, the nin could see various machinery harvesting sections of the giant field.  She was told by her master that the Land of Wheat had advanced technology, but she'd never expect it to be this advanced!  The girl reached the capital city and was greeted quite warmly by the citizens.  Despite the amazing quality of their cuisine, the people living in the village were not all large.  In fact they came in a variety of sizes, though the larger citizens were part of the majority. The village itself seemed quite normal, aside from the fact that there were a number of restaurants and food shops on the main roads.  She had never seen such a display of variety before.  Hungry due to eating nothing but shinobi-appointed meals, the girl stopped by a local cafe.  Needless to say, she became hooked to the food almost instantly.  A few days later, she met with the leader of this capital city and their deal was forged.  Konoha would now be receiving their products in exchange for the Konoha's services and the embassy would be set up as well.  Not to mention that using their own tech, they agreed to create a railroad system to connect the two areas.  The reason why Sakura stayed at the capital city was to train other nurses at the local hospitals, as part of the agreement.  This of course allowed Sakura's figure to 'blossom' into the hourglass like shape it was at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh~ Hina-chan, that sounds amazing doesn't it?\" asked the teen, turning his fat face to see his tubby girlfriend.  Hinata gave off a giggle and nodded in agreement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of food, let's get some dinner to catch up!  You guys need to tell me everything about you two,\" said Sakura as she nudged Naruto on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well me and Hina ate before we were called to Granny's office so...\" began Naruto.  However Sakura would have none of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, everyone knows food tastes much better with company.  Don't you feel hungry Hinata?\" she asked, looked towards the timid girl.  Subconsciously, the girl's chunky hands made way towards her sphere of a gut.  She was still quite hungry despite her earlier meal and it couldn't hurt eating with friends right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah I could go for anything right now really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? The poor girl is starving!  I suggest some ramen as a remedy stat.\" joked the plump pinkette, placing her arms around Hinata, secretly enjoying the girl's flabby figure pressing against her own chubby layer.  Naruto gave in and the trio changed their destination and headed towards Ichiraku's.  As it was nearing night, the ramen stand was somewhat empty, with only one other random civilian eating ramen.  They all sat down, their lower bodies enveloping most of the tiny stool.  Hinata had to readjust herself a few times as her bum made it difficult to sit properly.  Sakura was sitting next to Hinata, who in turn, sat next to her round boyfriend. Teuchi, the old man that own the stand, and his daughter Ayame were at the counter, preparing some broth and the noodles.  The old man then came up to the trio and greeted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it isn't Naruto.  Oh and you brought two girlfriends this time around. Hehe you sly dog?\"  All three laughed at his comment, and Naruto greatly appreciated his type of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Old Man, but I'm a one-girl-only type of man.  Besides Hina here is more than enough for one guy don't you think?\" claimed Naruto as he gently patted her belly.  Hinata blushed at the contact but she appreciated the gesture.  Teuchi gave out a roaring laugh of his own, clearly he had become used to the larger frames of his customers as of late.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you kids want. First bowl is on the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonkatsu ramen for me!\" shouted the kitsune-boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrimp ramen for me please.\" said Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the same as Naruto if you don't mind.\" replied the overweight Hyuga.  Teuchi confirmed each of the orders and went off to prepare the meals.  Quite quickly the meals were served and the friends ate.  Bowl after bowl, these nin's ate like there was no tomorrow.  An hour and 8 bowls later, they were finally satisfied, with their bellies taut with broth and noodles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooooo~ That really hit the spot!\" exclaimed the pink-haired girl, a hand resting on her generous belly.  Naruto and Hinata did the same, clearly happy from their meal.  Placing the right amount of money on the counter the three left the stand.  By now it was dark outside with the lamp posts illuminating the small roads.  Very few people were out and the occasional drunk was out in full stride.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we should prepare for the trip tomorrow right?\" asked the bloated med-nin.  Earlier they spoke that they would leave in the morning and that it would be best to prepare soon as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup after a hearty breakfast of course!\"  said Naruto.  While the two were chatting away on the plans for their mission, Hinata reached out for Naruto's hand, wrapping her chunky fingers against his own.   She gave him a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go home for the night.  We'll see you tomorrow Sakura.\" said Naruto as he and his plump princess turned towards the direction of Naruto's quaint apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait!\" shouted Sakura as she ran towards the couple, her generous body jiggling at the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's all spend the night together, like a sleep-over!.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Placing the scale in front of the plump Hyuga, Sakura gleefully awaited to see how large this girl had become.  Dressed in her pair of lavender panties, stretched across her widened backside and her matching bra, this girl was quite the sight.  While in the Land of Wheat, Sakura had learned to appreciate the 'larger' figures of others and her own gain was a testament to such a notion.  Carefully, the other girl placed her swollen feet onto the reading device.  As her heavy gut blocked view from her lower half, she couldn't read the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Sakura.  What does the scale say?\" she asked, both hands resting on said gut.  Sakura, went around Hinata and looked down to see that the number read out 230 lbs.  Letting out an impressed whistle, Sakura rubbed the other girl's gut, enjoying the softness under her fingertips.   How she berated herself for missing how the couple began their path towards obesity, but now she wasn't going to let them out of her sight. She vowed that she would be witness to each and every pound they would add to their frame.  Hinata, however, was thinking in a completely different wavelength.  To put on two pounds in just a single day! Maybe she was overdoing it a bit?  Her internal musings were soon interrupted by Sakura tracing her finger across her one of her wide cheeks.  Blushing an almost unheard of shade of red, she quickly jumped around, her entire body quivering as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-S-Sakura! What are you doing?\" she exclaimed in a panic.  Sakura merely grinned at her panicked response.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax you dummy. I'm just enjoying your softness.  Don't tell me you didn't like it.~\" said Sakura as she lightly bumped her reasonably sized belly into Hinata's gut.  They both saw how their fat pressed against each other, with Hinata's jello-like belly nearly engulfing Sakura's.  This action alone cause the heavier girl to become silenced.  True the feeling of their softness touching each other was pleasurable, but was it okay to do?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we got that point across, move off the scale Hina-chan so that we can see how much I've put on.\" said Sakura as she gently pushed Hinata off of the scale.  Placing her dainty feet onto the surface, she looked over her moderately sized midsection and chubby thighs to see that the numbers were 153 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"153 lbs? Wow that's impressive Sakura-chan.\" said Hinata as she observed what the scale read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see, when I first went on the mission, I was about 110 lbs.  So it looks like I gained 40!.  Nothing compared to your amazing gain though Hina-chan.\" cooed Sakura, placing her hands on her broad hips, and with playful look to her.  She couldn't place it, but she found the couple to be very irresistible these days. Perhaps the trip to the Land of Wheat had another effect on her?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, why do you want to put on weight so much?\" asked Hinata as she found their little exchange to be quite out of character for both of them.  She and Naruto gained weight out of a mutual love.  With the pink haired girl, she couldn't understand why she would choose to gain as much weight as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a secret!\"</span></div></div>",

Her boyfriend nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure there is some bread stores still open I mean-\" He heard a tapping near the window and saw his thin clone empty handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need money boss,\" said the clone. Naruto could only sigh as he grabbed his wallet and gave the clone all of his bills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get something that can fill us all up,\" Hinata also gave the clone her's and Sakura's money, the clone pocketed it and bounded away out into the village.

Sakura shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curiosity.\" And a tapping came at the door, this time the apartment one. Naruto sat and headed towards his apartment entrance and opened it, and there was his clone trying to balance out several bags of food, apparently he went towards the new restaurant filled with fried foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back boss,\" responded the clone from behind the food bags. The blonde gave a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, let me help.\" He grabbed some bags and walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Special delivery!\" He smiled as the girls beamed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before they could weigh the overfed fox-boy, Hinata's stomach growled loudly as if to cut into their conversation.  A natural blush formed on the girl's flab-filled face as she tried to settle her mammoth sized belly.  Finding this quite cute, Sakura reached into one of the bags of food and grabbed a double-decker burger, unwrapped it and presented it to the other female.  Hinata gladly accepted it and took a mighty bite out of the fattening food.  She felt her taste-buds explode due to the savory flavor of the burger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Sakura! This tastes delicious!\" exclaimed Hinata, wolfing down the rest of the grilled meat.  Naruto looked somewhat surprised as he'd never seen his girlfriend eat so ravenously before. Growing up in such a dignified household, Hinata often ate with a dignified air, even if she was stuffing herself to obesity.  Out of his own curiosity and his great hunger, Naruto also grabbed a burger, unwrapped it and took a generous bite.  Like Hinata before him, the male ninja was hooked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hinata was right.  This tastes great.\" Naruto said with a bit of disbelief.  Truth be told, Naruto had never expected take-out food to rival restaurant quality dishes in the taste department.  Reaching out for a second burger, Sakura slapped his flabby hand away from the bags of unhealthy foods. Shocked at her action, he looked at her and found that the plump pinkette had a stern look on her face.  Quickly, his mind raced to find out what he did wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot, first we need to set the table and then we can all eat.  Honestly, do you not have any manners?  Poor Hinata here is wasting away because you're goofing off.\" stated Sakura, in her trademarked angry tone, pointing her finger towards the shy girl.  Naruto returned fire with a blank stare of his own, but obliged with the girl's demands. Grabbing a few of the bags, he gestured for Sakura to handle the rest.  Bringing the food over to the dining table, Naruto began to set the table, setting down the place-mats and gathering three glasses from his cabinet.  The pink-haired girl followed, placing the bags of food on the table and filled the glasses with water from Naruto's refrigerator.  Hinata took it upon herself to distribute the food equally amongst themselves.  And so, with the preparations complete, the trio began with their feast of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Later- <br>\r\nThe large meal was over, the remnants of the ordeal was located all over the simple wooden table.  These individuals nursed their heavy midsections; they felt quite lethargic after such a meal.  Giving off a heavy yawn, Sakura rose from her seat, loosening the sash to her robe to allow for her belly to surge out a few more inches. Rising with a bit of some difficulty, Naruto went over to his Hinata and helped lift her bloated figure from the strained chair.  All three were tired by the events of this particular day and decided to call it a day.  Sakura and Naruto headed back over to the living room, ready to go to bed in their makeshift sleeping arrangements.  Sitting herself down on the mattress placed on the floor, the girl was quite happy that the soft surface sank quite a bit under the girth of her generous underside.  Setting himself onto his couch, Naruto mentally braced himself for a night with poor back support, but it was a man's duty to sacrifice such things for the sake of women.  Such was the life of chivalry he thought.  He was however quite excited for the morning, to travel to a new country was always a treat for this youth.  From his previous travels under his sage-worthy teacher, he guess that he grew this sense of adventure during that time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Sakura, what are the people in the Land of Wheat like?\" Of course it is quite difficult to label people, but he was quite interested in the people that populated that land.  Placing a finger to her chin, the girl thought of what to say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they are pretty friendly.  A lot friendlier than the people in Konoha.  Oh and they're really modest too and give compliments all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sound a bit wholesome don't they?\" said Naruto, piecing together that a country made out of farmers would be friendly in nature.  Another yawn escaped Sakura's mouth, laying on the mattress with her head on the comfy pillow.  The girl gently pet her rounded belly, happy at the quantity of softness it possessed.  Naruto stared at her, his cerulean eyes transfixed on her apparent gut; however it was not with lust that he stared at her, it was more out of curiosity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, why exactly did you gain weight again?\" he asked, recalling that the issue was never brought up between them. It was quite surprising at first, but he never asked as the thought of food was plastered in his peculiar mind. Sakura, hearing this twice this night, gave off a giggle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a secret Naruto.\"  As if on queue, Hinata stepped in the living room, looking at the two with a smile.  To be honest, this evening of their was highly enjoyable as the huge ninja loved the company of those she cared for.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Sakura-chan, do you mind sleeping on the couch and me and Naruto can share the mattress?\" asked Hinata in a worried voice of sorts.  She did not want to trouble Sakura in anyway, but considering that the two wouldn't be able to be intimate in a while, she wanted to spend the night with her boyfriend.  This was a normal thing to want after all and Sakura readily agreed after giving Hinata a quick hug claiming that she wouldn't be able to use the flabby girl as a cuddle pillow.  That was also a good chance for the pink-haired teen to grab a healthy amount of Hinata's vast back-flab, which Hinata didn't seem to notice, but Naruto caught on and found it kinda strange, but dismissed idea to the back of his mind.  Getting himself off of his couch, Naruto happily laid on his king-sized mattress and cuddled himself with his big girlfriend, placing the blanket over their large frames.  Sakura made herself comfortable on the furniture, looking over at the two and 'awing' at how cute the two were.  What she wouldn't give to be sleeping in between them, their heavy figures overlapping Sakura's smaller one with excess fat.  A blush appeared on Sakura's cute face for even thinking of such a thought.  Staring at the ceiling, the glow of the moonlight illuminating parts of the room. she was also looking forward to their travels for adventure awaited them in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

However thanks to her recent blossoming hourglass figure, there was cleavage evident in her red shirt rising up to accomadate her growing bust, thus causing some of her small belly to be noticable. Her thighs also nearly rubbed with each other, as they along with her breasts have taken up most of the gain. Unlike Naruto's chubby face, Sakura's face remained skinny as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had to rush to buy a new outfit, as she looked a bit winded. Her newest outfit was a lavender and white long sleeve jacket along with a blue tank top. But thanks to her large girth and breasts, she was produced a fair amount of cleavage(nowhere near as big as Sakura's) and her thighs were very close to rubbing. While Sakura had the biggest bust, Hinata had the biggest butt and belly, as she had more time to gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long was the trek to Wheat again Sakura-san?\" Asked Hinata as she walked alongside her tubby boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" the pinkette placed a finger on her lip in thought. \"About a week I think.

Can fill us up for a day if need be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah thanks Sakura-san!\" Chirped Hinata. Sakura gave them a thumbs up and plucked out a candy bar for herself and the trio dug in and scarfed down the candy bar as they continued to waddle away from the village.</span></div></div>",

Turning to look behind her, her grin widened as she saw Hinata already on her rear end, panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we...huff...wheeze...set up camp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Naruto both nodded, Naruto soon sitting down as well. \"Let me just catch my breath...huff...then I'll...help,\" Narutp said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, I can take care of it. Here, eat some of the extra burgers I packed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't refuse and both dug into the tasty treats, Sakura snarfing her own as she began to set up camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForty minutes later, now wheezing herself, Sakura plopped on her butt and surveyed her finished work. There was only one tent, a large one, enough for all three to fit in. A tiny fire-pit was set away from that with a large flame going. A river nearby provided enough water for the whole trip, provided they rationed reasonably well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Hinata had recovered by this point and were busy tracking some game, the pair figuring it would be a nice way to treat Sakura for treating them to the wonderful food from earlier. Luckily for the fattened pair, they had managed to find a dozing boar not far from the camp and with a swift kunai throw dinner was just waiting to be cooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's eyes widened at the size of the boar that Naruto and Hinata carried back, her green eyes gleaming as she took in the effort it took the pair just to lift the creature, the bits of flab she could see poking out from their clothes making her inward self squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's a big pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, and you get to be the first to eat some!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded at that, touched at their generosity. An hour later, she was biting into a large slice of the boar, soon finishing that first bit. She looked over to see Naruto and Hinata also digging in on much larger portions than her own. She was about to get more when Hinata got in front of her, carving the largest chunk yet from the pig, a part of it's impossibly wide rear. Moving the sizzling piece of meat onto Sakura's plate, which it easily exceeded, Hinata beamed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you're hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura could only nod, licking her lips as she dug in with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                                     ///<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Hinata blinked food-dazed eyes at the volume of Sakura's belch, taking in her engorged middle and how it was on full display now, her shirt riding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata reached out a hand and felt how taut that bulging middle was, blushing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...big,\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded, moaning as Hinata pressed down and elicited another belch from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManaging to crawl into the tent twenty minutes later, Sakura smiled as she felt the fleshy forms of her two friends on either side of her a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pink haired girl slowing awoke inside the tent. She felt two masses pressing into her corpulent body. One was engulfing her face, while the other was mashed into her backside. Her eyes gaining focus, she nearly squealed when she saw Hinata's creamy belly being forced into her rounded face. While she did not care as much, Naruto's gut was pressing against her bubble butt. Maneuvering her arms, she quietly wrapped them around Hinata's midsection and tried to grab on to as much flesh as possible. There was simply so much of it! It was impossible to hold all of that delicious fat. Next she nuzzled her face into the gelatinous surface, enjoying the softness it presented to her. Sakura remained like this for quite some time, luckily the two heavy weights had become heavy sleepers as a result of their weight gain.  Her eyes feeling heavy once more, Sakura began to drift off, content with using Hinata's fat as a pillow. Two hours later she awoke, her position still remaining the same. Feeling a bit daring, she gave Hinata's belly a soft kiss. Deciding to release her hold, Sakura sat up, causing her own belly to fold into a few rolls. The girl then noticed that Naruto was not in the tent. Stepping out, the sun was shining down on the campsite, though the weather was fairly mild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto?\" she called scanning the camp for signs of her teammate. He was nowhere to be found. She then choose to look around the camp site, reinforcing the traps she had set up and making sure that no one had managed to enter without any of them knowing. Walking back to the center of the campsite, headed to a nearby stream to freshen up. Meanwhile, Hinata awoke and readily noticed that both of her friends were missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did I really sleep that late?' thought Hinata. Slowly she lifted her heavy body from the floor and gave a mighty stretch, her arm fat touching her face in the motion. Stepping outside the tent, no one was present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder where they went?' Further thoughts were cast away; her stomach let out a guttural roar. Sitting down, the pain of hunger was quite extreme for the bloated beauty. Using her wobbling tree trunk legs, the girl made it back to the tent and reached into her backpack. With her pudgy fingers, the girl found some candy bars. These were no ordinary candy bars however; they were bursting with calories and were usually reserved for those in dire need of it such as starving individuals or those trying to build their weight up from dangerous levels. For someone like Hinata, they were perfect towards adding to her soft flesh and reliving her cravings. Hinata devoured them in seconds; at this point it was more important to stuff herself rather than eating for necessity. It was clear that this girl was addicted to food. She didn't mind one bit. Near the  stream, Sakura was sitting by the water's edge, her feet plunged into the cold water and she had removed her shirt was well, revealing her red frilly bra. Sakura was admiring her new-found poundage. She loved how her gut spilled onto her lap, she loved her protruding love handles and she especially enjoyed her swollen breasts. Compared to her former flat self, she was enamored by such a change.  Her self-indulgence was interrupted by a shocked gasp. Immediately turning her head, she saw Naruto carrying fish inside of a net. Apparently he had ventured to fish at a nearby lake earlier for breakfast for all of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH, I promise I didn't see anything\" said Naruto in a panicked fashion. He readily covered his eyes with his free hand, not daring to glance at the half naked beauty that was his violent teammate. He only hoped that she didn't beat him up that badly. Surprisingly she was quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura?\" he said with his eye still closed. Hearing her walking towards him, he braced for the worst. What came next was severely unexpected for the male ninja. \"Sakura?\" he said once more. He then felt a hand grabbing his and removing it from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, please look.\" Reluctantly, his eyes slowly opened and he was greeted to an divine image of his childhood friend. Nothing was left to the imagination; it was simply her beauty in bare form. A blush was plastered on her face; it was clear that she was nervous as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura...\" he trailed on. The fish were dropped onto the ground, luckily the net prevented them from escaping. A finger placed on his lips and silenced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Hinata, I want both of you.\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nThe two returned to the campsite, fish in tow. Hinata was sitting in the center of the site and she had already built a fire, anticipating that Naruto went hunting once more. They all greeted each other, Naruto with a kiss and Sakura gave the girl a tight hug. Naruto went on to prepare the fish for cooking while Sakura sat next to Hinata and began small talk. After their hearty meal, the trio packed up their site, made sure to remove all traces that they were there and began to trek towards their destination. Sakura had noted that there was a small village near them were they would be able to stock up on their supplies. Their destination in mind, they were on their way!</span></div></div>",

Cooing with joy at the combined taste, she patted her gut and imagined just where the calories would end up and which of her new lovers would be the first to caress wherever the new weight appeared. Turning back, she beamed at the pair waddling behind her, Hinata's face red both from exertion and from the fact that she had been watching Sakura's jiggling rump quiver as she waddled ahead of her. Naruto was wheezing and the combined sound of Naruto's wheezes and Hinata's pants made Sakura moan a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost as good as the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn't quite devote all her thoughts and energy on her bloated body and bloated lovers, especially since the village was in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting one fat foot in front of the other, and letting loose some deep wheezes of her own, Sakura continued on, imagining the food she'd be able to eat once they arrived at their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                                                                 ///<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village didn't have much in the way of exotic fare, specializing in more traditional food but Sakura didn't care as she emptied her fourth bowl of the evening, sparing a glance towards her two companions and noting, with no small amount of glee, that Hinata had out-eaten Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive empty bowls lay on the wooden table just in front of the Hyuuga heiress and she belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Hinata started to apologize when Sakura just winked and belched even louder, patting her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that hit the spot!

Naruto walked on the Hyuga\u2019s right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou tell me,\u201d said Naruto in turn. He tried to pull his orange and black jacket down but to no avail, as some bulging belly and his bellybutton can be seen. His orange pants has also risen by a small margin around his fattening thighs and rump. The last time he weighed himself was before Sakura arrived from the land of wheat half a week ago and he was 247 pounds. With the extra food and snacking he has been doing, he looks to have put on over fifteen pounds, as his moobs seem to be close to breaking past an A-cup size as they pushed into his white shirt underneath his jacket. His soft face remained the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata last weighed herself at the night of the sleepover and it read 230. However, due to her and Sakura\u2019s monopoly of the ration candy bars, she herself must have put on nearly twenty herself. Her tank top looked tighter than before, rising up on her stomach and creating a generous valley of cleavage with her slightly bigger bust. Her thighs looked even closer and appeared to be the only one of the group to be near the point of waddling. She is close to getting an even more softer complexion on her face and her butt seemed to be even larger and softer, hidden by her lavender slacks which were containing the cellulite riddled blubber butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was still smaller than the two but she looked heavier. She and Hinata have been in on their ration candy bars and Sakura seems to be taking the gain overall in stride. She had to unzip her red shirt a little to give her bust some room, but now it looked fleshy and perky as her breasts seemed to be on par with Tsunade\u2019s now. Her stomach, over her beige skirt now thanks to the recent ramen meal, was hard and taught as she was the one who ate the most of the three. Her black spats seemed to have trouble containing her slightly doughy rear and upper thighs, but Sakura knew they would hold. Like her female companion, she looked to have gained nearly twenty pounds herself and her face seemed to soften just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Sakura resting her hands behind her back as she stretched. \u201cWe may need to stock up on supplies soon in order to finish the last leg of the journey to Wheat. So, let\u2019s stay in this village for the night and get stocked up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the border is only about\u2026\u201d Hinata went into her backpack and reached for a map scroll. After opening it her eyes went up a little. \u201cAnother twenty miles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me we\u2019ve done ten miles over nearly thirty-six hours,\u201d groused Naruto. Sakura patted him on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s alright. Besides, we\u2019ll reach Wheat by week\u2019s end. Besides I think the railroad should be around here,\u201d she pointed at the scroll, which was a good fifteen miles from the small village they were staying at. \u201cSo what\u2019s wrong with an extra five miles? We could ride our way into the Land of Wheat\u2019s border on one of their small trains in style.\u201d She gave a confident grin which seemed to put the couple at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, let\u2019s order a hotel then. After that meal,\u201d Naruto yawned. \u201cI\u2019m feeling sleepy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen it\u2019s settled.\u201d Sakura walked past Hinata and near Naruto. \u201cYou\u2019ll do as we talked earlier?\u201d The blubbery blonde looked at the tubby kunoichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll do the shopping and leave you to Hinata-chan,\u201d He replied. \u201cShe may not like it though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me,\u201d grinned Sakura. \u201cI got this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAno\u2026Sakura-san, Narut-kun, what are you talking about?\u201d Asked Hinata curiously. The two mentioned turned their heads towards the bluentte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just Sakura-chan, giving me suggestions on where to shop. She\u2019s been in this town before.\u201d Sakura nodded, backing up the blonde\u2019s claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then,\u201d said the Hyuga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them found a Hotel and Naruto stood by the door as Sakura and Hinata finished getting a room for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, what room are you guys in?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoom 58, you getting the supplies now Naruto-kun?\u201d Asked Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm-Hmm,\u201d He gave his girlfriend a peck on the cheek and walked out, both of the girl\u2019s eyes eyeing his large blubbery bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty then!\u201d Grinned Sakura as she began to push Hinata. \u201cLet\u2019s relax in the room and talk girl stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat-What? What girl stuff?\u201d Asked Hinata with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know\u2026girl stuff,\u201d smiled the pinkette slyly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back at the hotel room, Sakura sat down on the foot of one of the two beds. She had since changed into her sleepwear which consisted of a pair of boy shorts that hugged her lower body very generously and a tight t-shirt that failed to cover her pale gut. Her stomach as still slightly distended and the girl rubbed it gingerly to alleviate some of the pressure she felt. Aside from that, the plump girl was waiting for Hinata to change into her sleepwear in order to have a little chat with her. The simple idea of being with both of her friend in an intimate manner caused her to go a bit light-headed in excitement but she was still a tad bit worried that the black haired heiress might reject her proposal. If anything, she can still watch the pair grow fatter and fatter, that in itself was quite acceptable. Hearing a creak from the corner of the room, Sakura rapidly turned her fat neck towards the sound and saw a rather pleasant sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Hina, don't you look really cute.\" said Sakura with a small laugh as she fought back the urge to grope the overweight girl. Hinata's sleepwear consisted of long pants that were white in color and were stretched across the inches of the girl's lower body flab. The girl also sported a button down lavender shirt, the color complimenting her eyes incredibly well. The buttons of the material were strained greatly due to Hinata's immense gut and her rounded breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, well thank you Sakura.\" said Hinata as she gently walked over to the other bed and sat her hefty body down. She knew that Sakura wanted to talk to her still, otherwise she would have went to bed, exhausted after such a heavy meal. Sakura got up and sat right across from Hinata, eying the soft flesh on the other girl. What she wouldn't give to have access to such flab anytime she wanted. \"S-So, what do you want to talk about Sakura?\" The pair then began to speak of small talk, which was according to Sakura's plan. Around half and hour passed and the black-haired girl was much more relaxed. the bottom two buttons of her shirt had seemingly become unfastened which allowed for her belly to spill out onto her lap. Sakura noticed right away, and she felt that it was time to move things along a tad bit faster. Moving closer to Hinata, the other girl moved her face quite close to hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, Hinata, how do you keep your face so wonderfully round?\" Her face glowing red, Hinata attempted to back away slightly, but Sakura matched the motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uhm, my f-face? I s-suppose its all the food me and Naruto have been eating, we've put on some weight recently...\" Going in for the kill, Sakura threw herself forward, wrapped her arms around Hinata's doughy flesh and buried her fat face into it, nearly loosing herself to the immense pleasure of the softness. The black haired girl could only watch with a bewildered expression on her demure face, but the sensation wasn't all that uncomfortable. To have someone playing with her fat was actually excitable. Moving her hands down towards the girl's head, Hinata gently stroked Sakura as she continued to gently nuzzle her face in Hinata's midsection. <br>\r\n---<br>\r\nAround two hours later Naruto had returned with his hands full of bags containing supplies for the remainder of their trek and a backpack full with things that Sakura had specifically requested. Seeing that it was dark in the room, he saw Sakura and Hinata sleeping in one of the beds, both of them under the covers. Smiling at the cute scene, Naruto placed the bags plus the backpack in a corner of the room as he removed his orange jacket and threw himself onto the bed, the frame straining slightly due to his bulk. Seeing Hinata resting peacefully, he could assume that her night with Sakura went well. </span></div></div>",

Reaching the gargantuan gates of the city, Sakura presented the guards with the proper paperwork, and were told that they would meet with an official later on and to head down to the main inn to wait. Nodding, Sakura lead the pair through main street, the latter marveling at how large the buildings were, paying no attention to the rather large citizens who were munching on a variety of foods. Scents of delicious food assaulted Naruto's and Hinata's noses, the pair getting extremely hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sakura, why don't we stop by to get something to eat before we head back?\" asked Naruto nearly drooling and rubbing his immense gut.

There were not very many d-rank missions in the village, if any at all, so all of the genin were hanging around the village with nothing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno, Sakura, Tenten and Hinata decided to have a girls' night out, and while they were leaving the hot springs, an idea came up while they were talking about boys. They mentioned Choji, then Tenten said, \"Lee would freak out so much if he found out that he had a little meat on his bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ino got an idea. She started with, \"Hey, we're bored, right, and we still have quite a bit of money from when we had missions, right,\" the others looked at her expectantly every time she paused. Then she said it, \"What if we each pick a boy, and then we try to see who can fatten theirs the most! It would be hilarious when they noticed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others began giggling, except for Hinata, who blushed at the thought of a bigger Naruto. Soon enough, they were picking their guys. Hinata, too shy to pick Naruto, decided upon Kiba. Ino chose Shikamaru, as choosing Choji would pretty much be cheating, and Tenten ultimately chose Lee, as he was too nice of a guy to resist Tenten too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Sakura, to everyone's surprise, chose Naruto. She explained, \"Sasuke would never spend time with me!\" \"Besides,\" She thought, \"Naruto likes me, so I can get him to do anything I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough after talking about how funny it would be to see their reactions, the girls had each gone to their respective homes for the night. Sakura was thinking of a plan as she walked to her house. \"Hmm,\" she thought, \"I could just use my charm and just get Naruto to eat more, or I could look through Tsunade's medical jutsu. Maybe there's something that could help me. I might even be able to catch Naruto with a trap. I could just force him to eat as much as I want him to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Sakura decided to...</span></div></div>",

Sakura, who had been out on her way to visit the hokage, was immediately pushed out of the way by the blur and into the local river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNarrruuuttttoooo!\u201d she shrieked as she made her way out of the river.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah! Outta the way!\u201d the golden haired ninja yelled this time as he was trampling through the Yamanaka family garden of rare and delicate flowers. Ino Yamanka who had coincidentally been out in the garden at the same time barely caught sight of Naruto as he chased after an equally fast cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto! Watch where you\u2019re going!\u201d cried the platinum blond but it was too late. She watched as his foot came down right on one of the few of her family\u2019s rare and exotic plants. \u201cNo! You\u2019re going to pay for that Naruto!\u201d she yelled at the ninja who was too focused on capturing the cat to notice anyone or anything that got in his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater at the Hyuga mansion Tenten and Hinata had just finished a thorough training session. \u201cNice job Tenten!\u201d complimented Hinata to her squad-mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too Hinata!\u201d said Tenten equally out of breath from the rigorous exercise. Suddenly a cat shaped figure tore across the Hyuga courtyard and quickly disappeared towards the Hyuga mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing through!\u201d yelled a mob of shadow clone Naruto\u2019s headed towards the two. Most of them whizzed between the two, but unfortunately some of the clones bounded into the two training ninjas rather than go around them. One ninja clone knocked down, Tenten and shredded several of her near infinite amounts of scrolls under foot, another  few stomping into a mud puddle near the byakugan using ninja, splattering a stain of mud across her  delicate outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c M.m..my robes\u201d said Hinata  almost sobbing as she realized what the flash mob of Naruto\u2019s had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy scrolls!\u201d cried an angry Tenten getting up from the dirt and dusting herself off.  One thing was clear to both of them Naruto was becoming a bigger troublemaker than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day the group of girls gathered outside of the hokage\u2019s room to gripe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno\u2019s voice began ringing shrilly. \u201cSakura can\u2019t you keep your knucklehead squad mate under control?!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow exactly am I supposed to keep him under control? He\u2019s a jinchurichi i I can\u2019t contain that kind of power! Sakura asked the group of girls who were advancing towards her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTch, well can\u2019t you just put a muzzle on him or something?\u201d said Ino getting progressively angrier and crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Maybe I could time him down with a couple of ball and chain weights to slow him down! Tenten joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a seconded Tenten, a weight\u2026Weight!   That\u2019s it!\u201d  Sakura exclaimed the look of a brilliant idea shining in her eyes. The group gathered closer eager to hear what Sakura had in mind to put an end to the rambunctious ninja\u2019s rampage.  \u201cLook Chouji\u2019s a pretty easy going guy right?\u201d Sakura asked. The group nodded remembering Choji and Shikamaru two of the most relaxed, no, downright laziest, ninjas the girls knew.  \u201cWell I\u2019m just saying, what if Naruto had to lug around a little more?\u201d she asked the rest her voice rising.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see what you\u2019re saying Sakura. If we fatten Naruto up, it would certainly slow him down\u201d Tenten said. \u201cBut how would we make Naruto chubby? People don\u2019 just turn Choji sized overnight, he eats enough for three people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour right, but what if we all stuffed him at the same time.\u201d Sakura began grinning as she revealed more of her genius plan. \u201cLet\u2019s think about it.  Say you and I asked Naruto out on a date at the same time what would he do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno jumped in answering for Tenten, \u201cThat pervert would probably just shadow clone himself and go out with the both of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo while he\u2019s separated, we\u2019re umm each supposed to feed him. Is that the plan?\u201d said Hinata speaking up quietly, rubbing her fingers together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Sakura said, and then called the group together to scheme further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere were the steps to their final plan.<br>\r\n1.\tSakura will give Naruto a shadow clone haze jutsu beforehand, so each shadow clone would not remember what really happened. <br>\r\n2.\tEach girl would ask Naruto out for some reason and force him to come. He\u2019ll split into shadow clones and head to each separate \u201cdate\u201d.<br>\r\n3.\tDo whatever it takes, to feed him till he pops.<br>\r\n4.\tEven if he asks about his weight,  play dumb and just ignore  it.<br>\r\n5.\tSuccess! A tubbier, slower, and all around easier going Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Naruto was sleeping in. He had worked hard yesterday chasing that stupid cat all across town! Stupid D-rank missions like that were all he had these days! Suddenly a knock came from the door and still in his pajamas, Naruto answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShadow clone haze jutsu\u201d whispered Sakura as she gripped the doorknob, transferring her chakra and jutsu into the hand holding the other side of the handle. Not detecting the jutsu now upon him Naruto opened the door wide, and his sleepy face immediately lit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hey Sakura!\u201d he said ecstatically \u201cWhy you here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was going to take you of for some ramen\u2026but I see you\u2019re not dressed.\u201d She said bringing her eyes down to his pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH whoops!\u201d he flushed immediately. \u201cJ-j-just let me get dressed and we can go!\u201d he said lightheartedly as he quickly made to take off his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, never mind\u201d said Sakura \u201cJust meet me at Ichiraku Ramen! Ok?\u201d and with that she left signaling for Hinata to go knock next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk sure thing!\u201d  He yelled down the hall slipping his pants on. \u201cSee you then Sakura!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then there was another knock on the door. \u201cWho could it be now?\u201d Naruto thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hinata?!\u201d Naruo said astonished at her arrival as soon as he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ivory skinned Hinata now stood at his door blushing embarrassed, in a soft voice she asked \u201cUmm\u2026Naruto, I was just wondering, if um, you wanted, to\u2026go on a picnic with me...\u201d  the last part she said all at once in a hurried breath embarrassed to even say the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood dumbfounded for a seconded as he realized what he just herd, then instantly he flashed his trademark grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I will!\u201d he said giving her a big smile and a thumbs up. There was no way he could turn sweet Hinata down. Seeing the smile on her face and how happy she looked as she left his doorway assured him that he\u2019d made the right choice. Even if he would have to hold a separate shadow clone for a little while it wouldn\u2019t be that hard to be with both Sakura and Hinata at once, and for one of Hinata\u2019s meals it would be worth it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was just about to form a shadow clone when for the third time; there was a knock on his door again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTenten and Ino!?\u201d Naruto shouted. Things were definitely getting weird, but now the two were standing right before him, but unlike the previous two visitors who were happy to see him, a look on anger was on both of their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey mister!\u201d said Ino pointing a finger accusingly. \u201cWhere do you get off? Do you know what you did yesterday? You stomped on one of my family\u2019s rarest flowers!\u201d she said jabbing the finger towards him to punctuate the end of every sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Tenten joined in pointing an accusing finger at the very confused Naruto too. \u201cYou realize you ruined some of my scrolls you knucklehead! We\u2019ve both decided your punishment!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, what is it?\u201d Naruto felt guilty, both the girls before him didn\u2019t have proof, but Naruto knew he was responsible. He hadn\u2019t meant to wreck their things; it was just sometimes he got out of control. What choice did he have, they had basically forced him into it, but it\u2019s not like he could lie about what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTenten here and I have been arguing over who\u2019s the better cook. You\u2019re going to be our taste tester for the next few weeks, and then after that we might forgive you...\u201d Ino said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh that\u2019s it?\u201d Naruto asked, unbelieving that such a menial task was his punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the least you could do for messing up my family\u2019s garden!\u201d said Ino not needing to fake her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah and messing up my scrolls too! Just know your punishment starts today! Be at my place within the hour!\u201d Tenten said forcefully towards him, and with that the pair left, leaving one dumbfounded ninja behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell the best thing to do for the day was play it his way, and make this a challenge/training session of sorts. He obviously could send a shadow clone to Tenten\u2019s as well as one to either Sakura or Hinata. If he could hold two solid and strong shadow clones for the rest of the day, he would definitely get some good training in! Plus if it meant he could spend the whole day with Sakura and Hinata he would be all for it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo sending two other  well-made  shadow clone Ninja\u2019s towards two separate locations and going off in a third direction himself, Naruto  had seemingly played right into the girls trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should the story follow <u>first</u>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One of Naruto\u2019s extra strong clones made their way to the ramen stand.  It had been a while since he\u2018d hung out with Sakura and he was more than a little excited.  He\u2019d chosen to use a shadow clone with her because Hinata somehow knew when he used clones and he didn\u2019t want to insult the girl.  <br>\r\n \tGetting to the Ramen stand Naruto saw Sakura\u2019s brilliant pink hair immediately.  The girl turned at he sound of footfalls and smiled broadly at him as he sat down.  Naruto blushed.  It wasn\u2019t often Sakura of all people smiled at her.  She must have been in an awfully good mood.  It would be best to stay of his best behavior and try not to anger her in any way today.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sakura-chan!\u201d Naruto greeted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez Naruto, what took you so long?\u201d Sakura asked in exasperation, but it held a teasing note to it so Naruto just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came across a black cat and had to deviant my path to get here or Konoha would have been completely destroyed.\u201d Naruto told her seriously, giving one of Kakashi\u2019s many excuses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed good naturedly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I get a pork ramen old man?\u201d Naruto called to the man behind the counter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing Naruto!\u201d The chef called back over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned back to Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 what\u2019s the special occation?\u201d Naruto asked Sakura.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nSakura shrugged in response as she finished chewing the noodles in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually I\u2019ve been thinking we should get together more often to catch up and stuff.  Lady Tsunade says in a short few months I\u2019ll be placed on emergency call to the outer regions of Konoha in order to give one of the medics there pregnancy leave.\u201d Sakura lied fluently.  It would give her an excuse to fatten him up more and she could always just say that Tsunade decided she was needed her more on a last minute decision.  The female Hokage was apt to doing such things and Naruto wouldn\u2019t question it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 That sucks.\u201d Naruto said sincerely as he was handed his bowl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay Naruto\u2026\u201d Sakura trailed off.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHm?\u201d Naruto questioned through his ramen filled mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just curious, how much of this ramen can you eat in one sitting?  I\u2019ve heard Kakashi say it was ridiculous amount but I\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d Sakura said carefully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can eat 18 bowls in sitting when I\u2019m really hungry.\u201d Naruto stated proudly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm\u2026 oh.\u201d Sakura said boredly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned and looked at her.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with that tone?\u201d Naruto asked.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 it\u2019s nothing.  It\u2019s just\u2026 not very impressive.  I heard Chouji can eat 30 bowls in one sitting and for some reason I thought you could beat him\u2026\u201d  Sakura said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at her, affronted.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cChouji\u2019s three times bigger than me!\u201d Naruto said, throwing his arms out in front of him to indicate the mentioned shinobi\u2019s girth.  \u201cThere\u2019s not way I could eat more than that fat-so.\u201d Naruto claimed loudly before quickly looking around to make sure the super sensitive male wasn\u2019t around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmphf\u2026 Is THE Naruto Uzumaki actually trying to make up excuses for why he can\u2019t do something?  I suppose since Sasuke is a genius he is more likely to become Hokage too then?\u201d Sakura asked innocently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s face grew red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSasuke is never going to be Hokage because I am!\u201d Naruto shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you just said that you couldn\u2019t beat someone because they\u2019re naturally better than you?  Doesn\u2019t that mean that Sasuke can beat you too?\u201d Sakura asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeing naturally good at something doesn\u2019t mean you automatically win! If your determined and work hard you can beat anyone!\u201d  Naruto said passionately.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen prove it!  Beat Chouji at his ramen record!\u201d Sakura challenged.  </span></div></div>",

If it was anything as good at this then Naruto would be chubby in no time.  No longer bothering them with inconsiderate and immature mission disasters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother bowl old man.\u201d Naruto said as he pushed his first to the side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef laughed good naturedly as he placed the next bowl in front of the teen.  Naruto dove right in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until the 15th bowl that Naruto began to slow done the tiniest bit.  Sakura watched carefully out of the corner of her eye Naruto\u2019s slightly distended stomach.  All the girls, with the exception of Tenten, were medics.  They would be able to tell where the limit to this egging on was.  Sakura could tell that Naruto could still eat a lot more within the safety range, at least for a Jinchuuriki anyway.  Luckily the bunshin Naruto created could handle such added pressure upon the body.  If something such as overeating in each body overwhelmed Naruto then the blonde would simply pass out and whatever it was that overwhelmed would accumulate at a safe rate.  Their plan was perfect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlowing down after only 15 bowls?  Seems to me natural beats determined any day of week.\u201d Sakura said triumphantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto finished his fifteenth bowl and took a deep breath, putting his hand on his stomach before looking up with a determined eye.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep \u2019em coming old man! I\u2019m beating Chouji today!\u201d Naruto yelled out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto dug in again, though slightly more slowly, the fattening ramen disappearing before Sakura\u2019s eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the eighteenth bowl Naruto paused for a minute, setting the bowl down, and then fiddled with something around his waist.  Naruto pulled off his hidden belt and laid it down on the side.  Sakura smiled as she noticed how the blonde\u2019s stomach fell forward a bit.  Not much but a bit.  Progress.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto returned to eating the ramen, bypassing his own record, and continuing on.  Nineteen. Twenty. Twenty-one.  Naruto was slowing down again.  Each bowl taking nearly ten minutes to eat.  Sakura sighed.  It was a good start anyways.  She could see his pants straining and the bump against his stomach seemed to be very tight.  He could only safely eat one more bowl, she guessed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef placed the twenty-second bowl in front of Naruto with a weary eye.  Naruto picked his chop sticks back up and dug in.  Fifteen minutes later Naruto brought the bowl up to his lips and drank the last drops.  <br>\r\n\u201cDamn\u2026 I can\u2019t go any further.\u201d Naruto muttered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura patted Naruto on the back, inadvertently causing the young shinobi to burp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will beat him, I will.\u201d Naruto muttered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen come back tomorrow and try again when your hungry.\u201d Sakura stated smiling.  \u201cAfter all you got really close.  I bet if you tried again tomorrow you\u2019d get it!\u201d Sakura said encouragingly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded slowly, too stuffed to do much else.  Sakura\u2019s mind looked at the blonde calculatingly.  If she could get him to stay with him the whole day he would probably digest the food enough for her to be able to eat even more.  What would take AT LEAST a couple hours of no annoying Naruto time for the food to digest?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to go to the movies Naruto?\u201d Sakura asked casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto perked up and looked at her as if she\u2019d grown a second head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026? With me?  The movies?\u201d  Naruto asked surprised and delighted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that surprising.  We\u2019re teammates. Teammates do stuff together all the time.\u201d  Sakura said offhandedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but not our team.\u201d  Naruto said pointedly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura started at that a bit guiltily, but shrugged it off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let\u2019s go!\u201d  Sakura said, gripping Naruto\u2019s arm and pulling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde lumbered to his feet, swaying a bit and groaning at the obvious discomfort of undigested ramen gave him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto forgot his belt.  </span></div></div>",

Sakura was ecstatic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand carefully moved over Naruto\u2019s bulging stomach and began to glow green.  Using her medical ninjutsu the girl began to hurry along Naruto\u2019s digestive track as fast as safely possible while at the same time slightly enlarging Naruto\u2019s poor taxed stomach and healing the slight strain placed on it.  Naruto would have to badly use the restroom after this, but then he\u2019d be able to eat a lot again.  Oh she was lucky.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell\u2026 kinda lucky.  Falling asleep was only natural in a dark place after gorging on food.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto woke up he gently excused himself and headed for the restroom.  Sakura smiled.  After a slightly long weight and an embarrassed Naruto the two headed out around town.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a good movie wasn\u2019t it Naruto?\u201d Sakura asked coyly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed nervously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYe..yeah it was!\u201d  Naruto said, attempting to cover up the fact he had only seen the commercials.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was your favorite part?\u201d  Sakura asked innocently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t know it was all really good.\u201d Naruto tried.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smirked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?  I heard you mumble something about crap in your sleep.\u201d  Sakura teased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Sakura-chan.  I don\u2019t know why I fell asleep.  I didn\u2019t mean too.\u201d  Naruto apologized hurriedly, red with embarrassment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright.  I have an idea of how you can make up for falling asleep when we were spending time together.\u201d Sakura said sweetly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can treat me to Ice cream, especially since I paid for ramen this afternoon.\u201d Sakura said lightly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s stomach growled and for the first time the blonde noticed it was getting dark.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat movie must have been really long.\u201d Naruto muttered.  \u201cSo\u2026 Ice cream it is then.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smiled as she lead the way to her favorite ice cream place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they sat down Sakura briefly looked at the menu, an idea forming in her mind.  She caught Naruto\u2019s attention by putting the menu down directly in the middle of the table and pouting her lips slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNa-ru-to\u2026  there\u2019s something here I\u2019ve always wanted to try, but I can\u2019t finish by myself\u2026 will you help me eat it?\u201d Sakura asked with her best puppy dog eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto never stood a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 sure Sakura-chan!\u201d Naruto cried out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter arrived at their table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we please have the double fudge rocky mountain special?\u201d Sakura asked sweetly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter blinked.  Then blinked again.  He looked between the pair with an unsure measure before shrugging and writing it down.  Naruto raised a brawl but didn\u2019t otherwise comment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jaw dropped when IT was brought out.  A large bowl, roughly the size of a mixing bowl, was set before them.  Fudge ice cream filled the entire thing in scoops with chocolate and caramel heavily drizzled on top.  Nuts of all kinds covered it from head  to the bowls bottom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is\u2026 a bit much isn\u2019t it?\u201d Naruto asked nervously, eyeing the offending bowl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura laughed gleefully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to try it and it\u2019s been my dream to eat it with someone who could help me finish it so that I could have my picture up at the front of the store.\u201d Sakura admitted/lied through her teeth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d Naruto began, but stopped as Sakura showed him big puppy dog eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I can try.\u201d   Naruto said uncertainly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll right, let\u2019s dig in then.\u201d  Sakura said cheerfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably Sakura stopped at only a bowl, but ate so slowly that it seemed she stopped a lot further along.  A large chunk was missing from Naruto\u2019s side of the ice cream.  The boy\u2019s paints struggled to restrain the tight belly that sat against it.  Sakura smiled at the evident bulge coming from the front of Naruto\u2019s shit now.  She licked her spoon and gave a loud, dramatic moan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!  I ate so much!  I\u2019m done.  I\u2019m so thankful that your hear to help me Naruto.\u201d Sakura said sweetly as she put the spoon done.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked up with apprehension before looking down at nearly half the remaining bowl.  Naruto sighed, seeming to give up on something, before reaching down to his pants and unbuttoning them with a grunt.  The bulge moved forward a little and Naruto sighed happily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning a little but with determination Naruto once more dug into the ice cream.  Bite after bite Sakura carefully watched for Naruto\u2019s limit.  She did not want to hurt her friend even if she wanted to slow him down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scooped up a rather large bite and shoved it into his mouth, swallowing.  The blonde shifted uncomfortable and Sakura noticed the bulge her friends stomach had become tighten.  That was it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto moved to force himself to take another bite but Sakura gently stopped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think your done for the night Naruto.  It\u2019s alright.  We can come back and try again another time\u2026 okay?\u201d Sakura said gently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned.  Determination still ringing true in his eyes before nodding slowly in understanding.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura stood up and\u2026 Naruto attempted to get up but with a grunt fell back onto his seat.  Running chakra through her arms Sakura used her strength to help the overstuffed boy up.  They walked all the way to Naruto\u2019s apartment like that, with him and his stone hard, distended stomach moving from side to side.  Sakura took the keys from his pocket and unlocked the door.  She gently helped him into the bedroom and left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door closed the shadow clone lying in the bed poofed away.     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ino was excited.  She knew several jutsu's of the Akimichi due to Chouji being on her team.  She NEVER thougth that she'd ever need to know any of them.  Why would she want to know a fattenting jutsu?  Well she'd just have to apologize to Chouji.  Ino lead Naruto into her kitchen and smiled broudly at Naruto.  Quietly she made handseals beneath the surface of the counter and whispered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind transfer jutsu!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto jerked and moved forward, catching Ino's body before it hit the ground.  Ino/Naruto grinned.  Perfect.  She set her body down gently on the couch and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled off Naruto's shirt and pants and bit his/her thumb, drawing blood, before beginning to draw seals all over his/her body.  It was an old Akimichi trick for safe, quick gain.  Naruto's body would temporarily extend further out using chakra to hold five times the amount of food than he would normally be able to handle.  She would have told the other girls but... truthfully it would just take too much time to teach them.  Plus it would be fun to see the shock on their faces at how large Naruto would wake up to be tommorrow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would simply take control of Naruto's body when the boy started to slow down.  After all Naruto would still feel his regular limit and would probably freak out if he saw his stomach extending passed that.  Ino giggled.  This was going to be so much fun!  She would be able to pig out as much as she wanted and she wouldn't gain an ounce.  Once she loaded the seals with chakra she put his shirt back on and released the jutsu.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto held his head in confusion and dizzyness Ino moved hurriedly back into her place.  She smiled at Naruto who gave her an unsure one in return.  Ino cut a generous cut of cake and set it in front of Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Here's the first type of food to try!\" Ino exclaimed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scrunched up his nose and shrugged.  Taking the fork from Ino Naruto took his first bite and chewed it thoughtfully before taking another.  At the end of the piece Naruto wrote a number on the page, hiding it from Ino, and nodded.  Ino brought out her specialty.  After all, just because they were doing this to slow Naruto down didn't mean that she couldn't beat Tenten in this little cooking competition.  A nice sized lemon pie was set down on the counter.  Ino cut a piece out and gave it to the blonde.  Once more Naruto ate it and wrote down his number.  As he did for her donuts, her apple pie, her peanut butter cookies, fudge, brownies, short bread, and her double stacked strawberry cheescake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned.  His stomach was bulging out and paints tight.  He\u2019d already lost his belt and put it to the side.  Naruto messed with his pants and with a heavy sigh unbuttoned them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInoooooo\u2026 I can\u2019t eat any more.\u201d Naruto said as she brought out her pumpkin pie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026 not even a teeny tiny piece?\u201d Ino asked pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shook his head.  Ino sighed.  She\u2019d thought Naruto would make it a little further, but that was fine.  She turned and pretended to start putting everything away.  Naruto leaned back and closed his eyes.  Ino spun and rapidly went through seals, extending her hands she called out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind transfer jutsu!\u201d </span></div></div>",

She knew though that it was the psychological part of Naruto\u2019s brain that told him to stop so she couldn\u2019t blame him.  If your brain is telling you, you can\u2019t go any further then 10 out of 10 times it\u2019s right.  This was a very special occasion though were her jutsu would fix that ten to a 100.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tIno smiled as she looked down at all the food before her.  She pulled Naruto\u2019s jacket off and rubbed her hands together.  This would be awesome! She started with the pumpkin cake first, shoveling it all into Naruto\u2019s mouth and enjoying the taste of it.  She was a great cook if she did say so herself!  Then she went on to the large pile of cookies that Naruto had only nibbled at.  One after the other she bit into it and took out the milk to wash it down with.  It tasted so good! <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tIno looked down at Naruto\u2019s body in slight fascination.  The stomach was extended out in an unnatural way, though she knew it was normal for this jutsu\u2026 she\u2019d seen it performed before by an Akimichi after they\u2019d taken the third pill on a mission not too long ago.  Two inches out passed the normal limit.  The bulge moved from side to side and was still extremely soft.  That was how you could tell you hit the limit of the jutsu when the stomach became stone hard.  Ino grinned.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tShe brought the large chocolate cake closer to his body.  Ino didn\u2019t bother cutting a piece.  She took her fork and dug in.  The cake tasted so good!  She was never gonna be able to do this again.  Half the cake\u2026 all the cake.  She was so going to beat all the girls with getting Naruto to gain the most.  As she swallowed the last bit of cake Ino put her hands on Naruto\u2019s still soft but large stomach.  She\u2019d have to destroy the clone as soon she let her jutsu go unless she wanted a totally freaked out Naruto.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tHis stomach was huge!  She\u2019d had to move the seat back because the thing was pushing against the table.  She\u2019d almost tipped over twice it was so big!  Ino forced Naruto\u2019s body up and nearly tipped over again.  Steadying herself she got an idea.  She moved all the food to the living room and set the rest on the coffee table.  Then she lowered Naruto\u2019s body onto the couch.  There.  Now she wouldn\u2019t fall.  The couch sunk in deeply in response to the added weight.  Naruto\u2019s stomach jiggled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe felt a little guilty.  After all the plan wasn\u2019t to make Naruto quite \u2018this\u2019 big, but then she thought of all the chaos Naruto caused and shrugged.  Ino grabbed a large chunk of fudge and shoved it into Naruto\u2019s mouth.  Then she moved on to the lemon pie and apple pie.  The stomach extended further still and Ino was forced to take off Naruto\u2019s jacket when the stomach almost broke the zipper.  It was hard, dragging the zipper over the enlarged stomach, and she grunted with the effort.  When she reached for the donuts is when she came to the real problem though\u2026 His pants were REALLY digging into her/his? Hips.  It hurt.  A lot.  Ino lowered his pants just a little and smiled as the fattened stomach moved down and laid nicely on Naruto\u2019s lap.  That was better.  And it was still slightly soft too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stuffed the donuts into Naruto\u2019s mouth and deeply enjoyed the sugary taste.  It wasn\u2019t until she finished off the short bread and brownies that Naruto\u2019s stomach, enlarge to a foot and a half outward, finally began to harden.  Three more pieces of her strawberry double stack cake, which took a lot of effort to get a hold of, and the stomach hardened to it\u2019s capacity.  Ino smiled and patted the extremely hard stomach.  With a large amount of trouble she forced her hands into the release seal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNaruto moaned loudly as Ino quickly got up.  The blonde seemed extremely confused and tried to get up.  Fortunately for the blonde he simply fell hard back into the couch.  Ino moved behind him and hit the back of his neck.  The clone disappeared.  </span></div></div>",

For years, they have been working on a special jutsu designed to fatten all the Shinobi in the world, and now they're developed and prepared it, and they've activated it. And thanks to their many years of patient and careful preparation every Shinobi in the world instantly begins to feel the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the group of conspirators is enormous and very diverse. As such, while they all share a common goal, they have different reasons for doing it. Some are out for revenge on the Shinobi who have long since dominated their profession. Others see this simply as a means to ensure peace. And others are doing this for more personal reasons. And others still may have completely different motives and attitudes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of the difference they may have, they all came together to make this happen. But how did they make it happen? Did they use a Genjutsu to influence the Shinobi or a Ninjutsu?</span></div></div>",

Feel free to fatten up other characters along the way as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't intend to intervien much with this story, but I will if I start seeing bad submissions. So, be sure to do the following: don't end the story, keep Naruto oblivious for a while, try to use good grammer and spelling (but I'm not gonna harp on that one too much), be VERY descriptive of Naruto's gain as well as any other character or character's gains, be sure to include as many options as possible, don't kill off any characters, and be sure to keep the story logical<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, do what ever you want.</td>",
