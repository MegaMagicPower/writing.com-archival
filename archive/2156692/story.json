Well, if he was this dedicated to it, you guessed you were too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, on three. One, two, three!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you sprung out from behind the stack of boxes you had been hiding behind and began lobbing tomatoes at the blonde heads of the school cheerleaders. One of the tomatoes hit the lead cheerleader right in the forehead. She squealed and ran off, hands in the air. The other cheerleaders followed soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned. Those girls deserved that, after all they\u2019d done to you and Teddy\u2019s mutual friend, Brenda. Mocking her, stealing her gym clothes while she wasn\u2019t looking, writing fake love letters to the most popular guy in school. Man, teenagers really were animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were brought down from your high when you saw that one of the cheerleaders had stayed behind to confront the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Missy, the most popular girl in the school and the one who had initiated Brenda\u2019s bullying. She had her hands on her hips and a scowl on her face. \u201cYou two assholes better stop this shit or I\u2019m telling my daddy. He can snap his fingers and have your parents fired from their shitty little jobs at the factory.\u201d Ah, life in small town America. The only place where you could have a single person rule over more than half the town and have the threat of unemployment from a spoiled, bratty little girl have actual weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddy spluttered. \u201cHey, you don\u2019t have to do that! We\u2019re actually really sorry! We\u2019ll even clean your clothes for you-- wait, I mean--\u201d He realized his mistake too late. Missy\u2019s face turned red and she slapped Teddy in the face. Teddy yelped and clutched the throbbing red mark where she\u2019d hit him. \u201cOwww\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy stormed out of the room, arms at her sides and blonde ponytail bobbing. You\u2019d be lying if you said you didn\u2019t think she was hot. But enough of that! You had a wounded friend to tend to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright, dude?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and hid his face, his other cheek turning a vivid shade of red from sheer embarrassment. You patted him on the back and the two of you left the gymnasium to finally head home after another day of the hell that was highschool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda was waiting for the two of you outside, backpack slung over her shoulder. She waved at the two of you. You waved back with a smile on your face. Brenda wasn\u2019t exactly a model, but she was cute in her own nerdy way. You\u2019d thought about dating her a couple of times, but every time you came to the conclusion that it would just be too awkward. She adjusted her coke bottle glasses and gave you a high-five. Hell yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. \u201cWe made them pay. They\u2019ll think twice before pushing you down the stairs again.\u201d Really, you should have done a lot worse than embarrassing them at the end of the day, but you didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again. You were already on the verge of being kicked out. Your dad was angry enough as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda gave you a crooked smile. You patted her on the back and made your way down the sidewalk to the front of the school, where your bikes were chained up. A quick turn of the combination lock later and you and Teddy were on your way home. The two of you lived in separate neighborhoods, but they were both the same direction away from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Derek, what are you up to tonight? Got any plans?\u201d Teddy looked genuinely curious for once. He probably wanted to hang out. It was too bad you couldn\u2019t make it tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just the regular. I\u2019m going to hop on the computer and get some research done!\u201d That was true enough. You had been hard at work on a story that would hopefully become your first book. Teddy thought it was a little weird that you were obsessing so much over a piece of writing, but he didn\u2019t know how it felt to create with just your mind and your raw imagination. It was indescribable to someone who had never experienced it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddy\u2019s face fell. You guessed he could tell you weren\u2019t up for the hang out tonight. You smiled wanly at him. \u201cHey, next time, we\u2019ll definitely hang out. For now...I\u2019ve got to be heading home. See ya, man! Have a good evening!\u201d You waved Teddy goodbye and split down the intersection towards your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, you hated doing Teddy like that. He was a good friend. But you had to get your research done...ah, who were you kidding. Most of your research devolved into random music video sessions. That turned into a whole lot of behind the scenes videos, too. Very little research was actually done. Your book had stalled at chapter four. Maybe it would stay there forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were the thoughts running through your head as it happened. As you crossed in front of a local playground, you saw a blue streak of light shooting through the sky, straight at...you! You hopped off of your bike just in time to see the blue streak crash into the swingset, utterly destroying it in the process. A massive cloud of dirt shot up from the impact point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah.\u201d You looked around, to see if anyone had seen or heard what just happened, Nobody was standing outside with their phones up, so you guessed that was a big no. You stopped your bike at the curb and hopped off, eager to investigate this seemingly random cosmic occurrence.<br>\r\nAt the center of a surprisingly large crater, there was a single blue rock. It was smooth and somewhat oblong. It gave you the impression of an overly large egg. Hadn\u2019t you read that somewhere before? You crouched down at the edge of the crater and poked the rock with a curious finger. The stone was surprisingly cool to the touch, for something that was smoking just a few seconds ago. When nothing happened, you picked up the rock with both hands and dumped it into the outermost pocket of your backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d have to take a closer look at it later, in the safety of your own home. Out here, anyone could come looking for it. And that was the last thing you wanted. No, this precious gem was yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued on your way home, bicycling past the police cars that were zooming past you towards the impact site. Soon, they were joined by big black vans. Well, one thing was for sure-- whatever that rock was, somebody was looking for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You pulled up onto your front lawn and hopped off your bike. After walking your bike into your garage (your dad\u2019s garage, as he always insisted on correcting you), you made your way into the house proper. You crossed your fingers, hoping and praying that she wouldn\u2019t be in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey bro! Why are you in such a hurry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour little sister waved to you from the couch. Angela was such an annoyance, you swore to god. She just loved getting under your skin. She was only eleven, but that didn\u2019t stop her from being a total demon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just heading upstairs. Nothing else is happening here. Nope, nothing at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela raised an eyebrow. \u201cYeah, sure. I really believe that. You\u2019re hiding something, bro. More than usual, I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, is that Derek?\u201d Your mom\u2019s voice. She was probably taking care of something in her downstairs office. It seemed she spent almost all of her time in there nowadays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me! I was just heading up to my room when Angela decided to stop me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, be nice to your sister, okay? She\u2019s going through a rough time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know and you didn\u2019t want to know. Instead you just held your hands up and surrendered. \u201cOkay, mom. I\u2019ll be nice to Angela.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela stomped her foot. \u201cI\u2019m right here, you know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilted your head and forced a smile onto your face. \u201cI know. Sorry Angela. I\u2019ll be nicer to you from now on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked and hopped her way back to the couch. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear the smile in your mother\u2019s voice as she lauded you. \u201cThank you, Derek! Have a good time upstairs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good time? You raised an eyebrow and clomped your way upstairs. You were glad your dad wasn\u2019t home yet. You weren\u2019t sure you could deal with that level of bullshit this early in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought, you opened the door into your humble little bedroom. It wasn\u2019t much to look at. You had a twin bed with a hilariously outdated Scooby-Doo bedcover, a small desk where your laptop was charging, and a tiny table with a suitably small lamp. The walls were plastered with posters of your favorite celebrities (read: K-pop girls). You had Momoland, Twice, and Oh My Girl in positions of honor right above your bed. They were usually the last things you saw before you fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut enough of your lameness, you had a strange space rock to look at. Without wasting any more time, you tore the rock out of your backpack and placed it carefully on your desk, next to your laptop. You sat down and began to pick away at the rock with a screwdriver you\u2019d stolen from your dad\u2019s toolbox in the garage. Nothing seemed to happen. You weren\u2019t even sure what you were expecting. Some kind of blue light? A genie in the bottle? Neither came to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to get a little frustrated. Surely something as incredible as this rock held secrets beyond the surface. You picked the thing up with both hands and held it up to your face. \u201cCome on! Show me something cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rock lit up with a vibrant blue light. It suddenly become very hot to the touch. With a gasp, you dropped it back onto your desk. It didn\u2019t stop glowing. If anything, the light got brighter. The rock began to shake from side to side, as if possessed. You shielded your eyes with the back of your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light finally stopped, you lowered your hand, only to come face to face with a cloud of blue dust in the shape of a woman. That was the best way you could describe it. It was kind of amorphous, but it was unmistakably alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, the rock had done something cool, alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloud began to speak. \u201cHello, hello, testing one two three! Wow, this is so interesting! It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been to three-dee land. I\u2019ve forgotten how simple you all are. And Earth...ooh, intelligent life is so much fun to play with!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a couple of steps back, jaw thoroughly dropped. \u201cAre you-- are you an alien?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm...what an interesting question! Well, the answer is...sorta yes, sorta no? I originate not too far from here from a four-dimensional perspective...but from a three-dimensional one it\u2019s...difficult to explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFourth dimension? So you\u2019re like that one Superman villain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloud seemed to shrug. \u201cIn terms of powers, sure. But he and I couldn\u2019t be any more different in terms of mentality. Or maybe not. It\u2019s all a little orange and blue to you three-dee-landers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe floated past you, over to your bed. She took a close look at the covers. \u201cHmm. Scooby-Doo. You like this show even though you shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s way below your age group. At least that\u2019s what you think. And your favorite character is...her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped her fingers, and in an instant she had reshaped into the form of Velma Dinkley, orange turtleneck sweater and all. You blinked. \u201cHow did you do that? That\u2019s just...impossible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe adjusted her glasses and winked at you. \u201cI specialize in the impossible. As to how...I\u2019m a reality shifter. I manipulate the third dimension like you breathe air.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step back. \u201cBut why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \u201cThis one\u2019s your favorite, right? Velma Dinkley. She has a catchphrase too, doesn\u2019t she? What is it, Jinkies?\u201d She hummed softly to herself. \u201cI think that\u2019s what I\u2019ll call myself for right now. It works as well as anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get here? What do you want with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cSo many questions! I got here as part of a, hmm, a prison break, I guess you could say.\u201d You raised your eyebrows. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a violent crime, don\u2019t worry. As for what I want with you? Fun. That\u2019s my main reason for being, I guess you could say. To have fun. So, show me a good time, darling. I\u2019m sure we can get to know each other very well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step forward and rubbed the top of her head against your chin. You shuddered. It felt...so good. This was such a bizarre situation to find yourself in...and yet...something inside of you felt so right next to this-- fourth-dimensional being?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a hand on your chest and looked up into your eyes with warm brown eyes. \u201cSo, what do you want to do first?\u201d</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">It's a seemingly normal day when a gem containing an all-powerful reality-shaper crashes down in your neighborhood. The being inside takes a liking to you and you're off, twisting and bending reality to your will with the help of your new friend! Be very careful with what you say to her, though-- nigh-omnipotent beings are notoriously fickle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHARACTERS:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek Hallenburg: You. You're a sixteen year old kid with a lot of creative energy. You're also known as a bit of a punk around school. Or a nerd. It depends on who you talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela Hallenburg: Your younger sister. Eleven years old. Totally annoying. She loves pranking you, your mom, your dad, and just about everyone actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalliope Hallenburg: Your mom. 43. A good, hard-working person who hardly seems to have time for you or your sister nowadays. She works as a reporter for the local newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin Hallenburg: Your older brother. 21. He moved away a couple of years ago to move in with his girlfriend. That was just fine by you. He was nothing but a jerk to you when he lived with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward Hallenburg: Your dad. 49. A hard-ass. You're not terribly fond of him and he's not terribly fond of you. He thinks you're a lazy excuse for a son compared to your older brother. A career police officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddy Aldridge: Your best friend. 16. He kicks ass and takes names! Not really. A decent guy who has your back. He could be more popular, if it wasn't for his friendship with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda Miller: Your other best friend. 16. A total, hopeless nerd. You two met in kindergarten and you've been inseparable ever since. You do your best to protect her from the realities of high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy Kirkland: The most popular girl in school and an unrepentant bully. 17. You still have a crush on her, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy Lancaster: The most popular guy in school. Also a bully. Not a jock, though. He's class president, but that doesn't mean he's not a dick. Hates your guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinkies: A fourth-dimensional being living in a three-dimensional world. She's taken the shape of Velma from Scooby-Doo for some reason. You don't know much about her, but she does have the ability to shape and bend reality to her will. For some reason, she's following your lead, but that might change. She seems a little mischievous and a lot fickle. Try to stay on her good side, okay?</td>",
