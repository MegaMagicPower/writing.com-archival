Racing around the house trying to gather everything she needs, her car broke down so she needs to take the train into the city today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a7/58/63/a758637682dc3e1e7ffd48b7e67ec7c4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a7/58/63/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Just what I want to do.\u201d She scoffed \u201cRide the train in! It\u2019s always packed!\u201d Brandi tugged on her boots without socks in a hurry and bolted for the door, knowing the train could be here any minute now. As she opens the door she noticed a small cellphone sized box on her doormat. Not wanting to miss her train she just grabbed it and zoomed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was speed walking down the street, cig in hand when she sees the train coming from not to far down the track. \u201cAw, come on! I didn\u2019t want to run!\u201d Brandi flicked her cig and took off for the ticket machine and basically punch the thing to get a day pass. She grabbed her ticket and leaped into the train. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi tilted her head back and sighed, happy she didn\u2019t have to wait for the next train. She began to look around for any kind of seat in the packed train. Walking down the halls she was greeted by a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Brandi! You Bambi fuck!\u201d Brandi looked in front of her and noticed it was one of her coworkers Ethan. Looks to her he had a seat held in the way back. Brandi sighed a sigh of relief as she walked over to him and sat down. \u201cSo what\u2019s got you riding the train? Don\u2019t you have a car?\u201d Ethan questioned as Brandi began to unbox what ever was on her doormat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucker broke down. Glad I live close enough to the train.\u201d She laughed lightly \u201cGot this weird package on my way out tho. Don\u2019t remember ordering anything from Wish lately.\u201d Brandi opened the box and inside was some kind of remote with one button on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan glanced at it and had a similar confused look on his face just as Brandi did. \u201cThat\u2019s weird\u201d she reached in for it and started examining the device when all the sudden the train had to make an abrupt stop, Brandi tumbled the remote in the air and the two grabbed it. Tho it was pointed towards Ethan unluckily for him, the remote made a quick little ZAP sound and in the blink of an eye Ethan vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi shook her head and looked around, then looked back at the remote and checked out the button. It was just one large button that said \u201cShrink\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandis eyes slowly made there way down to the seat Ethan was sitting at and low and behold, there he was standing no taller then an inch tall or shorter. Brandis eyes widened as she looked at Ethan jumping up and down and back at the remote \u201cI-It\u2019s a shrink ray? Why would I get a shrink ray?\u201d She questioned herself and looked back down at Ethan, ideas racing through her mind as a smile spreads a crossed her face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knows at this point. She\u2019s not going to work now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She was amazed no one even noticed this whole ordeal happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJokingly Brandi began to play dumb as she looked around \u201cEthan? Where did you go? Eeeethaaaan?\u201d She said in a sarcastic voice as. Ethan watched as she looked around like she never even knew they made eye contact before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBRANDI! Stop playing games! Help me! What\u2019s even happening!\u201d Ethan yelled but his voice fell on deaf ears as the girl jokingly acted like she had no idea what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess if he\u2019s not here anymore. I can have the window seat...\u201d A soft chuckle came from Brandi as she lifted her butt of her seat and began to scoot over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthans heart sank as her ass casted a shadow over him like an eclipse. For being such a skinny girl her butt was still well defined, both her cheeks noticeable even under her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan snapped out of it a little to late tho. Brandi centered herself over the poor boy and plopped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan vanishes from sight as Brandis butt sealed him in darkness. She giggled to herself and swayed in her seat a little, feeling her tiny friend struggle. Her aim was spot on as she felt him wiggle under her she could feel him right under her buttcrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was hyperventilating, his friend just sat on him, he could feel the warmth growing around him as she moved to her comfy in her new seat. Ethan struggles to move his arms and legs but to no avail he was trapped on his back under her behind. He began to accept the fact he couldn\u2019t get out without outside assistance he stopped moving to save energy. But this is when his focus shifted to the now ever growing stagnant air around him, even through her jeans he could smell her butt. He tried taking his mind off of it and was Atleast happy he wasn\u2019t on the inside of her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi was filled with joy as she sat in her new seat, she looked at the shrink ray again \u201cI don\u2019t know why I got this thing, but it\u2019s gonna be an enjoyable little toy.\u201d She smiled \u201cJust like you Ethan.\u201d She said softly to herself as she wiggled her butt in the seat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the train got closer to her work she began to think about the fun she could have with the remote and better yet the fun she could have messing with Ethan. As the train reached her stop she had already made the call she won\u2019t be coming in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what does she do from here on....</span></div></div>",

She wondered how well he could breath under her, but soon her stop was coming up. Brandi slid the remote into her pocket and gathered her things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked around to make sure no one was watching as she leaned to the side and fished Ethan out from under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled softly as she brought him to her face and quietly talked to him \u201cSo how was that huh?\u201d She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBRANDI!\u201d Ethan yelled catching his breath of fresh air \u201cYou have GOT to fix this! I knew you were crazy but this is a BIT much!\u201d His voice barely hearable \u201cListen I\u2019ll take care of you. If you could survive my butt I\u2019m sure you can handle anything.\u201d She laughed as she began to get up \u201cNow listen I\u2019m gonna see what more I can do with this thing. So I\u2019m gonna need to hide you for now.\u201d She looked around, most people in the area have moved on now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey now Brandi! Don\u2019t be doing anything stupid! Just put me in your bag or some shit!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi looked back at Ethan \u201cOh you know me. As of now. I know just where to keep you.... butthead. I know you\u2019ll like it.\u201d And without another word Brandi swung her hand down behind her, Ethans looking right as her butt now. \u201cWait! WAIT NONO! BRANDI DONT YOU FUCKING DARE! DONT YOU FUCKING DO IT!\u201d She laughed and quickly stuffed her hand down the back of her pants, with a little shove she pushed Ethan right up against her wrinkly hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi bit her lip as she removed her hand \u201cNow you enjoy yourself. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine in there.\u201d She laughed and made her way off the train. She could feel Ethans panicked struggles to free himself from within her petite behinds cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was in pure hell, the smell was 100x stronger then when she just sat on him \u201cGOD DAMNIT BRANDI! *gag* GET ME OUT OF HERE! I knew you were crazy but not SHOVE ME IN YOUR ASS CRAZY!\u201d He yelled and punched on her asshole as hard as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi felt this hard hit and it made her jump and clench up a bit. As she did this she felt Ethans struggles ram against her butthole \u201cOh dear! Don\u2019t get lost in there Ethan...I\u2019ll get you out once I find a few more toys.\u201d<br>\r\nShe rubbed her left asscheek as she walked to her destination \u201ctoday is gonna be fun.....\u201d</span></div></div>",

The same button that made her friend tiny. Speaking of witch, Brandi cracked a smile as she focused on her friend between her buttcheeks. She let out a quiet laugh as she walked, feeling his tiny body rub against her asshole. His struggles to not be sucked in brought a strange joy to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope it\u2019s not to bad back there, Ethan.\u201d She giggled and walked into the malls parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile between the cheeks, Ethan was in a sweaty hell. Her movement only heated up the place from the friction of her soft cheeks grinding him against her asshole. He\u2019s had to use every bit of his strength to not get pulled inside his friends behind. To be trapped in Brandis rectum was not on the top of his fun list. The smell of her butt was starting to really get to him but he had to fight on, otherwise things will only get... grosser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the hellscape known as Brandis behind she finally reached the entrance to the mall.

I swear!\u201d She whisper screamed \u201cHang on...

YOUR FUCKING BOOT!? Are you kidding me!?\u201d Ethan flailed about, his voice actually reaching Brandis ears at this point. \u201cI know I know! Hush! I\u2019m sorry! But you\u2019ll be safe in here... I think. As long as you\u2019re under my toes.\u201d She blushed a little as she removed her bare foot from the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan noticed this and freaked out \u201cyou are NOT putting me in there! No way no how! You didn\u2019t even wear socks! It\u2019s gonna fucking REEK!\u201d He protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook! You\u2019re going in the boot! If you keep being stubborn I\u2019ll make it worse! I could just eat you. You want that!? You can hang out in my belly till I get home, or worse! You wanna go up my ass?\u201d Brandi glared at Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrandi... no.. but you know you have FUCKING POCKETS! Put me in t- AHH!\u201d Before he could argue more Brandi through him into the boot. His body slammed into the moist insole covering his clothes in foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh... ow..\u201d he sat up and instantly his nostrils were assaulted by the thickest air he\u2019s ever breathed in, it absolutely reeked of Brandis foot sweat inside. He looked up to see just a slight exit of light. Gagging and trying to get to his feet he looked around. The faint light lite up his tomb, he turned towards the toe section and could very faintly see the craters her toes have imprinted into the worn out insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his footing became shaky as the whole boot began to move. Brandi began to tilt the boot sending Ethan straight to the toe section. The smell only getting worse as he slammed face first into the dip her big toe has made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUaaah! GOD! *cough* REALLY!\u201d He whipped the thick sweat off his face and soon noticed the world around him getting dark. Ethan turned to see Brandis skinny pale foot enter the boot and rocket towards him. One last curse word spilled out as he was bulldozed and sealed underneath her sweaty toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Brandi adjusted her boot on and put her foot down. \u201cThere we go. See. Nice and safe.\u201d She wiggled her toes and felt Ethans struggles were wedged between her middle toe area. His face buried against her soft skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk! Time to get home. Fuck work. Gotta figure this shit out.\u201d Brandi got her stuff ready to get off and get the next train back home.</span></div></div>",

She plugged in music and pretended everything was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside her boot, the air began to get much thicker and dank as each step dug Ethan into the moist insole of her shoe and slowly wedged him more and more between her toes. His screams muffled by the sweaty skin deep between. Ethan could find a second of time each step to push his face away from the disgusting monster known has Brandis foot each step only to be forced against it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Brandi was about half way home and she could feel her feet getting even more sweaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh jeez...

FUCK!\u201d She ripped her boot off and light flooded Ethans eyes as he was pulled free, yet still stuck between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi brought her foot closer to her face, kind recoiling from the smell \u201cWhat the hell is your problem!\u201d She looked around if anyone could see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s MY problem! YOU! You stuck me in your gross ass shoe! You know how bad it smelt in there! Damnit girl I know you have pockets!\u201d Ethan blurted out as he tried to break free from between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen here you little shit. I didn\u2019t have many other options! My pockets are full of more important things.\u201d She disclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan look dumbfounded as if her cellphone and wallet were more important then his well being. \u201cYou... STUCK ME IN YOUR BOOT!\u201d He was clearly upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen! I was being nice. My boot was one of the least problematic spots I could have kept you, you know what! Since you\u2019re acting this way AND bit me. I\u2019ll gladly move you.\u201d Brandi was visibly angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait... I just.. WAIT!\u201d Brandi plucked Ethan out from between her toes and brought him to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squinted her eyes and soon walked behind a nearby bush, out of site of anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna bitch at me, and you bite me? You get what\u2019s coming...\u201d she glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan screamed as she...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knew Brandi was gaining on him, no way in hell running is actually going to help. But as all hope was almost lost, two figures came around the corner on the sidewalk and were near Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe skidded to a halt and looked behind him, Brandi was very close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan started jumping up and down to draw any kind of attention to himself. It was two guys, late teens early 20s. Ethan screamed and jumped, and somehow! These two noticed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d One said as he leaned down to look at Ethan, the other seeing Brandi close in. She was reaching for something. \u201cIs that a tiny person?\u201d The one leaned down said as he reached out to pick Ethan up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all the sudden a familiar flash overtook Ethans eyes. He covered his face and soon lowered his arms to look at the two guys. His heart sank as he saw them both on the ground at his height, holding their heads \u201cAuh.. the fuck happened?..\u201d one said as he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of them could move from that spot tho Brandis two boot clad feet stomped beside Ethan and the two others. An audible gulp could be heard by Ethan as he slowly turned and looked up at the angry face above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sheepishly waved as the two others started to panic, Brandis hand came down and plucked them all up. She put the two new boys in one hand and Ethan in another. She then walked off to a more privet place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL! Ethan, looks like your rebelliousness got me two new toys. That\u2019s not gonna save you from what\u2019s going to happen as punishment tho.\u201d She glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen Brandi! I only acted out cause of your carelessness! You put me in your boot for god sakes!\u201d He yelled, the words unsettling the two new people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well my boots gonna feel like heaven once I\u2019m done securing you...\u201d she looked at the other two \u201clet this be a lesson on being disobedient.\u201d Her eyes shot back at Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait Brandi, we can TALK AB-\u201c he was cut short as she flung him into her mouth. His tiny screams being silenced to the two others as she closed her mouth and started swishing him around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-HEY!.. let him go!\u201d One of the others stepped forward. Brandi glanced down at him and smiled. She slowly opened her mouth And stuck her tongue out slightly to let the two see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was struggling in a thick pool of saliva she\u2019s bowled up on her tongue, a slight dribble of it falling from the tip of her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELP! OH GOD! HELP! BRANDI YOU FUCKING BITCH DONT DO TH- AHH!\u201d Brandi rolled her tongue in and closed her mouth, she smiled and with her free and wiped the spit off her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were speechless as the towering girl sloshed the poor soul around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was in pure hell, not only was he in a sea of saliva, and being beaten by Brandis tongue. The air was filled with left over morning breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screamed and shouted as he was pushed from one cheek to the other, under her tongue and scrapped onto the roof of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart was racing as she flopped him under her tongue again and pinned him there, the saliva build up subsided but with it came a grizzly sound. Brandi had pushed all the built up spit to her throat and swallowed, the horrifying sound of the thick pool sliding down the girl esophagus sent chills down his spin... that could have been him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds pass with silence When she soon flipped him back into her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys in her hand were to shocked to say anything as they watched Brandi swallow, a wet gulp could be heard trickle down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile spread a crossed Brandis face as she leaned into her other hand and spit Ethan out with a small glob of leftover spit. The two others sighed with relief as they saw Ethan lay there struggling in the spit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t actually think I\u2019d eat him did you?\u201d She chuckled \u201cNo, no that wouldn\u2019t show what else I can do to bad toys...\u201d as Ethan struggled in the spit Brandi managed to slid him to her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could have stayed in my boot Ethan. Could have waited and been good till I got home. But no. At least you got us some company.\u201d She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrandi, I\u2019m sorry! I really am! Just.. just carry us home in your hand.\u201d Ethan was to beat up and tired to fight back in his normal way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019ll carry you, they\u2019ll be fine. You get to ride in the back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan tried to make sense of what she meant when his world began to move again. The two others watched, eyes wide open as Brandi brought her hand down behind her. Ethan out of sight from them they could soon hear his screams as Brandi adjusted herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthans screams fell silent again as Brandi giggled, she bit her bottom lip and let out a little moan as she violently thrusted her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi opened her eyes and brought her hand back into view for the others, Ethan was no longer stuck to her fingertip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY.. you didn\u2019t... you didn\u2019t just stick him in your asscrack did you?!\u201d One said with a fearful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi looked back down at them and laughed \u201coh he\u2019s not in my crack.\u201d She brought her other hand to the two, index finger out. A strong smell came from it \u201cLet\u2019s just say are bad toy is deep in a cave no mans ever been.\u201d She laughed again \u201cI can feel him wiggling around, he\u2019ll be fine in there till we get home.\u201d She closed her hand around the two and started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk on her face. She\u2019s liking this new power over people.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
