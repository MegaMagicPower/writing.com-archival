Jaden was reviewing his deck while she was getting food. Jaden thought about his friends. He cared about them but he didn't want to worry them. He knew that if he told them they would worry more than they already are. The door started to open, so Jaden hid near the pillow just in case that it wasn't Alexis and it wasn;t. Instead it was Zane, Syrus's older brother and one of the top student in duelist academy.<br>\r\n\"Alexis. Are you there?\" he asked. He left after he noted that she wasn't there. A few minutes after Alexis came in with some food.<br>\r\n\"Alexis.\" he said in a low voice,\"Am I putting you in a lot of trouble?\" Alexis looked down at Jaden surprised. \"No, of course not Jaden. I mean anything to help a friend, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a friend.\" he said lowly. Alexis  started to feel sad for Jaden. She knew that he felt helpless to do anything and that he could do anything to help.<br>\r\n\"Oh Jaden. I didn't mean to make you feel sad or anything.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh, oh, don't worry. It wasn't what you said\" he lied. When she used the word friend he thought of what he was putting Alexis through. At noon he went to sleep without eating much.
