You hopped a bus and took a seat. You keep your head down for the entire ride. People gave you looks, but said nothing when they saw the knife on your leg. When the bus came to a stop, you got up to get off when someone bumped into you. Watch it, freak. He said. You turn and punch him hard in the stomach. Ugh\u2026..! He said as he coughed up blood. As he falls over, you walk off the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome\u2026.. You said. You head over to see detective building you worked for and see Narue talking to someone. Time was good to her. You said. You wanted to go over to her, but don\u2019t. No\u2026.. She has her life to live. You said. When Narue looks over your way, you\u2019re gone. Did you see something? The person said. I felt\u2026..like he was here just now. Narue said. You left the building and went back to your house. You use the spare key under the mat and head inside. You went into your room and grab the device you got from the school. \u2026..Those girls were smarter than anything I\u2019ve seen. Let\u2019s see if this works. You said. You press a few buttons and are enveloped in a blue light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light goes away, you are standing in the middle of a desolate street. You take a look around to see destroyed buildings, crushed cars, and a few bodies. Where the hell am I? You said. You look at one of the bodies. No gunshot wounds, but he\u2019s covered in blood. Maybe he fell, but from where? All the buildings here are trashed. And this guy\u2026.. He\u2019s been ripped in half. You said, looking at the other body. You head over to the last body and examine it when his eyes shoot open. Sir. What happened here? You said. The\u2026\u2026the monsters\u2026.. The monsters\u2026. They\u2026..they came\u2026..killed everyone\u2026\u2026 Left\u2026.no one\u2026.alive\u2026.. He said before his eyes close. You feel for his heartbeat. He\u2019s\u2026.gone. You said. You look around and see devastation. Whatever monsters he talked about, did a number on this place. I need to find some answers. You said. You follow the road and after a long walk, you come across a city. Maybe I\u2019ll find something here. You said. You walk around and see only guys. Strange\u2026.. Only men are around here. You said. Hey! A voice said. You turn around to the person who said that. You point to yourself. Yes, you. Get over here. He said. You walk over to him. You\u2019re really out of place. Who are you? He said. Just a wandering nobody. What\u2019s going on here? You said. Before he could respond, the ground shakes. What the hell is that? You said. Oh shit! He said. He runs away as the shaking gets more violent. You see people scrambling and hiding. You wait a few seconds until you see the cause of it. A\u2026.giantess? Why is this kid so huge. Can\u2019t be no more than 100ft. You said. You cover your ears as she roared like a monster. I think this is what that guy meant by monster. You said. You hide inside a building as you hear her rampage around. So is this a world of giant preteens pretending to be monsters\u2026\u2026 Not the worst I\u2019ve seen. You said. As you look outside, you see a giant eye looking in. She reaches in to grab you and pulls you out as the building crumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess I found out how that guy died. You said. She smiles at you evilly and gives a tug at you arm. She\u2019s treating me like some kind of toy\u2026..! You said. (\u2026..Do it\u2026.) He said. You push her hand away and disappear. While she\u2019s surprised, you reappear in the air behind her head and punch her. The force of your hit sends her crashing into the ground and you land on her back. (\u2026..See what happens when you listen to me\u2026?) He said. (Stay quiet.) I need to find someone who knows what the hell\u2019s going on. You said. You jump off her back and leave the city. As you walk, you come across\u2026.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A prison? If this is a world run by giant preteens, why would they need this? You said. You disappear and reappear on the roof and bust open a window and jump down. You land on the hard ground and get a look at your surroundings. Whoa. It\u2019s more of a concentration camp on the inside. You said. You walk down the line of cell doors and see guys in them. A cot and tv. Hopefully these people are getting three hots. You said. As you walk, you see some laying down on the floor and others silently weeping. Their spirits are broken. I don\u2019t get it. Why keep them here? You said. Hey! Stop! A voice said. Guess one of the guard dogs found me. You said. Get back to your cell, now! He said. When he touches you, you elbow him and kick him into the wall. I\u2019m no prisoner. You said. You go to him and look him over. No weapons on him. Not even identification. You said. Psst. Hey pal. A prisoner said. Me? You said. Yeah. You. Come here. He said. You go to his cell door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust who are you? A masked vigilante? He said. A nobody. You look like you know something. What\u2019s going on here? You said. This is a place where hope dies. Like being slaves was bad enough. Day in, day out torture. He said. Slave? Torture? Ok. I\u2019ve been around for a few hours and I would really like some answers. You said. You must not be from this world. I\u2019ll sum it up for you. Women are dominate, and men are dirt. He said. Give me a long version. You said. Women here are 100ft. They come to our cities and destroy everything. Any man they don\u2019t kill is taken to be a slave. If not slave, they are made to fight in that accursed arena. He said. Arena? You said. A death sentence. You go in, but don\u2019t come out. You get matched up against these vile creatures. If you\u2019re lucky, death is quick. He said. Has anyone ever survive? You said. One guy, but power went to his damn head and now he\u2019s master. He said. What\u2019s the point of this prison? You said. To fulfil the sick desire of those creatures. They play their sadistic games here on us. Men who commit crimes against these beasts are kept here. He said. Are there any women who aren\u2019t as bad as you make them? You said. They are few and far. If you do manage to find one, I suggest you stay with her. Odds of living go up. He said. So this guy who won in that arena\u2026.. Where is he? You said. In his mansion. He has guards. His elites he calls them. Five of them. All of them are as nasty as can be. Especially Amy. \u2026\u2026You ever felt like life hates you just because? He said. I think I should pay this master a visit. You said. Wait. If you\u2019re going crusade against him, free us. Nobody deserves to be locked up like this. He said. Do you know how to get out? You said. I\u2019ve been in here long enough that I know the guard change. He said. Good enough. You said. You bend the bars easily. Get going before someone sees you. You said. You go around and set free some more guys and leave the same way you came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis place is hell. You said. (Feel like you\u2019ve done good, boy scout? Set them free knowing they\u2019re going to die in that arena.) He said. (Didn\u2019t I tell you to shut up?) You said. (You can\u2019t get rid of me. I\u2019m a part of you. A part you need. If you\u2019d only let me drive, we could have so much fun.) He said. (You\u2019re staying sealed.) You said. (You\u2019re going to need my help sooner or later. You can only do so much by yourself\u2026.) He said. Him aside. This place is filled with giant women. Not that it is a problem. I can knock \u2018em out with ease. But I need to see this master for myself. You said. Avoiding being out in the open, you head towards the mansion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He don\u2019t look like a master or dressed like one. And those five bikini clad preteens must be his elite guards. Except that one. She\u2019s only at least ten. You said. You put your hand on the glass and it glows so you can hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster. We just got reports of slaves escaping. One of them said. What? How? He said. Reports showed the bars were pried with force. Another said. Force? Who could be that strong to do that? He said. One man who was caught said it was a masked person. Another said. Was he caught? He said. No. He was long gone by the time the alarm was tripped. Another said. Is their any information on this person? He said. No name, no identity. It\u2019s like he just appeared. Another said. Interrogate the ones who were captured. We have to stop this before it becomes a problem. He said. You wait until the five of them leave. You punch the glass window out. When he covers his head, you jump down. Ask and you shall receive. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo\u2026. You\u2019re the masked person? You\u2019re not even out off your teens. He said. Didn\u2019t know there was an age requirement to do things. Like being a tyrant? You said. And? He said. What? You expect me do something about that? You said. You crashed through my window and had a knife. You do the math. He said. You think I\u2019m going to kill you? What makes you think that? You said. You mean you aren\u2019t? He said. No. Unless you give me a reason. Turning on my own kind isn\u2019t enough? He said. I\u2019ve seen worse. I\u2019ll keep it simple: Don\u2019t cross me and you can keep playing god. You said. Is that a vague threat? He said. No. It\u2019s advice. I suggest you take it\u2026. Unless you want me to kill you. You said. Really? I\u2019d like to see it. He said. Look down. You said. He looks down to see your knife in his chest. Wha?! When did you?! He said. Calm down. A little mind trick. There\u2019s nothing there. You said. He looks again and there\u2019s no knife or wound. See? If I wanted you dead, you\u2019d be dead. You said. What\u2026..who are you?! He said. Just a wandering traveler\u2026.. You said. You disappear and reappear on the roof. Nice talking to you, Kyle. You said. W\u2026..when did he learn my name?! He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back to the city you came across. While walking through, everyone moves out of your way. You bump into someone. Hey! Watch- Oh! So sorry, man! I\u2026I\u2019ll be going! He said. He quickly ran away. That guy was scared shitless. You said. You keep walking and head into a vacant building and head into an empty room. A bed. All I need. You said. You take a seat on the bed. (Why didn\u2019t you kill him? We could have be the new master.) He said. (I have no intentions of being that. And don\u2019t wrap me up in your sick delusions.) You said. (We are the same person. Two sides of the same coin.) He said. (I\u2019m nothing like you. You want death and destruction.) You said. (It\u2019d be better than what\u2019s going on now. I don\u2019t have time for slaves.) He said. (Be quiet! I\u2019m done talking to you.) You said. You lay on the bed and close your eyes.</span></div></div>",

Guy can\u2019t get no rest. You said. You get up and look out the window. You see men running and a giant foot land on a few of them. Ouch\u2026. You said. You see it\u2019s Kyle\u2019s elite guard. Oh. Those girls. Is this what they do in their spare time? Bad enough they wear bikinis everywhere they go. You said. Your door is suddenly flung open. There! That\u2019s the one they want! A man said. Oh. I see. Knew this was coming. When they came to grab you, you broke all of their bones. Just had to try me. And now look at you all. Crumbled up like paper balls. You said. Hey! A voice said. You turned around to see a giant eye looking in. Fuck\u2026. You said. A hand comes through the building and grabs you. Gotcha! I got him! Yumi said, pulling you out. Let me see! I want to see this person! Amy said. As they crowd around, she opens her hand, but you\u2019re gone. What?! I felt my hand on him as I grabbed him! She said. If you wanted me, all you had to do was ask. You said, standing on her shoulder. Wha!? How\u2019d you!? She said. You disappear and reappear on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this rampage just for me. Am I suppose to be flattered? Shocked? Angry? What\u2019s going on here? You said. You\u2019re the one who caused a prison escape! Amy said. Oh. That. I wasn\u2019t allowed to do that? You said. Why would you?! Luna said. Because the guy asked me too and I didn\u2019t see a reason not to. What\u2019s the problem? Rule the world anyway. You have more slaves than one girl needs. You won\u2019t mind a few missing. You said. Your smart mouth is going to get you crushed! Luna said. Shaking. Aren\u2019t you girls late for school or something? Or do you usually waste your time hunt one random guy? You said. You talk big for a man. Soya said. Because I\u2019m not intimidated by some preteens on a power trip. You said. You should be. Your life belongs to us! Koyuki said. Last time I checked, my life was my own. Just like yours. Now. Are we done here? Go\u2026.do whatever you usually do. You said. Why you! Amy said. When she took one step, you disappear and reappear on her shoulder. You jump and punch her right in the face. The force of the hit sends her crashing to the ground as you land on the ground.  Amy! Her friends said. Let that be a lesson. A lesson to all of you. I\u2019m not the guy you want to deal with. You said before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear some distance out of the city. Hmph. Looks like I\u2019m walking tonight. You said. You head down the desolate road. (You could have taken her head off if you used a little bit more power.) He said. (Knocking her lights out was enough. I\u2019m not going to start something with kids.) You said. (Kids? Monsters is more like it.) He said. (Takes one to know one.) You said. You continue to walk when you come to a different district. This place is a dump. Ruble and destroyed things everywhere. You said. You look around and keep walking. This must have been one of the places men lived. It\u2019s a wreck now. You said. You stop when you felt like someone was watching. Alright, kid. You can quit peeking. I know you\u2019re there. You said. Waiting a few seconds, you feel the ground shake. \u2026..What do you want, kid? You said. I heard\u2026..rumors about you. Are they true? She said. Enlighten me. You said. That you can vanish into thin air and knock out anyone with one punch. She said. All true. What about it? You hear to do me in or something? You said. N\u2026No! Why would I do that? She said. Because this is a world ruled by derange women. You said, turning around. Question is: Are you one of them? You said. You see that she\u2019s not a preteen, but a teen. Or at least 15. She\u2019s dressed in jeans and a red shirt, and she has short orange hair. So. Where do you stand? You said. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to treat your kind the way we do. She said. Do you mean that? Or are you just saying it? You said. I mean it. I don\u2019t see why we need to treat men horribly. She said. So why are you after me? You said. Come with me. She said. What? As a slave? You said. No! I wouldn\u2019t do that! I want to come with me so you can be safe. She said. From what? I\u2019m not scared of you girls. You said. \u2026..I know you have no reason to trust me, but I want to show you that not all of us have a god complex. She said. Trust\u2026.. You think you can show me that you\u2019re not like the rest? You said. I\u2019ll prove it right now. She said as she places her hand on the ground. \u2026\u2026Hmph. You said. You disappear and reappear on her hand. You have a long way to go. You said. She brings you to her face. First time holding a man in my hands. She said. Don\u2019t get use to it. I\u2019m only allowing this because it\u2019s a trust building thing. You said. R\u2026right\u2026. She said.</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t try to crush me in her hands, so she\u2019s off to a good start.) You said. (Are you giving her the benefit of the doubt? Didn\u2019t do that for me.) He said.

It\u2019s always the basement where the secrets are kept.) He said. As you look around, you hear rapid footsteps. That can\u2019t be good. You said. Mira! A voice shouts. You see an energetic 13 year old run up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley. Calm down. Mira said. Miley sees you in Mira\u2019s hand. Mira. Who\u2019s that? She said. He\u2019s\u2026.a friend. Mira said.

She said. S\u2026.sure. Just be careful with him. She said. Mira hands you over to Miley. She looks at you with intrigue. (That look in her eye\u2026.) You thought. She pokes you with her index finger. He\u2019s\u2026..so cute! She said. (Cute!?) You both said. You\u2019re my little brother from now on! She said. (Little brother!?) You both said. Miley. It doesn\u2019t work that way. You can\u2019t just make him your \u201cLittle brother.\u201d Mira said. Why not? He\u2019s small enough. Miley said. Just because he\u2019s smaller, doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t older than you. He\u2019s not even related to you. Mira said. Then I\u2019ll ask him. She said. (I hate kids.) He said. Hey, little guy. Would you like to be my little brother? She said. (No, snot nose.) He said. \u2026\u2026Sure. You said. (You really do hate me.) He said. Now he\u2019s my little brother! Miley said. Miley. I need to speak to our \u201clittle brother\u201d alone. Mira said. \u2026..Fine. But I want time with him after. She said. Very well. Mira said. (Am I a toy here?) You thought. Miley hands you back to Mira. Mira heads to her room. (Hm. A normal girls room.) You thought. (Closet. Box of men. All begging for freedom.) He said. Mira sits on her bed and opens her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister is a lively one. You said. She\u2019s a handful. Mira said. (Mira\u2019s\u2026\u2026not bad so far. Still not holding my breath.) You said. (I\u2019d like to hold onto something of hers.) He said. (You have no respect.) You said. You take a glance at Mira\u2019s chest and you\u2019re not displeased. (She\u2019s well endowed. For a 15 year old. Ds.) You thought. (Yeah. I\u2019m the one without respect.) He said. So\u2026. Do you trust me yet? She said. Not as easy as you think. Only time will tell if you\u2019re true to your word. You said. I mean what I say. I\u2019m not going to do anything to you. She said. So you say. You said. You disappear and reappear on her shoulder. Trust is a two way street. You want me to trust you, but do you trust me? You said. I do. She said. You say that with such confidence. You said. I know you\u2019re not a bad person. Just\u2026..frightened. She said. Don\u2019t you dare try and psycho evaluate me. You know nothing about me. You said. I know you\u2019re alone. I know that you\u2019re looking for some solace. I know that you\u2019re looking for peace of mind. She said. You think you know me more than I know myself. But you don\u2019t. You. Know. Nothing. You said. Then tell me something that you know. She said. I don\u2019t need to tell some girl I just met anything about me. You said before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear back in the city. That girl has some nerve trying to get into my head and act like she knows me. Out of anger, you punch a building and it crumbles down. (Mindless destruction. My favorite.) He said. You power was rising from you being anger. (Yes\u2026. Let it flow through you.) He said. The ground started to shake as your power keep rising. (Release me\u2026. And we can make this world our own.) He said. Your eyes change red for a few seconds until you regain your sense and calm down. (Grrr\u2026.! So close. I could taste freedom.) He said. You power returns to normal. (Can\u2019t let my anger get out of control. Less he gets free.) You thought. (You\u2019re hurting my feeling over here.) He said. (You don\u2019t have feelings.) You said. You notice the moon is hanging high. It\u2019s getting dark. Don\u2019t think I should stay here. Not dealing with a late night preteen. You said. (That only leaves one option. Ugh.) You said. You disappear and reappear back in Mira\u2019s room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave you calm down? She said. Why? You want to evaluate me again? You said. That wasn\u2019t my intention. I wasn\u2019t trying to evaluate your life. I was pointing out the aspects of your life. She said. So you think you know me? You think you know what\u2019s best for little old me? Fine. Tell me what\u2019s good for me since I don\u2019t know. You said. You know that\u2019s not my intention. She said. Then how about this. You tell me your intention for me and I\u2019ll tell you whatever you want to know about me. You said. Fine. My intention for you isn\u2019t to treat you as a slave or whatever those messed up girls do. I\u2019m not like them. And you can ask my sister to validate me on that. I was and still am going to treat you like a human and with respect. She said. And the endgame? You said. Show you that there are some good ones out there.  And you expect me to believe that after what I\u2019ve seen? You said. Take it or leave it, but I told you what you wanted to hear. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. Fine. You kept your end. What do you want to know? You said.</span></div></div>",

At least we know each other by name. She said. Whatever\u2026.. Just keep your dark desires to yourself. You said. I keep telling you\u2026. I\u2019m not going to do anything to you. She said. I\u2019ll believe it when I see it. You said. *Sigh* It\u2019s getting late. She said. You disappear and reappear on her dresser. I\u2019m fine here. Just in case you had a shoe box ready. You said. What do you take me for? Some slave keeper? She said. I take you as a girl who I don\u2019t know. From where I stand, you all are the same. Now. I\u2019d like to get some shut eye. If that\u2019s ok with you, and don\u2019t want me do some demeaning task. You said. You lay down on the hard dresser and manage to go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up the next morning. Ugh\u2026.. You said. (I see you and this Chijinda were close.) He said. (Prowling through my memories again?) You said. You look around and notice you aren\u2019t on the dresser. (Where the hell am i?) You said. You feel you\u2019re on something soft. Like a pillow and you hear light snoring. You look over to see Mira\u2019s head. You quickly jump up and check your body. Nothing is out of place. Knife still on my leg. Mask still on. You said. (Middle of the night, she moved us to her bed.) He said. (And you didn\u2019t wake me?) You said. (I was going to, but I remembered you agreed to be that brat\u2019s little brother. Consider us even.) He said. (You\u2019re so petty.) You said. You disappear and reappear outside on the roof. You go from rooftop to rooftop to see women treating men like slaves and pets. This really isn\u2019t a world to be born a man. You said. You stop when you get to that prison. \u201cA place where hope dies.\u201d Is what the guy told me. The fuck is up with this place? You said. You head inside through the window you used last time. You walk around and look at the prisoners. As you go, you hear whispers from them as you walk. Seems like they won\u2019t be happy until they have every single man in here. You said. You couldn\u2019t be more right. A man said. You walk up to his cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo is that the point of this place? You said. Besides torture and punishment, yeah. He said. You look young to be in here. What\u2019d you do? You said. Told my owner to go fuck herself. One thing led to another and here I am. Serving a dime. He said. Ten years for that? A little harsh. You said. Every man here is being made as an example of. Most don\u2019t leave this place. Some try to break out, but they fail, and get a death sentence. He said. (Makes Alcatraz look like a time out.) He said. Was it always this bad for men? You said. In my opinion, since day fucking one. He said. (Damn.) You said. Say\u2026. You\u2019re that guy who laid out Amy? He said. What of it? You said. So it is true. How\u2019d you do it? Some sort of weapon? He said. Weapon? I just punched her. You said. J\u2026Just punched her?! He said. Yeah. Is it that hard to believe? You said. With the world we live in, yeah. She was not happy when she came to. Unfortunately, she took her anger out on us. He said. Oh. So that noise I heard is screaming. You said. L\u2026.Listen. If what you said is true, you\u2019re the only one who can stand up to these women. He said. Me? What about the army? You said. They won\u2019t last. If they could, they would be at that bastard\u2019s mansion by now. Nobody deserves to live their entire life in a cell just because they\u2019re a man. He said. Why not just fight back? You said. We don\u2019t have what you have. Laying out one of those girls like that. Amy no less. Look around. Do you think this is a life for anybody? Day in, day out torture, hoping that your life isn\u2019t ended on a whim, worshiping these bitches as if they were God himself. He said. Yet you still have hope of better times. I can see it in your eyes. You said. Even in the darkest of places, light still finds a way to come. He said. That sounds\u2026..philosophical. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat light is you. You could be a beacon of hope for us. He said. You seem like the only one. Everyone else here seems to have given up. You said. They just need to be waken up. See that these women aren\u2019t that powerful. He said. You\u2019re putting a lot of faith in a person you don\u2019t even know. You said. I know that you\u2019re a good person. Someone with a conscious. He said. (Well, beacon?) He said. You grip the bars and easily pry them open. Get going before someone sees you. You said. I have the utmost faith in you. He said before leaving. You go around and free other prisoners until you see a security camera. (They know it\u2019s us now.) He said. (Won\u2019t do them any good.) You said. You head out through the window. My good deed for the day. You said. You disappear and reappear in M district and see the prisoners getting there in vans. Seems like they were planning on escaping anyway. You said. (It won\u2019t be long before the goon squad finds out.) He said. (Scared of bikini clad preteens?) You said. (Scared? I\u2019ve killed bigger things than them.) He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess keeping a low profile is out the window. You said. (We\u2019re going to be a household name. Everyone will know.) He said. (It\u2019s not like I did something extravagant. Just bust some guys out of prison.) You said. (Extravagant or not, things are only going to get more interesting.) He said. (Which means it\u2019s only going to get worse from here on out. Perfect\u2026..) You said. </span></div></div>",

They sure are in a hurry. You said. (Life seems peaceful here for them.) You thought. You were going to leave when someone handed you an envelop and ran off. You open the envelop and read the message. \u201cCome to the mansion. Time me and you talked.\u201d It said. (A message straight from him. We\u2019re on notice.) He said. (I was expecting his guards to come, but a subtle message like this? He must think this is a delicate matter.) You said. (I say we yank out his delicate spine.) He said. You toss the message in a trash bin and head to the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get there and head to the roof. There he is. And he\u2019s alone. You said. (I smell a set up.) He said. You kick out the window and jump down. You know, there are these things called doors. He said. I know, but I only use them when I\u2019m kicking someone threw it. And it will happen if you don\u2019t tell things one through five to back away from me. You said. \u2026..Back off for now. He said. Reluctantly, his guards back off. Heh. What do you want, Kyle? You said. Seems like you like to cause trouble. He said. Are you referring to that prison break? I had nothing to do with that. You said. He\u2019s lying! Yumi said. Stay in your place. Men are talking. You said. Why you! She said. See? Trouble. He said. That prison break was because of the fault security system and your lazy guards. The one at the prison. You said. Really? Because I saw the camera footage and you looked right at it. He said. I was there. Seeing what kind of hellhole it was. But the prison break wasn\u2019t me. If I did organize that, there would have been explosions. You said. Explosions? That\u2019s funny, because that\u2019s how most of them escaped. He said. You hold guys with military background there. Anyone of them could have made an explosive device. You said. He\u2019s lying through his teeth! Amy said. Am I talking to you, runt? You said. What\u2019d you say?! Amy said. You heard me. Unless you want to get laid out again, keep quiet. You said. You\u2019ve got some nerve! Do you know where you stand in life? She said. Obviously you don\u2019t. Seems like you need a reminder. You said. Love to see that, but not here. Blood is hard to clean out. Kyle said. Fine. I\u2019ll do it your way. That arena isn\u2019t for show. I\u2019ll shut you up there. You said. Are you seriously challenging me!? She said. Kyle? You said. I can make it happen. But it\u2019s your funeral. He said. Then it\u2019s settle. Add whatever stipulation you want in your advantage. I\u2019ll see you there. You said. You disappear and reappear on the roof and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear back at Mira\u2019s house. (An impromptu challenge like that. Business or pleasure?) He said. (You know already.) You said. (This is going to be fun.) He said. You pull out your knife and sharpen it. (How should we kill our first giant? Dismemberment? Disembowelment? Decapitation? So many ways! Is this what being happy feels like?) He said. (You\u2019re a sicko.) You said. When you\u2019re done, you cut yourself, and the wound instantly heals up. Almost to the bone. You said. You sheathe your knife just as Mira walks in. Oh. You\u2019re back. She said. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be gone in a few minutes. I have somewhere to be. You said. And where is that? She said. I don\u2019t need to disclose that. You said. Fine. I know it will be like pulling teeth to get you to talk. But I need you for a minute. She said. (I knew it! I knew she was a faker!) He said. Heh. And what would that be? Get on my knees and call you goddess? You said. No. Just\u2026. *Sigh* Hop onto my hand. She said. Mira places her hand in front of you. (Don\u2019t do it. Listen to the voice in your head.) He said. With your hand on your knife, you step onto her hand. She lifts up her hand to her shoulder and you jump on. Mira heads out of her room and heads to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy\u2019d you bring me here? You said. You need to eat, right? She said. (Not really, but never turn down free food!) He said. Here this will be good. She said. She grabs some bread and meat and gives you pieces. Are you going to eat with that thing on? She said. You pull of your mask and hood. Whoa! Your face\u2026. She said shocked. Never seen a guy with small scars on his face? You said. (Parting gifts from me. Heh heh heh.) He said. You quickly eat the small pieces and put your mask and hood back on. \u2026..What about it? You said. I\u2026.didn\u2019t think you\u2019d look like that. She said. Believe it. Now. If we\u2019re done commenting on my facial features, I have to go. You said before disappearing. So\u2026.. That\u2019s why\u2026. Mira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear outside and head to the arena. When you get there, you see a bunch of men in there. (It\u2019s like a funeral in here. And at least, one thousand plus.) You said. (Hear the crowd? These bitches are expecting a massacre.) He said. You look at the weapons. Swords, guns, rockets\u2026.. Weapons from medieval to modern. You said. (And look. These jokers have already given up. They\u2019re using only swords.) He said. (Spirts broken beyond saving. Might as well lay down and wait.) You said. Blending in with the others, you head into arena. (Damn. This arena makes the coliseum of Rome look like a playground.) You thought. You look across to see the huge arena doors opening. Hear she comes. You mutter. Feeling the tremors that caused some of the men around you to fall, you see Amy coming out. She lets out a thunderous roar down at the men. They all cover their ears, but you just stare up at her. (Fear tactics.) You thought. (The crowd\u2019s in a buzz over that shit.) He said. While observing her, you notice something on her left wrist. (A bracelet? Why would she\u2026.) You thoughts are interrupted by Amy stomping towards the men. You disappear and reappear to the side and watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome men ran, others fought back in vain, and a few just waited for it all to be over. You look on as she stomps, crushes, and obliterate most of them. One stomp had wiped out fifteen percent. Another twenty percent were crushed in her hand. You said. (You notice something off?) He said. (What?) You said. (She moving faster than most. And her strength is stronger than normal. Her stomp left a crater in the ground.) (Interesting\u2026..) You said. While observing, a guy who looks to be in his thirty\u2019s comes next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCigarette? He offered. You know those kill you. You said. If not these, it\u2019s them. One last drag? He said. Hold that. You said before disappearing and reappearing on Amy\u2019s shoulder. Easy. Spot to hit. Right there. You said. With your hand balled into a fist, you hit her right at the spot on her neck. Ugh! She said. The blow you delivered to her pressure made her topple over and you land right in front of the man. Wow\u2026.. He said. Enjoy your cig. You said as you leave. You walk out of the arena and disappear. </span></div></div>",

(Not like they could do anything.) You said. You walk through the city. As you do, you hear whispers, and mumbling. And guys move out of your way when they walk beside you. One guy ran the other direction when he saw you coming. \u2026..Was it something I said? You said. You keep going until you come to the edge of the city. \u2026..You\u2019ve been following me since I left. You said. And yet, you let me. He said. Because you know I\u2019ll kill you faster than those cigarettes you smoke. You said, turning around. See you got out the arena alive. You said. Thought it\u2019d be my last in there. Then you lay out that brat. He said. It\u2019s not the first time one of them fell in that arena. How\u2019d you think Kyle got where he is? You said. Kyle? So that\u2019s his name. He said. You didn\u2019t run or step aside when you saw me. So I take it you need something? You said. How\u2019d you do it? He said. I just hit her on the pressure point in the neck. Solid blow there and you\u2019re out cold. You said. To move that fast and be strong. Are you with the army? He said. Army? No. I haven\u2019t seen them. You said. Not with the army? So how\u2019d you become\u2026..like this. He said. I\u2019m not with Kyle if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at. You said. Sooo\u2026.. He said. Let\u2019s just say\u2026. I have experience dealing with giant, rampaging girls. You said. You\u2019ve\u2026..done this before? He said. A lot. It\u2019s not as difficult as you think. You said. Easy for you to say. He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know you didn\u2019t just follow me so you can ask questions like that. What is that you really want? You said. Seeing you down that girl\u2026\u2026 Even though I just met you, I have this feeling of being by your side. He said. What makes you feel like that? You said. I don\u2019t know\u2026.. Maybe you\u2019re good company. Or maybe some of that power will rub off on me. He said. If that\u2019s the case\u2026.. We need to be on a first name basis. (Insert name here.) You said. Arif. He said. Arif\u2026.. You said. (A new friend in this world of terror. Misery loves company.) He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you seem to know this place better than I do. What\u2019s the story here? You said. This city is the last place a men are free. He said. That explains the heavy military presence. They know that kyle and his army of preteens and maybe teens will come knocking. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to let them surrender. You said. Good thing I have another place to stay. He said. Found a nice one? You said. A bit of a stretch on nice, but she\u2019s better than how most of the girls act. You? He said. I\u2019m still keeping an eye on her. She says she\u2019s not going to do anything or use me, but I\u2019d be a fool to trust her word at face value. You said. Don\u2019t blame you. With how things are going to get, better that way. He said. As you two chat, you see multiple military trucks pull up and soldiers get with guns pointed. Uh-oh. The jar heads are here. You said. You! You will come with us! One of the soldiers said. I\u2026.think he\u2019s talking to you. Arif said. Can\u2019t be. I think it\u2019s you. You said. You disappear and attack the soldiers. You reappear with your boot on the sergeant\u2019s neck. Because I don\u2019t take kindly to a person with a gun to my head. You said. Arif picks up the gun. A nice gun too. He said. F\u2026.First that asshole. Now you\u2026.? Can\u2019t catch a break. He said. Got ten seconds to talk before I break your neck. You said. Ok! Ok! The general wants to speak with you. He said. General? You said. General of the army. Or what\u2019s left of it. Arif said. What does he want? You said. He wants to talk about you working with together. He said. For what? You said. Keeping those girls from destroying the last city. He said. So this is the last city. Arif. Is it that bad? You said. Once this place falls, all the men here go into slavery to the women. He said. Think it\u2019s worth the headache? You said. Couldn\u2019t hurt to listen to him. I know the staging area of the army. He said. You knock out the soldier. Can you drive one of these heaps? You said. Use to hijack these things. He said. You hop into the back and Arif drives to the staging area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long drive, the truck comes to a stop. You hop out to the sight of multiple guns pointed at you and Arif. Take it this is the welcoming committee. You said. Seems like it. Can you pull what you did in the arena again? Be helpful right now. He said. Raise you one better. You said. You stomp the ground and it shakes violently, making the soldiers fall over. Let\u2019s go. You said. As you both head inside, you spot an antenna. This seems important. You know the jokers better than I do. What is this? You said. Seems like\u2026.some sort of projector. I\u2019ll look at this. You go on ahead. Arif said. You head deeper inside and kick open the officer\u2019s door. Jesus! The general said. You sent truck loads of soldiers after me gen. You better have a good reason for it. You said. So\u2026. You are the one who survive the arena. He said. And you\u2019re too old to be leading an army. What the fuck do you want? You said. Alright. Down to it then. I heard you can lay these girls out cold. He said. Point, general. You said annoyed. Help us take the ward off those monsters. He said. So kyle is coming for this city. You said. We don\u2019t know when they are coming. Usually the ground shaking beneath us is an indicator. By that time, it\u2019s too late. He said. And that has what to do with me? You said. If what people say are true about you so far, you can help us defend our city. He said. Come now, gen. Being a slave ain\u2019t that bad. You said. Your jokes are poor. Look. This place falls and every man here is sentenced to a life worse than death. I can\u2019t be your only option, gen. You telling me no girl has defected to helping your cause? You said. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have any female allies, but compared to how many that want us dead or in chains, our backs are against the wall. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo nothing hurts them? Gunfire, missiles, rockets, tanks, all that. Nothing? You said. If it did, you think we\u2019d be this far back? A nuke? You said. Only thing we did with that idea was wipe ourselves out. We have no options left. We either fight, or surrender in shackles. He said. Let me see what I can do. You said before leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFound out what that thing does? You said. Had to break a bone or two, but that thing sends out a frequency. He said. To? You said. This isn\u2019t the last city, but the last stand for the army. Apparently, they built an underground city. He said. Is that even possible? You said. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Signal goes out, and the route to the underground opens. Shock and awe tactics will be a decoy to keep the girls at bay while the city evacuates. He said. So if the city is empty, then there would be no fun in toppling it. Why rampage in a city with no one there. You said. So we\u2019re helping? He said. We aren\u2019t incline to. Not like we\u2019re with them anyway. In fact, I see an opportunity. You said. Opportunity? He said. You took a photo of that thing? You said. Multiple. He said. Give them to me. In the coming days, keep low and out of sight. You said. You take the photos and disappear. Have a hunch he\u2019s off to make a killing\u2026.. Arif said.</span></div></div>",

I have something you want to see. You said. You show him the photos. What is this? He said. Antenna array. Sends out a signal that opens up a path to a suppose underground city. You said. Another one? They just don\u2019t know when to quit! He said. So it\u2019s true? You said. More than you know. So how does this happen? He said. Once your army gets there, that antenna will broad cast a frequency to the underground city. Shock and awe tactics will keep your army preoccupied, while the city evacuates. You said. So by the time they get to the city, it will be empty. He said. Right. And where\u2019s the fun in rampaging if the city is empty? You said. Can\u2019t let them get away with this. But I have no body on the inside\u2026.. Except\u2026.. He said. Who? Me? Naw. You don\u2019t trust a man, do you? You said. I saw what you did in the arena. Quite frankly, I was surprised as everyone else. I know where this goes, but if you can use those skills of yours for me\u2026. He said. You don\u2019t expect something for nothing, do you? You said. What do you want in return? He said. Give me some cash, and I\u2019ll take care of that antenna. You said. How much? He said. I say ten thousand is enough. You said. Done. He said. Then we have a deal. When can your army be there? You said. No more than 10 minutes. Be done in 2. You said before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear outside and head back to the city. You head back to the city and into the army base. You see the antenna and make sure no one is looking. You hold out your hand and a purple energy forms and you blast it to pieces. As the explosion rings out, you disappear and reappear some distance away. You wait a few minutes before the ground starts to shake. So that\u2019s his army. His goons, 10 preteens, and 7 teens. Child\u2019s play. You said. (They aren\u2019t going to forget you sold them out.) He said. You wait and hour before returning to kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNice victory out there. A little one sided if you ask me. You said. Good thing I didn\u2019t. Here\u2019s your blood money. He said. You take it. A pleasure doing business. You said before disappearing. Deal with him one way or another\u2026.. Kyle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back to the city and see the damage done. Got to admit. Those girls do good work. You said. (I feel you like them better than me. They get to rampage and kill the populace, but I don\u2019t.) He said. (That\u2019s because that\u2019s how things are here. There\u2019s a point to there killing. You kill to kill.) You said. (I see no difference.) He said. You look around and see the death and destruction. Blood stains, crushed cars, destroyed building\u2026. Godzilla and his family were here. You said. So this was the opportunity you spoke of. Arif said. More or less. You said. And the money? He said. Ten grand. Here. You said. You hand him the wad of cash. Why are you giving this to me? He said. Hopefully to start a new life. Get the hell out of this place. You said. And you? He said. I got more than enough money on hand. You said. Is it a good idea to take blood money? He said. Won\u2019t do me any good. You said. Money from selling out? Now I see why you said lay low. He said. Yeah. Let\u2019s meet in a few days once this calms down. You said. You disappear and reappear at the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFucking trashed this place. Jarheads didn\u2019t stand a chance. You said. As you look at the damage done, you felt the ground shake. Oh boy. You said. You balance yourself as the shaking gets more intense. You see a giant teen. (Great\u2026.) He said. (She seems to be looking for something. Survivors maybe.) You said. (Nobody survives destruction of this magnitude.) He said. She was looking frantically through the rubble. (Looking for survivors.) You said. Damnit! How could this happen?! She said. As she searches, her gaze fall on you. You! She said. (Uh-oh.) You said. (Public enemy number one.) He said. She storms over to you. (Wait. That bracelet again. What\u2019s up with that thing?) You thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turncoat! These men were counting on you and you turn your back! She said. To be a turncoat, I need to be aligned with them. I wasn\u2019t. So take your venom and horrid breath elsewhere. You said. You\u2026..! What was it? Money? Fame? A pardon? She said. What I do is my business.  I don\u2019t need to explain myself to someone like you. Now go back to\u2026..whatever you were doing. You said. I wouldn\u2019t be doing this if it wasn\u2019t for you! She said. Not my fault they couldn\u2019t defend themselves. If you cared so much, you should had fought and died here. You said. You heartless\u2026.! She said. Now that I look at you\u2026. You look like that girl from that movie. Come to think of it, you\u2019re almost a spitting image of her. Face and all, expect you have some sort of combat clothes. What was her name? She was such a Mary Sue that I didn\u2019t I didn\u2019t even take time to remember. Started with an R. Whatever. You want to start something you can\u2019t finish? You said. If you fought instead of talked, the men here would be alive and free! She said. Their battle, not mine. They lose, and are now prizes for the enemy. You said. You inconsiderate asshole! You should have died in that arena. She said. Is that a mistake you\u2019re going to rectify? You said. I couldn\u2019t save the living\u2026. But I\u2019ll give the dead the peace of knowing the person who sold them out died! She said. Take that as a yes. You said. You disappear and hit her in the stomach and broke multiple ribs. Agh\u2026..! She said. She knees over and clutches her midsection. You then punch her in the face, knocking her down and out. You reappear on the ground. That girl from that awful movie was a Mary Sue, but you\u2019re not. You said before leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop when you get to Mira\u2019s house. You head through the window and reappear on her dresser just as she comes in. Oh. You\u2019re back. She said. Is that a problem? You said. No. I\u2019m actually glad. She said. \u2026\u2026Hmph. You said. Mira comes over and places her hand next to you. Really? You said. Come on. You should know me by now. She said. Hand on your knife, you step onto her hand and she lifts you to her face. Still not use to holding a guy in my hand. She said. What are you planning, giant? You said.  I just want to...</span></div></div>",

It\u2019ll help you trust me. I\u2019ll even tell you something about me, if it helps. She said. \u2026..Alright. Fine. You said. (You\u2019re not actually going to give her information about you?) He said. (What do you think?) You said. You ask first. She said. Do you rampage like those other girls? You said. No. I\u2019m not heartless. She said. (So she says.) You thought. Ok. Uh\u2026. How did you get like this? She said. Like this? You said. You know, strong and fast? She said. Came from a lab. You said. A lab? She said. Yeah. Have you killed? You said. No! Why would I do that? I\u2019m not one of those preteens. I have a conscious. She said. Not even one? You said surprised. No. I don\u2019t see a lot of you guys, but the ones I do see are terrified. She said. (You believe that shit?) He said. (At face value? No way.) You said. What about you? Have you killed? She said. No. Don\u2019t have a reason to. You said. Oh. Ok. She said. Before you could ask your question, Miley\u2019s voice rings out. Mira! She said. Miley comes in. Are you done with him? I want to play with him. She said. You have to ask him. And don\u2019t make it sound like he\u2019s a toy. Mira said. Sorry. Do you want to play, little brother? Miley said. (Best to get it over with.) \u2026..Sure.  You said. You disappear and reappear on Miley\u2019s shoulder. Ohhhh! Do it again! She said astounded. Don\u2019t be rough with him. Mira said. I\u2019ll be gentle with him. Miley said. She walks out. *Sigh* He still doesn\u2019t trust me. I can hear it in his voice. Mira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley takes you to her room and sits on her bed.  (From what I\u2019ve seen of her, she\u2019s energetic.) You thought. You notice he was quiet\u2026..for once. (No comment on her?) You said. He said nothing. (Are you serious? Has this girl captured your attention?) You said. Heh heh heh! You\u2019re cute! She said. Miely brings you to her mouth and starts kissing you. Ugh! You said. Even other kiss, she would tell you how cute you were. When she stops, she lifts up your mask a little, but you stop her. Come on! Can\u2019t I get a look? I know you showed Mira. She said. (\u2026..Do it.) He said. (Are you serious? Now you decided to speak?) You said. (I said do it.) He said. You feel your power rising. (He\u2019s\u2026.found a way to leak some of his energy out. The seal should prevent that. If he can do that\u2026..) You said. You quickly take off your mask and your power dies down. When Miley saw your face, she gasp at the state of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nY\u2026..your face! I\u2026.it\u2019s covered in scars! She said. Why do you think I have one? You said. Without saying a word, Miley gets up and walks to the medicine cabinet in the bathroom. She grabs the peroxide and rips off a small piece of cotton ball and dips it. Hold still. She said. She lightly rubs your face. Even wounds you sustain heal instantly, having them doctored makes you feel like you\u2019re still partly human. She rubs your face a few more times before stopping. How\u2019s that? She said tenderly. \u2026..Better. You said. How\u2019d you get those? She said. In a fight. I lost\u2026. Badly. You said. Who was it!? She said. I\u2019ve dealt with him. But\u2026.. Why did you turn all\u2026.. motherly? You said. You\u2019re my little brother, aren\u2019t you? So why wouldn\u2019t I take care of you? She said. But\u2026. We aren\u2019t related by blood. You said. So? You agreed to be my little brother. So that means I have to look out for you. She said. (Yeah. Nothing like having a giant watching over me.) The scars aren\u2019t the only reason I wear this\u2026. You said, putting your mask back on. I\u2019ve lost\u2026.a lot. And I\u2019m not ready to deal with it. You said. I\u2019ll help you deal with it. I don\u2019t like it when my little brother is hurt. She said. \u2026\u2026I\u2019ll be fine. Plus\u2026. The things I\u2019ve went through\u2026..you wouldn\u2019t understand. You said. Is it bad stuff? She said. Compared to the girls I\u2019ve seen, I\u2019m a saint\u2026\u2026 Mostly. \u2026\u2026sorry. I\u2019ve got to cut this play date short. You said, disappearing. You reappear in M district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan\u2019t run from my problems\u2026.. You said. (Wherever you go, there you are.) He said. (What was that back there? Where you fascinated by her or something?) You said. (N\u2026..No! Why would I be interested? I\u2019ve got bigger things to worry about that some preteen.) He said. Speaking of teen\u2026. You said. You look to see that teen from yesterday. Ah. Mary Sue. What\u2019s she doing this time? You said. She runs off and you follow her. You follow her a long way when she goes a building. You head inside as well and look for her, but she\u2019s gone. Where did she go? This is just an ordinary house. You said. You felt the ground beneath you move. But not like shaking. Like it was coming up. You disappear and reappear at a safe distance. You see her come out of a hatch. Shit. This Sue has an underground. What\u2019s she hiding? You said. As she opens it, you run and jump down as the hatch closes. Now let\u2019s find her secret. You said. You follow the path and come across an underground city. Whoa\u2026. This must be what Kyle meant. Seems like some did get away. Or were rescued and taken here. You said. You see military supplies and the works. Tanks, vehicles, and personal. With some civilians mixed in. This has Mary Sue written all over. So that\u2019s why she was looking for men. To bring them here. You said. You pull out your phone and take a few pictures. Kyle will pay a fortune for this information. Get out the same way I came in. You said. Ass you put your phone up, you\u2019re grabbed and lifted up. (Shit. She\u2019s back.) You thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you doing here!? She said. It\u2019s a free country, Sue. Well for me it is. I go where I please. You said. You insensitive asshole! She said. Dial it back some, Sue. Don\u2019t think I won\u2019t bury you with this city. You said. You wouldn\u2019t dare! She said. Keep insulting me, and the elites will be the least of your problems. You said. I can\u2019t believe this! You\u2019d sell out your own? Again? For what? Money? What good will that do you? She said. I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s your concern. Like the rest of the girls out there, I do what I want, when I want. So if I want to give up the location of this city to kyle for some monetary gain, that\u2019s me. And you know what will happen to this city. But you? Ohhh. You\u2019re going to be made an example of. You said. You\u2026.. You\u2019d condemn these men to an eternity of slavery? She said. Depends if Kyle wants it. Or this entire place buried. As long as he pays. You said. You\u2026. You\u2019re no hero. You\u2019re just some\u2026\u2026mercenary! Profiting off other people\u2019s suffering! She said. And you\u2019re about to suffer if you don\u2019t put me down. No. I won\u2019t have you deny these men their freedom. If I have to kill you, then I will. She said. This underground is your grave, Sue. You said. You power free and land on the ground. Better be a good fighter than talker! You said.</span></div></div>",

Guess I didn\u2019t hit hard enough. You said. She struggle to get up, but only gets to her knees. Still want to go? You said. T\u2026.tell me\u2026..

She said. Morality doesn\u2019t pay the bills. Benjamin does. You said. All the cash in the world-ugh! Won\u2019t mean anything\u2026..when you\u2019re in that prison\u2026.. She said. Talk all you want. I got a check to cash. And you made the mistake of getting in my way. You said. You hold out your hand and a purple energy builds. Her eyes go wide as you build up power. Never get between a man\u2019s paycheck. Before you could fire, someone holds your arm down. What are you doing? He said. Arif? You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho else? What are you doing here? He said. In town. Saw this Mary Sue being all suspicious and followed her to find out she has an underground city under her house. You said. Mary Sue? You mean Ashley? He said. Whatever her name is. You said. You know this person? Ashley said to Arif. He\u2019s\u2026..a friend of mine. He said. Your friend was going to give up this place. She said. Keyword was. Not if you\u2019re  staying here, Arif. You said. Actually, I\u2019m not. Sort of taken against my will. He mutters. Sooo\u2026.? You said. I\u2019ll stay for now. He said. You delete the pictures on your phone. You said. What happen to that paycheck? She said. Something\u2019s came up. You trust this one? You mutter. \u2026..She\u2019s good company. He said. \u2026\u2026Alright. Lucky day, Sue. You said. You disappear and reappear outside and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you cut the ruins of the city, you look at the destruction. Got to say, they are efficient. You said. You stop and look around. (What\u2019s the delay?) he said. (She\u2019s here.) You said. What do you want, brat? You said. I don\u2019t know how you knocked me out in the arena, but it won\u2019t happen again! Amy said. Go home, Amy. You said. I\u2019m not going anywhere. She said. You turn around. What do you want, kid? Don\u2019t you have dolls to play with? Or are the men you torture in that prison not enough? You said. I left someone in my place. Right now, I have an obligation to bring you to heel or under my heel. She said. Take me in\u2026. Or take me down. You real think you can? You said. You got lucky last time! You blindsided me! Now it\u2019s just you and me. She said. And you think your chances are better\u2026.. Heh. Go home, Amy. Your friends are worried about you. You said. You turn your back and walk away. Coward! She said. What was that? You said, coming to a stop. You heard me. Coward! You know as well as I do that you can\u2019t beat me. The only reason you walked out of that arena was because I was preoccupied. And you know you can\u2019t do it again. She said. \u2026..Heh. Goading? Nice try, Amy. I\u2019ve already proves my point. Waste of time and energy to fight you. Now go\u2026.do whatever it is you elites usually do. You said. You disappear and reappear back at Mira\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head through the window and sat on the couch arm. (Been around for a couple of days and already making enemies.) You said. (You say that as if it\u2019s a bad thing.) He said. (Isn\u2019t it?) You said. (Not for me.) He said. You look at the tv to see a broadcast of Kyle. You hear him talk about changes made to that prison. So all men are now restricted to living in that prison. Going overboard in my opinion. You said. (Makes some sense. Keep them all in one place. Easy to regulate them.) He said. (It\u2019s big enough to hold them. And I don\u2019t the women and girls there will let the men know a single day of peace.) You said. (It\u2019s perfect. Think about it in the long run. Round up all the men. Educate them that women are superior. Break there spirts. Kill the dissidents. Reward the faithful ones. All men will willingly serve females until the end of time. It\u2019s the perfect plan.) He said. (But that\u2019s just for men. What about girls like Ashley? She seems steadfast in her resolve.) You said. (That prison isn\u2019t just for men. Like I said. Educate that women are superior. That goes for both men and rogue women.) He said. (Now I see what you mean. Make men see that there is no hope for them other than serving women and their lives become easier. And the rouge women will be reeducated. I doubt they would execute a woman.) You said. (They wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d become a martyr. An example for others rogues to follow.) He said. (And us?) You said. (Like hell I\u2019m going to serve another. Giant or not.) He said. (If life wasn\u2019t bad enough for them, it\u2019s going to get a whole lot worse now.) You said. As you continue to watch, you see Mira come in, wearing a white bra and panties. (Damn. She\u2019s got it all. Breast bigger than mountains, legs that go on for days, an ass that jiggles when she walks. 100/10.) He said. (You\u2019re a perv.) You said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you are. I was wondering where you were. She said. Why? Do you need to servitude or something? You said. No. I heard the master\u2019s speech. And my heart sank when I thought of you. She said. Didn\u2019t know you cared. You said. I keep telling you I do. I don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t believe me. She said. Because words are hollow. Actions speak louder. You said. If I wanted to do something to you, I would have done it by now. She said. Yet. You haven\u2019t done something yet. You said. And I don\u2019t plan on it. She said. Time will tell. What do you want? You said. I wanted to know if you\u2019re tired or anything. She said. What are you, my mom? You said. It\u2019s just a question. No need to be a jerk. She said. \u2026\u2026I wouldn\u2019t mind a bath. You said. Mira places her hand next to you. You walk onto her hand and she carries you to the bathroom. She places down and runs warm water in the sink. Ok. I\u2019ll check on you later. She said. She leaves you alone in the bathroom. (Yeah. I\u2019m the perv. Told you that ass jiggles.) He said. You take off your clothes and mask and jump into the water. You wash yourself and clean your clothes. Once you\u2019re done, you get out and put your clothes and mask back on just as Mira comes in. Are you done? She said. Yeah. I\u2019m good. You said. Mira lets the water out and you appear on her shoulder. She walks to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo are you going to take me from my sleeping spot again? You said. You were tossing and turning in your sleep. I thought you were having a bad dream, so I placed you on my pillow and you calmed down. She said. So is that where I\u2019m sleeping tonight? You said. If you want to. She said. (She\u2019d just do the same again.) You thought. You climb onto her pillow and go to sleep. Mira lays down a few feet from you. She looks at you for a few seconds and covers you with her hand. When you felt something on you, you grip your knife, but saw it was Mira\u2019s hand. What are you doing? You said. Covering you. She said. (Makeshift blanket.) You said. It takes a while, but you fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

Arif! You said. You search the destroyed city and come across a few bodies, but they aren\u2019t Arif. You search the city up and down, but can\u2019t find him. Damn. He\u2019s not here. You said. (If he\u2019s not here, that means he\u2019s at one place.) He said. The prison. You said. Before you could leave, the ground shakes, violently. Fuck. That can\u2019t be good. Just as I thought. Came running. A voice said. You turn to face Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour work? You said. Yeah. I\u2019m pretty proud. Had to kill a few, but they all surrendered. She said. And took them to that prison. You said. You catch on fast. All of your kind have been moved there. Where they will learn their rightful place. She said. (Arif won\u2019t break. He\u2019ll ask for death.) And you think that applies to me? You said. Every single male on earth. Including you. She said. You think you can take me? While wearing a bikini? You said. I know I can. Last time was a fluke, and you know it. Now it\u2019s just you and me. She said. And you think I\u2019m going to fight you? You said. That, or you could bend the knee and give up. She said. Keep dreaming brat. Now beat it. You said. Oh, no. There\u2019s only one way out of here. She said. And it\u2019s through us. A voice said. You turn your head to see luna behind you. (They aren\u2019t the only ones. The other three are here.) He said. You turn your head to see the whole elites are here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouldn\u2019t challenge me yourself. Had to get your friends. You said. Not ashamed to admit it. She said. You really want this to happen. You said. That\u2019s on you. She said. (What are you planning?) He said. (Arif is somewhere in that prison. Killing these bitches won\u2019t be a problem, but I\u2019ll lose my ticket inside.) You said. (You mean?) He said. (First time for everything.) You said. (No there\u2019s not.) He said. \u2026\u2026Fine, brat. You got me. You said, holding your hands up. You were handcuffed and taken to the prison. Your knife and clothes, and mask, were taken. You were given a white uniform and some kind of collar with red lights. You where tossed inside a cell. A bed, tv, and radio. Doubt the three hots. You said. You look to see guards outside your cell alone. Heh. Guards. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the ground and take your disable the collar\u2019s alarm and take it off. You bide your time until you see two guards come to your cell. Hey! Get up! He said. You get up and head out the cell. Move! He said. You follow the guards to the arena and are directed to the stands. (Place is usually used for fights. What\u2019s going on today?) You thought. You see someone point you out and the men look at you. A few that were close to you backed away out of fear. When you looked at one, he ran right out of the stands. (Did I say something?) You thought. As you turn your attention back center, you come see Amy in the arena, along with men in the there as well. (It\u2019s an execution. These men are about to die.) He said. (Must have done something wrong. Kyle\u2019s not here. Though he\u2019d be here to see this.) You said. Alright slaves! You have been brought here to watch these pathetic fools, who tried to escape, crushed under my feet! She said. (As much as I love watching death sentences\u2026.. I\u2019m not to keen on this.) He said. You quickly observe the men. (Nope. None of them are Arif.) You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy raised her gigantic foot in the air. You wondered why the males didn\u2019t try to run, when you saw the looks in their eyes. (They\u2019ve completely given up. On hope and emotions.) You thought. You watch as amy\u2019s foot came down on them all. She grinded them into the hard ground to make sure they were dead. You heard cheering from around the arena as the men\u2019s lives were snuffed out. The men in the stands were horrified. Amy looks at you and the others. This is the fate of any insects who try to escape from this chamber! Resist the rules, and die! You pitifully race will follow our every command to the T, or have fun being crushed into paste like these idiots were! You all are going to learn that you belong to us now, and any one of you thinks that males are capable of anything more than serving can forget it. You will learn your rightful place. Particularly one of you in the stands right now! She said. (Call me out all you want. That\u2019s your breath you\u2019re wasting.) You thought. You get up and head back to your cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there for a while until someone comes to your cell. Get up! Hell\u2019s waiting for you. He said. Hell? You mean doing the bidding of one of those enforcers? Pass. You said. Like you have a choice. Get your ass up now! He said. As he grab you, you push his arm away and punch him hard that it sent him through multiple walls. \u2026\u2026Asshole. You said, sitting back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the time goes, you formulate a plan of finding Arif. I\u2019ll wait until night. Less foot traffic. Can find him and bust out of here. You said. As you plan, you notice someone at your cell. \u2026..What do you want, giant? You said. You\u2019re needed in the medical wing. She said. You turn your head to look. (A lab coat, Purple hair, massive D\u2019s and round ass. She\u2019s a scientist.) You said. (Oh, hell no! I\u2019m not getting dissected and examined!) He said. (Wait. We can use this.) You said. (How?) He said. (She\u2019s an egghead. She\u2019s probably one of few who built those bracelets we\u2019ve been seeing. Maybe she has the blueprints of those things.) You said. (So use this nerd to get nice things?) He said. (Play the cards right, and we turn one of Kyle\u2019s drones for us.) You said. (\u2026..If I end up on a table.) He said. (Yeah, yeah. You and your irrational fear of a scalpel.) You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..Do I come back with my arms and legs attached? You said. Body parts stay where they are. This is a routine check up. She said. (Straight lie. They would send a doctor. But I wouldn\u2019t trust the doctors in this place.) You thought. Fine. You said. You disappear and reappear on her shoulder. You saw her blush, but don\u2019t pay much attention to it. Such a cute little guy\u2026.. She mutters. You say something? You said. N\u2026No! She said. </span></div></div>",

You jump down on the counter as she gets a few items. Ok. I need a blood sample. She said. For? You said. Like I said, standard procedure check up. She said. (Lady can\u2019t lie to save her life. She wants to cut me up.) You thought. You let her take some blood from you. Ok. Now a pulse check. She said. She takes and records your heartbeat. She does more routine things for the next 10 minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. Everything seems in order with you. She said. So I can go now? You said. Not yet. Even though we don\u2019t name the men here, I prefer it for my clients. She said. You give her a fake name and leave. You cut through an empty cafeteria, when the door you open closes. Oh. Your that blackguard I knocked through the wall. You said. You think you can just do whatever you want? He said. Damn right I can. Now get lost. You said. I\u2019m not going anywhere. You need a hard lesson about where you stand. He said. And you\u2019re going to do that by yourself? You said. Not just me. Every man here is here for life, but I talked to our masters about you and they\u2019ve agreed. Teach you a lesson, and we get to live an easy life. He said. Teach me a lesson, and you and your goons get to live on easy. You said. Strength in numbers fucker. Get him! He said. As the men around you charge, there was a flash and all the men are lying dead with holes in their chest area. You roll your eyes and head back to your cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nighttime comes, you get up from your bed. You head to the bars and pry them open and look for Arif. You look in each cell for him, but can\u2019t find him. You head down some stairs and pass through the cafeteria. You reach the medical wing and find the room you were examined in and saw a report. You take a look at the reports. \u201cSubject showed disdain, but no malice. From the few minutes with him, he is cynical and makes crude jokes. From the blood I got from him, the cells multiply endlessly, but in a controlled way until they reach the subject\u2019s body. After subject left, test one started. Subject killed all the men after his head in less than a second. The bodies of the men all had holes in their chests the size of a fist. Subject didn\u2019t even move to harm them. Further testing is recommended.\u201d It said. You look some more and find a personal note. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have taken this gig. I don\u2019t share the views of my colleagues or the girls who operate this prison. I can\u2019t bring my myself to kill one of them. They are too cute to me to do that. I look at one and, all I want to do is hold and cuddle them. Let them know that there are some good ones out there. Yet I stand by and watch as these men suffer. Being cruel is one thing, but apathic\u2026. That\u2019s a sentence to the deepest parts of hell. Right next to traitors and turncoats. Now I\u2019m to do an assessment of a man who has the potential power to kill all of us. The power to bring down this perfect world they set up for themselves. Personal, I hope he does. We all have sins to answer for. Even me\u201d It said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Seems like we found another one with a conscious.) You said. (A scientist with a conscious? That don\u2019t sound right. Aren\u2019t they an ends justify the means type of people?) He said. (Guess we lucked out.) You said. You leave and continue looking for Arif, but came up empty. Damn. Not here. Not even in the arena. You said. You head back to your cell and don\u2019t get a wink of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, you get up and head out of your cell. You go to the cafeteria area and take a seat on the far end. (This crap they serve is unhealthy.) He said. (Like you said, good thing we don\u2019t need food that much.) You said. You sit there for a while until you notice some of men get up and come over to you. Is there a problem here? You said. Yeah. Ever since you came along, things have only gotten- I\u2019m going to stop you right there. My being here hasn\u2019t upset the balance here. Now park your ass back where it belongs. That\u2019s some real tough talk from- you grab him, sit him down, and rammed a knife through his hand, pinning him to the table. Holy shit! One of them said. You look at his collar and mess with it. No! That will- An alarm rings out from the collar, and Amy comes barging in. By the time she arrives, you were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back to your cell when you notice someone waiting for you. (The girls no older than 13. The hell she\u2019s doing wearing dominatrix latex?) You thought. Hey! Slave! She said. You point to yourself. Anyone else? You\u2019re wanted in the arena. She said. You sigh and head to the arena. When you get there, you find your stuff. My clothes. And knife. You said. You take off the uniform and put your clothes and mask on and sheathe your knife. That\u2019s better. You said. You head inside the arena to see no one, but that scientist lady in the audience stands. Then the heavy metal doors open and a preteen came stomping out and let out a monstrous roar. Uh-oh. You said. She came charging at you. You disappear and reappear near her face and hit her right on the forehead. The force of the punch sends her crashing into the wall. You land on the ground and look at the scientist. She\u2019s smiling at you. Thank goodness\u2026.. She said. You head out the arena and back to your cell.</span></div></div>",

They actually eat the prisoners if they don\u2019t perform up to expectation. You said. (Not just that. A variety of things. No wonder these guys bend the knee so quickly.) He said. You saw a group of slaves enter a massive room and followed. You enter the room and see all of the enforcers and the elites. Oh this is gold. They are sitting on thrones. Like they are the gods of Olympus. You said. (I wouldn\u2019t mind a throne.) He said. And if that\u2019s not bad enough, the clowns are on their knees worshiping them. You said.

What do you- She\u2019s gone. You said. (Just so you know, I don\u2019t do favors.) He said. You left your cell and went to the caf\u00e9. When you got there, you took a seat. Hey! That\u2019s my- Oh God! He said. You turn your head to him. I\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t know! You can have the seat! He said, terrified. He runs off and so do most of the men at the table. (I love the look of fear on people\u2019s faces.) He said. You saw the doors fling open and Amy comes in. Where is he!? She said. (Us?) You said. (Who else?) He said. I said where is he!? Amy shouted. Some men left the cafeteria, and a few others point you out, and she comes your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, this day just got better! She said. What do you want, Amy? You said. For starters, that\u2019s not how you talk to your betters. She said. Deflate that head of yours. It\u2019s coming off your shoulders. You come to gloat or something? You said. I did. With you here, this shows that no man can stand against us! She said. Whatever helps you sleep at night, bitch. Go\u2026.play with your dolls or something. You bother me. You said. What\u2019d did you say!? She said. I said you bother me. Now scram! You said. This guy has balls. One of the men said. Who is this guy? Another said. You still don\u2019t get it. She said. That you and every girl here has a god complex? We all get that. Keep playing god, and see what happens. You said. And what would that be? She said. Your world shatters. Just like your ribs will if you don\u2019t get lost. You said. Is that a threat to a superior? She said. Amy suddenly felt a sharp pain in her stomach. Ugh! She said as she falls on her knees. You land on the ground as the men around you stand stunned. Ho\u2026.holy shit\u2026.. One said. This guy\u2019s insane! Another said. Y\u2026.you\u2026..! You are so dead\u2026..! She said. Say that when you regain your dignity. Embarrassed you twice. First the arena, now here. I expected more from you. Since you nickname is \u201cThe beast\u201d You said. I\u2019ll\u2026..show you. I\u2019ll make you see it clear as day! She said. Take five. You said, hitting her on the head. Amy hits the ground with a thud. \u2026\u2026Brat. You said as you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day goes on, the prison is in an uproar as Amy is put in the medical wing. The enforcers and elites crack down on the prisoners. You sit in your cell. (The airheads are up in a panic.) You said. (What\u2019d you expect? You humiliated their best not once, but twice. Making a name for ourselves.) He said. (Not like I want to. These fucks might take it, but I\u2019m not. We knock people on their ass if they talked to us like that.) You said. (Why stop at knock? Really want to set them straight, kill one of them. They\u2019ll get the message, or line up to be next.) He said. (You make it sound so simple.) You said. As you sit there, some guards come to your cell. \u2026..Pick your words carefully. Could be your last. You said. Y\u2026\u2026you\u2019re wanted in\u2026..uh\u2026.uh\u2026.. One said. Medical. Another quickly said. Yeah. Medical. He said. You get up and the guards brace against the wall. You walk away and they breath a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to medical and see the scientist. Ah, you\u2019re here. We can get started. She said. \u2026\u2026Right. You said. She runs some scans of you and sticks some pads on you. After an hour of this, she takes them off and lets you go. Ok. I got everything.....i needed. She said. You look at one of her lab sheets and find out her name is Jessica. (Got a name for our mysterious scientist.) You thought. While your back was turn, Jessica was reaching for you, but pulled back when you turn your head. We done here? You said. Y\u2026.yeah. You can go\u2026.. She said.

(He\u2019s not here. We searched up and down this joint.) He said. (So\u2026. If he\u2019s not here. Then he\u2019s out here.) You said. (And if word got out that you\u2019re here, then he\u2019s planning a break in.) He said. (Breaking out is one thing, but in? That\u2019s a whole different game.) You said.

You head to medical and look at the notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInitial scans of subject\u2019s body showed no alteration to his skin, bone, muscle or brain. Aside from scaring, he was not under the knife. Test 3 was impromptu, but it confirmed my suspicion. Subject has the strength to knock out anyone. Test 4 was also impromptu, but the results were astronomical. Subject showed no fear in front of Amy. Even going as far as insulting and humiliating her. Test ended when he KO\u2019d Amy. Three broken ribs and a fractured skull. From the men who were questioned, they seem to fear him more than women. And none of them even seem to know who he is. No name. No friends. No family. Nothing. It\u2019s like he\u2026..came from a different world.\u201d It said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you find more personal notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore and more, I\u2019m finding myself drawn to him. I like the little guys, but him\u2026.. When I look at him\u2026..my heart throbs. I\u2026..want to take him away from here and hide him away. But they\u2019ll know it was me. They assign me to find out what makes him like this. The only thing I found out was that he\u2019s a special kind of man. My\u2026\u2026little man.\u201d It said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(We have an admirer.) He said. (Not the first time. Except this one towers over me.) You said. You head back to your cell and wait for morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came, you woke to the sound of shouting. Man. Who\u2019s getting it? You said. You go to the bars and see one of the enforcers come to your cell. (These girls have some sick fantasies. Wearing latex. They aren\u2019t even of age for that.) He said. (Pot calling the kettle black.) You said. (Hey! My fantasies only involve mass destruction and mayhem. Not some god complex.) He said. You need something, little girl? A whip? A gag? Some self-respect? You said. Rgh! Lucky day for you. You\u2019ve been pardon. She said. Pardon? On whose authority? You said. Who else, idiot? The master\u2019s authority. She said. (This can\u2019t be good. He wants something.) What\u2019s the catch? You said. He wants an audience with you. She said. (Knew it.) You thought. You step out of the cell and leave the prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Kyle has a plan in motion.) You said. (We were close to inciting a riot. We embarrassed their top monster, didn\u2019t do any of the re education, and spit in the faces of the enforcers. A riot\u2019s bound to happen.) He said. You head to the mansion and kick open the front door. Knock knock. You said. You walk through the mansion and see how he lives. Shit. This living room isn\u2019t anything to laugh at. And that dining room is nice. You said. (You see the fucking penguins here? Nothing inside their eyes. \u2026..The perfect servants for me.) He said. (Are you serious? What are you going to do with a mansion?) You said. (A summer house. All I need to do is decorate it with bodies.) He said. The hell are you doing here? A voice said. Ahh. Amy. Shouldn\u2019t you be on bed rest? It takes a while for broken ribs to heal. You said. I\u2019ll be fine. You won\u2019t be. She said. I sense a threat. You said. That\u2019s a promise. She said. Really? So you\u2019re ready for IFV and eating your food through a straw? You said. This time will be different! She said. Then you can have the first move. Shit, I\u2019ll even stand still for you. You said. Grrrr! I\u2019ll grind you into the dirt! She said. She comes at you, but comes to a halt and feels pain in her midsection. Then you punch her on the check. She gets sent into the wall and you punch her again in the gun and hear multiple ribs break. Ack! She said as she coughed up blood. She falls over just as you land on the ground. You give her a kick to the head. Trash\u2026.. You said before disappearing.</span></div></div>",

Tears ran down her checks as you try to calm her down. You tell her what happen and what you were doing there. You were looking for a friend? She said. Yeah. But he wasn\u2019t there. She said. Did they\u2026..do anything to you? I heard they run experiments on people there. She said. No. Like I\u2019d let them in the first place. You said. Mira sighs with relief. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re ok. She said. So you do care. You said. I keep telling you. How many more hoops do i have to jump through to prove that? She said. You can't just expect me to believe you like that. Think of it from my perceptive. Would you trust me right away if the size scale was reverse? You said. .....Fine. I'll keep proving to you that i care about you. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, you heard about a huge number of men escaped from that prison. Arif. You said. You disappear and reappear outside and head to the prison. They broke out during the day. So it must have been during roll call. Which means\u2026.. There. You said. You see a hole in the wall. Big enough to escape through. Seems like\u2026..some sort of explosive device. You said. You look for shrapnel, but find none. Must have been through. You said. (They couldn\u2019t have gotten far by themselves. M district is too far of a walk from here.) He said. (Right. They had help. A woman\u2019s help. Reports said it was about 50 to 100.) You said. (Had to be more than one. Even at that height, they can only hold so many in their hands.) He said. You look to see tire tracks. Fresh. This should lead me to them. You said. You follow the tire tracks to the ruins of m district and see the van and a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, look who it is. Mary sue. She must have helped, but not formulated this plan. You said. (Where do she plan to hide them in this dump?) He said. (Maybe they aren\u2019t hiding. Maybe they\u2019re going to rebuild. This is the only place for them.) You said. You scan from your spot and see Arif. There he is. You said. You disappear and reappear next to him. Arif! You said. Heh. And here I was going through with plan I spent making looking for you. He said. I was looking for you. After that underground city was trashed, I thought you were in that prison. You said. I left that underground city the first chance I got. I knew it was only time before they found it. Then I heard you were in that prison and I thought it was the perfect time for a jail break. He said. And the guys here? You said. Someone tipped off Ashley about what I was going to do. A simple in and out became something like a bank robbery. He said. That explains the hole I found. You said. IED. If you saw it, you\u2019d think that it wouldn\u2019t work at all. He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what does Mary sue and the men here plan on doing? You said. Talks of rebuilding this place. I think it\u2019s a waste of time. All cities get destroyed by those\u2026..monsters. He said. I doubt Kyle will let this stand. A prison escape is one thing, but rebuilding M district? What\u2019s next? The army? You said. That too. He said. The first one was taken out. What\u2019s going to be different this time? You said. Apparently, Ashley knows some other girls who are willing to stand up with them. He said. So Mary, the army, and however many of her friends\u2026.. Are going to oppose Kyle and his elites and army? You said. Basically. He said. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re getting involved? You said. Hell no. I know how this ends. You think I\u2019m ending up a stain on the ground? He said. A one man rescue attempt? You said. I\u2019m bold, not suicidal. Fighting\u2026..Kyle is suicidal. He said. Heh. So it wasn\u2019t just good looks as to why you\u2019re still alive. You said. If it was just down to looks, I\u2019d be in kyle\u2019s position. He said. Yeah. Getting fat off the luxury of easy street. You\u2019ll get soft. You said. Wouldn\u2019t mind a steak every now and then. And some\u2026.butlers. He said. Ok, kyle. You said. Don\u2019t compare me to him. I\u2019ll share the wealth. \u2026..Somewhat. He said. Somewhat? You said. 1/3 of the wealth. He said. Since you met him, you seen Arif smile for once. Heh. You said.</span></div></div>",

I heard a rumor that he\u2019s recruited an extremely dangerous girl. He said. Another Amy? You said. As the rumors go, she\u2019s worse than Amy and the enforcers combined. He said. And these rumors got started where? You said. Prison. She got the whole place back under control in minutes. All the riots and men not listening have stopped. He said. Really? Maybe I need to pay this one a visit. You said, disappearing. That\u2019s\u2026..what I was afraid of. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear at the prison and head inside. Now. Where is this dangerous girl? You said. You explore the prison, passing all the cells and guards, when you get to the empty cafeteria. Hm. Seems like I missed her. You said. You didn\u2019t. A voice said. I take it you\u2019re the one who got this place in order. You said. Not hard to brake their spirts. Even after what you did. They\u2019ve gone back to the husks they should be. She said. Well, good for you. You must really think I care about your accomplishments. You said. I don\u2019t. But I do care about the shift in the balance of power. Ever since you came along, it\u2019s tipped out of our favor. She said. And your problem is? You said. It\u2019s about to be solved right now. She said. You sense her presence is gone. (What the?) You thought. You disappear and reappear to the side as her fist hits the ground, leaving a small hole where you were standing. She attacks again, but you disappear and reappear to the left. (Her strength is unnatural. Leaving small crater in the ground with her fist?) You thought. You disappear and reappear next to the door as she misses you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t know the big bad man was a coward. She said. (She\u2019s faster and stronger than Amy. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m looking at a copy of me.) You thought. Come on. Are you just going to run? She said. (A carbon copy of ourselves\u2026.. I don\u2019t know if I should be impressed or insulted.) He said. (If this is a copy, insulted. This bitch could be stronger than me or you.) You said. (Someone stronger than me? Ha! That\u2019ll be the day.) He said. (You never know. Can\u2019t be number one forever.) You said. (\u2026\u2026.Kill this bitch. I will not be outdone by some cheap imitation of me!) He said. (Not yet\u2026.. I need\u2026.to make sure of something first.) You said. You take a step back. Really? All that fighting I heard about you, and you\u2019re going to back down? She said. You disappear and reappear outside the cafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly head to medical. If what I\u2019m thinking is true\u2026. You said. You look around and find a report. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSubject was willing to go through with the transfusion. Even though her blood type was the same, the chance of the blood eroding them is high. Subject\u2019s response was moving\u2026.or foolhardy. After the transfusion, subject was observed closely. First thing to show was a high regeneration of an wound. Cuts, bruises, lacerations. We wanted to try a limb, but the master shot that down. Next was the speed. Test was the recapture of slaves that we freed. Subject returned them within a minute. She didn\u2019t even move her legs. She vanished in thin air and was back with all the males. Third was the strength. This is a slow progression, but it showed in a mock fight between her and 3 other enforcers. No serious damage to the enforcers, but they should take the next few days off. Even though testing is far from complete, some of the other scientist are chalking this up to a success. A few of them say that it will be his end. \u2026..I hope and pray that it isn\u2019t.\u201d It said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I was right. I know I shouldn\u2019t have given that scientist my blood. They injected it into that girl and now, she\u2019s going to be like me. You said. (Go back and kill her.) He said. Wait. There\u2019s more to this. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPersonal note. My conscious will not let me hear the end of what I\u2019ve done. I didn\u2019t want to do it. I really wanted to destroy all my findings and research, but I couldn\u2019t. I had to continue and do more. For my own knowledge, sure, but\u2026.. What my colleges, elites, and the master have plan\u2026.. I won\u2019t get a wink of sleep. It gives me somewhat ease that I sent these findings to the men in m district. Hopefully, they find it useful before the master sicks his new dog on them.\u201d It said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo not only here, but the army has it as well. These finding need to go. I can\u2019t let them create more people with my powers. Kyle or the army. You said. You break the computer and destroy the reports and files and leave for m district.</span></div></div>",

Almost like no attack has happened here to begin with. But where is army HQ? You said. You follow one of the trucks to a base. Damn. These fuckers don\u2019t play. Already have an Army HQ. I need to get in there. You said. You see a soldier, knock him out and take his clothes. Best way in is to look like I belong. Not the first time I\u2019ve done this. You said. You walk up and into the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect\u2026. No one has even noticed me. Now, to find those files. You said. You look around and find them, along with a blueprint of the bracelets you\u2019ve been seeing. Seems like that scientist leaked more than she let on. Not only data on me, but how to make one of those bracelets. There\u2019s enough parts for one, but I think I can follow these instructions. You said. You follow the instructions closely and carefully until you have one that is an exact look a like. I prefer if it was an armband or something, but this will do for now. You said. You then burn the data about you and destroy the computer as well. You took the blueprint as well. Might need this for later. You said. Hey! What are you doing in here!? A soldier said. Acting quickly, you knock him out. Jarhead. You said. You then leave the base. As get out, an alarm is sounded. But you\u2019ve already left and put your clothes back on. Now, neither of them will know or create anything. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouldn\u2019t have done an infiltration like that better myself. A voice said. Arif? Where you watching the whole time? You said. Right when you knocked out the soldier and strolled right in. He said. I was good, wasn\u2019t i? You said. \u2026..I\u2019ve seen worse. He said. So you\u2019re a critic as well? You said. You know, you\u2019ve just doomed them, right? He said. Let them fight their own battles. They don\u2019t need data about me to do so. You said. When Ashley puts two and two together\u2026. She said. Like I\u2019m scared of Mary sue and her band of untrained misfits. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walking out of M district when you feel the ground shake. Great\u2026.. And my day was going so good. You said. The shaking gets more violent until you see Ashley, and she\u2019s not happy. What do you want, Mary? I\u2019m a busy man. You said. You just couldn\u2019t let them have this, could you? Have what? I didn\u2019t take anything from them. You said. Liar! I know you destroyed the data sent by that scientist, and the growth bracelets. She said. (Growth bracelets? So that\u2019s what these things are.) You said. What was it worth? How much was it to do this? She said. I wasn\u2019t paid to do that. You said. Then why? Fame? Recognition? If it wasn\u2019t money, then what!? She said. I don\u2019t need to tell you my reasons for anything, Mary. Now, beat it! I\u2019ve got places to be. You said. Like back under the master\u2019s thumb? Maybe I\u2019ll send your body there when I\u2019m done! She said. First, I\u2019m not under anyone\u2019s thumb. I\u2019m independent. Second, if that\u2019s a threat, you better make sure I\u2019m dead. You said, turning around. I\u2019ve should have done this when I first saw you. You\u2019re nothing but trouble. She said. You disappear and hit her hard in the face and she hits the ground hard. You reappear on the ground. All talk like the rest. You said, walking away.<br>\r\nYou walk until you get to a desolate part of M district. Let\u2019s see if this thing works. You said. You activate the bracelet and shoot up 100ft. Whoa! So this is how look from there perspective. You said. (Puts things in a new light. A slight need to clear out all this rubble.) He said. (We, well me, are better than them. I don\u2019t have an ego crisis.) You said. Watching where you step, you make your way to Mira\u2019s house while avoiding being seen. You get there and open the door. You walk around and hear a door close. You look to see Mira is half asleep and rubbing her eyes. Who\u2019s\u2026..there? She said. Her eyes shift to you. Oh\u2026. It\u2019s just you\u2026.. She said. (No reaction out of her. She must be dreaming.) You thought. It\u2019s too late for you to do\u2026..whatever it is. Come on back\u2026.. She said. Mira grabs your hand and leads you back to her room. She lead you to her bed and lays down. (Best to play along. Until morning.) You thought. You lay beside her and she puts her hand on your check. Why\u2026. Are you still wearing this around me? She said. Mira takes off your mask and hood. Better\u2026.. She said. (Dreaming.) You said. Then she kisses you. (Huh!?) You thought. I\u2026.love you. She said before drifting back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Wow\u2026..) You said. (So how was it for you, lover boy?) He said. (She\u2019s just dreaming. She won\u2019t remember a thing in the morning.) You said.</span></div></div>",

Ah! She said, jumping out of the bed. She quickly gets up and scans you. S\u2026.so I wasn\u2019t dreaming this?! This is for real!? She said. Yeah. You said. B\u2026..B\u2026.But how?! She said. Science? You said, getting up. If I can say this\u2026.. You\u2019re more terrifying like this. She said. Good. Now my point will get across better. You said. (And our fists.) He said. Wait. Before you go\u2026.. Did I\u2026\u2026say anything\u2026\u2026weird last night? She said, blushing. Not really. Just brought me to your bed. You said. Oh\u2026. Ok. She said. Mira breathes a little easier as you left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out, shrink back down, and head to M district. Damn. Like this place wasn\u2019t attacked at all. Must have pulled an all nighter. You said. (But where are they getting the supplies? This rebuilding can\u2019t be cheap.) He said. (Must be using material that wasn\u2019t destroyed.) You said. (If that\u2019s the case, they would have rebuilt a long time ago. No\u2026. Someone is funding these jokers with money, supplies, and equipment.) He said. (A secret benefactor\u2026.? Who\u2019d be that rich in a world like this? Kyle wouldn\u2019t allow another man to be richer than him, and no woman would shell out for them.) You said. (How about that scientist? She sent research to them. She might also be funding them.) She said. (She\u2019s too close to home. Plus, all her spendings are monitored. If they saw a huge withdrawal, they\u2019ll know why.) You said. You walk around and look at the city. Guess with the help of Sue and her friends, this place has no reason not to be built fast. You said. While walking, you come across Ashley. She give you a snide look as she holds her side. \u2026\u2026What do you want? She said. Dial back that tone, Sue. Unless you want more broken bones. You said. I don\u2019t have time to deal with you now. Do what you came to do and leave. She said. I\u2019ll leave of my own accord. Not on yours. You said. You two aren\u2019t getting along well. Arif said, walking up. Sue fault. She starts something she can\u2019t finish. She said. Stand still and I will be finish. She said. You\u2019re holding your side now. Want to be put in a wheelchair? You said. Ok. Enough of this. Ashley. I need to speak with him alone. Arif said. \u2026..I was leaving anyway. She said. Clutching her side, Ashley walks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really aren\u2019t making friends. He said. I\u2019m more than willing to put everything behind if Sue quits trying to make me do something I don\u2019t want to do. You said. She still trying? He said. Trying to appeal to my morals didn\u2019t work, so she tried violence and strongarm. You said. So that\u2019s why she\u2019s holding her side. He said. I gave her fair warning. She didn\u2019t listen. You said. You know, this isn\u2019t going to sit well with the army. He said. Like I need them or Ashley\u2019s band of misfits. They should be worried about Kyle and his goons when they come knocking. Speaking of, how long you give this place? You said. A month. He said. A lot more lenient than me. Here. You said. You hand him the blueprints. These are\u2026.. So that explains the bracelet on your wrist. He said. Yeah. It works. I have no need for it. Made your moral compass is better than mine. She said. I know a lot of people who would want this. Some would pay a king and queen ransom for this. He said. Heh. Don\u2019t forget about me when you\u2019re eating caviar with a tiny fork. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days goes by, you saw M district return to how it was before it was level. You\u2019ve gotten multiple request from the army to help and even Ashley tried one last time, but you shoot them all down. One day, Arif told you that the men in M district just vanish. Even Ashley was gone. So you went there to see for yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoa. Like a ghost town. You said. You walk around and even go into the army base, but not a single soul. (It\u2019s like every single man here just disappeared.) He said. As you walk, you see the tv\u2019s light up. (Hey. Isn\u2019t that our supposed clone?) He said. (Yeah. I think the scientist said she\u2019s Beth.) You said. I know you\u2019re watching this. I take it you found the entire M district empty. She said. Understatement. You said. I expected to see a shield. Someone who\u2019s going to stand up for his kind, but from what I hear, you haven\u2019t been doing any of that. From what I hear now, they say you\u2019re just like the master. All the power, except you don\u2019t do anything with it. I don\u2019t care what they say now. You know what I want, hero. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell. She sure knows how to send a message. Arif said. Over the top, if you ask me. You said. So? Arif said. I have no obligation to them or m district. Let them do what they want. You said. That leaves this place empty. He said. I doubt they got every single man here. Army\u2019s gone, which leaves a power vacuum. Arif. You said. Running a city? Never thought of it. He said. Here\u2019s your chance. Nobody\u2019s going to stop you. Think about it. Master Arif. All that power, no to stop you, and you know I\u2019ll keep Kyle off your back. You said. Name in lights? He said. The brightest neon we can find. You said. Excuse me. I need to go find a suit. He said. (Hey. How come I don\u2019t get my own city?) He said. (You\u2019ll get the city where all those bitches lay.) You said. (As I please?) He said. (Whatever you want.) You said. (Arif does make a point, though. Not doing ourselves any favor by leaving them to their fates.) He said. (If they want out, they can think of an escape plan. I\u2019m not going out of my way for them because it\u2019s the right thing to do. How much trouble has that phrase cost?) You said. (A lot. But then that means we have two enemies. Kyle and his bootlickers. And the army.)  He said. (I made it perfectly clear to both. Cross me and die.) You said. (With thinking like that, you know how it ends, right?) He said. (If it comes to that, it\u2019s their fault. Not mine.) You said.</span></div></div>",

Destroyed or partial buildings, crushed cars, desolate street, and small fires. Good place to hide out. But it\u2019s a long walk from here to M district. You said. You keep walking until your cell phone goes off. Arif. You said. Hello, hero. Beth said. Your blood starts to boil. You didn\u2019t come to my challenge a few days ago. So I had to take out my frustration on the new city. And look who I found. She said. Where. Is. Arif? You said, pissed off. Arif\u2026. So you are close to this one. Is he a friend? She said. Where!? You said. He\u2019s safe. For now. I would have killed him, but someone told me that you and him are close. So I had a better idea. If you won\u2019t come to rescue m district, maybe you\u2019ll come to your friend\u2019s rescue. If you care. She said. You\u2019re dead. You said. Is that emotion? So you do care. Want him alive? Then come get him. You know the way. She said. Hanging up, you head to the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the desolate arena and see Beth with Arif in her hands and he has a collar on his neck. So glad you could make it. Thought I had to start without you. She said. Let. Him. Go. You said. I really wish I could. But I know you\u2019d take him and run. So I added an incentive for you to fight. This collar on his neck is wired to give a painful shock if he leaves the area. She said. Arif screams as he\u2019s violently shocked by the collar. You clench your fist when the shocking stops. So. Ready? She said. You disappear and reappear in her hand, grab Arif and disappear back on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put him on the ground and turn back to her. I\u2019ll take that as a yes. She said. You disappear and she felt a strong kick to her stomach. She hits the wall as you land on the ground. First one\u2019s free! She said. She disappears and reappears behind you, but you were already behind her when her fist hits the ground. Huh? She said. You hit her hard on the head and send her into the ground. You turn to leave, when you hear her get up. That\u2019s all you got? She said. You pull out your knife and disappear. She swings behind her, but she hits an afterimage and felt a sharp pain in her neck. You appear in front of her. Ugh\u2026. C\u2026..coward\u2026.. She said. You take your knife out and push her down. You shrink back down and turn to tend to Arif.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArif. Hold still. You said. You disengage the locks on the collar. You\u2026..must really care\u2026.. No one would risk their necks like that. He said. Come on. We\u2019re getting out of here. You said. \u2026..What\u2019s the rush? We\u2019re just starting. Beth said. She gets up as the wound on her neck heals. Did you not know? I can heal from any wound. She said. \u2026\u2026Go. I\u2019m going to bury her under the rubble of this place. You said. Hit her a few times for me. Arif said before leaving. You turn to her. Come. She said, grinning. You use the bracelet and grow. Yes\u2026. This is what I want. Give me everything you have, so I can break you. She said. You disappear and reappear in front of her and kick her into the wall. She gets out and comes at you, but you dodge and knee her in the stomach and punch her into the wall again. Now it\u2019s my turn. She disappears and reappear behind you, but you block her and stab her in the stomach. Ha\u2026.. hahaha! She said as the wound heals. She punches you, but you don\u2019t react. You grab her arm and slam her into the ground. Ha\u2026. Don\u2019t you understand? Beat and stab all you want. I\u2019ll heal from it. She said. You pick her up by the neck. Heh\u2026. Do. Your. Worst. She said. Your focus your power and punch through her stomach and take your arm out. Heh. Useless! She said. The wound doesn\u2019t heal. Wha?! Why isn\u2019t-Arghhhh! She said as she\u2019s engulfed in a bright glowing light. \u2026..Hmph. You said. You turn and walk away.<br>\r\n(You\u2019re welcome.) He said. (I don\u2019t remember asking.) You said. (That stunt requires both mine and your power. Without my power, it\u2019s imbalance. And you know what happens when we use it.) He said. You get to Mira\u2019s house and walk in. You collapse on the couch. Takes almost all my energy. You said. As you lay there, Mira sees you lying there and quickly rushes over. What happened?! She said. Got into a fight. I\u2019m fine. You said. No you\u2019re not! Quick breaths, a rising temperature, and you\u2019re covered in blood! She said. Theirs. Not mine. You said. You\u2019re not allowed off this couch until I say so. She said. You\u2019re not my- I mean it! You\u2019re in no condition to move! Now stay there! She interrupts. (Hahaha! Guess she wears the pants in this relationship.) He said. </span></div></div>",

You look over at the window and see someone standing there. When you focus, your eyes widen. C\u2026.Chijinda!? You see him just standing in the window. You quickly get up from the couch, but he\u2019s gone when you get there. H\u2026.he was just here\u2026. You said. You look out and see him walking down the street. You hurriedly open the door and follow him. When you give chase, it\u2019s like he gets farther away. Chijinda! You said. He goes into the prison. You follow him and see him walking down the hall. You run after him. Wait up! You said. You head through the empty cafeteria and meeting room. When you get to him, you turn him around. C\u2026.chijinda\u2026. You said. You hug him. You feel his hands on your back. (\u2026..What are you hugging?) He said. (Chijinda\u2026. He\u2019s right here.) You said. (Nothing is there.) He said. You look and see you\u2019re holding nothing. You take off your mask. H\u2026.he was just here. I saw him. He smiled at me.) You said. (Are you going crazy?) He said. (I swear I saw him!) You said. (We can talk later. Trouble\u2019s coming because you breezed pass multiple cameras.) He said. You put your mask back on and grow back to 100ft and hear the doors open. There he is! A voice said. You turn to the guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A few are scared. Let\u2019s see\u2026.) You all know what I can do. Who wants to be in the infirmary? You said. I\u2026if you think you can intimidate us\u2026.! One of them said. You took a few steps towards them and you can see the fear. S\u2026.screw this! One guard said. She runs away. Anyone else? You take one more step and the guards break and run. (Ahhh. Fear. The best motivation.) He said. You walk to the exit until you\u2019re thrown through the wall and into cafeteria. Ugh\u2026. You said getting up. (Someone\u2019s got nerve.) He said. Stepping through the hole, you see Ashley. Sue? What the hell are you doing here? You said. (She looks different. Like she\u2019s been doing something.) You thought. Something I\u2019ve should have done a long time ago. She said. Really, Sue? You want to do this? You said. Someone has to. She said. Fine. You said. You disappear and reappear in front of her and she catches your fist. Heh. You said. She blocks a kick from behind and the side. (She\u2019s seeing through my attacks. Alright then.) You thought. You disappear and reappear behind her and just as you\u2019re about to attack, you disappear and reappear to her side and she blocks your attack from behind. (Just as I thought\u2026.) You said. She kicks you into the wall. The force from you hitting the wall leaves a hole. You walk back through the hole. (She\u2019s been injected with my blood.) You said. (Another one?) He said. (Me and Sue never got along, but I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d go this far. She must have had enough of me saying no, and decided to do it herself.) You said. (She thinks she can be a hero. I say we give her a hero\u2019s death.) He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you really did this, Sue. You really think you can take out Kyle and save all the men? You said. I know I can. You weren\u2019t going to. She said. For what reason? And don\u2019t say it\u2019s the right thing to do. You said. To be a decent human being. She said. Decent human being? Look around, Sue. This is a world were men are seen as slaves and playthings. Morality went out the window a long time ago. You think you can be this paragon of justice and virtue? You said. I don\u2019t want to be a paragon, but the master will face justice after I kill you. She said. You believe you can do that? You said. You bleed like everyone else. You\u2019re not invincible or immortal. She said. Fine, then. This is a long time coming. You said. You\u2019re right. This is way past overdue. She said. </span></div></div>",

She blocks both punches from the side, but they were after images. She expected an attack from behind, but is punched from the front and sent through into a wall. Grrr\u2026.! She said. You don\u2019t see her in the ruble. You block an attack from behind and kick, but she\u2019s gone. You dodge a punch and grab her arm. You fling her into a wall and rush her. You punch her multiple times and through the wall. \u2026.Hmph. You said. You walk away until she comes back through the hole. Is that all you can do? She said. Still standing\u2026. Thought you\u2019d break after that. You said. Unlike you, I\u2019m fighting for something. She said. And that\u2019s suppose to mean something? You said. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to understand. You\u2019re blinded by all that power you have. She said. Says the person who has a vendetta against me because I won\u2019t help. Yeah. I\u2019m the blind one. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe runs at you and you dodge her attack. You swing at her, but she blocks and kicks you away. While you stumble, she hits you in the stomach, and punches you a few times and slams you against the wall. She knees you in the chin and kicks you through the wall. She backs up; waiting for you to come out. You come out of the hole, but at normal size and fall on your knee. Done already? What happen to all that energy? She said. (Come on\u2026.) You thought. And here I was hoping to see what they fear in you. As much as I\u2019d love to see you suffer, I\u2019m not sadistic. She said. She raise her foot over you. Before she stomps you, she\u2019s grab by your clone. What the?! She said. Gotcha\u2026. You said. B\u2026.But when did you?! She said. The first time you sent me through. I created a clone to hide and wait. You said. So you only faked being out of energy? She said. I didn\u2019t walk in here at full. I\u2019m pretty exhausted. But it\u2019s over. Do it. You said.  Your clone slams her into the ground and grabs his knife. It starts to glow and he stabs her in the gut. Ahhh! She said. Relax. You won\u2019t die. It just feels like it. You said. After a few minutes, the knife stops glowing and he pulls it out. Done. All the tainted blood is gone. She should be back to normal now. He said. You grow to 100ft and your clone disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand over Ashley. Just had to be a hero, Sue. You said. This had nothing to do with being a hero. I was going to do what you refuse to do. She said. By bootlicking Kyle and signing up for this. You said. Like I said, I wouldn\u2019t expect you to understand! She said angry. Then tell me what I\u2019m not getting. You said. You and the master\u2026\u2026 You\u2019re both the same. Only care about yourselves while others suffer. He had a chance to make everything right, but he didn\u2019t. He turned his back and pushed them further. Then you come along and refuse to lift a finger to help. I see why men shouldn\u2019t have power. They squander it! She said. And you get that from me and Kyle? We\u2019re nothing alike. You said. But you both act the same. Wanting nothing but your own self interest. You\u2019ve both taken away a lot more than you know. And for what? Self gratification? Recognition? She said. I don\u2019t know about Kyle, but I\u2019m not doing it for some gratification or whatever. The thing you\u2019re missing, Sue, is that everybody has a choice. You, me, Kyle. Everyone. You chose to bootlick to get here. I don\u2019t know what Kyle chose, but it got him there. We all get choices to make. Like the choice of should I kill you. You said. Fine! Kill me! Rather be dead than listen to your reasoning. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Do it. She\u2019s no good to anyone.) He said. (Actually\u2026 She does. She has pull with the army. Keeping her alive, we can call in a favor.) You said. (Are you serious? What good are they?) He said. (They have there uses.) You said. What are you wanting for?! Do what you do best. She said. Not today Mary Sue. I\u2019ve got a better idea. You said. You knock her out. Call it a favor. You owe me. You said, picking her up. You walk out of the prison and head to M district. As you walk, you watch where you step to not break or wreck anything. You get to the Army base and put Ashley down. I think this belongs to you, general. You said before disappearing. You reappear some distance away and shrink back down. (Still think we should have killed her.) He said. (Sue owes us a favor. We can call that in anytime.) You said. You head back to Mira\u2019s house and see Mira is waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere were you!? I told you not to leave! She said. Sorry, doc. Something came up. You said. DO you know how worried I was?! She said. I came back. You said. Not the point. Do you consider how I feel about you when you go running off to who knows where. Do you have a death wish!? She said. Why do you care so much about what I do? You said. Because I\u2026. She said. Because what? You said. I\u2026. don\u2019t want to hear from someone that you died. She said. Uh-uh. That\u2019s not it. You\u2019re feeling are more than a concerned friend. You\u2019re acting more like a concerned girlfriend. You said. AH\u2026..! She said surprised. Oh! Did I get it? You said. A\u2026.a\u2026. And what if I am? Is it a crime to be worried about someone? She said. When they are as protective as you\u2019re being. You think nursing and worrying about me will change my mind? You said. I don\u2019t see anyone else looking out for you. She said. I don\u2019t need someone to look after me. Worry about yourself. You said. You can\u2019t do everything by yourself! She said. Goes to show that you know nothing about me. I can do everything AND anything. You said. You\u2019re a man! Not an island! She said. That maybe, but this man can topple a preteen monster without the size. Something that probably hasn\u2019t been done since the start of time. No wonder the army needs help. You said. You\u2019re no going to make a lot of friends with an attitude like that. She said. I don\u2019t need friends. I handle my own problems. And I certainly don\u2019t need a worrywart like you. Ah\u2026! \u2026\u2026Fine. Excuse me for putting your health first. She said. Let that be my concern. You said, disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear outside. (She has a point. We aren\u2019t making allies.) He said. (You want to help m district or Kyle?) You said. (Let them fight their own wars. Freedom isn\u2019t free.) He said. </span></div></div>",

(I don\u2019t like the idea of being documented. But I doubt we can walk in there. Security\u2019s tighten since last time.) He said. (Time to call in that favor.) You said. You pull out your cell phone and call Ashley. Sue. Put on that enforcer outfit, and meet me near that prison. You said. \u2026..You beat me down and expect me to help you when you won\u2019t lift a finger for us? She said. Don\u2019t forget who carried your sorry ass back to M district. You owe me. You said. I won\u2019t wait forever. She said, hanging up. You make your way to the prison and wait for Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you are. Man, you girls are sick. Some sort of dominatrix angle? Why latex? You said. I didn\u2019t come to converse with you. What do you want? She said. You\u2019re going to help me ger into the prison. You said. And why can\u2019t you do it? She said. I want to be subtle about this, and me storming in there isn\u2019t good. You said. And that\u2019s a problem for you? She said. I\u2019m only after one person. After this, you and me never have to see each other. You said, disappearing and reappearing in her hand. So you ready? You said. We\u2019re through after this. She said. Ashley heads into the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know where the medical wing is? You said. I know this place like the back of my hand. She said. Kyle only lets the most vicious be enforcers. From what I hear, you are one of the horrible ones. A story of eating men who don\u2019t meet your standards of servitude. You said. Had to sound believable. I\u2019d never do that. It\u2019s disgusting, barbaric, and immoral. She said. And he bought that? You said. He had no reason not to. She said. Ashley gets to medical and you jump out of her hand. She\u2019s here somewhere. You go save some of the men here. You said. I plan on doing that anyway. She said. Yeah, like a good Mary Sue. You said. You look around, but don\u2019t find her, but you find research notes. Hmm. Instantaneous healing, unnatural strength, peak agility\u2026. This is a surmise of me. You said. You see the vial that has your blood. You quickly grow and take it. Get your super soldiers another way, Kyle. I should destroy the computer. That way, it\u2019s all gone. You said. You smash the computer. Now. Only the scientist. You said. You wait in there a few minutes before she gets in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the? My computer\u2019s been smashed. And files have been burned. When I find the person\u2026.! She said. Hello there. You said. You put your knife against her neck. Someone\u2019s been real busy with her research. You said. Wait, wait! We\u2019re both reasonable people here. T-there\u2019s no need for blood. She said. Reasonable? And what can you offer me? You said. I didn\u2019t come up with the idea, but I built those growth bracelets. I can give you a technological edge. She said. (If she\u2019s going to work for us, it would be better.) He said. You think for a few seconds and let her go. You work for me now. You said. Of course. Anything to clear my conscious. She said. You can start now. You said. You hand her the bracelet. Turn this into an armband. You said. I\u2019ll need a few minutes. She said. You wait while she reworks and configures the bracelet into an armband. And\u2026..done. She said. She shows you the armband. That was quick. You said. It\u2019s my own work. I did say I built those. She said. This might workout after all. You said. \u2026..Jessica. She said. What? You said. My name\u2019s Jessica. She said. Just be ready when I come to you. You said. You get a call on your phone. Sue. You said. Are you done yet? She said. Waiting on you. You said. You use the armband and shrink back down and leave. When you left, Jessica breath a sigh of relief. I can finally start doing right. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find Ashley and call out. You don\u2019t seem happy to see me. You said. Get on. She said. You jump onto her hand and she heads to the exit. So where are you keeping all the men you saved? You said. Why do you care? She said. No need to be like that. You need a hug. You said. Ashley makes it outside and you jump down. Nice working with you, Sue. You said. We\u2019re done here. Don\u2019t ask from me again. She said. Aw. Don\u2019t be like that. Need a hug? You said. Angerly, Ashley heads back to M district. (She hates us more and more each day.) He said. (As long as she doesn\u2019t try anything, she can hate all she wants.) You said. You head back to M district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive just in time to see Ashley put a handful of men on the ground. Such a good girl scout. You said. Guess this is your doing. Arif said. Called in a favor. You said. So that\u2019s why Ash looks like she\u2019s pissed. He said. She got a better end of it. She saved a lot people from that prison. She said. Heh. If she doesn\u2019t hate you now\u2026. He said. Oh please. Like Mary sue and her friends scary me. They focus more on kyle and his croons, they\u2019d be free. You said. Not like they aren\u2019t trying. Just nothing works against a giant. He said. They aren\u2019t invincible. No one is. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned, anyone can be killed. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day goes on, you explore o district. What the fuck happened here? A warzone? You said, looking at the decerped buildings. You walk the desolate streets and stop. \u2026..You\u2019re not good at sneaking, Amy. You said. Who said I was sneaking? She said. Don\u2019t tell me you came all this way for little old me. You said. And if I have? She said. Get over your grudge with me, kid. The world in your hand and you focus on me. You said. Everything was going smoothly until you came along. Riots, rebellion, an increase in defiance from slaves we\u2019ve never seen. She said. Don\u2019t blame that on me. You think that wasn\u2019t bound to happen soon? People get tired of having a boot on their neck. You said. We destroyed all hope men had of being free. They finally knew there place in life. Until you came along and inspired them to rebel. And if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, you humiliated me in front of my peers and slaves. She said. First, I didn\u2019t inspired them. If I did, it wasn\u2019t my intention. Second, you can\u2019t be at the top forever. Someone\u2019s bound to knock you off. You said. You don\u2019t belong on top. You place, like every other male, is on the bottom and worshipping the ground women walk on. She said. Get real, Amy. All you bitches are on a power trip. You need to come off it. Especially you and your friends before the army comes marching on your doorstep. You said. The M district army? You really think that pitiful band will be able to do anything? She said. You keep going after them, so they must be of some worth to you and kyle. You said. Men who don\u2019t know their place. They learn to serve or die. Like you. She said. Is that a threat? You said. It\u2019s my job to bring men to heel or under my heel. She said. You really don\u2019t learn. You said behind her. When she turns around, you punch her hard in the gut. Ugh\u2026..! She said. She falls to her knees and coughs up blood. She tries to get up, but falls back on her knees. Let that be a lesson to you. And spread the word to everyone you know. You said. You walk away and shrink back down.</span></div></div>",

So it\u2019s true that they pushed back Kyle\u2019s preteens and teens? He said. Didn\u2019t believe it until I saw the celebration. Never seen people so proud and happy for themselves. And I saw Sue smile for once. You said. That\u2019s rare. She must be overjoyed at how far they\u2019ve come. He said. Still nothing to brag about. Not until they get to kyle\u2019s mansion. You said. Now that\u2019s a fight. They\u2019d have to cut right through f district. And they aren\u2019t going to get a warm welcome. He said. Odds? You said. Elites, preteen and teen monsters, plus the regular women in the city\u2026. That\u2019s a 1000 to 1 odds. He said. What about the ones who claim to be sympathetic? You said. Their chances go up, but only slightly. The majority still think of men as slave, and won\u2019t budge on that. You said. Guess they won\u2019t be winning the hearts of their enemy so they can talk this out. You said. Nah. This is a zero-sum game. Either they win or kyle. He said. If Sue and her band does win, you think they can change anything? You said. With Ashley at the helm, yeah. He said. You trust her enough not to become just like if not worse than kyle? You said. Ashley\u2019s been all about equality for men since her first slave. He said. Sue had a slave? She doesn\u2019t seem like the kind to even own one. You said.  She doesn\u2019t like to talk about it. He said. If they get to Kyle, it\u2019s going to leave a power vacuum, and I don\u2019t like the idea of Sue sitting in the head chair. Just imagine the draconian laws she\u2019ll put in place. You said. Anyone talking about having a man as a slave gets death. He said. And people aren\u2019t going to like that. The cycle of rebellion starts over again. And having checks and balances won\u2019t work either. Leads to corruption and back ally deals. You said. Has to be someway people get what they want. He said. Freedom of choice. You can\u2019t stop every last one of these crazies from having slaves. And you can\u2019t stop the ones who don\u2019t want slaves. You said. Is that why you don\u2019t help Ashley? He said. Exactly. What right do I have to impede on kyle and his goons choices? Just because it\u2019s wrong and unfair? You said. I see where you\u2019re coming from, but every action has a reaction. Which is how this resistance got started. He said. This is going to turn into all out war. We\u2019ll see whose ideology comes out on top. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you two walk the streets of m district, you see military trucks full of equipment. They are dead serious now. Might have a chance. You said. When the trucks are gone, you both hear booming footsteps and see who\u2019s causing them. Hey. Kim\u2019s back. He said. Take it she\u2019s one of Sue\u2019s friends? You said. Yeah. Kim\u2019s been just as much help as Ashley.  She\u2019s one of the good ones. He said. You say that as if you have personal knowledge of her. You said. Kim\u2019s saved my ass more times than I can count. Almost got her name tattooed there. He said. You trust her? You said. Her and Ash share the same ideal, although Kim thinks a more direct approach is required. She said. She hates kyle? You said. Burning passion. Condemning all men to that prison did it for her. If Ash doesn\u2019t kill him, Kim will. Hey Kim. He said. Huh? Arif! She said, happily. Not foreboding as Sue. You mutter. Are you staying out of trouble? She said. Give me some credit, Kim. I\u2019m not that much of a trouble maker. Arif said. Breaking into the master\u2019s mansion, starting prison riots, showing disrespect\u2026.. She said. Breaking into Kyle\u2019s mansion? You said. Hey, no reason not to share the wealth. He won\u2019t miss a few items. He said. You\u2019re lucky you got life and not execution, or it would have been harder to get you. She said. I got out. He said. Only because I hide you away and snuck you out. The fighting you started didn\u2019t last long, and you activated the fail safe on your collar. She said. I thought you were a tech wiz? You said. The only wiz he\u2019s good at is trouble. She said. I don\u2019t go actively looking for it. It just finds me. He said. Like that fight with the soldier? You said. Really, Arif? More fighting? Kim said. Ok. This one is explainable. He said. A bump lead to an all out street fight. You said. Arif\u2026. Kim said. I didn\u2019t kill him. He said. No, but you beat him pretty good. You said. Arif. She said. He started it. He said. *Sigh* Looks like I still need to look out for you. She said. That makes two of us. You said. I\u2019m not some kid who needs to looked out for. He said. I beg to differ. Just\u2026.. Stay out of trouble, ok? She said. Fine. He said. Thank you\u2026. I\u2019ll be around if you need me. She said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArif shakes his head as you look at him. So\u2026. You and kim\u2026. You said. It\u2019s not what you think. She\u2019s like that with every guy. He said. It looks like she cares for you more though. You said you two been through a few things. So it wouldn\u2019t be crazy if she\u2026. You said. Developed feelings. If love exists in this world, Kim deserves someone better than me. A lot better. You said. \u2026..We all have our demons. You said. If you knew my demons, you wouldn\u2019t see me in the same light. He said. You were going to say something when you saw a shadow move. You saw that? You said. Yeah. Multiple. He said. You both wait until you block a knife and shove it back into the person. Arif sidesteps and an attack and you punch the guy. You sense someone behind you and punch him hard enough that your arm when through him. You pull out your arm and push him down. Think that\u2019s all of them. You said. You see one crawling and you stomp on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2026.can\u2019t believe it\u2026. We stood no chances. We were\u2026. We didn\u2019t\u2026last for a minute. He said. To coordinated to be random. Who sent you? You said. We were\u2026.promised freedom\u2026. Didn\u2019t know\u2026.that freedom\u2026..would be death\u2026.. He said. Promised freedom\u2026.. You think Sue\u2026.? You said. Put a mark on you? As much as she hates you, she wouldn\u2019t go that far. Arif said. She tried to kill me herself. You said. You pick up the man. Come on. Sue\u2019s got some explaining to do. You said. Carrying the guy, you find Ashley near the base. Great. And I was having a good day too. She said. Can the shit. This garbage belongs to you? You said, tossing the guy. W\u2026what did you do to him?! Ashley said surprised. A group of guys attacked us. Arif said. He said he was promised freedom. You said. You think I put a hit on you? She said. Who else is going around promising freedom? You said. I didn\u2019t do this! I don\u2019t like you, but I wouldn\u2019t stoop to this level? She said. She\u2019s right. Ash prefers to handle her problems herself. You did say she tried to kill you. Arif said. And failed. So if she didn\u2019t do it, who did? You said. Only two people have the power get this man what he want. Kyle and Kyouki. He said. Kyouki? You said. His second in command. One the most feared girls he has. If this guy was promised anything from someone, it her. He said. Keep this trash alive. I\u2019m not done with him. You said.  You head out to the mansion.</span></div></div>",

(Do these girls have any other clothing besides bikinis?) He said. (Power trip.) You said. You see them talking and listen in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..Those were his words. Amy said. This man doesn\u2019t know who runs this world. Luna said. You hear the stories about they are saying about him? Soya said. Stories. That\u2019s what they are. Koyuki said. Still we need to do something. Men are starting to rebel against their betters. Where\u2019s the master? We need to discuss this with him. Yumi said. He\u2019s a x prison. He\u2019s overseeing some new security measures. Kyouki said. We need to do something. This one arrogant man is going to ruin everything we worked for! Luna said. I\u2019ve already has something in play. I promised a few men freedom if they take care of this. Kyouki said. You really think they can do it? Yumi said. They were in x prison for horrible crimes against their masters. If they can do those things to woman, who knows what they can do to him? Kyouki said. And the freedom part? Amy said. A lie. They were going back to x prison anyway. Kyouki said. I see\u2026.. This mysterious man dies, the prisoners go back to prison, and m district is ours. I like it! Yumi said. It\u2019s only a matter of time. Kyouki said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the first time thugs have been sent after me. You said. (We must be doing something right.) He said. You head back to m district. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArif. Where are you keeping our friend? You said. Took a lot sweet talking, but I convinced Ash to hold him in the base. He said. So he\u2019s in there? Being interrogated by Sue\u2019s jarheads? You said. No. But I\u2019d hurry before they get that idea. He said. You head into the base and find the prisoner. Give us some privacy. You said. Reluctant and scared, the guarding soldiers leave. You enter the cell. What\u2026.more do you want? He said. A lot. You know more than you\u2019re letting on. So I suggest you start talking. Or I start breaking bones. You said. What can you do\u2026.that they can\u2019t? He said. I don\u2019t like to show it, but I have a sadistic side. The girls will kill you. But I\u2019ll torture you to within of an inch of your life. Then I\u2019ll fix and clean you up really good. Then torture some more. Let me show you. You said. You grab and twist his arm out of socket. ARGHHHH! He said. Now, I could have rip it out of socket, but that\u2019s not fun. You said. You snap his other arm. Ahhhh! He screams. You must be in a world of pain. Good thing I know the proper solution. You said. You wrap your arm around his neck and pull until you hear a snap. Argh\u2026. You bastard\u2026. He said. Now, you can\u2019t feel the pain. Well, you can\u2019t feel anything from the neck down. Life in a wheelchair for you. But I\u2019m not that mean. Let\u2019s get you fixed. You said. You twist his neck again and he can feel and move again. Now\u2026 Do I need to give another demonstration? You said. No, no\u2026.. I\u2019ll talk. He said. Leave nothing out. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master\u2019s second in command\u2026.. Koyuki\u2026.. She hired us to take care of a problem. She said it was a man. She told us he was a troublemaker, and needs to be taken care of. We thought it would be easy\u2026.. Do this for her, she\u2019ll put in a good word with the master. But she didn\u2019t say we\u2019d be going after you. If we knew that, we\u2019d turn her down. He said. And? It doesn\u2019t stop there. You said. \u2026\u2026You know how the army repelled the master\u2019s preteens and teen monsters? You said. Yeah? You said. He\u2019s coming back with an even bigger one. He\u2019s going to lay waste to m district and make it as if it never existed. He said. So Koyuki had you try and take me out. After that, lay siege to m district. Didn\u2019t think those bitches knew tactics. You said. So\u2026. You have your information. What are you going to do with me now? He said. As much as I\u2019d like to kill you, I don\u2019t shoot messengers. I\u2019ll let Sue decide. You said. You walk out the cell and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you learn? Arif said. Plan was to kill me then wipe out m district. You said. Didn\u2019t they learn from last time they attacked? He said. Kyle\u2019s bringing more this time. I think we should avoid being in m district for a while. You said. And koyuki? He said. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll deal with her. Let\u2019s scram before Kyle shows up early. You said. You and Arif leave m district quickly, not noticing Ashley saw you both. They\u2019re leaving in a hurry\u2026.. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stop when you reach o district. Sue and her band are really going to be tested this time. You said. It\u2019s not going to be a battle. It\u2019ll be attrition. He said. Both sides are going to loss a lot. And we\u2019ll see whose ideology is stronger. You said. If I know Ash, she\u2019s not going to back down. He said. Hopefully\u2026. We\u2019ll hideout and see. You said.</span></div></div>",

You think there will be prisoners? You said. The only people being taken prisoner are any woman helping m district. All the males are going to be killed on the spot. He said. I don\u2019t think Sue will opt for a jail cell. Neither will kim or any of Sue\u2019s friends. You said. Kyle\u2019s going to make an example of them. He\u2019s hellbent on taking out any hope men have. He said. Who are you putting your money on? You said. I\u2019m impressed by the army\u2019s resilience and Ash\u2019s determination, but Kyle\u2019s got the numbers, experience, and technology. He said. Not to mention it\u2019s only Sue, Kim and their friends. You said. Kim\u2019s a fighter. She won\u2019t go down easily. He said. Yeah. She seems like the kind to detonate a grenade in her pocket than be taken hostage. Maybe if they win, you can ask her out. You said. Think I have a chance? I mean, no. Out of all the things, dating isn\u2019t one. He said. Heh heh. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking at the jets scramble from a distance, your cell phone rings. Ah. Sue again. You said. (She\u2019s still mad?) he said. (Try pissed. Withholding information about an impending siege doesn\u2019t make you popular.) You said. (When is this fight starting!?) He said. (Relax. We\u2019re not taking part in it.) You said. (\u2026..I still want to see them kill each other.) He said. As one jet flies low, the ground shakes. Oh great. Here come Sue. You said. You wait and see that it isn\u2019t Ashley. Wait. That\u2019s not Ash. And it\u2019s not Kim. You said. This was another teen, but she wore a jacket with a brown vest, black jeans and combat boots. Her hair is red and green eyes. She\u2019s looking around hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking for something? Or someone? You said. You! She said angerly. I take it you\u2019re with Sue. You said. First not helping, then you keep crucial information from us  that we didn\u2019t learn until the last minute! She said. I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s my job to tell you anything. It\u2019s your job to stay on top of this. You said. I don\u2019t understand you. All that power, and you won\u2019t do anything! She said. I\u2019ve heard that nonsense from Sue. So don\u2019t push that shit on me now. You said. Don\u2019t you see?! We\u2019re fighting so that men don\u2019t have to live in the shadows and fear. She said. And it\u2019s a noble cause. But it\u2019s YOUR cause. Not mine. So I suggest you get back to m district and fight for that cause. You said. I\u2019m not going back by myself. She said. You really want to do this? You said. If you won\u2019t help willingly. Then I\u2019ll force you. She said. You\u2019ve already lost. You said behind her. When she turns around, you punch her. When she kneels over, you uppercut her and she lands hard on the ground. You step on her neck. Two hits and you\u2019re already on your back. You said. (Let\u2019s kill this bitch. We haven\u2019t killed anyone in a long time.) He said. \u2026..Let this be a lesson. You said, stepping off. You shrink back down and walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026.C\u2026.coward\u2026. She said.

You care only\u2026..for yourself. She said. Only person matters and can rely on. You said. That\u2019s something you\u2026.and the master have in common. Don\u2019t care about anyone but yourselves\u2026.. She said. No one else is going to. Think I got this far by putting others first? You said. No\u2026. But you should still have some kind of empathy. She said. It\u2019s for the weak. Unless you pay me for it. You said. Before you could leave, you feel something lock around your neck. What the!? You said. You turn around and grab the person when a strong shock of electricity shocks you, making you drop him. *Pant* A shock collar? You said. I\u2026.said I\u2019d force you to help. What better way? She said. You think this will- Ow! You said. The shock was stronger than you thought. That\u2019s 30,000 volts coursing through you. She said. (Better than those mind control collars, but still.... I don\u2019t like being controlled.) He said. You try to pry it off, but the shock stops you. So\u2026. Sue finally had enough. You said. You\u2019re going to start doing right\u2026.. You\u2019re going to hep us defend m district. She said. \u2026..You just made the biggest mistake of your life. You said. You\u2019re shocked again and lead to m district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could be here any minute. Damn! Where is Kira? Ashley said. Right here. She said. What were you doing!? She said. Getting some insurance. She said. Ow. You said, walking up. W-what\u2019s he doing here!? And\u2026.why is there a collar on him? She said. Look. As much as you hate him, we need him. Kira said. Is that why he\u2019s wearing that? Ashley said. Keeps him in check. We had to amplify the voltage, but he can take it. Kira said. (A necklace out of teeth or bone?) He said. (How about both?) You said. (Now that\u2019s an idea.) He said. </span></div></div>",

Is he ready? Kim said. Just waiting on the word. Kira said. Then let them come. We\u2019ll show them and the master what we\u2019re made of. Ashley said. With the sound of monstrous roaring, the siege begins. At the start, the army held back Kyle\u2019s army. With Ash and Kim beating down one after a another preteen and teen monster. But slowly and with the elites, Kyle\u2019s army started to push back. They just keep coming\u2026. Kim said. We\u2019ll be overrun soon. Kira. Do it. Ash said. Got it. You know what to do. Unless you want to be brain dead. She said. You ignore her and head to the battle. You walk past the retreating men and grow. There you are. Hold them off until we regroup. She said. You clench your fist. You would rip Ash apart if it wasn\u2019t for this collar. So you head out. Come on. Kim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you meet the vanguard, you quickly eviscerate them. (Take our anger out on them.) You said. You pull out your knife and meet them. One by one, you kill them. Stabbing, bludgeon, neck twist. You flip one over and slit her throat. Good god\u2026. He\u2019s murdering them\u2026. Kim said. And he makes it look easy. Kira said. Come on. There numbers have been thinned. Kim said. Wait. Look. Ashley said. She points out the elites. Oh shit\u2026. Kim said. You stomp on a down girl\u2019s neck, breaking it. (This will be nothing compared to wait Sue and all her friends will suffer!) He said. When you sheathe your knife, you see the elites. T\u2026.there\u2019s no way\u2026. Soya said. (I love the smell of fear.) He said. Great. You gave another reason to kill you. Amy said. You draw a line with your foot on the ground. Angered by your threat, Amy charges at you with a full head of steam. When she gets to you, you disappear and reappear behind her. Amy felt her body take multiple hits and she fell over unconscious. Jesus\u2026. Soya said. You think your so tough!? How about- Before luna could finish, you were behind her and shoved her face first into the ground. You leg sweep and elbowed Yumi as she fell and socked Soya right in the face and push her over. You and Koyuki\u2019s eyes meet and you know the look she\u2019s giving you. \u201cAm I suppose to be impressed?\u201d Come on\u2026. Show me what you got. She said. You disappear and she swings back, but you catch her arm. You catch her fist and head butt her. Oof\u2026. Surly you can do better. She said. You charge at her and disappear and reappear behind her. When she swings, you were already gone, and when she turns, you punch her on the nose. Ugh\u2026.! She said. She doesn\u2019t topple. She was showing her brawn, even though her nose was gushing with blood. I can\u2026.take more\u2026. She said. You walk up to her and move your head close. Tell Kyle\u2026. I\u2019m coming for him. You said before kicking her down. With the elites down, the remaining girls look at you with terror. Run\u2026. NOW! You shout. Hearing your words, they break and run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nT\u2026.they\u2019re running\u2026..! He drove them away! Kim said. Is he even a man? Kira said. You walk back to Ash. And you didn\u2019t want to help. She said. You punch her and the shock kicks in. *Spits blood* I\u2019ll let you get away with that one. She said with a little anger. You walk back into m district and shrink back down. You head into the base and the soldiers move out your way. You snatch one of the soldier\u2019s beer out of his hand. Hey! What-Oh God! I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ll get another! He said. (On the verge of pissing himself.) He said. You go to where it\u2019s secluded and drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day later\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere\u2019s the plan. You\u2019re going to bust the men out of this prison. Every last one of them. Understand? Ashley said. You push her aside and head to the prison. You kick the door down and break open the cells. When one of the enforcers sees you, she immediately turns and run. \u2026..Heh. You said. You continue to free the men and the enforcers you came across either ran or let you proceed. (Fear is the best motivation.) He said. Within 10 minutes, you had freed the entire prison. As you walked back, you found a blueprint. Looking at it, it\u2019s the exact kind of collar you\u2019re wearing. Seems like Kyle was in the midst of building this. Someone must have leaked and given it to the army. You said. (And they planned on using it on us.) He said. You take the blueprint. (One step closer to vengeance.) He said. You head back out to see Ash smiling smugly. Nice job, hero. She said. (When we\u2019re free, can I keep her skull for drinking cup?) He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving you under control, Ash and the army manage to free m district. And were planning one final attack. The mansion. This is it. Everything we\u2019ve fought for. Ash said. Finally. I\u2019ve been waiting for this. Kim said. We\u2019re not taking any chances on this. I want that bastard in chains. He said. That\u2019s too quick for him. Let me keep him. I\u2019ll make him suffer like he made every other man suffer. Kim said. No. We\u2019re better than he is. Ashley said. (Did this bitch just say that?) He said. It should be easy. His elites aren\u2019t 100% We can take them. Kira said. Should be. But just in case, I\u2019m sending in our friend. Go there. Take out the elites if you have to, but do not kill the master. Ash said. You grab your knife, but let go and walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrink back down and on the way, you are pulled aside by someone. You see it\u2019s Arif. Arif. You said. I didn\u2019t think the rumors were true, but it seems it is. You\u2019re working with Ashley. He said. Forced. Look. You said. You show him the collar around your neck. Holy shit. I didn\u2019t think Ashley would do this. He said. It\u2019s not mind control, it\u2019s shocks me when I don\u2019t do what they say. You said. Jeez. I\u2019d rather be mind controlled. He said. I\u2019m going to kill them when I get free. You said. Can\u2019t say I blame you. Ashley held herself to a higher standard than Kyle. Or I thought she did\u2026. Arif said. It was Kira. She distracted me while one of there soldiers slapped this on me. You said. Kira? Oh that girl was always trouble. The reason I got put into the arena was because of her. He said. Arif\u2026. I need your help to get this off. Sue wants me to go to the mansion to get Kyle. He said. What can I do? He said. I made friends with one of the scientist. Jessica. Take this blue print to her and see if there is a way to get this off. You said. You can\u2019t pry it? He said. Every time I try, it feels like I\u2019m being hit by supercharged lightning. And it hurts like crazy. And I\u2019ve been stepped and sat on. You said. Arif take the blueprint. Where is this Jessica? He said. She has home in f district. It\u2019s like Kyle\u2019s mansion except smaller. You said. I\u2019ll get this to her. He said. I\u2019m in your debt for life. You said.</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s a one in a million. A\u2026.actually\u2026. I came here for\u2026.. What was it again? Oh. Our mutual friend is in trouble. You said. Friend? You mean\u2026..! She said. He\u2019s in a bind and thinks you can help. You said. Anything. She said. He got a collar put on him and he can\u2019t take it off without getting shocked. He game me these blueprints. You said. Wait. That\u2019s the blueprint I was looking for. She said. Really? You said. It\u2019s was meant for rehabilitation of slaves, but it was stolen. She said. Is there a way to remove it? You said. Sitting at her computer, Jessica looks the design of the collar. There are two ways to get it off. Hack it or fry it. She said. Which do you prefer? You said. I could hack this in my sleep, but there\u2019s a fail safe. Whoever put the collar on will know it\u2019s off. She said. And frying it? You said. It will require more electricity than it can put out to fry it circuits, but that will disable the fail safe. She said. So hacking it will be safer, but Kira will know. Frying it is dangerous, but the failsafe will fry as well. You said. I don\u2019t want him in pain\u2026. She said. But I doubt he wants Ash to know he\u2019s coming. I\u2019ll let him know. You said. If he decides to fry it, \u2026.tell him to come to me so I can moniter his condition. Shock collars are nasty things to deal with. She said. I\u2019ll give him the word. You said. You leave and head to the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pov<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuit squirming and listen. You said. Why? You plan on killing me! Kyle said. Not me. But someone is. You said. Why should I listen to you? You massacred my army and hospitalized my elites. He said. Because I\u2019m the only thing stopping you from becoming a plaything to a girl who wouldn\u2019t piss on you if you were on fire. You said. W\u2026.what do you mean? He said. The person who sent me wants to make sure you can\u2019t escape what\u2019s coming to you. You said. What are they paying you? I\u2019ll triple it! You said. Keep your money. You said dropping him. You see Arif come in. I\u2019ll do it for free. What did she say? You said. Two ways to get that collar off. Hack into it, but trigger the failsafe. Or fry it. Painful, but the failsafe is fried to. He said. What\u2019s the failsafe? You said. Kira will know it\u2019s off. You said. \u2026.Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. You said. You tug on the collar and shocked. ARGHHHHH! You said. You grit your teeth as you endure the electricity. After a minute, the electrocution stops and you pull it off. *Pant* *pant* Now Sue and her friends die. You said. Wait. These girls\u2026. I want them alive. Kyle said. What good are they to you? You said. They\u2019ve been a thorn in my side for too long. Plus, they\u2019re go against the natural order. Bring them to me alive\u2026. I\u2019ll pay you for it. He said. Arif. You have a problem with this? You said. \u2026\u2026Don\u2019t hurt Kim too much. He said. I\u2019ll be back. You said. You and Arif leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet to o district and stay there. You said. They won\u2019t go easily. He said. Let me deal with that. You keep your head down. You said. Jessica said she wants to see you. She wants to monitor your condition with the shock collar. He said. After this is done. I\u2019m going to crush Sue and everything she stands for. You said. </span></div></div>",

Sue\u2019s not here. You said. (All I want is Kira.) He said. You disappear and reappear behind them at 100ft and bonk there heads together. You kick Kira in the face a few times. You tie there hands and feet together and carry them back to the mansion. When you get there, you place them on the ground. Ugh\u2026. My head\u2026. Kira said. What\u2026happen? Kim said. Just desserts. You said. Kira\u2019s eyes go wide. How\u2026.did you get the collar off!? She said. Doesn\u2019t matter. I would have killed you both. Especially you! You said, punching Kira. But I\u2019ve been made an offer. You said. By who? Kim said. Me. Kyle said, walking up. You bastard! When I get free\u2026.! She said. Take it she\u2019s the one you referred to. He said. Where\u2019s Sue? You said. Where not telling you anything! Kira said. Go ahead and kill us! Rather die than be your prisoner! Kim said. Now that I think about it, I don\u2019t need you to talk. You said. You take a picture with your phone and send it to Ashley. She\u2019ll come running to this. Because resistance members stick together, right? After all, you only have each other. You said. You\u2026.asshole! How do you sleep at night? The both of you! Kim said. Like a baby. You and Kyle said. You head back to m district and wait a while until you see Sue. She stops when she sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you are. Took you long enough. You said. Where\u2026.are my friends? She said. With Kyle. Being interrogated and possibly re-educated. That\u2019ll teach them for slapping a collar on me! You said. You had it coming! She said. I didn\u2019t do anything to warrant a collar! You said. That\u2019s it right there. You didn\u2019t do anything! She said. I told you from day one I wanted nothing to do with your war. You just couldn\u2019t let it go. You said. I thought there was some good in you! But I guess I was wrong. She said. You\u2019re damn right. Now you\u2019re going to join your friends at Kyle\u2019s. You said. Oh. I\u2019m going there. After I beat you to within an inch of your life! She said. Good luck with that. You said behind her. You leg sweep her and elbow her into the ground. She gets up and you block her fist. You bend it and punch her. She hits the ground in frustration. Damnit! She said. Kyle said bring you to him alive. But I\u2019m going to pound you first. You said. She blocks your kick, but you punch her. Come on! Get up and be a hero! You said. You kick her again. Put a collar on me! You said pounding her in the face. You hit her some more before getting off her. Come on. Get up! I\u2019 not done yet. You said. Ashley gets up to her knees. You kick her, but she blocks it. You punch her, but she blocks it too. She pushes you away, and as she got to her feet, you notice marks appearing on her body. What the hell? You said. *Pant* *Pant* *Pant* I\u2019ll\u2026..kill you! She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe runs to you and you dodge her fist. You go for a body blow, but she blocks that and sweeps you from off your feet. You roll out the way when she tries to stomp your face. You see that shat made a small crater. You disappear and reappear right into her fist. She hits you hard enough to send you flying a mile away. You skid to a stop. (She\u2026..knew where I was going to be.) You thought. You get up and block her fist. (She came out of nowhere\u2026..) You said. You block her other fist. She blocks your attack and you do the same. It ends when you both locking hands in a struggle. I\u2019ll make sure no one remember you! She said. You push her away and she vanishes before you could attack. Where\u2026..? You said. As you look around, she appears behind you. You go to swing, but stop when you felt blows hitting your body. Hrg\u2026..! You said falling over. Ashley clenches her fist and you disappear and her fist hits the ground, making a huge hole. You reappear ready to attack, but she swing faster than you. She hits you in the gut and slams you into the ground. If that was a normal attack, you\u2019d get up, but for some reason, it hurts. Tremendously. (Why\u2026.does this hurt so much? What\u2026is she?) You said. Your body starts to heal, but taking all that damage has left you winded. You get to your feet. Ok\u2026. No more playing. You said. You power up to full. You charge at the and she blocks your attack. You roundhouse kick her and charge her. You both exchange powerful attacks. Just\u2026.DIE! She said. Not to you! You said. You shove her and punch her. She is sent flying and you disappear and reappear. You catch her and punch her into the ground. She gets up and was livid. Come on\u2026 You said. You both clash. Hitting each other, destroying the environment around you, knocking each other down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Huff* *Huff* *Huff.* (This is insane. She keeps getting back up.) You thought. She comes and you and intercpts your punch. You knee her and she round kicks you. Even though all your wounds are healed, fighting at full power is draining your stamina. (I can\u2019t keep this up forever\u2026. I\u2019ll wear myself out.) You thought. (Let me take over\u2026. You know you need me\u2026.) He said. (And put the world in danger? I don\u2019t think so\u2026. I\u2026just need a new plan of attack.) You said. She vanishes and you dodge her attack. But the second you touch the ground, she was right in front of you. You couldn\u2019t dodge her attack, so you block it. The force of the hit sent you back and you land on the ground. (She hits like a fright train.) You thought. Your vision starts to go blurry. You take off your mask and your vision is suddenly clear. Huh\u2026? You said. You sense an attack from behind and block it. You grab her arm and push her to the side so you can get up. Grrrr! She said. She vanishes and\u2026.you see her moving behind you. You kick her just as she appears. She looks at you with an angry expression, but it turns to shock when she sees three tick marks in your eyes. Y\u2026..you\u2026! The\u2026.! She said before you punch her in the gut with extreme force. Ack\u2026..! She said. You send her flying in the air and disappear and reappear and knock her back down. She hits the ground with a tremendous crash. You pull your arm out of her gut and see it heal almost in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh\u2026. You said. You put your mask back on. You look to see the marks on her body fade away. You check her pulse to see that she\u2019s still alive. He\u2019ll\u2026.betray you. Ashley said. You still talking? You said. You think\u2026..the master will just\u2026..let you go? He won\u2019t let\u2026..another man have power\u2026.. He said. Right. Like you\u2019re any better. You said. I\u2019m fighting for something\u2026..other than myself\u2026.. More than I can say for you. All you care about is yourself\u2026..and money. \u2026..I thought there was\u2026..no one worse than the master\u2026.. But you\u2019ve proven me wrong. You\u2019re the absolute worst\u2026.! She said. I\u2019ll take that as a compliment. You said. You knock her out, bind her and carry her to Kyle\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kick open the door and toss Ashley with the others. Ashley! Kim said. You shrink down. That\u2019s all of them. You said. Looks like it wasn\u2019t easy. He said. A few hiccups, but nothing major. He said. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t give you anything. He said. He hands you 50,000 dollars in cash. (Private island. Here I come.) He said. Is that how much your soul\u2019s worth? A few thousand dollars!? Kira said. You need a soul to lose it. You said leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head to o district and find Arif. Holy shit\u2026. You look terrible. Ash didn\u2019t go easy on you. He said. I\u2019ll be fine. Here. You said. You hand him half of your cash. You know, it took every once of me not to beat down Kyle when I saw him. He said. I saw it on your face. Kyle can have his fantasy world of women at the top, but we\u2019re going to make our own lives. Dictated by no one but ourselves. You said. No other way to live. He said.</span></div></div>",

When that was done, m district was easy pickings. Without Ashley and her friends, m district quickly fell. No stone was left unturned. Every single man there was captured and placed in the prison. Rumors spread that you helped the master in his conquest. They were mad at Kyle for betraying them, but what you did made you public enemy number 1. But you didn\u2019t care. If there was anyone to blame, it themselves. That\u2019s what you thought. They weren\u2019t strong enough to fight, so they get what they deserve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re on a rooftop in m district. Completely deserted\u2026. You said. (They were through. They say we\u2019re worse than Kyle now.) He said. (Like I care.) You said. You leave M district and head to the prison. You walk inside the prison and look around until you find Ashley in a cell. You holding up in there, Sue? You said. Saying that she\u2019s angry at you would be an understatement. If it wasn\u2019t for those bars, she\u2019d come at you. At least they\u2019re feeding you. But I can\u2019t imagine the torture they\u2019re putting you through. You said. She grits her teeth and snarls. Looks like the re-education is working. You\u2019re acting just like those preteens. You said.  Ashley calms herself down. Looks like you need some more. I\u2019d love to stay, but I got things to do. You said. \u2026..You know, there is a lot to life I don\u2019t know about\u2026.. But there is one thing I know for sure. You\u2019re going to suffer pain, loss, and betrayal. Just like all of us. And when you\u2019re at your lowest point, there\u2019s going to be no one there for you. No one to pull you out of the darkness. I hope you suffer the worst pain and suffering this world has! She said. That\u2019s ominous. But that kind of pain has no effect on someone with nothing and no one. You said. Lying to yourself\u2026.. You\u2019ll find out. People like you always get theirs. She said. Goes to show you don\u2019t know who I am or what I\u2019ve been through. You said. You head out and leave. (That was\u2026.interesting. Looks like we won\u2019t be friends with Sue at all.) He said. (That was never going to happen. She\u2019s a bleeding heart.) He said. (Reminds me of\u2026\u2026Narue.) He said. (Don\u2019t compare Sue to Narue. Stark difference between compassion and bleeding heart.) You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back to m district. So how\u2019s the whole mayor thing? You said. Who am I going to govern? The rats? You said. A lot more useful. You said. I take it Ashley\u2019s not happy. He said. Livid. You said. And Kim? Is she\u2026..doing ok? He said. I didn\u2019t go see the other two. But you can go see her and tell her you like her. You said. You think she\u2019ll understand!? I mean! I don\u2019t like her. N\u2026.not like that! More as\u2026.. What\u2019s the word? He said. Girlfriend? You said. You can see us together? I mean! That\u2019s not it! He said. Arif, you can lie to me, but not yourself. You know your heart beats for her. You said. In a world like this, love is the last thing I thought would get me. He said. I can brake her out. If you want. You said. Then it would be awkward. Plus, I know Kim. She\u2019s already thinking of a way to get out. He said. Flowers and chocolate. Throw in a teddy bear if you want the extra points. You said. I don\u2019t think I can find flowers pretty enough for her. D\u2026. Did I just say that out loud? He said. Yep. And your toughness has gone down by ten. You said. You laugh as Arif looks away in shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you head back to Mira\u2019s. You don\u2019t get through the door before Miley comes running. Miley. You said. Hey\u2026. How\u2019d you get like this? She said. You didn\u2019t think I would stay small forever, did you? You said. But you can\u2019t be my little brother like this. She said. Sure I can. You said. You will?! Thank you! She said. Miley hugs you as Mira shows up.  So\u2026. You\u2019re back. She said. Give us a minute, Miley. You said. Miley runs to her room. She sees you as family. She said. She likes me. You said. That makes one of us. She said. Come on. You still mad at what I said? That was over a month ago. You said. You said you didn\u2019t need a worrywart like me. So I took the hint. She said. Doesn\u2019t mean you have to act like you hate me. You said. I don\u2019t hate you, but you obviously don\u2019t want me to like you. She said. You talk like you hate me. You said. Why do you care? She said. Cause home is where the heart is. You said. So this is home to you? She said. Don\u2019t say it like that. Miley likes having me around. You said. You don\u2019t treat her like you treat me. She said. Come on. You aren\u2019t giving me a fair chance here. You said. Over a month in and you still act like we first met. She said. It\u2019s hard to adjust. You said. How? I treat you with respect, I don\u2019t threaten you, make you do anything you don\u2019t want to, what else is there I need to do? Walk around half or fully naked. She said. \u2026\u2026Is that a legit option? You said. \u2026..Pervert. She said blushing. Point is, I\u2019ve treated you with the utmost and you still have a stick in your ass. She said. I can be easy going and all that. I just don\u2019t show it. She said. Why not? She said. If you haven\u2019t notice, your kind isn\u2019t the friendliest. Killing, enslaving, eating, mutilating, and that\u2019s all before noon. You said. So you see me like one of those sadists? She said. I didn\u2019t say you. But nine out of ten isn\u2019t a good number. You said.  Miley? She said. Eight out of ten. Sill isn\u2019t good. You said. Which bring me back to my original question: What else do I need to do? She said. I don\u2019t know. Kiss me? You said. Mira walks up to you, takes your mask off and plants one on you. You could feel her tongue invading your mouth. (Damn\u2026..) He said. After a minute, she breaks it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat do it? She said. I was actually being sarcastic about that. You said, putting your mask back on. Y\u2026..you were? She said, stunned. Of course. I didn\u2019t think you would actually do it. And where did you learn to kiss like that? On your pillow? You said. T\u2026. That\u2019s not important! She said, blushing. (This one is full of surprises\u2026. I think I\u2019ll let her live.) He said. (Because you\u2019re crushing hard on Miley.) You said. (\u2026..So?) He said. (Aww. There is a heart in you.)

Not like this. Shrink back down first. She said. (What is this kid planning?) You thought. (Do it.) He said. Using your armband, you shrink back down. Perfect! This will make it easier to play! She said. Miley reaches for you and your hand was on your knife\u2019s hilt. Her fingers wrap around you and you\u2019re lifted up to her smiling face. This\u2026.is a different perspective. Joanna was one thing, I knew what she\u2019d would do. But this\u2026. You said. Hehe! You\u2019re even cuter in my hand! She said. Try\u2026.to not let it go to your head. You said. But you\u2019re so cute! I can\u2019t help it! She said. S-so what are we playing here? You said. Don\u2019t sound like that. You won\u2019t get hurt at all. And you\u2019re going to love it! She said, smiling. (A smile that big. I\u2019ve seen that smile before.) You said. (All the things Joanna did to you.) He said. (Yeah. She\u2019s about to\u2026..) Before you could finish, you were pressed against Miley\u2019s lips. Mwah! She said. She kisses you multiple times, smothering you against her soft lips. Mwah! I call it the kissing game! I kiss you until I think you had enough! She said. For the next 5 minutes, you\u2019re assaulted by Miley lips. When she finally stops, she laughs. Told you that you\u2019d love it. She said. It was\u2026..something. You said. Let\u2019s play like this next time! She said. Sure\u2026. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning the spit from your mask and suit, you get a message on your phone. Unknown? \u201cI think it\u2019s time we meet. Follow the broken highway out of o district. Come alone\u201d It said. (Someone wants our attention.) He said. (From the tone of the message, it\u2019s not Sue.) You said. (Maybe it\u2019s the benefactor who\u2019s sent all his money to the army.) He said. (Only one way to find out.) You said. You head out to o district, but not before telling Arif.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone sent you a message to meet you out of beyond o district? He said. Yeah. You said. Only a few people have been gone past o district. He said. Is it dangerous? You said. No one has come back to say what\u2019s out there. Not even Kyle\u2019s elites go past o district. They\u2019ll go in the ocean, but not pass the o district border. He said. They must think I can survive to get to them. You said. I don\u2019t think you should go alone. He said. Said I had to. Like you said, don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there. You said. How long will it be? He said. Don\u2019t know. A few hours, days, weeks, or even months. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be back to be best man in your wedding to Kim. You said. Arif blushes as you laugh. See you later. You said. You head into o district and see the highway. Still intact and standing. But piece of it missing. You said. You start walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk, you see destroyed cars and crushed cars. Along with a few bloodstains. Blood\u2019s all dried. This must have happen a long time ago. You said. You keep going until you reach the end of the long highway. Damn. This place makes o district look nice. You said. You see long mutilated bodies, skeletons, dried blood, and bodies with no heads. You look around to see the buildings are in a horrible state. Dilapidated and crumbling down. Man. This makes what the women do look sane. You said. (Who do you think did this in the first place?) He said. (No sane person would do this?) You said. (You think these girls are sane?) He said. (Far from it. But this is another level.) You said. You cell phone goes off. \u201cEnough sightseeing. Get to the center.\u201d He said. You walk into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in f district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the prison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhhhh! Ashley said, screaming. We\u2019ve been at this for hours. Why don\u2019t you tell me what I want to know? Kyle said. I told you\u2026.. I don\u2019t know him. She said. Same story from your friends. You think we\u2019ll believe that? Kouyki said. It\u2019s the damn truth. No one knows the guy. Ashley said. One of you knows for sure. Amy said. She punches Ashley in the gut. Even though Amy was shorter than Ashley, the serum she took made her stronger. Who is he!? And how is he so strong? She said. Like I said, I don\u2019t know\u2026.. Ashley said. Amy. Stop. She\u2019s right. Kyle said. She\u2019s lying. I know one of these three know something! She said. We\u2019ve been torturing them for days, and all of them say the same thing. Luna said. If they don\u2019t know him personally, then they must know someone who does. Yumi said. Talk. Who does he hang out with? Amy said. You think\u2026..I keep tabs on him? Ashley said. All of you know each other. Who does he be around the most? Amy said. I\u2026..don\u2019t know. Ashley said. We\u2019re getting nowhere with her, Amy. Let\u2019s question the other two. Kyle said. Amy walks over to Kira. She gets her a nasty look as Amy sits her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does he know? Amy said. As much as I hate him, I hate you more. I\u2019m not telling you a damn thing\u2026. Kira said. Amy hits Kira and she falls down. Ashley was getting mad. She didn\u2019t care if they hurt her, but Kim and Kira, she couldn\u2019t stand seeing hurt. Amy beats on Kira until Kim shouts stop. What? Amy said. I said stop. I\u2026..know who he spends his time around. Kim said. Who? Who is it!? Amy shouted. \u2026..Arif. His name is Arif. She said. Wait. The guy who came into my mansion? Kyle said. If he he looked like trouble, yeah. That\u2019s him. Kim said. Where is he? Koyuki said. Around this time\u2026.. He\u2019s usually walking around m district. She said. Girls. Find him and bring him here. With a nod, each one of the elites head to m district. I\u2019m so sorry, Arif\u2026. Kim said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to your pov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis looks like the center. You said, getting another message. \u201cTook long enough. Don\u2019t just stand out in the open. Find a secure place.\u201d It said. (Could have told us in the last one.) He said. You look at the crumbling buildings and find one that is stable. You head inside and get a text. \u201cSun is setting. Too dangerous to move at night. Stay there until daybreak.\u201d It said. Looks like I\u2019m camping here. You said. You put some rubble and wood together and make a fire. You sit next to the fire and taken in what happen today. (This person better have a really good explanation for making us camp out like hobos.) He said. (Has to be if they want us to come to this place. You don\u2019t bring someone here for nothing.) You said.</span></div></div>",

You said. Shut up! Amy said, squezzing you. Argh! You said. Arif! Stop it! Kim said. Amy. Kyle said. Ay loosen her grip. Alright\u2026. You got my attention, Kyle. What is it that you want? You said. The guy you hang out. Who and what is he? Luna said. You think I know? You said. Your friend here says you\u2019re around him the most. Yumi said. I know as much about him as he likes Ash. And that\u2019s nothing. You said. Really? You seem buddy-buddy with him when you were in my mansion. Kyle said. He was only like that because I\u2019m close with these three. You and your stupid plans, Kira! You said. At least I did something! She said. Enough! You. How is he so powerful? Koyuki said. How would I know? He doesn\u2019t tell me anything. You said. He must have told you something! Amy said. He didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t even know his name. But I know that crossing him isn\u2019t good for your life. And that money is his sole love. These three should know that. You said. So none of you know a single thing? Kyle said. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been saying\u2026. Ash said. If that\u2019s the case, we should do something about them. Luna said. And what\u2019s that? Mind control collars? More torture? Execute us in the arena? Ashley said. All of them great ideas. I say execution. Yumi said. Even if we did, we\u2019d still have him to deal with. Soya said. I have an idea. Where is he now? Kyle said. He\u2019s gone. You said. Gone?! What do you mean gone? Answer me!! Amy said. He left. I don\u2019t know where. Like I said, he doesn\u2019t tell me anything. You said. Then we need to bring him back. Kyle said. And how are you going to do that, master? He cares about nothing and no one. Ashley mocks. He might not care for you three, but for this guy\u2026. He must care for you to a point. Kyle said. Don\u2019t even think about it\u2026.! Kim said. W-we\u2019re going to bring him back here!? Soya said.  Of course. That way we get rid of all of them one stroke. Koyuki said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to your pov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re laying on the cold ground with sound of fire crackling. As you sleep, you hear a voice. Huh\u2026.? You said. You sit up and hear the voice calling your name. Who\u2019s there\u2026.? You said. You got up and look around. You hear the voice again and it sounds like\u2026..Chijinda. Chijinda\u2026..? You said. You see him standing in the distance. Wha\u2026.!? You said. You take off your mask and rub your eyes. But he\u2019s still standing there. C\u2026.Chijinda\u2026.. You said. He turns and walks away. W\u2026.wait! You said. You quickly run after him. (Ugh\u2026. What\u2019s all the racket? I need my beauty sleep.) He said. (Joke later. I just saw Chijinda.) You said. (Again with this?) He said. (I\u2019m sure it\u2019s him this time.) You said. You run after him and cut the corner, but he\u2019s gone. Where\u2026.? You said. You see him standing further away. He looks at you and walks away. Chijinda! Wait! It\u2019s dangerous here! You said, running after him. When you turn the corner, he\u2019s gone. This is a dead end. Where did he go!? You said. You look around and look outside and see him standing in the street. You quickly jump out and chase after him. Chijinda! Stop! You said. Your voice reaches him and he stops. Finally\u2026.. This place is dangerous. We shouldn\u2019t- You\u2019re interrupted by a searing pain in your head. Argh! You said gripping it. It subsides after a few seconds, but Chijinda\u2019s gone. Chijinda! You shout. (I keep telling you. You\u2019re chasing the wind.) He said. (I know what I saw. It\u2019s him. Looked like him, smell like him, even his smile. Right down to a T.) You said. (I see everything you do. I hear what you hear. And feel what you feel. I saw nothing while you were running. I\u2019m telling you you\u2019re chasing thin air.) He said. (But\u2026. I saw him clear as day. If you can\u2019t see him\u2026.. Then\u2026.. Am I hallucinating?) You said. Your thoughts are interrupted by a bellowing roar. That\u2026.doesn\u2019t sound friendly. You said. The ground shakes as the roaring becomes louder. You wait and see it\u2019s a preteen. When she sees you, she lets out a thundering roar.(So they\u2019re this far out too.) You said. (This one\u2019s different.) He said. (Meaning?) You said. (The others are sadistic. This one seems\u2026.feral.) He said. (Feral? Why would she go feral?) You said. (There are always those who take things too far. Here she comes.) He said. She reaches for you and you disappear. She looks surprised and you reappear on her shoulder. You punch her on the jaw and she hits the ground with a loud thud. You land on the ground and dust off as you get a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just alerted the horde.\u201d It said. (There goes my beauty sleep.) He said. \u201cGo back into hiding and stay there until daybreak.\u201d A new message said. (This person is bossy.) You thought. You hear multiple roars from all directions. You quickly run into a dilapidated building as the ground shakes violently. You peek out to see a few dozen of them. Holy\u2026. That\u2019s a lot of them. You said. (They sure know how to accessorize. Bone necklaces.) He said. (Puts everything kyle and his goons do in perspective.) You said. You cell phone goes off. \u201cYou\u2019re close. We\u2019ll meet in the morning.\u201d It said. Finally. Going to get some answers. You said. You duck down as one of the savages pass by and stay there for the night. </span></div></div>",

You get a message on your phone. \u201cHead down the next ally. Blue door. Top floor.\u201d It said. You walk until you come to the ally and see the door. You open it and head up a flight of stairs until you reach the top floor. Finally. You\u2019re here. A voice said over an intercom. I take it you\u2019re the one who sending the messages. You said. Not how I prefer to handle things, but the only way to reach you. I bet you have plenty of questions. I will answer them. He said. A buzzer goes off and the door unlocks. You open the door to a well furnished room and see a milled aged man sitting at a desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo. I can finally put a face to you. You said. So can i. When I heard that someone was giving Ashley a hard time, I had to know who. He said. So you know Sue. Does that mean you\u2019re m districts benefactor? You said. I am. All the supplies and weapons come out of my pockets. He said. So that\u2019s how they were able to rebuild so fast. Wait. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to be in m district and not here? You said. Nobody will come after me here. I have a lot enemies, and you\u2019re the only one brave enough to come here. He said. No different than what I usually deal with. But what\u2019s the reason you called me out here? You said. Ashley\u2019s been ranting about some guy with tremendous strength being selfish. Being able to knock anyone out in one punch and moving like the wind. He said. She\u2019s not wrong. Why should I help Mary Sue and her band? You said. She also said you worked with Kyle. He said. Kyle offered me something. You said. Scratch my back, I\u2019ll scratch yours. You remind me of someone just like that. He said. Save story time for later. Did Sue put you up to this? You said. No. This was all me. I\u2019m brought you here to help you. He said. Help me? With what? You said. That darkness in you. He said. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to preach to me like Sue did. You said. Not that darkness. Your other half. He said. My other\u2026. You mean\u2026. How do you\u2026.!? You said. I know a lot about you. You\u2019re not as mysterious as you think. He said. And what else do you know? You said. I know your dark half wants to take over your body. I know you don\u2019t want to make friends because of fear of suffering another tragic loss. And that you\u2019re looking for solace for that tragic loss. Am I right? He said. His knowledge of you freaks you out as much as it surprises you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you know all that? You said. Someone\u2019s been keeping an eye on you. But I will let him make himself known. But I know that even though you and your dark half act like you\u2019re on the same page, you\u2019re both plotting on how to do each other in. He said. Ah\u2026! You both said. Your power alone can destroy the planet. And his many more. I\u2019m not going to tell you what to do with that power, but it will rip you apart if you two don\u2019t get on the same page. He said. \u2026..You have no idea what he can do if he gets out. You said. Can\u2019t be any worse than the world is now. He said. He\u2019ll make Kyle look like a saint. You said. That\u2019s a stretch. But you know that I\u2019m right. He said. \u2026..What do I do first? You said. Break the seal. He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner psyche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up the gate. Get out here. You said. You see glowing red eyes as he walks up to you. He\u2019s a spitting image of you. Except his taste for death and destruction is bottomless. Heh. How long since your last visit? He said. Since you fucked up my face. You said. A few scars never hurt anyone. You\u2019re really going to do what this man said? He said. If it gets you under control. You said. And what\u2019s stopping me from just taking your body? He said. I expect nothing less. You won\u2019t succeed like last time. You said. Joanna and Blake aren\u2019t here. You sure about this? He said. I can handle you. You said. I\u2019m not one of these preteens. He said. I know what you are. And I\u2019m ready for you this time. You said. You overpower the force on the gate and it opens. He appears right in front of you. Then let\u2019s begin. He said. He hits you in the gut and kicks you away. You hit the ground and roll back up standing. You disappear and reappear behind him and catch his arm. Gotcha! You said. You knee him and send him flying with a punch. You disappear and slam him down into the ground. He gets right back up. Hehehe! Nice move there. I think we should quit warming up. And get right to the real fight. He said. He powers up. Ugh\u2026..! This is what I was afraid of\u2026. You said, powering up as well. Both of your power gets high enough to see each others aura. That dark red haunts me\u2026. You mutter. Don\u2019t keep me waiting. Let me enjoy myself before I take what\u2019s mine. He said. </span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve improved since the last time. He said. I knew day like this would come. Just earlier than I thought. You said. No amount of training can prepare you for me, but it\u2019s a nice gesture. He said. That\u2019s what you think. I\u2019ve learned since our last fight. You said. You push him off and roundhouse kick behind you and hit him. He slides on the ground and handstands back up. Hmph. Looks like you did learn one of my tricks. But there\u2019s plenty more. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside.<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t hear me, but you must know that this isn\u2019t a last man standing. You must become one with yourself. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside.<br>\r\nYou deflect a blast and he tanks it. Let me show you how it\u2019s done. He said. He fires a blast at you. You dodge it and are kneed in the gut. Ack! You said. He pulls his arm back and punches you in the ground. Your whole insides feel like jello and all your ribs are broken. The pain is intense as your bode quickly heals itself. You get up, but the fight has taken it\u2019s toll. You\u2019re still not ready for me. Now I take my prize. He said. He charges at you, but you smile when he gets close. You dodge him. Ugh! He said. He braced for an attack, but instead, you grab him. W\u2026.what are you doing?! He said. You know\u2026.. It\u2019s hard for me to\u2026.admit when I\u2019m wrong. But I was. All this time I thought I needed to lock you away or beating you down. But\u2026. That\u2019s not it. We\u2019d fight for eternity. The only way to beat you\u2026. Is to accept you as a part of me! You said. Ugh! He said. You both glow in a bright light and are engulfed in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes. Well? He said. You take of your mask and he sees one eye normal and the other red. Very good. He said. Grrr\u2026. This isn\u2019t over. He said. Your eye goes back to normal. How do you feel? The man said. I feel\u2026.different. Like I\u2019m finally whole. You said. This is only the first step. Now, you two have to work together and learn to share and trust each other. Easier said than done. He-Ah! You said as your eye turns red. I don\u2019t share anything with anyone. He said. First time for everything. Now. We have work to do. First thing: Trust. You have to trust each other. You can\u2019t go or do anything without an establish trust first. He said. So\u2026.what do I do? You said. Your dark half has to trust you in giving over control to him. While you have to trust your dark half to do the same. Give him what he wants? He\u2019s not going to relinquish control once he gets it. You said. Let\u2019s see what he does. He said. Reluctantly, you give your body over to him. Your eyes turn red. Finally\u2026.. After all this time. He said. Intriguing. The switch was smooth. The man said. And so will the cut I make across your neck. He said. Violent. I expect nothing less of a manifestation of anger. The man said. He had so much how could it not? Things will get done no-Rgh\u2026.! He said as you gain control of your body. You can\u2019t do it like that. You have to trust each other. He said. He can\u2019t be trusted. You heard what he said. He said. He\u2019s full of steam. Wanton destruction doesn\u2019t interest him. Now. Give him control. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days go by, you follow the man\u2019s advice. Slowly trusting your dark half with control over your body. Your dark half was slower than you in this. Opposing every time he could. But their was a problem at home\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm. He should have come running by now. Kyle said. That liar\u2026.! I\u2019ll grind him into the ground for this! Amy said. He\u2019s still useful. If we kill him, we loss our trump card. Kyle said. Master! Yumi said, running into the mansion. What is it? Kyle said. The man gave us more information. He said his friend went past the o district border. She said. What!? Past the border?! Even he wouldn\u2019t! Kyle said. Then our problem is taken care of. No one who goes pass the border is seen again. We can turn our attention to the traitors. Koyuki said. No! I was suppose to kill him! Amy said. W-we\u2019re aren\u2019t sure. I mean, he fought our army by himself. If he can do that\u2026. Soya said. I\u2019m not saying anything until I see a body. Luna said. How will we know if he\u2019s dead? No one is crazy enough to go pass the border. No one\u2019s been in the past years. Soya said. Then we forward the message. Kyle said. Forward? W-we\u2019re going out there!? Yumi said. No. But he went out there for a reason. Something or someone called him out there. Get ready to broadcast. Kyle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to your pov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcellent. You two finally trust each other. The man said. Wouldn\u2019t say fully, but we have an understanding. You said. Now. The next two will build off that bond. You both have your own powers, but together. You\u2019re unmatched. Combine your power with his. He said. How? You said. That one you did when Beth disintegrated. You said. It took a lot out of me to do that. You said. Do that, but half of it yours and his. He said. You concentrate your power and bright, half white and half dark ball of energy forms. Very good. Now. Throw it. He said. You throw it at a building and it disintegrates into nothing. You trust each other to share a body and powers. We\u2019ll come back at night to do the next step. He said. You both head back to his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must admit. This is going smoother than I originally thought. He said. He\u2019s doing it out of convenience. He thinks he\u2019s hot shit. Anything to improve his ego. You said. You said he was all your bad qualities rolled into one. He said. Didn\u2019t think ego was a part of it. You said. We all have that, you just never had a reason to show it. He said. As you take a seat, you see his tv flash on. What the hell? Kyle and his goons. And is that\u2026.Arif!? You said. Haven\u2019t seen Kyle since he became master. He said. Alright, hero. You see who we\u2019ve got. Koyuki said. You are making the biggest mistake of your lives. If he doesn\u2019t kill you, I will! Arif said. Quiet! Koyuki said. She closes her hand around Arif and squeezes. If you aren\u2019t dead out there and want him alive, come to x prison. She said. And just in case you\u2019re making friends out there, come alone. Yumi said. The screen goes blank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere\u2019s the best place to dig 5 unmarked graves? You said. You\u2019ve got to know it\u2019s a trap. He said. Traps work both ways. You said. You know what\u2019s going to happen, and you and your dark half aren\u2019t completely on the same page yet. But you\u2019re going to go anyway. He said. Arif\u2019s my friend. I\u2019ll turn that place upside down to find him. You said. \u2026\u2026Very well. He said. You leave the building and head onto the highway back to o district.</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s just one man! A guard said. When she came at you, you stab her in the stomach. She looks down and back at you and you slice her neck and push her down. You stare down the others and they run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk past the cells, the men in them were either cheering or backing away to get away from you.

You said. Screw\u2026.you! She said. You picked her up and slam her into the wall. Then threw her into the adjacent wall. Ok. Ok! They\u2019re further in! She said. Be more specific! You said, holding your knife to her neck. The meeting hall! They\u2019re in the meeting hall! She said. Kill! Kill! Kill! You heard. The men in the cells were chanting. The women watched them be killed in the arena. Now it was there turn. Kill! Kill! Kill! They chanted. (Give the crowd what they want\u2026) He said. You plunge your knife into her as the men cheered. You pull it out and throw her on the ground. (Now I see the attraction the arena has.) You thought. You head to the meeting hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked you came across a cell with three people you know too well. Well\u2026 Look who it is. Kira said. (A cell? I was hoping for a public execution.) He said. Heard you went past the border. Find what you need out there? Maybe a heart or some decency? Kim said. You\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t take your heart. You said. What do you want? Gloat? Ashley said. I don\u2019t have time to deal with you, Sue. Or your merry band of misfits. I need to find Arif. You said. Arif\u2026 Why?! What\u2019s happened to him?! What did you do?! Answer me! Kim said. You pull her head into the bars and she falls down. Sweet dreams, thot. You said. You walk away from the cell and continue on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find the room labeled meeting room and kick it open; catching the elites attention. Guess we can\u2019t put the rumors to rest. Yumi said. You draw your knife. H-He\u2019s going to kill us! I knew this was a mistake! Soya said. He won\u2019t do a thing if he cares for this worthless man. Koyuki said. You see her holding Arif in her hand. One more step, and I crush him! She said. D-Don\u2019t provoke him! Soya said. Don\u2019t worry about me\u2026. Put these bitches in the ground! Arif said. I said quiet! Koyuki said. She closes her fingers around him and squeeze him. You thinking I\u2019m joking? I will kill him. She said. (Looks like I got no choice.) You thought. You raise your foot and stomp the ground, creating a massive earthquake. As the ground shakes, Koyuki drops Arif. You catch him and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrink back down and make your way outside. Guessing\u2026\u2026you do care. He said. Why wouldn\u2019t i? We\u2019re getting out of here. You said. You make it outside and see a van waiting. What is this doing here? Never mind. You said. You put Arif in the back, get in and drive. Where\u2026..are we going? He said. To an acquittance. You said. You drive all the way back to the building . You get Arif out and help him. So this is what lies past the border? Makes o district look up to code. He said. You help him into the building and up the stairs. You kick open the door and set him down on the couch. I take it when well. The man said.  Yeah. You have any medical supplies? You said. I\u2019m fine\u2026. Wait. I\u2019ve seen you before. You\u2019re Sinclair. Arif said. You know him? You said. Only that he has an endless fortune. He said. I wouldn\u2019t say endless. I just know where to put my money. Sinclair said. So you\u2019re M district\u2019s benefactor. I wonder if Ashley knew? Arif said. Speaking of Ashley, I don\u2019t think you saved her. He said. They left during the confusion. If I know them, they escaped with all the men they could carry. You said. Then we\u2019re back to square one. Sinclair said. An important man like you must have a reason to being out here. He said he has a lot of enemies. You said. You wanted protection? Arif said. I have my own security. But I\u2019ll let him tell you the reason. Sinclair said. What does he mean? Arif said. It\u2019s a long story\u2026.. You said.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re not from this world, and you have an inner evil that can take over your body, and you have a lot more power than you\u2019re letting on. He said. More or less. I don\u2019t know how Sinclair knows about it. You said. It\u2019s all true, Arif. He\u2019s more powerful than you think. He just doesn\u2019t want to show it because it will draw attention. Sinclair said. I can see why. If Kyle found out about a person who can shoot energy beams from his hands\u2026. Arif said. Or Sue. Who knows what she\u2019d do. You said. Ashley\u2019s always had good intentions, but she does get carried away. She almost implemented a curfew for us. He said. We can discuss who\u2019s the lesser evil later. Right now, we\u2019re behind schedule. Sinclair said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days go by and you\u2019ve been learning more and more. You and your dark half aren\u2019t on the same plane yet, but you both know that this benefits you both. As you were out practicing, you felt that someone was near. You turn around to see a 20 year old woman dressed boots, long, brown hair, a coat covering her breast, dark pants. Found you\u2026. She said. You want a cookie? You don\u2019t look like one of Kyle\u2019s. Sue sent you? You said. Ashley wanted to come out to find you, but didn\u2019t want to send a lot of people out here. She said. And she picked you. Great\u2026. What does she want? You said. You and your associates out here are coming with me. She said. Heh. Someone thinks highly of themselves. You really think you have a shot? You said. I\u2019ll take you by force if I have to. She said. Heard that before. I don\u2019t have time for you. You said. You turn and walk away, but she\u2019s appears in front of you. (What the?) You thought. You\u2019re not getting away that easily. She said. I\u2019m not wasting my time on you or Sue. You said. You disappear, but reappear in her hand. What the?! How did you do that!? You said. You aren\u2019t escaping me. I will you force if I have to. She said. (There\u2019s something up with this one\u2026.) He said. (Being able to catch me like that\u2026.. She\u2019s not one of the standards.) \u2026..Fine. But you wanted this. You said. You disappear and reappear on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou disappear and attack her, but she vanishes. What? You said. You\u2019re suddenly grabbed and slammed into the ground. That smarts\u2026. Now it\u2019s my turn. You said. You disappear and reappear behind her and she blocks your kick. You turn and kick her again, but she blocks. You use your arm to stop your fall and she punches you in the side. Ack\u2026.! You said. She then kicks you in the side and you are sent a few feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Why are you playing with her? Kick her ass!) He said. (She knows all my tricks and moves. I even tried my speed attacks, but she saw right through them.) You said. (Then blast her to the moon!) He said. (I\u2019m not using them.) You said. You get to your feet and are grabbed and placed in her open hand. You can\u2019t win. Surrender. She said. You\u2019re quick to call it. I\u2019m not done yet! You said. She raises her hand over you and it starts glowing faintly. I don\u2019t want to hurt you. But if you won\u2019t yield\u2026.. She said. (This chick is full of herself. I need a plan of action\u2026.!) You thought. (Enough of this! Move over!) He said. Your body is forcibly taken over and your eyes glow red. You build up energy in your hands. What? She said. You fire the energy at her face and she moves her hand to block it. When she puts it down, you\u2019re gone. What the? Where did he go? She said. She senses someone behind her and she blocks an explosive punch. The force behind it sends her back. You walk out of the smoke with raging energy in your hands. Wh\u2026.. How are you\u2026. What are you? She said. You blast her and she moves out the way. You rush her and she blocks, but is hit from the side. (What? How did he hit me? I saw through his movement.) She thought. When she lands on the ground, you appear in front of her with your hand near her chest. \u2026\u2026Heh. You said. You blast her and she\u2019s engulfed in a giant red energy wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke clears, you see her on one knee with her clothes tattered . Ugh\u2026.. She said. She looks at you. I\u2026.. You\u2026. She said. I\u2019ll send you straight to hell. He said. You build up energy in your hand. I\u2026. need to get away\u2026.. Solaris! She said. There is a bright flash that blinds you. Ahh! Can\u2019t\u2026..see\u2026.! He said. While he\u2019s blind, she makes her escape. When you\u2019re sight returns, she\u2019s gone. Rghhh! Bitch\u2026. He said. You take your body back. (You just made us public enemy number one.) You said. (I\u2019m not dying because you\u2019re afraid of being found out.) He said. (You have no idea what power mad people like Kyle will do to get this power.) You said. (Won\u2019t need to if you bury him.) He said. </span></div></div>",

You said. You look like you got thrashed a bit. He said. A few mistakes here and there. Won\u2019t happen again. You said. Don\u2019t tell me Ashley came here and almost kicked your ass. He said. Not Sue, but she\u2019s a friend of hers. She was\u2026.different. You said. How so? He said. Every where I moved, she was there. It was like I was standing still. You said. Arif perks up. You didn\u2019t\u2026.see any weapons on her, did you? He said. I notice a holster on her hip, but she didn\u2019t use any guns. You said. Anything else you notice? He said. I felt\u2026.like I was standing in front of dread and sorrow. You said. Ugh\u2026\u2026! I thought Ashley left them behind\u2026.. Arif mutters. Arif? You said. I\u2026.don\u2019t know this one. But we should get ready just in case she comes back. He said. You think she\u2019ll come back? You said. Yeah. And if you showed off, she\u2019s not coming back alone. He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Arif stakeout the bridge. Ok. If she\u2019s with Sue, no way is she bringing the army. You said. Let\u2019s not rule that out just yet. Let\u2019s have some options. He said. Ok. That highway isn\u2019t stable. No way the army could get across. You said. The only way they could get her is with the navy. He said. How would they get here? This body of water is isolated. You said. Ships are like Tonka toys to them. Ashley or any girl could pick one up and break it like a twig. He said. So let\u2019s say the navy does come. What are we looking at? You said. Ash isn\u2019t going to risk lives on this. Navy comes, missiles away. He said. How powerful? You said. Nuclear. He said. If they have that, why are they having a hard time? You said. Leaves nothing but a few scratches. He said. And the radiation? You said. No effect. He said. Ok. So Sue and her band and the navy armed with nuclear missiles. A tall order\u2026. But I think we can handle. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both wait an hour before you see something. Sue and her friend are crossing the water now. Barely past their ankles. You said. You see a ship? He said. They aren\u2019t carrying anything. I only see those two. You said. Guess Ashley took it to heart. He said. They\u2019re on ground. I\u2019ll let them look first. You said. You look out at them when you notice something in the air. I\u2026.Is that a UAV? You said. Out here? He said. The UAV circles over you. Well, they know about us now. You said. Can\u2019t hide with that up. Not even inside. They have thermals and infrared. He said. Still can make them work for it. You can\u2019t say you don\u2019t like messing with Sue. You said. Before she got onto me. He said. Then let\u2019s enjoy ourselves. You said. You both come out of hiding and head into a building at random. You wait a few minutes before you see an arm coming in. You stab it and it retracts. As it does, the building starts to crumble. Ever run out of a falling building? You said. This wouldn\u2019t be the first. He said. You both run and jump out of the building. You land on the ground and catch Arif. You set him down and notice the UAV circling back. Let\u2019s go. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both duck into a narrow ally way and enter another building. Sue\u2019s not going to be happy about that scar. You said. You hear stomping and after a few minutes, silence. Think they\u2019re gone? You said. Not likely. Arif said as he pointed out an eye looking in. \u2026.Fuck. Then an arm comes in. Shit! Looks like we\u2019re jumping! You said. Jumping?! Where?! Arif said. The building across. You watch action movies? You said. Movies being the key word! He said. Come on! You said. You both run and jump to the nearby building and roll as you hit the ground. Guess I can cross building hopping off my bucket list. He said. Nothing beats the real thing. You said. Except for the giant air mattress\u2026.. He said.  That UAV\u2019s got to run out of gas soon. You said. You both hear stomping. We know you\u2019re in there. We aren\u2019t going to hurt you. A voice said. Heard that before. You said. Look\u2026.. We just\u2026\u2026want to talk. Ashley said. Even I don\u2019t believe that shit. Arif said. I think we exit stage left. You said. You both head down the broken staircase. Watch where you step. This thing looks like it will crumble. You said. You both tread lightly until Arif stops. You hear that? He said. You listen for what he hears. I don\u2019t- You\u2019re interrupted by a fist come through. Shit! You said. It retraces and the building starts to shake. You both run down and out of the building and into a hand. Before you both could react, it closes around you both. Fuck\u2026. Arif said. The hand lifts up and opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout time you caught us. You said. We had no plan on hurting either of you. Yet you ran. She said. Trust the word of giant. Arif? You said. Not even on a good day. He said. Did it work? Who is\u2026. Arif? You\u2019re the mysterious person out here? Ashley said. I like being a mystery, but it\u2019s not me who called him out here. He said. Then who else is out here? What are you plotting all the way out here!? Ashley said. I don\u2019t have to tell you a damn thing, Sue. My business is my business. You said. We\u2019ve come too far for you to ruin everything! She said. I\u2019ve done as much to you as Kyle has done. Nothing. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s gonna stay. You said. You!! Let\u2019s go Cecil. She said. Closing her hand, they both head back to m district. </span></div></div>",

Although you do deserve. She said. Then why are we here? And we\u2019re Arif? You said. He\u2019s fine. Kim\u2019s looking after him. She said. (Heh. Bet Arif is smiling ear to ear.) So why am I with you? You said. We\u2019re going to have a discussion. She said. Aw, not this again. No means no, Sue. You said. And why not? She said. Just because you, your goons, and every other fucking guy her has a problem with Kyle, doesn\u2019t mean I do. You said. This effects you as well. You think he will just leave you alone? He\u2019s not going to let another man have more power than him. She said. And that\u2019s his hang up. I showed Kyle what happens when you cross me.  You said. And you think that will stop him? Power went to his head. He made things worse than they were. And with you around, it\u2019s only going to get worse. She said. I\u2019m not m district\u2019s saving grace. I got my own problems to worry about. You said. It will be all of our problem if the master isn\u2019t stopped! She said. Then stop him. You said. It\u2019s not as easy as you think. She said. Really? What\u2019s stopping you? It isn\u2019t his goons. They\u2019re fucking kids. You\u2019re almost an adult. Go there with your merry band and do him in. You said. We wouldn\u2019t make it through f district. They\u2019ll stop us on sight. She said. Then why don\u2019t you use what you use against me. Those marks that were on your arm. You said. \u2026\u2026If only you knew what they meant. She said.  Like I care. No means no. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook\u2026. I\u2019m trying to be nice about this. You worked with the master a few times. She said. And? You said. So what is he offering you to keep out? She said. Nothing. Kyle didn\u2019t bride me to stay out this. He had a few jobs for me and paid for my service. You said. So it\u2019s money that drives you\u2026.. Making a profit off other people\u2019s plight? She said. This is a business. I don\u2019t play favorite. Kyle had the money, so I worked with him. Simple as that. You said. So you\u2019re a mercenary. No morals or anything as long as the check clears. She said. If you want to be technical. I\u2019m looking after myself. I can\u2019t trust anyone else but me in this world. You said. *Sigh* Better than nothing. Name your price. She said. Killing giants, saving people, assassination of a despot\u2026\u2026 90,000. You said. 90,000!? You want a private island as well!? She said. Maybe\u2026. I\u2019m going to be doing most if not all the work while you jokers sit back. You\u2019re lucky I only use I knife, or I\u2019d charge more for weapons upkeep. You said. \u2026..75,000. She said. 80. You said. 70. She said. 65,000. That\u2019s as low as I\u2019m going. You said. Deal. She said. I expect full payment. You said. You\u2019ll get your blood money. She said. I\u2019ll leave you alone to simmer and plot. You said. You jump down and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head out and look for Arif when you see him and Kim. You can tell he\u2019s nervous. After a few minutes, Kim hugs him. About time he told her\u2026. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo 65,000 to do their jobs for them? He said. I originally asked for 90,000. Sue skipped the first day of negotiation class. Negotiate from a position of power. You said. Surprised she knows how to. She likes to strong arm and intimidate. He said. Or appeal to a person\u2019s morality. Guess that\u2019s how she got Kira and Kim. Speaking of Kim\u2026.. You and her are a thing now? You said. Well\u2026.. We are. He said. Oh I can\u2019t wait to see you in a suit. You said. W-we\u2019re going to hold off on all the couple stuff until Kyle is taken care of. He said. Aww\u2026 She\u2019ll be waiting with baited breath for her freedom fighter. You said. C-can we get on with this?! He said, blushing. Sure. It\u2019s just the standard prison bust. I\u2019ll create the distraction, you get everyone out. You said. I\u2019ll have them out. The army will deal with the collars. He said. You grow and kick open the door. As you walk through, the alarm blares. A few enforcers head your way, but stop dead when they see you. Before they could react, you knock them all out. More come your way and you quickly deal with them and head to medical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n I\u2019ll draw them farther away from the cells. By the time they know what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s too late. You said. You walk in further and keep the guards busy. Ok\u2026. Last one down. Time to- Chijinda? You said. You look down the hall to see Chijinda standing there. (Not this again\u2026..) He said. (But\u2026. He\u2019s right there.) You said. (No one is there. Do I need to remind you that I see what you see?) He said. You wonder why when Chijinda walks towards you. He stops when he gets close. (Just\u2026.like when we went to that school.) You said. You reach out and touch him. (He feels like he\u2019s right there.) You thought. (You\u2019re touching nothing!) He said. (But\u2026.!) You said. There is a mild pain in your head your head. When you shake it off, Chijinda\u2019s gone. H\u2026.He was right here. You said. Then your phone rings. I got all of the prisoners out. Arif said. Then let\u2019s go. You said. You head back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeez. This everyone? You said. Entire fucking prison. Some got out on there own. He said. Listen up. You want to go back to kissing ass, you\u2019re more than welcome. But you want to be free, head to m district. You decide if you want this nightmare to end. You said. \u2026..End the nightmare. One said. End the nightmare\u2026. Another said. End the nightmare! Another said. They start chanting End the nightmare. A speech and a rally cry. Are you sure you\u2019re in it for the money? Arif said. No reason I can get some fun. You said. You jokers want to be free? Then head to m district and find Ashley. Arif said. The horde lets out a loud cheer. I think this might be the start of something. He said. </span></div></div>",

We\u2019re all in the same boat here. The master isn\u2019t going to stop at us. Kira said. And where are we going to get that much from anyway? Kim said. I already have the cash. Our benefactor must have gotten word. But he\u2019s not getting it until the master is out of power. She said. I just can\u2019t believe it. At a time like this, he decides to be money hungry. Can you get anymore selfish? The master gave him ten thousand to capture us, and that was enough. Kira said. I hate to admit it, but he\u2019s good at what he does. He took on the master\u2019s army and his elites without even trying. Kim said. We could have done that. We have growth bracelets as well. Kira said. But the battle would have been drawn out more and we\u2019d lose more than the master would. He practically kept us alive. Even if we did put a collar around his neck. Ashley said. Ugh! I just can\u2019t believe it! If he\u2019s not worse than the master, he\u2019s a close second. We need to do something about him. Kira said. Hold on. I don\u2019t like him either, and I hate the fact Arif spends so much time with him. But I don\u2019t think we should make an enemy of him. Kim said. We got to do something! He took money to capture us and help us. What\u2019s stopping him from taking money to derail everything we work for? Kira said. If the elites couldn\u2019t touch him, what chance do we have? Kim said. I didn\u2019t say kill him. What if we locked him up forever like we\u2019re going to do with the master? Kira said. He\u2019ll just break out. Ashley said. Not if we put one of those mind control collars on him. Kira said. We do that, we\u2019re no better than the master. Might as well sign up with him. Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grow while Kira thinks. Ok. How about we handle a money hungry mercenary? She said. Uh\u2026. Kira. Kim said. What? Kira said. She looks behind her and you knock her to the ground. You stomp on her neck. Care to repeat those words? You said. Ugh\u2026..! Gladly.....! You money hungry bastard! She said. Then I guess I should live up to it then. Starting with you. You said. You do anything, you don\u2019t get a dime! Ashley said. You think for a second and let her go. The prisoners are free, Sue. What next? You said. All of them? She said. Every last one. You said. That moves our time table up by months. We can focus on the master without worry. Kim said. Yeah\u2026.. I want you to bring in the elites. That way the master has no one to fall back on. Ashley said. Not like you\u2019re going to be marching on his place anyway. Just going to have me get him. You said. Just go. Kim said. You turn and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to the mansion and climb up to the rooftop. Everyone. Every last man in there is gone. Yumi said. How is that possible? Even for him that\u2026.. Luna said. It was a two person job. He kept all the guards busy while another unlocked all the cells. Koyuki said. Argh! When I find the two of them, they\u2019ll wish they were dead! Amy said. Getting angry won\u2019t solve this. Koyuki said. Going straight to m district and capturing every man there will. Luna said. What if he wants that? He wants us to go there so he can torture us in the most vicious ways! Soya said. He\u2019s not a psycho. And he wouldn\u2019t think that far ahead. But action needs to be taken. Koyuki said. What do we do? Yumi said. Execute him and any traitorous women working with the males! Set an example for all to see! Amy said. Think rational, Amy. If we- You crash through the window and land on top of Koyuki. You!! Amy said. You leg sweep and slam Amy into the ground. You grab Yumi and Luna and slam them as well. Ah\u2026.! Soya said. You stare right at her. You can tell she wants to run, but her legs won\u2019t listen her. \u2026\u2026Boo. You said. Soya\u2019s eyes roll as she faints. You go around and bind them. Little help here? You said. Your dark half comes out and helps you carry them back to m district. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere you go, Sue. You said. You toss the elites down. Jeez\u2026. Are they alive? Kim said. Why would you care? Feel sorry for them? You said. Ow\u2026.. My head\u2026.! Koyuki said. Agh\u2026.. What happened? Where are we? Yumi said. One by one, the elites come to. You coward!! Can\u2019t fight me on equal terms? Have to get the drop on us!? Amy said. You\u2019re lucky that\u2019s all I did. These jokers are your problem, Sue. You said.  We\u2019ll keep them locked up. And they will answer for their crimes. Ashley said. You people are the only ones committing crimes! Yumi said. You all will pay for this! Luna said. Right\u2026. You said. As you look at them, you notice they look like the heavenly queens and Miku. In fact, they look like the spitting image and right in front of you. The mild headache come back. You shake your head before leaving. How much are they giving you? We\u2019ll double it. Koyuki said. You stop. Can you? From what I see, you\u2019re in no position to talk. You said. Name your price. You could retire in the lap of luxury. She said. Luxury? That\u2019s expensive. You said. Just give me a number. She said. Don\u2019t you dare! We already bought and paid in advance! Kira said. I follow the money. So if she\u2019s offering, I have to take notice. If you get out of this, come find me. You said. You walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to take there offer? Your dark half said. If they get out and can actually double what I\u2019m offered, then yeah. You said. Heh. And they think Kyle\u2019s the enemy. He said, going back inside you. You shrink back down and head to Mira\u2019s place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk in and take a seat on the couch. You sit back and relax. Finally some down time. You said. \u2026\u2026 Your fault. A voice said. What? You said. It\u2019s all you fault\u2026\u2026 A voice said. What the hell? You said, getting up. You couldn\u2019t save him\u2026.. It said. W-who\u2019s there?! You said. He died because of you\u2026.. It said. I didn\u2019t\u2026. He was\u2026. You said. You were too slow. And he\u2019s dead\u2026.! A voice said. A blood image of chijinda appears in front of you. I\u2026. I was\u2026 You said. WEAK!! The voice shout. You head hurts and you stumble in pain. No\u2026. Chijinda\u2026..! I\u2019m\u2026.. You said. As you hold your head, you\u2019re shaken violently. Hey! Hey!! Snap out of it! Mira\u2019s voice said. The visage of chijinda is replaced by Mira shaking you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nM-Mira? You said. Finally\u2026.. She said. What\u2026..happened? You said. I heard you talking, so I came to see, but no one was there. Then you started clutching your head and you started saying things. (What\u2019s\u2026..happening to me?) You thought. Mira takes her hands off you as you stand up. Is everything ok? She said. Yeah\u2026.. I just need some rest. I\u2019ll be fine. You said.</span></div></div>",

Then you get a text to your phone. You look and read the message. \u201cHead to M district. There\u2019s something you need to see.\u201d It reads. (Another shady person.) He said. You get up, put your mask on and walk to m district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, you get another message. \u201cGet a disguise and head into the base.\u201d It said. You look around and find a lone soldier. You knock him out and take his uniform. What could be in there that I need to do this? You said. You walk past the guards and through the training area and head inside. You walk around and find a group of soldiers, a general and a few scientist. What are they watching? You said. You walk into the group and see a soldier in what looks like an power suit fighting 5 other soldiers. (What the? Where did they get those from?) You thought. (And look. He\u2019s not even breaking a sweat.) He said. After 2 minutes of watching, the test is stopped. As you can see, the exo suit increase the overall performance of the soldier. The head scientist said. How does it perform against those monsters? The general said. The suit makes the individual  faster and survive most fatal encounters with an injection of healing serum. He said. So if they get stomped or anything\u2026.. The general said. The soldier should be able to get away and if they don\u2019t, all they have to do is activate the stim injection and it will be like they were never hurt. He said. And as for offense? The general said. Strength of the individual is increased significantly, but it would take multiple soldiers to down one monster. Another scientist said. So our odds of survival go up or down? The general said. Up. Plus, with Ashley and her friends help. We have nothing to worry about. The scientist said. I\u2019m convinced. A soldier said. \u2026..Alright. How long would it take to mass produce? The general said. It would a while to fit each soldier. The scientist said. Then let\u2019s get to it. And one last thing\u2026\u2026 How are these suits against\u2026\u2026him? The general said. Combat is improved, but I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath. The scientist said. Then we\u2019ll worry about him later. He said. The group disperses and so do you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they work as well as he said, Sue can finally stop harping me. You said. (But what about our payday?) He said. (We\u2019ll get that. Sue\u2019s not dumb enough to shit me.) You said. (You think these suits are a problem for us?) He said. (No. I see no reason to do anything.) You said. Then you get a message. \u201c100,000 to deal with this.\u201d It said. (Now we have a reason.) You said. (How do we know this person will pay?) He said. \u201cMoney has been transferred. Check account.\u201d A new message reads. You check and see the money is there. (Guess we have a job to do. Who do we kill first?) He said. (We can\u2019t kill anyone. We need to be discreet.) You said. (Why?) He said. (If we go and rampage and destroy everything and everyone here, Sue will know it was us and we won\u2019t get paid. Best way to get away with this is to make it look like a renegade soldier sabotage all their work.) You said. (But I hate doing things from the shadows.) He said. (Private island where you can hunt anyone you want.) You said. (You know, I\u2019ve always like liked the stealth approach.) He said. You walk and look for the R&amp;D section where you find a bunch of exo suits being built. It\u2019s a production line. Workers and machine pumping out these suits. You said. (Imagine them building one for sue and her friends.) He said. (Oh god. We\u2019d never hear the end of it.) You said. You head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. If I can cause a chain reaction, production will be stopped. You said. (But it\u2019s automated.) he said. (Then we fry the main circuits.) You said. You walk around and head into the overlooking room. Here. This must be the master controls. You said. You break the controls and the automated machines all start to explode. Best get out of here before they find me. You said. You head out of the room and blend in with all the confusion. You make your way back out and get out of sight to change back to your clothes. I do excellent work. You said. You said. You leave m district before you\u2019re caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re in o district looking for Arif. He\u2019s usually here. Where is he? You said. As you look, your phone goes off. What do you want, Sue? You answered. We need to talk. In person. Now! She said,  hanging up. (Think she knows\u2026.) He said. You make your way to m district and find Sue with her friends. What do you want? You said. You bastard! You bastard! Kira said. What\u2019d I do this time? You said. I know it was you! Only you would do something like this! She said. I don\u2019t even know what happened. You said. There was a project being done at one of the bases and it was sabotaged. Kim said. And only you could do something like that! Kira said. Oh please. Don\u2019t come after me with accusation unless you have proof. You said. Who else could break in there?! Kira said. Wasn\u2019t me. I was in o district. Plus, why would I do that anyway? You\u2019re paying me to help, so why would I ruin my payday? You said. Well if it wasn\u2019t you, then you\u2019d have no problem finding out who did. Ashley said. No, I don\u2019t. But do you have any leads as to who? You said. Reports said a soldier with heavily scared face was snooping around were he shouldn\u2019t be. Ashley said. Then I\u2019ll go find him. You said. You turn and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(We need a patsy.) He said. (Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll find one.) You said. You head back to the base and the welcoming isn\u2019t that warm, but they stay out your way. Jarheads know their place. You said. You head inside the base and look around to make sure no one was looking or watching. When one soldier past by, you take his legs out from under him and punch him to the ground. That should do it. Now\u2026. I just need to mark up his face. You said. You pull out your knife and get to work. A slice here. A cut there. You said. After a few minutes, the man\u2019s face is cut up. Now to accelerate the healing. You said. You use your power and quickly heal up his face. There. You said, pulling him up. Now to get him to Sue. You said.</span></div></div>",

We\u2019ll deal with him later. She said. You\u2019re not going to execute him, are you? You said. Good god, no! We\u2019re not like the elites! Kim said. If you say so. You said. You turn and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. Let me get this straight. Ash is giving you 65,000 to take down Kyle. Arif said. Yeah. You said. And some mysterious guy pays you 100,000 to sabotage some project they were working on. He said. Yep. You said. And you got someone else to take the blame. He said. Yeah. You said. Ashley won\u2019t be happy when she finds out. She might not even pay you. He said. Sue knows better than anyone not to stiff me. I\u2019ll destroy everything she has. Look at Kyle. No army, elites or anything. Hold up in his mansion. Counting the days until I get there. You said. And when it\u2019s over, what are you going to do? He said. Do what I\u2019m doing now. Work for the highest bidder. I know someone is going to hire me to undo what Sue\u2019s draconian laws. You said. Heh. So work for Ash. Then Kyle. He said. If he has the money. I\u2019ll get him and his goons back in power. I don\u2019t play favorite. I go where the cash is. You said. You know you\u2019re going to make a lot of enemies with that mindset. He said. Let them come. I\u2019ll put them right next to Sue and Kira. Won\u2019t touch Kim since you two are a thing now. By the way\u2026. You said. You hand him a few thousand dollars. Buy a penguin suit and a nice place. You said. A back alley wedding wasn\u2019t going to cut it. I was thinking something romantic. Like a beachfront- Holy shit. What\u2019s happen to me? He said. Love. Arif. It\u2019s called love. You said. Hatred, rage, anger, sorrow, and all the other emotions I\u2019ve felt. But love\u2026.. That\u2019s one I didn\u2019t expect. He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019ll explore those feeling later. What I want to know is who\u2019s on top of this while thing? You said. What do you mean? He said. I\u2019m talking about Sue and her merry band. As experienced as they are, they\u2019re not shot callers. Even though Sue is good at barking orders. You said. Wouldn\u2019t it be the general? He said. I\u2019ve seen him, but he only has limited power. He signs off on things, but he\u2019s not moving the army. I noticed it last time. When Kyle was vulnerable, the army or Sue didn\u2019t attack. Like right now. Kyle has no protection, yet Sue, her friends, or the army aren\u2019t moving on him. You said. You think there\u2019s someone else at work? He said. Yeah. And I think Sue knows who it is. But she won\u2019t tell me. So there\u2019s only one thing to do. I got to see if she\u2019s hiding something at her house. You said. Whoa there. Raiding Ash\u2019s house? That sounds like a death sentence. He said. You sound like you\u2019ve done it before. What did she do? Torture? Make you do her toenails? Stress toy? You said. Ash isn\u2019t demented like the girls in f district, but she gets her point across. He said. So temporary slave. Did she at least feed you? You said. I was kept healthy. But she\u2019s a taskmaster. He said. Sue wouldn\u2019t do that to me. She knows I\u2019ll cave in her face. Where does she live? You said. In m district. Not far from the army\u2019s main HQ. You really can\u2019t miss it. He said. You run off to m district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, you see the army HQ, and not far off, a huge building. Arif was right. You can\u2019t miss it. It\u2019s like a national monument compared to the other buildings here. You said. You make your way to Ashley\u2019s house and grow. You head inside. Huh. Not like how I imagined it. I expected weapons and plans to litter the walls. Just lights and windows like any other house. You said. You walk around and shuffle through various items. Where do you keep your secrets? You said. (Think like a girl.) He said. (Either in my dresser. Or under my bed.) You said. You walk up some stairs and into the door on the right. A bed, tv, carpet floors\u2026.. Again. Not what I was expecting. You said. You start with her dresser. Why does this remind me of my high school years? You said. You open the dresser and see a bunch of bras and panties. C cup bras? In your dreams, Sue. You said. You rifle through the clothing, but see nothing. Damn. Not here. You said. You check the others, but find nothing. Nothing here. You said. You check under the bed and feel something. Hello. You said. You pull out a journal. Bingo. You said. (This better not have wild dreams.) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what shocks me more. The fact a man won in the arena. Or that he has gone mad with power from winning. As life wasn\u2019t already hard enough for men. Now he\u2019s implementing horrible laws, building a prison\u2026.. He\u2019s not going to stop anytime soon. Something has to be done about him.\u201d That\u2019s the first entry. Let\u2019s go further in. You said. You skip a few pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t the only one who believe men should be free. Two girls have decided to join me and the army in our fight. Hopefully our message will spread to others.\u201d No not this one. You said. You flip some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been back the master\u2019s army. I\u2019m not\u2026..proud of what I had to do to achieve victory. I had to\u2026.. You know what I am. But I\u2019ll forget as I celebrate tonight.\u201d That\u2019s a good question. What are you, Sue? You said. You flip some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike the master wasn\u2019t bad enough. Now we got this rouge person running around. He won in the arena, but not by using a weapon. He used his bare hands. I immediately wanted to find this person and asked him to join us. But he shot me down. He didn\u2019t give a reason. Is he disgruntled? Has a vendetta? Whatever he is, we can\u2019t let the master have him.\u201d Getting closer. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrying to appeal to his conscious and morality didn\u2019t work. He say he has no inclination of siding with the master. And given his actions, I believe. Turns out he only answers the call of money. All that power he has\u2026.. Wasted. At least when this is all over, I don\u2019t have to see high or low of him again.\u201d That\u2019s the last entry. Nothing after that. Wait. You said. You notice that some pages have been torn out. Missing pieces. You said. You do a quick search and find them in a waste bin. You unfold them and read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I had to get away. What I\u2019ve done will live with me forever. Why did I have to be born like this? I didn\u2019t ask to be like this! I don\u2019t think I can atone for what I\u2019ve done. But I\u2019m going to bring some good into this world.\u201d Not this one. You said, going to the next paper.<br>\r\n\u201cI was approached by one of my sisters. She still acts the same way now as she did when we were younger. Growing up as a Galloway gives you a sense of superiority. I can still feel that sense as she pulls the strings. She asked me to return. I couldn\u2019t go back to that. Back to being- You hear the sound of a door closing. Shit! You said. You toss the notes back in the bin and the journal back under the bed. You try to open the window, but can\u2019t. What the hell?! Why can\u2019t I open it? You said. You hear the footsteps getting closer. Damnit! You said. You quickly shrink back down and hide just as Ashley walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sighs as she takes off her boots and flops onto her bed. The door\u2019s my only choice. You said. You sneak out from the bed and bolt to the dresser. The door was in sight when you hear her feet hit the ground. You disappear and reappear behind her dresser as she walks over to the bin. She stares at the papers inside. She\u2019s so focused on those papers. They must mean something. You said. As you step out, you smell something burning. You look to see a fire in the bin. What the?! But she didn\u2019t throw a match. You said. Ashley stared as the fire burn the papers. Like they were burning away a past she wants to forget. When the fire burnt away, Ashley went back to the bed. Seeing your chance, you run out the room and house and head back to o district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArif. You said. Find anything? He said. Nothing of interest. But I came across a name. Galloway. You said. G\u2026.Galloway? Arif said as his face pales. Yeah. Also made a reference to pulling strings. Plus, some other things. It seems that Sue knows or is related to these people. Think I need to pay them a visit. You said. You notice Arif looks like he saw a ghost. You ok over there? You said. No\u2026. No I\u2019m not. He said. You know who the Galloways are? You said. Stay away from them! Of all the enemies, you don\u2019t want them as your enemy! He said. Can\u2019t be no worse than Kyle. Or Sue. You said. Trust me. These are not the kind of people you want to cross. Compared to Kyle, he\u2019s a saint. Arif said. That\u2019s\u2026.quite the comparison. But if you say so. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(You\u2019re going to go looking for them.) He said. (You bet I am.) You said.</span></div></div>",

And it\u2019s not like I can go to Kyle and ask. You said. Why not? Just threaten them all. One of them is bound to talk. He said. You get farther with honey than vinegar. You said. Speaking of Arif, there he is now. He said. You look to see Arif walking down the street and looking around. What\u2019s he doing out here? He said he was with Kim. You said. You see him mutter a few words and out of nowhere, a giant mansion appears. What the?! Where did that come from?! You said. Arif\u2019s been holding out on us. He\u2019 living large and in charge. He said. I doubt Arif would keep a mansion hidden from us. You said as he goes inside. You both run to and inside the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoa. Look at this d\u00e9cor. Statues, paintings, chandeliers, a fountain. You said. And the smell of snob. He said. Sue mentioned the Galloway. If she\u2019s comes from all this\u2026. You said. Hit her up for a loan. He said as he goes inside you. Where did Arif go? You said. You head up the stairs and look around until you find him talking to a lady in black dress with rimstones. Her jet black hair was down to her waist and her eyes were piercing. She must own this place. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grow tired of waiting, Arif. Have you found him? She said. No, miss. I haven\u2019t. He said. You do know the ramifications for not finding him. She said. Yes, miss. He said. One was bad enough\u2026. We don\u2019t need to. She said. Arif\u2019s looking for someone\u2026.? You said. (Or hunting.) He said. Why have you not found him? Are you too caught up with that friend of yours to do your job? She said. She knows about me? You said. (You haven\u2019t kept what people would call a low profile.) He said. No. He just\u2026..livens up the day. He knows nothing of what I do. He said. Your day doesn\u2019t need to be liven. You need to follow what your told to do! She said. Boy, she\u2019s mean. You said. *Sigh* Maybe it\u2019s my fault. I\u2019ve slacked off in my obedience training. Counting you, this is the fifth time a slave\u2019s failed me. She said. Slave? Arif told me he had no master. Maybe he meant Kyle wasn\u2019t his master. You said. How should I go about this? Maybe I should have your friend brought here. She said. N\u2026.No. He doesn\u2019t need to be exposed to this. Arif said. My. I am becoming slack in my disciplining. You\u2019ve never raised your voice to me like that. She said. I\u2019d never\u2026.. He said. You have been heavily influenced by your friend. I can\u2019t have one of my slaves thinking he\u2019s free. The others will fall suit as well. She said. With a snap of her fingers Arif is gone. What the hell did she do!? You said. But first\u2026. I have a pesky intruder to deal with. She said. You\u2019re suddenly brought in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew I had someone in my home\u2026.. But I didn\u2019t think it was you. She said. You\u2019re going to have a lot more trouble on your hands! Where\u2019s Arif!? You said. You care a lot for him. Do you see him as a friend? She said. I don\u2019t have to answer to you! Where is he!? You said. You do see him as I friend. That\u2019s so cute. Let me get a better look at you. She said. You appear in her hand. Now let\u2019s see who\u2019s behind that mask. She said. That\u2019ll be the day. Where is he!? You said. He\u2019s somewhere. But I wonder about this friendship. How far does it go? Does he see you as a friend as well? He\u2019s never raised his voice at me until now. She said. That\u2019s getting off easy. Compared to what I\u2019m about to do. You said. You move to attack her, but your legs don\u2019t budge. What the?! You said. You think I\u2019d just let the most dangerous person have their way in my place? You have no idea what I am or can do. But you\u2019ll find out. She said. She snaps her fingers and you vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh! Where am I? You said. You look around to see that you\u2019re in some basement. You try to move, but your wrist and legs are bound. These aren\u2019t normal chains. What kind of energy is this? It feels\u2026..ominous. \u2026\u2026Arif! You shout. Huh? A voice said. Arif! You said. You see him bound as well to the adjacent wall. W-what are you doing here!? He said. I saw you come here. You look distressed. And after how you acted a few days ago\u2026.. You said. *Sigh* If you knew what I knew, you\u2019d be too. You shouldn\u2019t have come here. He said. And leave you here with this bitch? Nah. You said. This isn\u2019t some random woman! It\u2019s a lot more darker than that. I told you to stay away for a reason! He said. Why? You said. \u2026\u2026I\u2019ve seen too many people lost to women like Sandra. I couldn\u2019t see that happen again. He said. Was that your way of calling me your friend? You said. \u2026\u2026You know I don\u2019t do mush feelings. He said. Kim. You said. S-She\u2019s a special case. He said. Well, if you want to see her again, we better get out of here. You said. Just as you said that, the sound of a door opens and you hear booming footsteps. Oh great\u2026.. Here comes the lady of the hour. You said. The clacking of heels are heard as she makes her way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope I didn\u2019t keep you two waiting. She said. She looks at you and Arif. Now\u2026. Who should I break first? My disobedient slave? Or the rambunctious bad mouth? She said.  Me. I\u2019m the one who failed you\u2026. Arif said. That you did. And I don\u2019t take failure lightly. She said. Touch him, and it\u2019s your throat. You said. Ohhh\u2026.. Such violence. No one has ever spoken to me like that. I can\u2019t wait to see your face when I break you. She said. No! Brake me all you want! But not him! He\u2019s done nothing to deserve this! Arif said. That\u2019s the second time you raised your voice to me today. I think you should go first. She said. She waves her hand and Arif starts shaking. No\u2026. No! NO! It burns! STOP! It hurts!!! He screams. She laughs as he screams, which makes your blood boil. You power started to rise and you try to break your bonds. Hm? Trying to break free? I haven\u2019t seen this before. Come on. You can do it. She mocks. Your anger just kept rising. And so did you power. As you struggled, cracks on the wall started to form. What? She said. You kept struggling and struggling until the walls gave in and so did your chains. WHAT!? She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally free, you build up energy in your hands. What the\u2026..? Arif said. Y\u2026.you\u2019re not\u2026.. She said. You disappear and reappear in front of her and blast a huge beam in her face that engulfs her. The beam cuts through the entire house. You drop down and quickly run to Arif. H-h-how did\u2026.. What\u2026..? He said. Later! Let me get you out of this! You said. You blast the bonds off him and help him up just as the lady appear from nowhere. H\u2026..How did you survive!? You said. I\u2019m something special. Just like you. And I intend on finding out what you are. She said. I\u2019ll give you all the knowledge you want! You said, powering up. Suddenly the building starts to rumble. This place is coming down. You have to go. Arif said. Like hell I\u2019m leaving without you. You said. Sorry\u2026. But that\u2019s not up for negotiation. He said. What are you talking about!? You said. You made life for me interesting\u2026.. And I\u2019ve learned a lot from you. Glad I could call you friend. Remember me. And tell Kim I love her. Teleportis! He said. Before you could question, you vanish. Giving up your life for him? She said. More like taking it back. This is a long time coming, Sandra. He said.</span></div></div>",

You said. You quickly run back to the mansion just to see it crumble down. ARIF!! You shout. When the dust clears, you grow and run into the rubble and start digging. Damnit! Where are you!? You said. You search, but can\u2019t find him. Not\u2026.. Not again\u2026.. You said. You take off your mask and tears roll down your face. First Chijinda\u2026.. Now\u2026. You said. You hit the ground in anger and the ground splits. You sit there for who knows how long and cry. When you were done, you put your mask back on and hesitantly leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t want to go back to m district, so you headed to Sinclair\u2019s. Just like the first trip, quiet. Except you\u2019re traveling with a heavy heart. While traveling, you phone goes off multiple times. You know who it is, but you don\u2019t have time for her. After a long trip, you get to Sinclair\u2019s. Thought you forgot about me out here. He said. \u2026..Not now. You said, taking a seat. Oh. I\u2019ve seen that look before. He said. I\u2019m wearing a mask. How can you see my facial expression? You said. I can\u2019t. But I know the tone. Sadness. He said. \u2026..He\u2019s gone. You said. Who? He said. Arif. I went to save him and\u2026.. It all fell apart. You said. You left him? He said. No. I was going to fight this woman named Sandra and- Wait. Sandra!? He interrupts. Yeah. His owner. She tortured him right in front of me. I lost my cool and blasted the bitch, but that made the place unstable. We were set to go, but she came back. Unharmed. I was set to do her in quickly. But Arif said some weird word and I appeared in o district. I went back and started digging to get him\u2026.. But I couldn\u2019t find him. You said. You take off your mask as more tears fall. He was a good man. Kim was very lucky. Few people knew how Arif really was. He said. Is this how it is for me, Sinclair? I\u2019ve lost both of my friends. Is that how it\u2019s going to be for me? Losing people I care about one after the other? You said. There\u2019s always a silver lining. He said. What\u2019s the silver lining to losing a friend!? You said, looking up. Sinclair backs up when he sees your eyes. Y\u2026.your eyes\u2026. He said. What? They\u2019re red from tears. You said. No. Not that. Here look. He said, handing you a mirror. You look to see three tick marks in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nW\u2026.. What are those? You said. I had my doubts\u2026.. But this confirms it. He said. Confirms what? You said. No time to explain. Take as much time as you need to grieve, and meet me outside. He said, leaving. You sit there crying for a while before finally getting up and heading outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what is it? You said. Do you know what you have been blessed with? You said. Not until you tell me. You said. The optical eyes. You said. Optical eyes? What is that? You said. You see everything. He said. Everything? You said. Yes. Nothing will be out of your reach. You\u2019re stronger, faster, quicker, and all that. He said. I don\u2019t\u2026.feel any different. You said. The change isn\u2019t immediate. You have to use them a few times. Which is why we\u2019re out here. First, let\u2019s see you activate them. Close your eyes. He said. You close them. Now open them. He said. You open them and the three ticks are gone. Ok. Now repeat the process. You do so. The ticks don\u2019t come back until the sixth try. Hm. Have to work on that, but good job. He said. Are we really going to train now? You said. Look, I know how you feel. You want nothing but to be alone and grieve. But you\u2019ve been given a gift. A dangerous gift, but a gift none the less. You need to learn how to use those eyes. He said. Are they that important? You said. Absolutely! He said. Fine\u2026.. What do I do first? You said. That building. Head to the top and back. He said. You focus and appear on the side of the building. Whoa! Wrong floor. You said. You disappear and reappear on the top. Ok. Now for the bottom. You said. You disappear and reappear on the ground. Hmm. We have a lot of work to do. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few weeks, you stay with Sinclair as he teaches you how to use the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright. You both know what to do? He said. Yeah. You and your dark half said. Then get to it. He said. Your dark half rush to you and starts attacking you. You dodge his attacks one after the other. Not like it was hard. Your dark half prefers straight up fights. When you dodge his next punch, he smiles. (Uh-oh) You said. You see the attack coming from behind and block. You see another and block. (Since when does he strike from the shadows?) You thought. You continue to block his attacks until Sinclair says stop. Excellent. It seems you can see people\u2019s attacks from any range or place. He said. Yeah\u2026. You said. Now the eyes can let you see the future. But do you know the saying about doing that? He said. Every time you look, it changes because you looked. You said. Right. That applies to the eyes, but I\u2019ll let you find the loophole in there. He said. As he talks, your phone goes off. Geez. What does Sue want? I\u2019m busy. You said. Maybe she misses us. Your dark half said. The elites have escaped. Sinclair said. How\u2026.do you know? You said. I have people on the inside in the army. It\u2019s how I know you destroyed the soldier enhancement project. He said. It\u2019s not like the elites are that big of a problem. You said. It\u2019s not just that. Someone new has shown up in Kyle\u2019s favor. Promising him results and a end to this madness. He said. And I\u2019m guessing Sue wants me to take care of it. You said. Well she is paying you. He said. I think that went out the window weeks ago. You said. I hear it in your voice. The fear and uncertainty. You can\u2019t run from it. You\u2019re going to have to face it sooner or later. He said. I don\u2019t run from my problems\u2026.. It\u2019s just\u2026. I\u2019ve been suffering from something. You said. Like what? He said. He sees things that aren\u2019t there. It\u2019s happend multiple times. Your dark half said. Dementia? But that only happens under traumatic problems. And you\u2019re so young. What happen to you? He said. You see the image of Chijinda dead. I\u2026..don\u2019t want to talk about. I\u2019m heading back. You said as your dark half goes inside. Just one more thing. If you really have dementia, come to terms with yourself. Or it will kill you. He said. You take his word and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back to o district and head to Kyle\u2019s mansion. You look down the glass window and see the elites talking. Finally good to be back. Yumi said. When I get my hands on those traitors\u2026.. And him. Especially him!! I\u2019ll make them ever regret rebelling! Amy said. You heard how the men talked about him? They are all scared of him. Soya said. They should be scared of us! Not him! Amy said. Amy is right. They should fear us. Luna said. Not when he\u2019s kicked your asses 10 ways to Sunday. A girl said as she walked up. She\u2019s new. You said. (At least she\u2019s not dressed in a bikini.) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said you know. Him. Koyuki said. I know of him. She said. That\u2019s not enough! How do we kill him!? Amy said. You can\u2019t. She said. WHAT!?! Amy said. Pull him apart, sit on, stomp on, all that gruesome stuff\u2026\u2026 He\u2019ll just walk off. She said. There\u2019s no way he can survive all that. Yumi said. It\u2019s been done to him. He\u2019ll just regenerate. You can even use that fancy growth tech and you still won\u2019t beat him. He\u2019ll kick seven shades of shit right out of you. She said. S-So we have no chance!? We\u2019re going to be his playthings! Soya said. Playthings? I\u2019m not that sadistic. You said. (I am.) He said. I didn\u2019t say that. There is a way. She said. How? What\u2019s stopping me from ending his sorry life? The suit? Mask? Some tech from m distict? Amy said. None of that. I know how, but I have to find him first. Then you can do what you want. She said. Heh. She thinks she knows me. You said. You disappear and reappear on the ground and head to m district.</span></div></div>",

As you walk, someone calls out to you. You turn your head to see that girl who was talking to the elites. (Quicker than I thought.) You have business with me? Otherwise, get lost. You said. You could say that. She said. Why do I get the feeling you\u2019re not here to converse? You said. What makes you say that? You\u2019re popular. The man who drove back Kyle\u2019s army, beats his elites, and survive the arena. You\u2019re on everyone\u2019s tongue. She said. Then I\u2019m doing something wrong. You want an autograph or something? You said. Why that, when I can get the actual person. She said. Great. Another one of you. Go ahead and say your threat and we can get this over with. You said. Man, you\u2019re no fun. Here I was thinking we could banter back and forth. She said. Waste of time. Either fight or run like the other. You said. Oh come on. We don\u2019t have to fight. Why don\u2019t you just surrender? It\u2019d be much easier. She said. And boring. Are we going to do this? Or not? You said. Fine. I guess I can indulge a little. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grow and attack her. She block and you duck her attack and punch her in the side. She stumbles and laughs. If you\u2019re going to hit me, put some effort into it. She said. It was to see if you\u2019d flinch and run. But it seems you\u2019re here for the long run. You said. You disappear and reappear behind her and feint a swing and go for a kick. She catches your leg and you bounce up and kick her in the face. She stumbles and hold her nose as you get up. Ow\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026..better. She said as blood runs down her nose. You can leave with a bloody nose, or I can knock you out cold. You said. I\u2019m not done just yet. She said. She vanishes and appears in front of you. You dodge her attack and sweep her feet, but she\u2019s gone. Hmm. You said. You focus and block her attack from the side and she vanishes. You wait her out for a few moments and grab her arm. But she wanted this. She pulls you in close and slams you into the ground. Surprised? She said. No. But are you? You said. She wonders what you mean when she is hit in the cheek that sends her away a few feet. What? Be you were\u2026.. She said. That was an afterimage. You said. So you were already up? She said. Yeah. You still want to continue? You said. Rgh\u2026.! As much as it pains me to do so\u2026.. I\u2019ll let you go for now. But you\u2019re mine next time! She said, vanishing. (And don\u2019t come back!) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was interesting. Hope I didn\u2019t attach the hero brigade. You said as you shrink down. You head to m district. (Is it wise to spend the night right under Sue\u2019s nose?) He said. (Who\u2019s going to tell her? People are dead asleep at this time. If Sue thinks that I\u2019m that big of a problem, her priorities are fucked.) You said.  (That\u2019s not the only thing about her that\u2019s fucked. Her attitude needs adjusting. And I know just the thing.) He said. (You seriously think that would make her less bitchy?) You said. (One good fuck is all she needs.) He said. (And the poor soul who has that job?) You said. (Can\u2019t be that hard to find someone. You\u2019ve seen the company she keeps, so her standards can\u2019t be that high.) He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came, you got up and looked outside. Hm. Nobody\u2019s out. Thought life here was suppose to be mundane, but safe. You said. You head to the door, but stop. (What is it?) he said. Sue\u2019s army goons are waiting. You said. (How do you know?) He said. (You didn\u2019t think the street was too empty? They are never that empty. They cleared it.) You said. (Then let\u2019s run through them.) He said. (Have half a mind to do that. But I think Sue is waiting. She wouldn\u2019t leave them hanging. She cares too damn much.) You said. (Then we exit through the window.) He said. You look outside. Nothing on the street. No trebling of a giant. You said. You focus and your eyes change. You disappear and reappear inside the adjacent building. You watch as the team bust down the door and see it\u2019s empty. (We\u2019re going to have to become scarce. Sue or one of her crones will come running.) He said. (Yeah\u2026..) You said. Changing your eyes back, you quickly and quietly leave the building an m district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne problem after another. Just can\u2019t catch a break. You said. (Comes with the territory of being public figure number one.) He said. You open the door and are immediately rushed by Miley. Where have you been?! It\u2019s been weeks and I started thinking the worse! She said. Got caught up in somethings. But I\u2019m back now. You said. Yeah. You are\u2026. Mira said. Oh\u2026. You said. Miley. I need to talk to him alone. She said. Is everything alright? She said. Yeah. I just need to speak with him. Mira said. Miley runs off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeez. No need to look at me like a pariah. You said. I don\u2019t know how to treat you. You don\u2019t want me to care for you. She said. I never said that. You said. Your exact words were, \u201cI don\u2019t need a worrywart like you.\u201d She said. Ok. That was taken out of context. I meant that as in a clingy mother way. Besides, I deal with dangerous people out there. You said. Is that why you were gone for weeks? She said. It\u2019s not like you were up every single night wondering? You said. Mira doesn\u2019t say anything as she stares at you. Oh my God. You did. You said. Yeah. It\u2019s something you do when you\u2019re worried. She said. Well, I\u2019m fine. No need to worry. You said. Yeah. No need. Shower\u2019s that way if you need it. She said. Are you telling me I stink? You said. Your clothes tell. She said. Oh. You said. You head to the shower and take your clothes off. Fuck. When was the last time I had this? You said. You stay in there for a while and come out. Shit. I don\u2019t have any spare clothes. And I don\u2019t want to walk around like this with a kid around. You said. (She\u2019ll have to learn someday.) He said. (But not from me. Wait. I have an idea.) You said. You fill up the sink with water and put your clothes on. You shrink back down and reappear on the sink. You take your clothes off and toss them into the water. After a few minutes, you jump in and get them all. You disappear and reappear on the counter and grow. You dry them off as best you can and put them back on. Damp are better than none. You said. You walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. Clean as a whistle. You said. Did you shower in your clothes? She said. No. I just improvised. You said. Is that what you call it? She said. Ok. You can quit with the cold stare and angry face. You said. I would smile, but you might think I\u2019m some clingy person. She said. Ok, ok. Another wrong choice of words. You don\u2019t have to harp about it and be a sarcastic jerk. You said. Wow. Can\u2019t worry about you or be a jerk. She said. Alright. You made your point. I\u2019ll stop. You said. Really? You\u2019re going to act like a decent person? She said. Why do you make it sound like it\u2019s impossible? I can be nice and all that. You said. Prove it. One day. No jokes, snide remarks, or anything. She said. Fine. I\u2019ll be an asskisser for a day. You said. Really? She said, annoyed. Starting now. You said. </span></div></div>",

That\u2019s cannibalism! What made you even think that?! She said. I\u2019ve seen shops selling guys off as food. You said. And you think that\u2019s what I eat? She said. Not anymore. But you can\u2019t fault me for thinking. You said. I\u2019d starve before I even think of doing that. She said. Explains how you keep that slim figure. You said. Ha. Ha. Ha. She said. Here. Let me help. Combine the soup with meat. You said. You put your hand on the soup just as Mira did. You could see the light blush on Mira\u2019s face. Uh\u2026 You want to do this? You said. Y-yeah. I got this. She said. Mira puts the meat and soup together and cooks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere. She said. You take off your mask and eat. You weren\u2019t joking. You can cook. You said. Told you. She said. You quickly finish eating. Jeez. When was the last time you ate? She said. It\u2019s been a while. You said. Mira gets both bowls and cleans them. While she was doing that, you phone went off. What the? \u201cKill Ashley.\u201d? You said. (Who did she piss off?) He said. (More importantly, who is this from? Hang on.) You said. You send a response message and wait a few seconds. You get a response. (500,000 to do this. And not ask who this is again.) He said. (How far can I push this?) You said. You send a counter offer, and get a notification. (One million deposited. That quickly. I was just fucking around. This person is serious.) You said. (You think it\u2019s Kyle?) He said. (No. Kyle would send his thugs after me then tell me. But the money\u2019s been transferred. We got a job to do.) You said. You get up, put your mask on and leave for m district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Getting Sue\u2019s attention won\u2019t be that difficult. She\u2019ll come running the second she hears about the army being attacked.) You said. (Well, good thing a convoy is moving out.) He said. (Sue probably told them to contact her the second they\u2019re attacked.) You said. You hold out your hand and blast the convoy. You blast multiple vehicles and personal until the convoy is destroyed. Now we wait. You said. After a few minutes, you hear rapid thundering footsteps. Here we go. You said, growing to 100 ft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley came running as quickly as she could and when she got there, she saw the entire convoy was destroyed. Damn\u2026. She said. Sue starts looking and calling out for any survivors. You slowly creep up behind her. She crouches down and lifts up the truck up to see bodies under it. Shit\u2026. I should have escorted them. They\u2019d still be alive. She said. You quickly grab her and stab her in the side and slit her throat. Ashley stumbles over, but doesn\u2019t fall. She starts gurgling on the blood, but it turns into a growl as the stab wound and slit are healed. (What the?!) You thought. You see those marks appear on her body again. (This\u2026.is what I was trying to avoid.) You said. You duck her swing and stab her again, but the wound close as soon as you pull your knife out. (Her healing is like mine. Then I have to keep the pressure on.) You said. You grab her fist and kick her away. As she recoils, you punch her and send her flying. You disappear and reappear behind her and punch her into the ground. When the dust clears, she\u2019s gone. What the? You said. You block a punch from behind and another from the side. You roundhouse kick her and she bounces back up and charges at you. You sidestep her and she blocks you punch. She blocks your other fist and headbutts you. You stumble back and duck her kick. You grab her and slam her onto the ground. She vanishes and dark purple energy ball appear around you. Oh shit\u2026. You said. You disappear as they explode and reappear next to the creator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus\u2026. What is she? She can do that, yet wants me to bust my ass doing her work. You said. More of the balls appear. Fuck\u2026. You said. You go to move, but can\u2019t. What the!? You said. You see a glowing circle under your feet preventing you from moving. What the hell is this!? You said. As you try to get free, the balls explode; blowing back buildings and parts of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dust clears, you\u2019re still standing. Shit\u2026. That hurt\u2026. You said, seeing your right arm and left leg gone. Your healing kicks in and your cuts, bruises, and missing limbs grow back. Even though you\u2019re fully heal, you\u2019re tiring out. *Sigh* *Sigh* You said. You see the circle again and Ashley appears in front of you. You see her fist glowing. (If you have a plan, now\u2019s the time.) He said. (\u2026.Fuck.) You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab her fist mid-flight. She pulls her arm back, but you don\u2019t let go. You tighten your grip and force her to the ground. You take off your mask and punch her back. She rebounds and you appear in front of her and kick her back. You disappear and reappear behind her and kick her in the sky. She vanishes and you punch her as she moves behind you. She vanishes again and the circle appears again and 2x as many balls of energy. You look at the circle and it breaks. You disappear as the balls explode. When Ashley reappears, you punch her in the stomach and kick her away. When she gets up, you hold your hand to her face and blast her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, you see her a few feet away with her arms blocking her face. When she drops it, she drops onto one knee. You pull out your knife and walk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRgh\u2026. She said as her body was in serious pain. S\u2026.so how much\u2026..was it? She said. You stop right in front of her. How much\u2026..did he pay you? What\u2026..is it all\u2026..worth? She said. You grip your knife. \u2026\u2026You know, I thought there was a good person. Under all\u2026.that greed. A decent person\u2026\u2026wanting to show himself\u2026.. She said. Your grip loosens on your knife. You remember how you and Chijinda were good people. To the point were you other detectives at the organization wanted to be like you both. But that was then, this is now. And this world is anything but nice. But I guess greed\u2026..and selfishness are too strong. So what are you waiting for? Kill me. Claim your paycheck. She said. </span></div></div>",

You pull your arm back and Ashley collapse to the ground. You stare at her body for a few seconds. Ash\u2026.. I\u2019m\u2026.. You said. You look at your bloodied hand and knife and back at Ashley\u2019s body. As a tear runs down your face, your eyes change back to normal. You wipe away the tear, sheathe your knife, and put your mask back on. As you stand there, you hear a crow cawing and see it flying overhead. You turn and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way back to Mira\u2019s house. Where did you go? You just up and left. She said. She sees your hand bloodied and clothes tattered. What happened!? She said. \u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want to talk about it. You said. Mira was going to say something, but closes her mouth. You walk past her and wash the blood off your hand and knife. When done, you sit there on the couch and brood. Mira saw you sitting there and wanted to talk, but you let you stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there for hours. You only move to take your mask off. You don\u2019t recognize Miley until she spoke. Big\u2026. Big brother\u2026.. Is everything ok? She said. Yeah, Miley. I\u2019m just\u2026\u2026 You said balling up your fist, but unclenching it. B\u2026brother\u2026.? She said. I\u2019m\u2026.. sorry if I\u2019m scaring or worrying you. I just\u2026.. want to be alone right now. You said. Miley gives you a quick hug and runs off. Who the hell am i? You said. You sit there until the moon hangs high. Mira comes in to see you still sitting there. It\u2019s late. She said. \u2026..I know. You said. She comes and sits by you. Do you want to talk about it? She said. \u2026\u2026.No. You said. You\u2019ll feel better. She said. \u2026..How do I feel better after what I did? Why was this time different? You said. What happen? She said. She places her hand on yours. For a second, you close your hand around hers. I\u2019m\u2026..sorry, Mira. But I need to go. You said. You put your mask on and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the army found Ashley\u2019s body. She was buried by her friends and the entire army came to pay respect. They gave her a soldier\u2019s burial. Jets flew over and guns were fired. When the army and her friends were gone, you walk up to the grave. You place your hand on the gravestone. I\u2019m sorry\u2026..Ashley. You said. You put down an olive branch with white flowers on the grave and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back to Mira\u2019s house. On the way there, you sense someone. You stop and turn around, but no one was there. When you turn back around, you see a note at your feet. You pick it up and read it. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of your exploits and power. Come to the skyscraper in o district. Alone. I will be waiting at the top.\u201d (A challenger?) He said. (\u2026..I\u2019m not in the mood to fight. But I need to respond to this.) You said. You head to o district. You get there and head to the skyscraper. You grow and head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was barely lit. You find a set of stairs. You disappear and reappear at the top of the stairs. You open them to see a young girl no older than 18. She was staring out at the sun. \u2026..You got here faster than I expected. She said, turning around. She walks over to you and stops a few feet. From what I heard, I was expecting a muscular built man. Not someone still in their teen\u2019s. She said. You say nothing. Not much for words, are you? Actions are more your thing. And you\u2019ve been very busy. Survive the arena, beat all 5 of the elites, turn back the master\u2019s army all by yourself. Need I keep going? She said. (Yes. Stroke my ego.) He said. But I didn\u2019t bring you here to tell you what you\u2019ve accomplished. I wanted to see the man himself. And see if what they say about you is true. She said. (So a fight is what she wants.) You thought. Let\u2019s not waste words or time. Come. Show me what they say about you being true. She said. You put your fists up. She comes at you and you sidestep her. You leg sweep her and she hits the ground with a thud. She gets right back up. First one\u2019s free. She said. She punches you, but you block and go for a knee to her gut, but she steps back and steps it with a knee of her own. You grab her leg and she jumps and spins kicks you. You duck and flip her. She catches herself with her hands and flips out the way as you go for a kick to her gut. When she lands, you were behind her, and she ducks your attack. You pull out your knife and she kicks it out your hand. She goes for another, but you catch and toss her again. This time, you appear as she lands on her hands and sweep them. When she hits the ground, you catch your knife and pounce on her with it against her neck. I\u2026..yield. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Had me worried there for a second.) He said. You sheathe your knife and get off her. I see\u2026. So they rumors weren\u2019t fabrication. You are good. She said. You turn to leave. She wouldn\u2019t want you like this. Even though she hated your reasoning, she wouldn\u2019t want to see you like this. She said. You stop for minute, clench your fist, and keep going until you\u2019re back outside. (Well, that was interesting.) He said. (Yeah\u2026.) You said. (Are you still upset over Sue? It was a contract.) He said. (I know, but\u2026. It felt different.) You said. (How? What was different about this one?) He said. (I\u2026.don\u2019t know.) You said. (I understand the concept of grieving and all, but we had a job to do. Paid in advance to complete. You knew this would happen.) He said. (I just didn\u2019t think it would get like this.) You said. You head back to Mira\u2019s place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk, you come to a stop. \u2026\u2026What do you want? You said. What? You aren\u2019t happy to see me? A voice said as the owner came into view. You again. You said. What? Didn\u2019t you enjoy our last bout? She said. No. And i\u2019m not in the mood today. Or ever. You said. Are you running scared? The same person who killed Ashley? She said. (How does she know that?) I\u2019m not scared of you. I\u2019m just not going to. You said. What if I gave you a reason? She said. Good luck with that. You said turning around. Shame. Looks like I have to go play with Mira. She said. You stop dead in your tracks. What did you say? You said. Hm? Oh. I was thinking of having some fun with that girl you\u2019re always around. She seems nice and all. She said. Your bawl your fist up. But her little sister, she\u2019s so energetic. She\u2019ll be overjoyed at the games I have plan. She said. You\u2019re dead! You said. That lit the fire. This should be fun. She said. Before you moved, your dark half comes out. What the?! Who\u2019s this!? She said. She\u2019s\u2026.mine!! He said. One condition. You rip her damn spine out! You said. Done. He said. </span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t want to say it, but she was being completely overwhelmed. He didn\u2019t hold anything back. When one of his attacks hit the ground, a hole was formed that was deep enough to go to china. And when he was hit, he returned the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet your ass up! He said. Ugh\u2026.. How is this possible? You\u2019re not even\u2026.. Is this how you do it? Having someone else do your fighting for you? She said. No. My\u2026..friend here only fights when it\u2019s enjoyable or he\u2019s pissed. And right now, he\u2019s pissed. You said. And that\u2019s not a good thing\u2026. He said. I don\u2019t care if he is or not. But I\u2019m not going down to some clone! She said. Clone!? I see your spine and raise you her damn head! He said. Done. You said. Don\u2019t\u2026.count me out just yet! She said. A dark circle appear under him and he can\u2019t move. What the?! He said. If I can\u2019t win the old fashion way, then I\u2019ll win my own way. She said. When I get free! He said trying to budge. The only way out is to die\u2026. She said. The circle starts to glow and a purple beam erupts from it. After it\u2019s gone, your dark half is nowhere to be seen. Heh\u2026. Hahahaha! Now it\u2019s your turn! She said. As she got up, your dark half grabs her head from behind. What?! But how!? She said. You wouldn\u2019t understand. He said. With ease, he rips the lady\u2019s head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBitch got exactly what she deserved. He said, shrinking down. Need to get you your own growth band. You said. Think I\u2019ll keep this one. You want this? He said, pointing to the head. No. Leave it for the vultures. You said. He toss the head and goes back inside you. You take a look at the body before heading to Jessica\u2019s place. When you get there, you enter through the window and look for her. Whoa\u2026. She has a lab in her own home. You said. You see her at a counter with beakers and test tubes. You disappear and reappear on the counter. Jessica. You said. Oh! It\u2019s you. I didn\u2019t know you were coming. I would have worn something more casual. She said. It\u2019s fine. I need something. You said. Anything for my little man. She said. I need- What did you say? You said. I called you my little man. She said. Why? You said. Because that\u2019s why you are. Little and cute! She said, giggling. (The girls just swoon over you, don\u2019t they?) He said. (A wink or a smile, yeah. But this?) You said. She cups you in her hand and bring you closer to her face. So. What does my little man need of me? It can be anything. And I mean anything. You said. She presses you against her massive chest and laughs before letting go. Is that it? She said. N\u2026No. It was\u2026.. I need another growth band. You said. Is that it? That will only take an hour. I was hoping for a few hours. You and me. She said. A red tint appears on your cheeks. (What? You don\u2019t know how to flirt?) He said. (\u2026..It\u2019s been a long time.) You said. Come on. Put saving the world on hold. And let me make all your worries go away. She said. Well\u2026. I have a lot of things to do. You said. The master can wait. In fact, why don\u2019t you be my master? She said. (I like this one.) He said. S\u2026.sorry. I don\u2019t see myself like that. And I don\u2019t want someone doing everything I say. You said. (Speak for yourself. All my servants will listen to me as if it\u2019s gospel.) he said. Awww! You\u2019re so modest. She said, rubbing your head. You\u2019d bat anyone else\u2019s finger away, but you\u2019re too embarrassed. Hehe! Now let me get started on that device for you. But where am I going to keep you? She said. On the ground? You said. Mmm. No. Wait, I know! She said. She puts you down her cleavage and giggles as you scramble up. I bet your face is red as a tomato! Now stay there until I\u2019m done. She said. (I really like this one! ) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like she said, it only took her an hour to build a new growth band for you. There we go. She said. Wow. I thought you were just joking. You said. I wasn\u2019t. She said. You put the band on and grow. Thanks, Jessica. You said. Anything for you. Although\u2026. I have to say\u2026. I like you smaller. She said. I get that a lot. She said. It\u2019s not as fun, but it\u2019s easier to do this. She said. She takes off your mask and kisses you. This was no regular kiss. She was invading your mouth with her tongue. After a few seconds, she breaks it. Hehe! Ever been kissed like that before? She said. N-never. You said, still reeling. First time for everything. She said. You were surprised at her boldness, but you go wide eyed when you see Chijinda standing a few feet away. Where you that surprised? She said. You look again and he\u2019s gone. Y\u2026.yeah\u2026. It\u2019s getting dark. I better go. You said. Why not stay here? She said. You see him again. I\u2026.think that would be best. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find a couch and crash there, much to Jessica\u2019s displease as she wanted you to sleep in her bed with her. As you lay there, you see Chijinda on the other couch. He\u2019s\u2026.just sitting there. Maybe I should\u2026. No. He\u2019s not real. You said. \u2026\u2026I\u2019m as real as you believe it. He said. Y\u2026.you can talk?! You said. Why wouldn\u2019t I? I\u2019m right here in front of you. And speaking English. She said. You\u2019re just\u2026..a figment of my mind. You said, gripping your head as he vanishes. I hope this doesn\u2019t get any worse. You said. You close your eyes and go to sleep. As you slept, you felt something weighing down on you. What the\u2026.? You said. You open your eyes to see Jessica cuddling against you. Ahh. My little man\u2026. She said. (I really like her.) He said. You try your best to sleep with her snuggling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZzz\u2026.. You said. As you slept, Jessica kissed you. Hehe! Wakey wakey! She said. Ugh\u2026. You said, opening your eyes. Good morning. I take it my snuggling didn\u2019t bother you. She said. Not\u2026.really. I did feel you kissing me multiple times and rubbing my chest. You said. I couldn\u2019t help it. You\u2019re so cute. But when you\u2019re small, you\u2019re just adorable! She said. She gets off you and you get up and put your mask on. Aww. Do you have to leave so soon? I got somethings to do. You said. My door is always open to you. She said. Thanks. You said. You disappeared and reappeared outside and head to m district. When you get there, you feel the ground shake. Oh great. You said. The shaking gets more violent and guys leaving. It would take the army a while to get here. You said. After a few minutes, you see the cause of it. (Amy\u2026. And her friends.) You said. You grow to 100ft. (See the fire in her eyes. Complete hatred for us.) He said. (So do the other three. Except Soya. She\u2019s fucking terrified.) You girls lost or need something? You said. \u2026..The master wats to see you. You will come along. Koyuki said. \u201cI will come along.\u201d Ha. Kyle wants me, he can come get me himself. Not send his attack dogs. You said. You really don\u2019t know how this works. We\u2019re in charge here! Amy said. Spat that line before. Don\u2019t you have people to torture? Or cities to topple? Maybe learn to smile? You said. You!! Amy said. Seethe all you want. You and your goons aren\u2019t threatening when knob knees over there is shaking like crazy. You said. Soya! Luna said. Sorry! He\u2019s just- A man! Like every other one! Amy interrupts. Right\u2026. You guys are causing a scene and the army is on there way. You said. You think we can\u2019t handle that? Luna said. No. But I don\u2019t want to be in the crossfire. You said. Rgh! This is useless. 5 of us, one of him. We can kill him! Yumi said. You disappear and reappear in front of her and punch her straight in the nose. Uhh\u2026.. She said as she hits the ground. \u2026..Anyone else? You said. YUMI! Luna said. You look right at Soya and she\u2019s terrified. (Girl\u2019s about to piss herself.) He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..I think I\u2019ll take you up on that offer. Just to see what he wants. Just keep your friends in line, Koyuki. You said. You leave for the mansion. H..h\u2026.he just\u2026.knocked Yumi out cold. Soya said. Yumi!? Yumi!! Luna said. \u2026..Something has to be done about him\u2026. Koyuki mutters.</span></div></div>",

My offer for them was ninety thousand. You said. That high? He said. I\u2019m that good. Remember. I survived your arena. You said. \u2026..Yeah. 300,000. He said. That\u2019s a commitment. Can you back that up? You said. 100,000 now. The rest later. He said. You take the money. Heh. So what do you done? You said. Bring me the heads of the army. He said. Figuratively? Or literally? You said. Bring them here. Alive. He said. Done. You said. You leave the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I have bring in the leaders of the army? No problem. You jump down and head into their base. You grow to 100ft. Damnit! We\u2019re way behind schedule. Kira said. It hasn\u2019t been easy. Ever since Ashley\u2026..died, we\u2019ve been lost. Kim said. I know it was him. Who else could have done it? Kira said. There\u2019s no proof of him doing it. Even if he\u2019s the most capable. Kim said. Talking about me behind my back? You said. What the?! Where the hell have you been?! Kira said. Doing my own thing. I heard what happen to Sue. How are you going to handle this? You said. You\u2019ve been gone for weeks, our friend was killed, which I know you had something to do with it. Kira said. Why would I want to kill Sue? We had our differences, but not worth killing over. If you want to honor her, then take the fight to Kyle\u2019s mansion. I basically blazed a trail for you. What happen to making Kyle suffer, Kim? You said death would be too good for him. You said\u2026\u2026I was racked with grief when I found out that Ashley died. Combined that with Arif\u2019s sudden disappearance, I couldn\u2019t do anything. Plus, Ashley\u2019s death hit us a lot harder than we thought. When she died, morale sunk and some men went back into slavery. She said. (Wimps!) He said. So basically you lost your figure head. And I lost my paycheck. You said. Are you serious right now!? All that\u2019s going on, all that is happening, and you\u2019re worried about some money!?! Kira said. I told you from day fucking one that this was YOUR fight, not mine. I have no stake in this war with Kyle. Unless you have cash, we have nothing to talk about. You said. Well, it\u2019s a good thing I did have the money. But you\u2019ve been gone while we\u2019ve been suffering. So I don\u2019t think you deserve a damn cent. Kira said. So you\u2019re backing out of the deal? You said. The deal was to help. You haven\u2019t been doing that. So the contract is null and void. She said. Then it\u2019s a good thing I took Kyle\u2019s offer. You said. You punch Kira\u2019s lights out and subdue Kim before she could move. Lights out. You said headbutting her. She slumps down unconscious. (Easiest payday ever.) He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tying them up, you carry them to O district. (What are we doing here?) He said. (There\u2019s one more we need.) You said. (That bitch who was with Sue?) He said. (Right.) You said. Ugh\u2026.. What happened? Kira said. Look whose awake. You said. You evil, spineless coward! Untie us! She said. Nah. I like you just the way you are. You said. So you\u2019re going to leave us here? Someone will find us! She said. Counting on it. Now, go back to sleep. You said, knocking her out. (Now it\u2019s just a waiting game.) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit and wait for fifteen minutes until you see her coming. There she is. You said. (Still wearing nothing but a jacket to cover those orbs of hers. And those knee high boots. And I think a mini skirt. Damn. She\u2019s confident in herself.) He said. (Guess when your kind tower over another, you get to wear whatever.) You said. (Shit. Imagine the stone age. It must have been 5x as worse.) He said. (Given what\u2019s going on now, I think most would go back to the stone age.) You said. You see her get close to them and sneak behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira? Kim? How did you get like this? She said. No response from either. Unconscious\u2026.. Hang on. She said. As she unties them, Kira stirs. S\u2026Susan\u2026.. She said. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll have you out. She said. No\u2026 It\u2019s a\u2026. She said. You hit her in the back of the head and she hits the ground. Trap. You said. You quickly tie her up with the others. All three. Time to cash in. You said. You carry all three to Kyle\u2019s mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss them onto the ground and shrink back down. Wow\u2026. Part of me didn\u2019t believe. He said. Never doubt me. Now the rest of my payment. You said. Ohhh\u2026.. My head\u2026. Kira? Kim said. She takes a look at her surrounding and sees you and Kyle, but her eyes focus on Kyle. You dirty, rotten, megalomaniac! Rgh!! When I get my hands on you!!! Kim said. (Jesus\u2026.. And I thought she was the calm one.) You thought. (It\u2019s always the quiet ones.) He said. Kyle hands you the rest of your money. They\u2019re all yours. You said. As you turn to leave, you see Chijinda standing near the door way. \u2026..Feel good about yourself? He said. You shake your head and he\u2019s gone. You continue to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(With Kim and the other two gone, it\u2019s open season on m district.) He said. (Wouldn\u2019t be surprise if Kyle has his army move out right now.) You said. You keep going until you see Chijinda standing against a building. Cash money in pocket. I wonder if that what kept you from saving me? He said. This is different. You said. Really? How so? He said. They got the short end of the stick. They have to deal with that? You said. Short end? I wonder if that\u2019s what I got? He said. What happen to you was\u2026.. You said. Was what? He said. Was\u2026.. You said. Mmm. You\u2019re never one not to have an answer. My death sure has change you. He said. I\u2019m still the same person. Just not going to do something suicidal for nothing. You said. So after you found my body, why didn\u2019t you just leave the school? He said. I\u2026.owed it to you. You said. And not them? He said. These clowns haven\u2019t done anything for me. You said. The money they promised? It was quite a lot to be there for them. He said. I got a better deal. I follow the money. You said. And if Miku offered money, would you have joined her, and forget why we were there to begin with? He said. Ah\u2026.! You said. I thought not. He said as he disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Arguing with a figment of your imagination?) He said. (I think it\u2019s slowly getting worse.) You said. (I can tell. First seeing, now talking.) He said. (Sinclair was right. This dementia will kill me. I took Chijinda\u2019s death hard, but I didn\u2019t think it was this bad.) You thought. </span></div></div>",

They prepared as best they could and waited, but the attack never came. Kyle\u2019s army didn\u2019t show up, even though m district is completely vulnerable. You got a suspicious feeling, so you went to the prison to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Why are we here?) he said. (Something\u2019s not right. M district open wide, and Kyle not attacking? Something\u2019s going on.) You said. (I didn\u2019t think you cared.) He said. (I don\u2019t. But I\u2019m not going after Sue\u2019s friends again. They know I\u2019ll come for them again, and they won\u2019t be nice about it.) You said. (So question Sue\u2019s friends?) He said. (They won\u2019t tell us a damn thing. But I think I know what\u2019s happening.) You said. You head to the medical wing and see notes with formulas and equations. It looks\u2026.like someone trying to break down something. You said. You look on the wall and see a picture of you and your blood type with equations all around. You also see a video of you fighting. (Looks like these clowns were researching us.) He said. You pull down all the pictures, equations, and other data and start a pile. You walk out, and blast an energy wave at it; starting a fire. You walk out with the alarm blaring. You head to Jessica\u2019s mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, you force open the door and call out for her. You are hugged from behind. Nice to see you again! She said. Not now. You said. Why? What happened? She said, letting go. I went to that prison, and I found pictures, equations, and whatever else there about me. You said. What? She said. Are you studying me? You said. No! I wouldn\u2019t even. It\u2019s someone else. After first meeting you, I wouldn\u2019t do that without your permission. She said. So it\u2019s someone else? You said. It has to be. I stop all my research on you after you confronted me. She said. \u2026.Sorry about barging in here. You said. Well\u2026. I know how you can make it up to me. She said, smiling. (Great\u2026..) You thought. She grabs your hand and takes you to a examination room. Really? You said. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t interested in learning about you. She said. Jessica\u2026.. You said. I promise to burn all of it when I\u2019m done. Please! She said with her eyes like puppy dogs. (The infamous puppy dog eyes\u2026.. Damn.) Ok\u2026. But right into the fire. You said. You sit down on the table. Ok. Blood sample first. She said. She takes the blood sample and puts it under a microscope. Ok\u2026 The cells are dividing at a rapid rate. Faster than normal. That explains the healing. Jesus\u2026. All the cells have tripled. It\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to make a clone of you. She said. Jessica comes back over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. Let\u2019s test your reflexes. She said. She hits your knee and you kick. Perfect timing. Ok. Let\u2019s test those your sight. She takes off your mask and covers one of your eyes. Ok. Read as far as you can see. L, M, N, A, K, E, O, C. You read out. Good. I don\u2019t have a projector, so I\u2019ll mark 20/20. Now to test feeling. She said. That\u2019s not a test. Hey! Whose the scientist here? She said. You. You said. Right, she said blindfolding you. And this is a test how? You said. You\u2019ll see. \u2026.Ok. You feel that? She said. I do, but what is it? You said. Heh heh! Take a guess. She said. Soft, firm, round\u2026.. Am I touching your ass? You said. No. She said. Is it your breast? You said. Maybe\u2026. She said. (And I thought Chijinda was a perv.) You thought. Ok. Do you feel\u2026.this! She said. Jessica hops onto you and kiss you. (This woman\u2026..) You thought.  She removes the blindfold and rubs your face as her tongue moves around in your mouth. (I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve seen where this leads to next.) He said. Now. For the test of stamina! She said. Ok! That\u2019 enough. You said. But I\u2019m not done yet. I need to see if you tire out. She said. (If that isn\u2019t a lowkey innuendo\u2026.) He said. I have to be somewhere. Burn that data. You said, getting up and leaving. Damnit\u2026. So close\u2026 She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I say you should have done it.) He said. (Call me old fashion, but I don\u2019t think sex should be frivolous. Should be two people in love with each other.) You said. (So you want your first time to be special.) He said. (\u2026\u2026And if I do?) You said. (I think Mira\u2019s heart might stop if you tell her that.) He said. (Shut up!) You said. As you walk, you hear something. Huh? You said. You look around and see no one. \u2026..Hm. You said. Over here. In front. A voice said. You look to see a robed and hooded woman right in front of you. (Where the fuck\u2026.?) You thought. (Think she\u2019s wearing anything under there?) He said. You have quite the reputation. I had to see you for myself. She said. I don\u2019t do autographs. You said. Why autograph when I can get the real person? She said. Jesus\u2026. Another one? You said. I can assure you, I\u2019m way different. She said. Heard that before. Raincheck. You said. Is this the same guy who killed Ashley? She said. (How\u2026.?) You thought. Or the same man who saw his friend died and went on to get revenge. I\u2019m sure he- You punch her in the face and send her flying back. Grrr\u2026. You said. Hm. Not bad. She said, behind you. How did she? You mutter. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been hit like that. She said. You swing behind you and she\u2019s gone. But you swing wildly. You have no discipline. She said. And what makes you qualified in that assessment? You said. From just looking at you, I can tell you\u2019re hoping one hit is enough. You said. That\u2019s because most people go down in one. You said. Well, I\u2019m not like most. She said. She appears in front of you and you block her fist. You go for a punch, but she sidesteps and takes your legs out from under you. You catch yourself on one hand and spin kick her, but she grabs your leg and tosses you back up. Using the momentum, you bounce back to elbow her, but she catches it and throws you into a building. You disappear and reappear behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeh. What do you say we get serious for a second? She said, turning around. (This woman\u2026.. What is she? She\u2019s able to keep up with me like it\u2019s nothing. And to see where I\u2019m going to strike next\u2026.) you thought. Come on. Let\u2019s make this interesting. She said. You disappear and reappear behind her, and when she blocks, you punch hit her from the front. She sent back, but vanishes. You wait a second and block a kick from behind. Using your arm as a platform, she jumps and kicks you with her other foot. You grab her leg and toss her away. You disappear and reappear behind her and go to punch her. She vanishes and you wait. You block a punch from behind, but don\u2019t see the real attack is from above as she comes down with her knee on your back. Heh. She said get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOw\u2026.. You said. This is what has everyone afraid? She said. You try to push yourself up, but it felt like a plane crashed into you and a building fell onto you. Hmph. Now I see why your friend died. She said. \u2026.! And he was such a good person too. What was his name again? She said. Your anger starts to take over as you get up. Oh? On your feet? She said. \u2026..Don\u2019t you dare\u2026.. SAY HIS NAME!!! You shouted. As your power increased, the ground started to shake. W\u2026what the?! She said. You appear right in front of her and she barely has time to block your fist. You follow it up with a few more punchs; forcing her to jump back. He\u2019s\u2026.different. He\u2019s attacking with reckless abandon. She said. You appear behind her and she vanishes as your fist hits the ground; creating a giant crater. He\u2019s not holding back any longer\u2026.. She said. </span></div></div>",

You disappear and reappear behind her and kick her into the sky. You build up energy in your hand and disappear. You reappear above her and blast her into the ground. When the beam hits the ground, the explosion clears the surrounding area. When the it dies down, you land on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour power starts to die down. (Destructive\u2026. See what happens when you just cut loose and hold nothing back?) He said. (Quit trying to tempt me.) You said. You look around. Going to be hard to explain this. Sinclair can foot the bill. You said. When you take a step, your body freezes.  What the!? You said. You see a dark circle under your feet. Then you see her appear right in front of you. You\u2026.! How did you survive? You said. Wouldn\u2019t you like to know. I am not easily impressed, but you\u2026. She said, with her hand running down your face. Have caught my attention. Let\u2019s see who behind there. She said. She slowly removes your mask, and gasps. My\u2026. A lot younger than I thought you were. You can\u2019t be out of your teens. She said. So? You said. And your face? Did you make out with a cheese grater? She said. Crack your jokes while you can. When I get free\u2026.! You said. You\u2019re not going anywhere until I say so. Now hold still. She said. Her hands start to glow as she reaches for your face. When her hands, touch you, you don\u2019t feel anything happening. W\u2026.what are you doing? You said. Getting rid of those nasty scars. She said. You could feel the scars being removed. There. All done. She said. Why\u2026.did you\u2026. She said. Let call it a whim. Now, let\u2019s see who you get your power. She said. Her hand phases through you and she pulls out your dark half. So\u2026.this is how you get so powerful. All your bad qualities made human. She said. Grrrr! Get your hands off me! He said.  So when your anger rises, he gives you your powers. She said. You\u2026.are far from the point! Rgh! Damnit!! Why can\u2019t I break free?! He said. Heh heh\u2026. She said. You try to break free, but can\u2019t move. All your power comes from him. But he said that\u2019s not true. So just in case\u2026. She said. She says some sort of incantation and you feel something placed on your back and you feel weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nW\u2026what the hell did you do?! You said. Oh, you\u2019ll find out soon enough. And I\u2019m taking your friend here. She said. Grrr! Keep pissing me off! When you let go of me\u2026.! He said. Heh heh\u2026 Bye, handsome. She said, vanishing. The circle disappears and you\u2019re free. What\u2026.is that woman? I can\u2019t let her escape. If she\u2019s working with Kyle, then she\u2019s on her way to the mansion. You said. You try vanish, but can\u2019t. What the?! Why didn\u2019t I move? You said. You try again, but nothing happens. What in the!? You said. You try to fire a energy beam, but nothing comes from your hand. M\u2026.my powers\u2026. What the fuck did she do to me!? You said. (It\u2019s like she sealed them. Wait. If my speed and strength are gone\u2026.) You thought. You pull out your knife and stab your leg and the wound doesn\u2019t heal up. (Shit\u2026. Even my healing. I\u2019m in a lot of trouble.) You said. With your powers gone, you know it\u2019s going to be open season on you. Whatever that bitch did, I need to find her. And him. But first\u2026. Get this cut looked at. You said. You quickly made your way to Mira\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get inside, look for any peroxide, bandages, or stiches you could find. Ok\u2026. You said. You spray the cut, stich it closed and roll a bandage over it. Now to find her. You said.  You get up and open the door, but Miley hugs you from behind. Miley\u2026. You said. Big brother\u2019s back! She said. Heh. I don\u2019t know if I should be happy or surprised about that. You said. It\u2019s not like that\u2026. I always know big brother will come back. She said. And don\u2019t forget it. You said. You\u2019re not going back out already? You just got back. She said, letting go. I have something to do. You said. Is it dangerous? She said. You\u2019re not going to gatekeep me, are you? You said. \u2026..Maybe. She said with a pout. Miley\u2026 You said. Someone needs to look out for you. She said. Don\u2019t I always come back? You said. Hurt. She said. But not badly. I\u2019ll be fine. You said. \u2026..Ok. I\u2019ll let you pass. She said. Thanks gatekeeper. You said, leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll be walking into the lion\u2019s den. Best pay a visit to the army. You said. You head to m district and head into their armory. The soldiers didn\u2019t even question or stop you when you took a few of their grenades. (Flashbangs. Pretty much useless for them. But I still got my growth device.

You said. You continue to search, but come up empty. Damn\u2026. Where is she? You said. (She\u2019s not here\u2026. Where else would she be?) (First her, then Kyle, then the army. No one is going to stop me.) You thought. What the fuck? I didn\u2019t\u2026.just think that? You said. Looking for something? A voice said. You turn around to see the cloaked woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t waste any time following. She said. Where is he? You said. What? No banter, jokes or insults? Someone\u2019s being serious. She said. I don\u2019t have time for that today. Where did you take him? You said. That prison the little jokester is so fond of. Him and his girls are there swooning over the gift I gave them. She said. You-You gave him over to Kyle!? You said. I don\u2019t see why not. She said. Do you have any idea what they\u2019re going to do? You said. Cut him open, run test, find out how to make your power their own. She said. (I still remember Beth\u2026. If Kyle\u2019s thugs become like that\u2026.. I\u2019ll just kill them like the rest.) (What the hell?!) You thought. But enough about them. Let\u2019s talk about us. She said. We have nothing to talk about. You said. I beg to differ. Why don\u2019t you just give yourself over to me? She said. And be your slave? You said. You hurt me. I\u2019m actually a nice person. I haven\u2019t killed anyone in the last two months. She said. I\u2019m jumping for joy. You said. I don\u2019t want you as my slave. I want you to be\u2026.something more. She said. Something\u2026..more? You said. That\u2019s right. Someone like you need a special position. And I promise to reward you well. She said, coming closer. (What is she? Her words are like honey, but I can taste the vinegar.) You thought. Come now. There\u2019s no need for us to fight. A handsome man like yourself shouldn\u2019t be doing that anyway. Plus, I\u2019m a lot more fun that girl you spend all your time with. She said. (M-Mira.) You said. She removes your mask and puts your hand on her chest. (Shit. Those must be at least double Ds.) You thought. All natural. And all yours if you become mine. She said. She wraps her arm around you and pulls you close. When her head was close, she felt a sharp pain in her side. Ugh\u2026! She said. She looks to see your knife jammed into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks back at you\u2026.and smiles. You\u2019re such a bad boy. She said before kissing you. And I love discipling bad boys. She said. (This girl is insane!) You thought. You pull out your knife kick her away. You\u2019re not seriously going to do this? Without your\u2026..powers. She said. You think I depend on my powers to get me through a tough situation? You\u2019re in for a shock. You said. You run to her and she grabs your arm. You drop and catch your knife in your other hand and she moves back just as your knife cuts a piece of her cloak. You quickly close the distance and kick her. She block and shifting your weight, you balance off her and kick her with other leg. While she stumbles back, charge her. She sidesteps and sweep your feet out from under you. You catch yourself with your hand, rebound back up, and jump back with your elbow right into her face. You spin around and stab her right in the heart. (Got her!) You said. Before you could pull your knife out, you are suddenly bounded by shadow like tendrils. What the?! You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeh\u2026..hehehe\u2026. I have to admit. Even with your powers locked, you are good. But\u2026. She said, pulling out your knife. You see all the stab wounds heal and close up. Without them, you aren\u2019t going to kill me. She said. (W\u2026.what is she?) You thought. You, on the other hand, are quite killable. No powers, no strength or speed, no regeneration. She said. Grr\u2026. You said. A stab in the neck, the heart, or multiple and you\u2019re dead. She said. So what are you waiting for? You said. You have any idea how hard it is to clean out blood? Besides Amy is hellbent on doing it herself. She said. (Shit. Amy\u2019s already jacked up on whatever shit she took to become better. If they get what I got\u2026.) You thought. But maybe\u2026. A little pain will do you good. She said. She stabs you in the leg. That\u2019s for stabbing me. Then in the arm. That\u2019s for turning down my offer. The in the side. And that\u2019s for not kissing me. She said. You didn\u2019t scream once. You weren\u2019t going to give her the satisfaction. Hm. One more? I guess so. Even things out. She said. When she goes to stab you, you grab her hand. What?! How are you?! She said. Your heart starts beating fast. Then faster and faster, and your power starts to rise to the point you break free. What? She said shocked. You pull her close and punch her and send her crashing into the wall. You pick up your knife just as she appears in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nH\u2026.How are you\u2026 But I sealed them.....! She said. You disappear and reappear in front of her and she vanishes. You follow after her and kick her. You disappear and reappear behind her and she vanishes as your fist hits the ground. She reappears behind you and you grab her hand and roundhouse kick her. Ugh\u2026.! She said, stumbling back. You swing your knife upward and slice her across her chest. ARGH!! She shouts. As you go to stab her, your chest starts to heart and you clutch it; which makes you drop your knife. You go to pick it up, but she starts to get up. So you leave your knife behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to a safe distance, you fall over and cough up blood. I knew\u2026..i\u2019d hurt, but not like this. You said. You writhe there for a minute before getting up. I have\u2026.to find him. You said.</span></div></div>",

You cough up blood again and take off your clothes. You knock out a guard and take his clothes. Wow. For someone who preaches that males are worthless and inferior, they still give them jobs like this. You said. You walk through the place, looking for your dark half. You look into each cell and come up empty until you come across a lone cell. Hey! Hey!! You said. In the dark corners of the cell, you see glowing red eyes and see him coming up. There you are. Holy shit. They slapped a collar on you? And where did you get that mask from? You said. I\u2019ve always had it. What took you so long? He said. That bitch again. Ugh\u2026! You said. The hell\u2019s your problem? Wait. Your heart\u2026. You didn\u2019t\u2026.. He said. It was either that or get stabbed in the neck. You said. We won\u2019t be able to break out with you like this. He said. Like hell. Let\u2019s get you out. You said. You start lockpicking the cell. Damn. They went out on keeping you locked up. This tumbler is hard. You said. They got public enemy number 1. It\u2019s only right they go this far. He said. You break the lock open and the cell door. Ok. Don\u2019t move out. Got to get that collar off first. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou!! A enforcer shouts. (Shit!) You thought. Bring him to the meeting room. And be quick about it! The master is waiting. She said. Ok\u2026. Let\u2019s play along here. Get in front while I work this. You said. You escort your dark half while trying to hack the collar. Damn it. I\u2019ve shutdown the alarm, but I need a screw driver to get the bolts out. I\u2019d pull them, but my powers are still gone. You said. And I can\u2019t do it either. I get this painful shock. He said. You reach the meeting room and see Kyle with is elites and some scientist. (Damn\u2026. Whole goon squad is here.) You thought. (Like I said, public enemy number 1.) He said. (You can still hear my thoughts?) You said. (We are the same person. Two halves of the same coin.) He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBring him here. Kyle said. You do what he said. (This doesn\u2019t happen often, but I don\u2019t know what to do. Can\u2019t fight, but I can\u2019t leave you here.) You said. Well? Kyle said. Primary blood test showed extreme regenerative nature. We theorized that it\u2019s high enough for limb regeneration.  Even if subject is decapitated, his head would grow back. (Even I didn\u2019t know that last part.) You thought. So what about abnormal strength and speed? Amy said.  He was highly uncooperative, but we speculate that his muscles and bones are hardened, which probably explains the strength. We still need to run a lot more tests. She said. From what I\u2019ve seen, it blows what amy was given out the water. Luna said. So how do we make it ours!? Amy said. I\u2019d rather not discuss that in the presence of\u2026..extra ears. She said. (Shit. That\u2019s me. But I can\u2019t leave.) You said. (Can\u2019t fight either. Your body is still suffering.) He said. \u2026..You\u2019re relived. Kyle said. (Go. Get stronger however you can.) He said. You turn and walk out. Looks like it\u2019s time to head back to Sinclair, but first\u2026. Let my body recover a little. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way back and put your old clothes on and cough up blood. Argh\u2026.! You said, clutching your chest. You put your mask back on and head to Mira\u2019s house. When you get there, you manage to open the door before falling out. B\u2026.big brother! Miley said, running up to you. She crouches down next to you. Mira! Come quick! She shouts. Miley grabs your hand just as Mira runs up. What happened!? She said worried. He just came in like this. He\u2019s bleeding, coughing up blood, and his heart is pounding like crazy. Miley said. Get all the medicine we have. Hurry! She said. Miley runs off. And here I thought\u2026\u2026you didn\u2019t care. You said. You thought wrong. She said. That\u2019s\u2026..doesn\u2019t happen a lot. You said. Miley comes back with a medical kit and extra medical supplies. Her and Mira pick you up and move you to the couch; where they started to work on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. Hold still. Mira said. She rubs peroxide on your last wound. You clench your teeth in pain as Miley rolls a bandage over it. Ok. That should do it. Mira said. All that\u2019s missing is the hospital bed. You said. Is he going to be ok? Miley said. He\u2019ll be fine. Mira said. And just in time to. I need to go find someone. You said. Not in your condition. You\u2019re still recovering. Mira said. I\u2019m healthy as a horse. See, look. I can stand. You said. You get up and wince back down. As a horse. Right. You\u2019re on bedrest indefinitely. Mira said. Indefinitely? You said. Until I say so. Then you have to get pass Miley, who you appointed as gatekeeper. Mira said. And I\u2019m not so easily swayed. One look of pain, and back on bedrest! She said. Either of you have a phone? I need to call 911 about being held hostage. You said. Does a hostage get the care of two loving girls? Mira said. \u2026\u2026No. Wait. Two loving girls? Are you saying you love me? You said. What?! No! I mean\u2026..! I meant it as a metaphor. Not that I don\u2019t love you, just\u2026.. She said, going red in the face. Uh-huh.

It reminded you of the times you\u2019d spend in the hospital after being investigation when sideways. And it reminds you that you\u2019re still human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on, Miley. I can get my own drink. You said. You can barely stand. She said. Not true. Look. You said. You get up and stand\u2026.only to grip onto the couch arm. You were saying? She said. \u2026.Fine. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen night came, Mira changed out your bandages. Wounds are closed up. And no sign of infection. I\u2019d say a day or two before you\u2019re healed up. She said. And finally get off this couch. You said. Don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t like being waited on hand and foot. Surprised you didn\u2019t make us wear bikini\u2019s while doing so. She said. One, I\u2019m not handicap, I can do things myself. Two, I\u2019m not lazy. And three, that\u2019s just wrong. I don\u2019t want to see you or Miley in a bikini every time I see you. Especially Miley. She\u2019s like, what,13? 14? I\u2019m not some pervert like\u2026.. You said. Pervert like\u2026..the master? Mira said. Not like Kyle. Although he has 5 of them with him at all times\u2026. You said. Then like who? She said. \u2026..Chijinda. You mutter. I\u2019m right here, you know. He said, appearing on the couch arm. What did you say? Mira said. \u2026..Nothing. It\u2019s late. And I\u2019m tired. You said. You aren\u2019t trying to sneak out again, are you? She said. One time. And I get put lockdown. You said. For your own good. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mira left, it was just you and Chijinda. So\u2026. Kyle\u2019s learning all your secrets right now. And here you are. He said. I can\u2019t do anything about that. You said. Why not? You said. Because my body couldn\u2019t handle anymore. I\u2019d be captured to. Or worse, dead. You said. Isn\u2019t that a better solution than Kyle finding out about your powers? He said. Sounds like you want me to die. You said. Don\u2019t act like that hasn\u2019t crossed your mind. You still haven\u2019t come to terms with my death. He said, getting up and looking out the window. This is only going to get worse. He said. What? My onset dementia? Or the world? You said. Both. I suggest you find a solution soon. Or it\u2019s not going to end well. For anyone. He said. You grip your head and he disappears. Shit\u2026. You said. You close your eyes and go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the night, your phone goes off. What the\u2026.? You said. You look at the message. \u201cGet up. Head to Sinclair\u2019s.\u201d It said. Sinclair\u2019s. That\u2019s beyond the o district. Travelling that path at night. Not a good idea. You phone goes off again. \u201cHurry your ass up.\u201d It said. Jesus\u2026 You said. You put your mask on and head to the door. You turn the knob slowly, open the door, and leave. You get to the highway that leads out of O district. This is going to be a difficult trip. Plus, Sinclair\u2019s place isn\u2019t in the safest of place. But someone wants to meet. You said. You start walking along the highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning time. At the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey! Wake up in there! An enforcer said. Your dark half growls lowly. I said wake up! She shouts. You dark half appears at the bars and grab her by the neck. Ugh! She said. You know how easy it is for me to crush your neck? He said. W\u2026.why hasn\u2019t\u2026.the collar kicked in yet? She said. You clowns really need to change your design every once in a while. Anyone good with mechanical work can crack this. You said. You\u2026.wouldn\u2019t dare! She said. I would. He said. He bashes her head against the bars repeatedly until her face is bloodied. He lets go of her and her body hits the ground. You got off easy. Kyle and his girls are going to get a lot worse. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Mira\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira comes out of her room with a yawn. When she walk into the living room, she notices you\u2019re not there. Oh\u2026. Oh God no! She said. Mira looked all around, but doesn\u2019t find you. Wait. What if he\u2019s\u2026. She said. Mira quickly checks under her foot and sighs happily knowing she didn\u2019t step on you by accident. Miley walks in seeing Mira worried. What\u2019s going on? Hang on\u2026. Where is he!? She said. I\u2026. I don\u2019t know. He must have snuck out during the night. Mira said. No\u2026.! I was suppose to gatekeep him. I should have slept standing in front of the door. Miley said, nearing tears. Mira was on the verge of tears as well. I should have kept him close. I don\u2019t think I could look myself in the mirror again. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally here. This place makes o district look clean. You said. You head for Sinclair\u2019s building and head inside. Hey, Sinclair. You here? You said, opening the door. Looks like he\u2019s not. You said. You look around and find a note. \u201cIf you\u2019re reading this, then I assume you made it. I know why you\u2019re here, and I can\u2019t teach you anything else. But my associate can. I think it\u2019s time you two finally meet. As for me\u2026. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see each other again one day.\u201d It said. Associate? You said, as your phone goes off. \u201cI feel it\u2019s time we meet. Head deeper into this hellhole.\u201d It said. Place is already dangerous enough during the day, but at night? Well, came too far to go back. You said. You cough up some more blood. Damnit\u2026. You said. You head out and back into the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk slowly and with caution. Feels like I\u2019m being watched. You said. You keep going until you see a old, rotting corpse. Holy shit\u2026. He\u2019s been ripped in two. And his insides are gone. Like they were slurped right out of him. You said. You heard roaring. That sounded more animalistic that how Kyle\u2019s thugs and cronies do it. You said. You feel the ground start to shake. Jesus\u2026. It\u2019s like the earth is about to open up. You said. As you regain your balance, you see multiple buildings topple over. What the\u2026.. Holy\u2026. You said, seeing a preteen girl. What caught your attention was how savage she looked. Her hair was unkempt and there was dried blood on around her mouth and there was this feral look in her eyes. I think she was way too into the whole monster thing. You said. When she sees you, she grabs you and holds you in front of her face. Shit\u2026. You said. You can see the hunger in her eyes and know what she\u2019s going to do. Have to\u2026.reach for my armband\u2026. You said. She brings you closer to her slightly open mouth. Come on, come on! You said, trying to get your arm free. She flashes her teeth are even they are stained with blood. Fucking hell\u2026..! You said. Just as you got to her mouth, one of your eyes changed. Ugh\u2026..! You said, vanishing. She closed her mouth; expecting you to land on her tongue, but felt nothing there. She looks at her hand to see you\u2019re not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear on her shoulder and punch her right in the jaw and sent her crashing into the ground. You land on the ground and your body is hurting all over. You cough up blood, have a searing pain running through your head, your body is hurting like crazy to the point that you can\u2019t move. You stay on the ground even when the girl slowly gets back to her feet. She looks around for you and sees you lying on the ground. She slowly makes her way to you. As she reaches for you, she is suddenly tackled by another girl and started laying into her with repeated punches to the face. You see her get up and turn to you before blacking out from pain.</span></div></div>",

You also take in your surroundings and see you\u2019re in a building 5x bigger than you\u2019ve seen before. Who\u2026.brought me here? And what do they want? You said. You feel the ground shake. Oh\u2026. Great. You said. You quickly got up and hide. As the footsteps got closer, you see the woman again. Wait\u2026. I\u2019ve seen her. Right before I blacked out. You said. She\u2019s wearing a green low crop and knee high heeled boots and she has emerald green eyes that look like they glow. She long black hair that partial covered her left eye. By the way she\u2019s looking around, it must be for me. You said. You see a worried and frightful look on her face. Best leave while she\u2019s panicking. You said. You take one step out of your spot and she turns around facing you. What? How did she hear me? You said. She runs over to you and smiles. Shit\u2026. You said. She reaches down for you and her long, slender fingers wrap around you and lifts you up to her face. (How do I get out of this?) You thought. She starts to move you closer to her, but it wasn\u2019t to her mouth. It was against her chest. Huh!? You said. She was holding you against her chest, but not in a smothering way. It was more of a mother embracing a long lost child. (Why is she\u2026.doing this?) You thought. After embracing you, she lets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUhh\u2026. You said. She then starts to gently rub your head with her finger. You\u2019re\u2026..quite friendly. You said. She hugs you even tighter. Oh\u2026.. Ok. Very friendly. You said. She lets go when she hears the pain in your voice. Did you\u2026.bring me here? You said. She nods. Are you a mute? You said. No. She just prefers action over words. A voice said. You see a man in a open, brown trench coat walk out of the shadows. When you looked at him, you felt his piercing black eyes look through you. Set him down, Em. He said. Em didn\u2019t want to and looked at him with a pleading look. Now, Em. He said. Reluctantly, she puts you down on the ground. Is she usually like this? You said. No. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the reason you\u2019re here. He said. No. I came to- Find Sinclair and get more powerful? He finishes. H\u2026How do you know that? You said. He pulls out a phone. Wait\u2026. Are you the one whose been sending those texts? You said. I have. I\u2019ve been watching you. You\u2019re fighting is sloppy. And you hold back you\u2019re true potential. He said. What do you know of my powers? You said. I know you have a dark half. And he told you to get stronger and come back. He said. Ugh\u2026! You said. I know you came across Heather and she sealed your powers and took your dark half. And he\u2019s being tested on right now. He said. You\u2026.know all this.? You said. I do. And I can help you get more powerful. 20x more than you are now. He said. 20x\u2026. You said. You think for a minute. (Becoming stronger\u2026. Just like my dark half said. Plus, if Kyle and his croons get what I got\u2026.) You thought. Well? He said. \u2026..Yes. You said. Good. We can start now. He said before punching you in the gut. Ack\u2026.! You said. It felt like behind hit by a train going at the speed of a jet. You fall over on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you there, Em wanted to pick you up. No. He needs to learn on his own. He said. You struggle to get up. Your muscles are hurt from that one punch. You fight through the pain and grit your teeth and get up. Good. Seems like this won\u2019t be a waste. Come. Oh. And My name\u2019s Luke. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days later.<br>\r\nCome on. Get up! Is this the same person who took on an army of giants by himself?! Luke said. Your body was hurting all over as you push yourself up. Again. He said. He vanishes and you block his punch. You dodge the next one and get hit by the one from behind and fall to the ground. (He\u2019s so fast. He puts me to shame.) You thought. That\u2019s enough for today. Em. He said. Em quickly picked you up and you felt your body slowly heal. You look up at her to see a heartwarming smile. You\u2019d speak if you weren\u2019t so hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Huff* *Huff* You said. You\u2019ll never hit me moving that slow. He said. You charge him again and he hits you in the back of the head. You hit the ground unconscious. *Sigh* Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to stay alert. He said. You wonder around and hit a wall. Don\u2019t trust your eyes. Use your other senses. Luke said. You move your head a few times and block a punch and sent flying through the wall. Ugh\u2026. So much pain\u2026. You said.  *Sigh* Getting there\u2026. I think. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne month later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou punch him and he dodges it. He comes back and you block it and the one from behind. Then the side. Good\u2026. You\u2019re learning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo months later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways stay on your toes. Keep focus on the punch and the one coming after that. He said as you dodge his attacks. You block his punch and his kicks. He keeps attacking and you dodge all of his attacks. It stops when you catch his fist. Very good. He said. \u2026..What\u2019s next? You said. I\u2019m going to teach you something extremely useful. Close your eyes. He said. You do that. Empty your mind. Focus on your other senses. He said. You concentrate as he talks. Now. Extend them beyond yourself. Connect to the world around you. You breath in and out and focus. Em looks on worried. Luke waits a few seconds before punching you. You move your head out the way. (Good\u2026.) Luke thought. He attacks you again and you dodge it without effort. When he attacks again, you dodge and attack him. He dodges it. Excellent\u2026. He said. He vanishes and appears in front of you. You sensed him and where ready to dodge when\u2026. (It\u2019s your fault he\u2019s dead.) A voice said. (Ugh!) You said. With your mind occupied, Luke hit you and sent you flying into a building. Ow\u2026. You said. Em quickly ran over to you as you got up. I\u2019m fine\u2026. You said. Something broke your focus. Luke said. I heard\u2026.a voice. You said. Didn\u2019t I say find a way before it gets worse? Chijinda said. Your eyes go wide as your head throbs in pain. Em looks on worried while looks into your eyes. (Widen eyes, pupil shaking, head pain, hearing voices and staring off\u2026. Sinclair was right. He does have dementia.) Luke thought. Luke elbows you to the head. Ugh\u2026! You said hitting the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatch over him. He said. Em picks up your body and looked at Luke. He\u2019ll be fine. He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster. I think we\u2019ve done it. We\u2019ve found out what gives him his strength. A scientist said. And? Kyle said. It\u2019s his blood. Not only does it give him his strength and speed, but the cells multiple at such a rate that any wound suffered is healed. She said. Any wound? So what if he\u2019s stepped on or something like that? He said. That\u2019s actual worse. The body explodes when under massive pressure. Since his cells multiply at a higher rate, and this is going to sound ridiculous, he\u2019ll reconstruct himself. She said. Reconstruct? You mean he\u2019ll build himself together? He said. Right. Although I think I see why. In all the test, he\u2019s showed violent tendencies. But in one where he got stabbed with a dagger, the blood that was on the floor moved. She said. Moved? He said. Yes. It was like a blob. It moved all the way to the wound and reentered his body. She said. Something like this\u2026. It can make a force not to be mess with. Is there a way for us to use this for us? Kyle said. At the behest of Amy, we\u2019ve started but we\u2019re going to full go into this without your approval. She said. Do it. With this power, we\u2019ll be unmatched.  He said.</span></div></div>",

Luke said. Em looks annoyed and rub your head gently just to spite luke. Em! He said. I\u2019m fine. What\u2019s next? You said. I\u2019m sure Sinclair told you that you have special eyes. He said. Yeah. He taught me how to use them. You said. Today you\u2019re going to be learning more about it. First, activate them. He said. You activate them, but only one eye has three ticks and it hurts. Argh! You said. Em quickly grab you and her hands start to glow. The pain quickly disperses and your eye change back. *Huff\u2026.* You said. Em. Luke said. Really not wanting to let go of you, she puts you back down. What happened? Luke said. I activated them, but only one eye changed. And then there was this blinding pain. You said. Strange\u2026. That shouldn\u2019t happen at all. And blinding pain. That should only happen when\u2026. Wait a minute. He said.  Luke scans your over. A seal\u2019s been placed on you. He said. A seal? You said. A barrier preventing you from using your powers. No wonder you haven\u2019t been performing well. He said. (So that\u2019s why.) You said. How did you get that seal on you? He said. I came across a woman in a black hooded robe. She placed it on me and I haven\u2019t been able to use my powers since. You said. Black hood\u2026. Heather. He said. Is there a way to undo it? You said. It\u2019s going to require blood. You said. How much blood? You said. Not yours. It requires the caster\u2019s blood. He said. I\u2019ll do that when I go back. So what now? You said. Take the day off. We\u2019ll pick right up tomorrow. He said, disappearing. Whoa\u2026. You said as Em picks you up and hugs you tightly. Em\u2026. You\u2019re\u2026.crushing me..... You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo\u2026 How did you get your powers anyway? Luke said. I wasn\u2019t born with them if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. It was\u2026.out of necessity. You said. Necessity? He said. Well at the time, but it was mostly out of jealousy. You said. Necessity and jealousy? That\u2019s a bit confusing. Luke said. \u2026\u2026I use to\u2026.hang out with this group. There was something off about them, but we all have that about ourselves. Blake, Joana, Jasmine. Jasmine was like Em here. Except Em takes it to a whole nother level. You said as she smiles, taking it as a compliment. They would do things without me, and when I\u2019d ask, they dodge the question. Joana really wanted to tell me, but she didn\u2019t. When they finally told me they had powers, I was mad they didn\u2019t tell me. It wasn\u2019t because I was the only one without. I was mad over the fact they didn\u2019t tell me. You said. I guess you didn\u2019t hang out with them anymore. Luke said. No. I didn\u2019t cut them off. Just\u2026..keep them at a distance. One day, I was approached by one of Blake\u2019s enemies. He read me like a book. He knew how I felt. And he offered me something. A vial filled with blue liquid. He said I will become more powerful than ever imagine. You said. And you took it. He said. As angry as I was and told myself and them I didn\u2019t care, I was jealous of them. You said. It\u2019s not like they rubbed it in every chance they had? Luke said. No. It had the opposite effect. Especially Jasmine. Damn mother Teresa to me. You said. Seems like you share something with this person, Em. Luke said. Em\u2019s smile just gets bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, we got called to investigate disappearances at a school. We found out what\u2019s been going on. Plus, a lot more. We came across this\u2026.thing. Horns, tail, red skin. She looked at me with this\u2026.hungry gaze. She was making light of what she was going to do to me. You said. \u2026.Succubus. He said. What? You said. You came across a succubus. She was going to take your life energy by fucking you. He said. T\u2026.that\u2019s what she meant?! I was so damn scared of her\u2026. I took the serum. And blasted that bitch back to the beginning of time! You said. That\u2019s a bit extreme. So that\u2019s how you got them. And this\u2026.Chijinda. Your long time friend? Luke said. He was. I couldn\u2019t get to him in time\u2026. But I made their leader suffer for what she did. Yet I still blame myself. You said. (That\u2019s where it\u2019s coming from. His guilt.) You knew this Chijinda for a long time. And in that time, you\u2019ve both known each other right down to the detail. Do you think he wound want to see you still hanging onto him dying? Luke said. That\u2019s exactly what I keep trying to tell him. Chijinda said. It\u2019s not easy. I still see you there like that\u2026.. How can I just forget it? You said. I never said you had to forget. I said come to terms with it. People die. And there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. He said. But why did it have to be you!? You said. Life\u2019s cruel like that. He said. Still doesn\u2019t mean I have to like it. We talked about all the things we were going to do. How we were going to be the best detectives. Outshine the real and fictional ones. You said. And in came the monkey wrench. You can\u2019t prepare for everything. Remember Murphy\u2019s law? He said. The one time it kicks in\u2026.. It\u2019s against me. You said. What did I always tell you? No matter what, keep going. You think Narue would want to see you like this? He said. N\u2026narue\u2026. As hard as it was, she was able to keep going. If Narue can do it, so can you. He said. \u2026\u2026.God damn it, Chijinda\u2026.. I tried. I gave it my all and it wasn\u2019t enough. You know I wanted to running after you. You said. I know. And I also know that a man isn\u2019t an island. You needed a bigger team to get into the base. He said. So\u2026.you never blamed me? You said. No. I knew who the to save that for. He said. Hearing that, you feel like a heavy burden\u2019s been lifted as he fades away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo? Luke said. I\u2019m better now. Everything has been settled. You said. Then rest up tonight. We\u2019ll continue tomorrow. He said getting up and leaving. Em picks you up and hugs you tightly. Em\u2026. Crushing\u2026. You said. Em puts you back on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs moon hanged high, you slept with Em close by, snoring lightly. Suddenly, your eyes open and you sit up. You look over to Em and walk past her. You head out to the dilapidated bridge and head back to m district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a day\u2019s travel, you get back to m district. Still a dump when you left. You look down on your leg and see your knife is gone. You set out to find it. You head to the mansion and go through the door. You look for your knife. Well, what\u2019s this? A voice said. You turn around and see heather. And just where did you run off to? Didn\u2019t see high or low of you for months. And I\u2019ve been looking. All I had to remember you by was this knife. She said. She pulls out your knife. You activate your armband and grow. Hm? You want this back? I think I can part with it\u2026..for something more worthwhile. She said surly. You walk up to her and snatch your knife away before she notice. What? How\u2019d you- Urgh! She said as you stab her in the stomach. You pull your knife out of her and she puts her hand over the wound. You\u2026.! She said. You then stab yourself and pull your knife out. After a few seconds, the wound is healed up. So\u2026. You figured it out. Who told you? She said. You sheathe your knife and disappear. <br>\r\nHeh\u2026.. It\u2019s begins\u2026 She said. </span></div></div>",

You walk up to her, grow, and grab her by the throat. What the?! Oh shit! She said. Your look right at her as your eyes change and she stop struggling as her face goes blank. What do you wish of me, master? She said monotone. You hold out your phone and hit record. As you say. Disengage collar locks. She said. You end the record and she falls back asleep. You shrink back down and head to the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to one of the many cell and bang on the bars. Ugh\u2026. Can\u2019t move\u2026. So much torture. A man said. You slide you phone inside and the message plays. Disengage collar locks. It said. The man\u2019s mind collar disengages and falls to the ground. I\u2026it\u2019s off\u2026! He said stunned. You then disappear and reappear and watch from a safe distance. You wait 15 minutes until you see a crowd of men running out of the prison; Combined with Kim and the other two. And then you see a lone figure standing in the entrance. You know who that is. You disappear and reappear in m district and head into the army base. When the soldiers saw you, they all just moved out your way. You take a few grenades from the armory. You toss the strap across your chest and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore heading off to confront them, you had two more stops to make. You head to Jessica\u2019s place and enter the front door. You head into her lab and found her looking through a microscope. I didn\u2019t sign up for this\u2026. She said. When she turns around, she leaps when she see you. Ah! Oh. It\u2019s only you. We need to put a bell on you. Actually\u2026. That\u2019s not a bad idea. She said as a lewd smirk spreads across her face. You point at the table. Oh\u2026. I know I promised you I wouldn\u2019t do any scientific research on you. But someone rated me out that I had data. The master told me to break down the genetic code and turn it into a serum. He\u2019s wants to give his girls what you have. I dragged my heels as long as I could on it, but he said if he wants me to see you alive again, I\u2019d better hurry. She said. She quickly envelops you in a hug; your face mashed into her breast. I\u2019m so sorry! She said. You pull her arms off you and motion to all the data. I can get rid of it. I\u2019d be more than happy too. But I did make some of serum and his elites already taken it. She said. Now\u2026.it\u2019s interesting. You nod your head and disappear. Please\u2026. Make him suffer before killing him. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear at Mira\u2019s house. When you head in, you head a voice. Brother!? A voice said. Miley comes running out her room and runs into you for a hug. Big brother\u2019s back! She said. As she shouts that, Mira comes running. It\u2026 You\u2019re back\u2026..! She said. Where did you go!? And how did you sneak out from under my nose?! Miley said. You open and close the door. Oh\u2026 I knew I should have put the combination lock on. But Mira said that\u2019s going too far. She said. He was on bed rest, not house arrest. But that\u2019s in the past. She said. Mira comes closer and puts her hand on your face. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re back. She said. For a minute, you feel it leaving. Wait. What are you doing with a those\u2026.grenades?! Mira said. That was when the tv screen change to show Kyle and his elites. It quickly came rushing back like a speeding train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know you\u2019re watching this. Somewhere out there. I don\u2019t know how you manage to pull off a prison break from the inside, but that doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019ll be brought right back. But first, I think it\u2019s time we finally settle this matter between you and us. How about we meet in the arena? Since it all started there, no better place for it to end. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the master. You can\u2019t go there. It\u2019s a trap and you know it is! Mira said. It is a trap, but they work both ways. I\u2019m not letting you go there! If the master wants to pick a fight, then I\u2019ll do it! Miley said. You stop Miley and put her to the side. No! I\u2019m not letting you go! You just got back! She said. You hesitate to do this, but you flip your mask up as your eyes change. Ugh\u2026.. Feeling\u2026..sleepy\u2026.. She said before falling out. Miley! Mira said. You pick her up and place her on the couch. \u2026\u2026She\u2019ll be fine. You said. A\u2026..are you seriously going to meet him? Mira said. \u2026..Yes. You said. T\u2026.then promise me one thing. Come back to me. She said; tears in her eyes. You place your hand on her cheek. Ah\u2026.! She said. \u2026\u2026.Take care of yourself. You said. You head out as you put your mask back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to the area and before entering, you see Chijinda standing to the side. You\u2019re not completely consumed. So I know you can hear me. You\u2019re doing what he wants you to.  And you know what\u2019s going to happen. And you know what you must do. He said. You slowly nod. Miley was wrong. He\u2019s not out to kill you. He wants to humiliate you. Show the world that no matter what kind of power a man has, he\u2019s powerless against the \u201csuperior race\u201d. He said. You hold open your hand and a ball of energy forms. You know it\u2019s the only way. Don\u2019t get distracted. The longer you wait, the more it will mature. And so will they. He said as he vanishes. You close your hand into a fist and walk inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get inside, the heavy doors close behind you. Didn\u2019t think you show. I\u2019m actually surprised. Kyle said. You see him sitting in his arena throne. Full circle is what they call it? It started here, only fitting that it should end here. Don\u2019t fret. We\u2019ve learned all we need to know, and I promise we\u2019ll put it to good use. But I think a demonstration is in order first. He said. The arena is empty. Who and how would watch? That\u2019s when lights flashed on and shined down in the arena. The first ever televised arena match. You really should take that mask off and smile for the people back home. He said. Chijinda was right. But he\u2019s going to be the one humiliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll throughout the F, M, O and any tv, everyone was looking at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mira placed Miley on the couch, she looked over at the tv and see you. Oh\u2026.. Oh, no. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. That\u2019s the last one. Jessica said, throwing the paper into the fire. Jessica walked pasted her tv and sees you. What the? Oh\u2026. God\u2026.. The master has gone too far. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s not keep the crowd waiting. Girls. He\u2019s all yours. Kyle said. You look at the giant, heavy metal doors as dents are put into it. Then it comes flying off its hinges and fly past you. Man. I\u2019m never going to get use to this strength. Yumi said. Man. It\u2019s going to be 10x as easy to put men in their place! Luna said. Not before we take care of him! Amy said. You only notice that there was only four of them. Soya wasn\u2019t with them. You\u2019ll deal with her after this. You grow to 100ft. You take out your knife and point. I don\u2019t need an invitation! I\u2019ve waited too long for this! Amy said.</span></div></div>",

Shen she comes running towards you, you sidestep her and punch her right into the ground. Grrr! I\u2019m going to rip that mask off your face and shoved that knife where it doesn\u2019t belong! Amy said. Amy charges at you and you punch her square in the nose hard. The impact of the blow made her eyes roll back and she fell down. You think you\u2019re better than us!? Luna said. You disappear and reappear and slice her throat. You push her down as she gargles on the blood. Which only leave you and Koyuki. You disappear and reappear in front of her. She stares you down as you stare at her. I\u2019m going to take my time breaking you. But first, I\u2019m going to expose your face to the world. Your bloody, broken and beaten face! She said. Ugh\u2026. Get in line, Koyuki. I\u2019m breaking him first. Amy said, getting up. Man. Regeneration as well? Oh, I\u2019m going to enjoy this. Luna said, getting up. We\u2019re going to have so much fun with you, death will be a mercy. Yumi said. And it won\u2019t be granted either! Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast the o district border.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm was in a panic as she was worried about where you were. Calm down, Em. You\u2019ll work yourself into a storm. Luke said. She looks at looks at Luke bewildered. He couldn\u2019t have gotten far. Especially with his-Ugh\u2026! Luke said. Em looks at Luke. I sense\u2026.a dark presence. And it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s coming from\u2026. Em. Looks like we\u2019re heading back to civilization. Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull your knife out of Yumi\u2019s chest and kick her down. He\u2026. Hehehe\u2026. It doesn\u2019t matter in the end. We\u2019ll just get right back up. Yumi said. You were a little fascinated as how quickly their bodies have adapted to your powers. Their regeneration is getting quicker; almost instant like yours. You pull out a grenade and pull the pin. You shove it into her mouth and stomp it down her throat. Mmmph! She said. You wait until the last second to jump out the way as the grenade explodes.  You look to see her headless body. After a few seconds, it stands up and her head grows back. She takes a deep breath. No way\u2026. I was a little worried, but I lived through that? I should thank you for this gift\u2026. After we\u2019re done showing you your place in life! She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo even limb regeneration. It\u2019s progressing quicker than you thought. Their stamina has gone up as well as their tolerance for pain. You want to see more. You pull out your knife and appear in front of her and she stopped your stab. Not this time\u2026. She said. You headbutt her back as you see Amy and Luna come too. Grrr! That was a cheap trick, coward! Afraid to fight me head on?! Amy said. All you did was punch her from behind. All the pain you give me, I\u2019ll give it right back! She said. When she took that first step, she disappeared and reappeared in front of you. She hits you right on the jaw. He\u2026. Hehehehe! I don\u2019t know how I did that, but I\u2019ll take it! She said. Now it\u2019s speed. How much more will they improve, you wonder? You grip your knife and disappear and stab her in the side. Ugh\u2026! She said, pushing your arm back. I\u2019m going to carve my name into you with that damn knife\u2026.! She said. You kick her away and charge her. Amy catches your arm and headbutts you. You stumble back and get hit from the side by Yumi. When you turn, you are hit in the face with a flying knee. So now they are coordinating attacks. This has become more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Mira\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira was sitting on the couching watching the entire fight go down. Please, please, please don\u2019t die. She said. Her heart was beating quickly to where she thought it would come out of her chest. Which is the same story for Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble back in amazement at how better their coordination is getting. First, they were hitting each other, now they are covering each other and almost in perfect synch. Don\u2019t get tired just yet! We\u2019re just starting. Luna said. Now is good time to knock them down a little, so you gesture them to come get you. You think I need an invitation!? Amy said. She comes charging at you and you sidestep her. You go for an uppercut and she moves out the way and goes for a punch to your head. You duck and punch her in the gut. Ack\u2026.! She said. She clenches her gut and you knock her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRgh! Don\u2019t get cocky! Yumi said. Both her and luna come at you and you catch their fists. You grab them both by the neck and bonk them together a few times and throw them away. Grrr! Have your fun while you can! Luna said. Quit attacking blindly. Koyuki said. All four of them looked at each other and nod. Picking themselves up, Yumi, Luna, and Amy surround you. It was a tense few seconds until they attacked. You dodge their attacks; a little surprised they haven\u2019t hit each other yet. Damn it! Hold still! Amy said. You continue to dodge until you sock them all in the head; knocking them out for a few minutes. Which leaves only you and Koyuki. You disappear and reappear right in front of her. As well as she hides it, there is a burning hatred for you. I wanted to let Amy have her way, but it seems like that needs to change. This is a long time coming. She said. You roll your eyes and kick her back. When she steadies herself, you gut punch her in the stomach. As she knells over, you punch her to the ground and kick her in the stomach. If you had a quarter for every time someone said you had this coming, you\u2019d be rich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she gets up, you knock her back down. You put your boot on her neck. All that talk only to end up there within 15 seconds. Being in this embarrassing position, Kouyki started to growl through her gritted teeth. Grrr!! Get off of me!! She said. You hold her there as she struggles. You hear rapid footsteps and back hand Yumi to the ground. If it wasn\u2019t for them having your blood injected into them, you\u2019d kill them by now. Rgh!!! Amy said. She came at you with a head full of steam. You swing with your knife and she catches your arm. She tries to wrestle it out of your hand. As you both struggle, Luna shoulder tackles you. When you shoved her head first into the metal doors, you see Amy about to slash you with your knife She swings with so much force that the blade cuts through your mask. Amy sees half of your mask fall off before being punched and sent into the wall. You pick up your knife and the rest of your mask falls off. Finally\u2026. Kyle said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally\u2026.. The man behind the mask. Kyle said. You put your hand on your face as you sheathe your knife. Damn\u2026. That hurt. At least I can finally see who you are. Amy said. With your mask gone, you had no reason to hide anymore. So you pull down your hood. N\u2026.No way. A kid!? That\u2019s who\u2019s been giving us all this trouble?! Yumi said. He can\u2019t be no older than 15. That\u2019s the thorn in our side!? Luna said. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s a kid! He was well aware of his actions! I still plan on breaking him! Amy said. You roll your eyes. Grrr! Let\u2019s see you have attitude in the next few minutes! When I get my hands on-Ugh!!! She said. She took too long talking and you got bored. So you rammed your arm through her stomach. When she looked at you, you punched her hard enough on the head that her skull caved in and she hit the ground with a thud. You won\u2019t get away with that! Yumi said. You catch her fist and throw her into Luna and they both crash into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2026! Koyuki said. You catch her fist and she catches yours. You headbutt her and pick her up by the throat. She beats on your arm as you hold her. You grab Amy by the throat as well. She\u2019s back on her feet already. The regeneration is getting stronger. As well as their strength. Koyuki\u2019s pounding is starting to hurt a little. You throw koyuki away into the wall. Rgh!! I hate you!!! She screams as she claws at your arm. As you hold her, you sense something within her. It\u2019s faint, but there. An energy source. It\u2019s forming not in only Amy. But the other three. It won\u2019t be long before they can do the same things you can. And as somewhat interesting and fun as that would be, you prefer to be the only one like that. So if anyone is going to out your powers, it\u2019s going to be you. You pull out your knife. GRRRR! Do your worst! I\u2019ll be back up in a minute! She said. Your knife starts to glow bright and you stab her in the gut. She smiles smugly at you, until she couldn\u2019t feel her arms. Or legs. Like they we completely cut off, but they were still there. W\u2026..what did\u2026.you do to me\u2026.? She said as she evaporates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi, Luna, and Kouyki looked on in stunned silence. A\u2026.Amy\u2026. What did you o to her!? Yumi shouts. You monster! Bring her back!! Luna shouts. They both charge at you from the sides and you disappear as they got close. They come to a screeching halt. Then they felt like they were being attacked from all sides. When the attack stopped, you appear behind them; with your eye changed, and you look over at them. In the next second, they are engulfed in black fire. The fire rages for a few seconds before dying down and every trace of it and Luna and Yumi are gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2026. Just what the hell are you!?! Koyuki said. As you turn to her, you can see it. The unmistakable look and smell of fear. You smile and appear right in front of her. You hold out your hand and she flinches. \u2026\u2026Die. You said as a huge beam of black and red energy consumes her. The beam goes through the wall; complete taking off that part of the arena. \u2026.Heh. You said. You shrink back down and reappear next to Kyle and grab him and lift him up by the neck. Nighty nighty, sweet prince. You said, knocking him out. You look at the seat he was sitting in. \u2026..Hmph. You said. You grab Kyle and head out to m district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the border, you stop and drop Kyle onto the ground. You look around and see your dark half in the shadows. Saw the whole thing. Is it weird that for once I pretended to be in your shoes? He said. You just stare at him. Oh. That\u2019s right. Your heart, mind and body are taken over by darkness and anger. He said, walking over. I dreamed of this. When you finally let it all out. Nothing can stop us. Not even the elites. And they jacked so much blood from me and stole our powers. But carbon copies can\u2019t beat the originals. You\u2019ve proved that. He said. He kicks Kyle in the head. No one could beat us, and with the display you showed, no one will want to. By the way, where did you learn that black fire from? Even I was astonished by that. He said. You continue to stare at him. You know, I had plans for each one of the elites. But you brought me this clown, which is better. Unless he isn\u2019t for me and is for Kim. Right? You said. You nod. Knowing how much she hates him? I can\u2019t be more proud of you. And with Kyle out, that leaves a power vacuum that needs to be filled. So let\u2019s claim our long over due reward. He said. He goes inside you, and instead of feeling the evil magnify, it starts to dissipate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh\u2026. Ohhhh\u2026. You said. You look around dazed and a little confused. (Why did you do that? I was finally consumed by the evil in my heart like you wanted.) You said. (I want it to come naturally. Not because you spent a month or two without me.) He said. (But what about what you said a few minutes ago?) You said. (To get close. You were still in fight mode. And it was all true, don\u2019t worry. Just wish I had ten minutes with the elites and Kyle. Speaking of him\u2026.) He said. You look at Kyle and pick him back up. You head to M district HQ. When you get there, it looks like they were in the middle of an evacuation. You walk into the grounds and all of the soldiers stop dead in their tracks. You drop Kyle on the ground and walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re about to leave m district when you hear the clicking and booming footsteps. You look and see Em running up to you. She quickly grabs you and hugs you tightly. (A friend of yours? She needs to learn personal space.) He said. EM! A voice shouts. Letting you out of her grip, you see Luke. I told you to stop coddling him! He said. Em looked furious at Luke, but a sharp look from him made her back down. Drop. Now. He said. She does just that. Luke looks into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can see the anger and evil in your eyes, but it\u2019s going away. As well as the dark energy. It\u2019s still there, but not as much as before. He said. (So I take it you know these two?) He said. So I guess Kyle has been taken care of. Which leaves a nasty vacuum that the army will try to fill. He said. \u2026..If the army wants to fill that vacuum, then let them. That has never interested me. You said. Really? And his mansion? He said. He won\u2019t be needing it anymore. But it is a shame to let it go to waste. You said. So you\u2019re going to move in? He said. Why not? You said. You head back to the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(It\u2019s all ours now.) He said. (Koyuki was right. We would be in the lap of luxury.) You said. You walk through the mansion an it has everything needed for living. More bedrooms than I like. Lot of redecorating to do. This color scheme is horrendous. You said. Don\u2019t think of remodeling just yet. Just because Kyle and his crones are gone doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re done learning and getting better. Luke said. I know. I\u2019m waiting on you. You said. I\u2019m ready whenever you are. You\u2019re fighting is still sloppy. He said.  Then\u2026.let\u2019s fix that. You said. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weeks go by as Luke trains you. During that time, M district slowly rebuilt. You didn\u2019t keep close tabs on m district as you didn\u2019t care that much. And it would seem Luke knew more about you than you know. As he was not surprised when he saw your dark half for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery good. Now the black fire is related to your emotions. The stronger your hate, the more intense it is. Luke said. What if I use it on someone I don\u2019t hate? You said. The fire won\u2019t burn them. He said. Your eyes change back to normal and the fire goes away. I have to admit. You struggled at first, but you always manage to come out at the end. He said. If at first you don\u2019t succeed, try try again. You said. Unless you\u2019re someone who\u2019s utterly incompetent. He said. Well, there\u2019s that. Kira and Kim still think they run the world? You said. Apparently. M district is coming along well. And they are still trying to convince others that men are equal. He said. I take it the change is happening slowly. You said. Some are willing to give it a try. Others\u2026..got there heels digged in. He said. At least they didn\u2019t implement any draconian laws for killing a guy. You said. Seems like it. We have guesses. Luke said. We don\u2019t get visitors at all. Let\u2019s roll out the red carpet. Em. You said. She nods and you and Luke disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting a few minutes, you see 5 guys and 2 preteens and a teen. When they get closer, you quickly take out the 5 guys and Em knocks out the girls. Let\u2019s make sure they can\u2019t start any trouble. You bind them and wait. This blonde one looked pissed when she came in. I think she\u2019s a former punishment enforcer. Weren\u2019t they all rounded up and awaiting trial? Luke said. Guess this one broke free. Besides, her defense wouldn\u2019t hold anyway. They say those trials they give are fair, but they\u2019re really kangaroo courts. Showing that anyone who worked with Kyle gets a life sentence. You said. So what are we going to do with our esteemed guesses? He said. Find out what they want first. If they have bad intentions, let Em have them. You said. She gets all the fun? Luke said. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll let you do something. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait a few minutes before they come to. Ohhh\u2026. Make the ringing stop\u2026.. One said. Ugh\u2026. I\u2019m seeing triple. What hit me\u2026.? Another said. Ice will do that knot well. You said. Oh\u2026. Oh, shit\u2026.! One of them said. When the rest of them saw you, you swore they all pissed themselves. Except the blonde girl who just gritted her teeth and narrowed her eyes at you. You jokers know you\u2019re here uninvited. Legally, I could kill you. You said. Wait, wait, wait! We\u2019re not here to cause any kind of trouble. One of them said. Yeah. Far FAR from it. Another said. So you\u2019re not trouble makers. And you none of you look like you work for the army. You said. Which brings us to the question: What are you guys doing here? Luke said.  Y\u2026you know\u2026.. After the whole fight with the elites and all\u2026. You sort of became a household name. One said. Don\u2019t try and sweet talk me\u2026. Who are you, again? You said. T\u2026tom. Guy to my right is Dante. To my left is Cody. Old guy over there is Hank. And the big guy right here is Bruce. He said. Sweettalk isn\u2019t going to work. Out with it. You said. Ok, ok. It\u2019d\u2026..just be in our best interest\u2026.if we were, you know\u2026.your go to guys. Tom said. My go to guys? You said. They want to join you. Luke said. Join me? In what? I\u2019m not some ruler. You said. Not in that aspect. More of like enforcers. Luke said. \u2026\u2026I can see why you five would. But what about you three? You said. W\u2026well the thing is\u2026. We\u2019ve sort of known these guys for a long time. And we really didn\u2019t want them coming here, and wondering what happen. One of them said. So that\u2019s your story and your friend here. But I know blondie\u2019s story already. Running to avoid that trial. Am I right? You said. She grits her teeth even more. And what Tom said, does that apply to you two as well? You said. Yeah\u2026. We\u2019ve lived through the master\u2019s reign scared they were going to be enslaved or worse. If you take them, we want in too. The other said. And blondie here choses the lesser evil. Still evil, but not as. You said. She turns her head away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..Fine. I\u2019ll take you on. Em. You said. She unties the girls binds and you do the same for the guys. I can tell you this right now. It\u2019s not going to be easy. If you\u2019ve been or seen army boot camp, that is gentle compared to what you\u2019re about to do. You said. Well\u2026. It could be worse. We could be-Ugh!! Tom said, feeling your fist in her gut. When you back up, he falls down. First lesson. Learn how to take a punch. Luke. Em. You said. With pleasure. Luke said. Em smiles evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill standing. Still alive and breathing. So you\u2019re committed. You said. Y\u2026.yes, sir. They said through broken ribs. Today you\u2019re going to get familiar with weapons. I take it at least one of you has shot a gun before? You said. I\u2019ve fired a few. Hank said. Good. Now each of you take a weapon that catches your eye. You said. Walking up to the table, they look over the selection of weapons. From pistols to rifles to shotguns to lmgs.  Dante picked first and went with a sniper rifle. Hank went with an assault rifle. Cody,  Tom and Bruce chose pistols. \u2026..Alright. Targets are out there. Fire when your ready. You said. You watch as they fire and fumble to reload. The only one to stand out was Hank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it wasn\u2019t the worse shooting I\u2019ve seen. Tom, this isn\u2019t a contest. Shoot like you have some sense. Cody, your hesitation to fire will end up killing you. Dante, if you\u2019re going to use a sniper rifle patience and timing is key. Bruce, don\u2019t fire blindly at a target. Hank. You did well. You said. Y\u2026yes, sir. He said. Don\u2019t let it go to your head. Always another chance to fail. You said. You turn around and contemplate. \u2026\u2026I\u2019m surprised. Weapons at your fingertips and none of you took the chance to shoot me in the back. Even after a berated you. You said. What\u2026.would be the point of doing that? Cody said. To see it if you\u2019d take an opportunity when you see it. Not always good to do so. But I wonder, was it out of fear that none of you did it? Or was it something else? You said. (Fear.) he said. Regardless, you\u2019re done with me for today. Luke however, has plans for you. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, you three. Looks like Em hasn\u2019t been the nicest to you. Look like hammered shit. You said. She\u2019s a lot meaner than she looks. One said. Right\u2026. I never caught your names. You said. Kate. And my friend is Sam. She said. And blondie here? You said.I think her name is Kris. Sam said. Ok... Kate\u2026. You\u2019re well endowed and all. Are you sure you weren\u2019t one of the enforcers like Kris here? N\u2026no, sir. I was just blessed. She said. Let\u2019s see if your skills are too. Have any of you killed before? No need to answer, blondie. I know you have. You said. She grows lowly. Killed? Like in general? Kate said. Yes. I won\u2019t judge. You said. No. Sam said. Not at all. Kate said. Ok, we\u2019ll cross that bridge later. Do you know how to throw a punch at least? You said. Not like you can. Sam said. Very well. That\u2019s your task. Hit me with all you\u2019ve got. You said. A-attack you? Kate said. You\u2019re\u2026..not going to attack back? Sam said. No. Just hit me with everything. You said.  Showing no hesitation, she blondie throws a punch and you catch it. You bend her hand and force her down on her knees. You punch her in the nose and break it. She hits the ground as blood gushes from her nose. You really thought I\u2019d just be a punching bag? Never believe every word you here. Understand?! You said. U-understood. They said. Get this trash on her feet so you can learn. You said.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re far from finish. And my seal of approval is easier to come by than Luke\u2019s And you all know he\u2019s a harsh teacher. You said. My bones are still hurting. Cody said. Changing things around. You\u2019re going to first aid. Each of you. You said. What are we going to practice on? Dante said. You pull out pistol and shoot him in the side and he hits the ground. Each other. Best way to learn is by doing. Tom. Get the bullet out. Dante, you sow it close. Cody, you\u2019re disinfecting. Bruce, you hold him down. And Hank, you\u2019re on bandage duty. You said. Y-yes, sir! They said. You watch over them as they perform to get the bullet out. Within 8 minute, Dante is patched up. He\u2019s going to be ok, it seems. You said. Would have been done sooner if Tom didn\u2019t forget to cauterize the blade. Hank said. And time is important. You said. You shoot Hank in the gut. Again. Until you can do it from memory. You said. Y-yes, sir! They said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk you three. Unlike the other four, you have size on your side. But before I go any further, have any of you seen Godzilla? You said. I\u2019ve seen it once. Sam said. Same here. Kate said. I know you lived it, Kris. You said. She grits her teeth. What was the one thing present in every movie about him? You said. He destroyed cities. Sam said. Right. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to be doing. You said. What!? Both of them said while Kris smiled a little. If you\u2019re having reservations. Express them. You said. We\u2019ve\u2026..never leveled a city. We\u2019ve seen them, but usually stay clear of them. Live and let live. Kate said. Hm. Kris. Demonstrate. You two, watch. You said. Kris walks to the abandoned city and starts to demolish it. Stomping, bulldozing, and toppling everything in her way until there was nothing left. Jesus\u2026. Kate said. So much destruction. Sam said. I need to know if that is something you can do. You said. I\u2026. I\u2026.don\u2019t think I can. Fighting is one thing, but that\u2026. Kate said. Y\u2026yeah. I can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s just\u2026.wrong. Sam said. Very well. Kris will do that from now on. We\u2019ll move on. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave to admit. I didn\u2019t expect you lot to get this far. Thought Luke will kill you for failing. You said. So close to it. He said. You pace the line back and forth before punching Dante in the gut. He doesn\u2019t flinch. Heh. You said. You start pacing again. You throw a punch at Tom and he dodges it. Hm. You said. You pull out a skeet disk and throw it. Fire. You said. The guys pull out their weapons and fire at the target; completely destroying it. Good. Now to put everything you\u2019ve learned together. You said. Yes, sir! They said. You\u2019re going to assault and take out one of the army bases in m district. Sam, Kate, Kris. You\u2019re clearing a path through. Kris, I want controlled destruction. Towers, antennas, satellites, take them out. You said. Yes, sir! They said. Guys, you\u2019re leading the attack in. Kill anyone who shoots you. You said. Yes, sir! They said. Go. I\u2019ll be following you after you in 5 minutes. You said. Determined, they set out to the nearest base. Think they got this? You said. Time will tell. Luke said. After waiting the five minutes, you head out. When you get there, you see antennas broken and towers toppled. In the base, you see dead soldiers everywhere. Bullet holes no lower than the chest. You said. (Give Annie Oakley a run for her money with that kind of aiming.) He said. You walk into the HQ and see more dead soldiers. Make shift defenses. They were taken completely by surprise. You said. You head further in until you find them with prisoners. They surrendered  when we cornered them. What do we do? Bruce said. Luke, are you in the mood for skull collecting? You said. I got plenty that will keep me busy for days. He said. Release them and let\u2019s get out of here. You said. They holster their guns and follow you out. Let\u2019s go. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one injured or anything. And it was your first assignment as a team. No infighting or bickering, clash of opinion or anything. 100% professional. Excellent job, all around. You said. (B+. No diversity in their killing.) He said. Thank you, sir. They said. In light of this, I have something for you. You said. You show them the armor. Body armor? Ante said. Able to block any bullet and withstand a great deal of pressure. You said. So if we get stepped on or sat on, it\u2019d keep us safe? Tom said. Yep. You\u2019d still feel the brunt of it, but you won\u2019t become a stain on the ground. You said. The guys quickly rush up and put on the armored clothing. Girls, I made the same for you. You said. You did? Sam said. Might as well. Just because you\u2019re bigger doesn\u2019t mean you invincible. You said. Is that why you asked my about my chest measurements? Kate said. As functional as they are, they have to be comfortable. Last thing you won\u2019t is to be uncomfortable in them. You said. T\u2026.thank you. Kate said. Kate and the other two put on their armor. You can even wear clothes over them. It\u2019ll feel like they aren\u2019t even there. You said. Hey. What\u2019s this symbol? Cody said. It\u2019s our brand. A fist within a shield. You said. Nice. Dante said. I have one last thing to give. I just need to go get it. You said. You disappear and reappear at Jessica\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go inside and find her inside her lab. Hey, Jessica. You said. Oh. I was wondering when you were going to come by. She said. I\u2019ve just been\u2026..busy. You got those things I wanted? You said. Over there. I finished them a few days after you asked. She said. That was a month ago. You said. When I said I finished college in two weeks, I wasn\u2019t kidding. She said. You strap the device onto your arm and turn it on. All the features you asked for. She said. Thanks, Jessica. I owe you. You said. Really? She said getting up and sauntering her way over. Come on, Jessica. Are we going to do this again? You said. You said you owe me. And I aim to collect. She said. She puts her arms around you. You hid so many secrets from me. And I hate secrets. She said. I couldn\u2019t trust you and if I did tell you, you wouldn\u2019t believe me. You said. I knew you were special in some way. I\u2019m hurt that you wouldn\u2019t trust me. Keeping secrets is a bad habit. She said. Jess\u2026. You said. She kisses you on the mouth and her tongue starts to invade your mouth. She holds the kiss for two minutes and breaks it. Done? You said. Not yet. This goes a lot deeper than just that. She said. She fiddles with your armband and watches as you shrink down. Her titanic finger wrap around you and she brings you to her face. Now for round two. She said. She starts assailing you with her lips. This goes on for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone now? You said. You said. For now. We\u2019ll pick right up from here next time. She said. You disappear and reappear back at the mansion. She\u2019s going to be the death of me. You said.</span></div></div>",

She likes you. If she can\u2019t accept you for who you are, then there\u2019s always Jessica.) He said. (You\u2019re just saying that because of her breast are a little bit bigger than Mira\u2019s.) You said. (\u2026\u2026And if I am?) He said. You sigh and open the door. Before you could even close the door, you\u2019re rushed and hugged by Miley. Big brother! You\u2019re back! She said. You say that as if you\u2019re not expecting me not to come back. You said. As Miley lets go of you, Mira comes out of her room. Mira. You said. H\u2026hey\u2026. She said. You don\u2019t have to be on eggshells around me. You\u2019re the last person I want scared of me. You said. Scared? Why would she be scared of you? Miley said. It\u2019s\u2026.complicated. But I\u2019ll explain as best I can. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell them about your powers and everything about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you have a person inside you? Mira said. He\u2019s like me. Just imagine all my bad things wrapped up in one. You said. And your powers\u2026.. That beam I saw\u2026 She said. One of many. Pretty much basic to what I really can do. You said. Can you show us? Miley said. \u2026..Here. Hold out your hand. You said. Miley holds out her hand and you create a ball of energy. You place it in Miley\u2019s hands. Whoa\u2026. Mira look! She said, excited. So that\u2019s\u2026.what you do? She said. I don\u2019t go around blasting people or things. I\u2019m not some psycho. You said. The energy ball dissipates. Awww. Miley said. Why didn\u2019t you tell me any of this? She said. You wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you. And I don\u2019t know if you were trustworthy. Imagine my powers in the hands of a megalomaniac. Kyle would be a saint. You said. Oh\u2026. She said. Can we get powers like that?! And fight like you?! Miley said. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d want that. Nasty side effects. You said. Like? She said. Well, you could go from nice and cute to mean and hatefilled. And there\u2019s a chance you might get you a evil dark half too. Who\u2019d want nothing but mass genocide and destruction. You said. (Slander.)He said. If that\u2019s the case, I don\u2019t want that to happen. Mira said. I do. I\u2019d get to be super strong and protect you. Miley said. I can protect myself, Miley. Plus, there\u2019s already someone who does that. You said. I can do it better. She said. Oh boy. You said. Your eyes change and you look at her. You want nothing to do with my powers, Miley. You said. Her face goes blank. I want nothing to do with your powers. She said. Now sleep. You said. Miley falls asleep and your eyes change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2026..can mind control? She said. Yeah. Didn\u2019t want to, but she\u2019d be all over me about it. You said. She can get like that. She said. Mira\u2026.. I\u2026\u2026owe you an apology for how I acted before. You said. What do you mean? She said. How I kept you at arms length. I wanted to let you in, but\u2026.. You said. But what? She said, getting closer. \u2026\u2026I\u2019ve already lost two people I cared about. My best friend. And a brother. Not by blood, but we were close like it. He was a pervert, but I still loved him. We did everything together. Hell, we\u2019ve been in the same hospital room. Then\u2026.. One day, he\u2019s killed. On the job. I couldn\u2019t get to him quick enough. I blamed myself. I stopped the people and their plans, but it didn\u2019t bring him back. You were one of the first people to accept me. If I let you in, and something happen to you\u2026.. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the first time Mira has seen you vulnerable. And show emotion towards her. So you\u2026.kept me away\u2026..to protect me? She said. People know they can\u2019t come after me, so they go after people close to me. I already lost two people I cared about. I didn\u2019t want to make it a three or even four. You said. You\u2026.care about me? She said. I do. I just didn\u2019t want to show it. Took me in and cared for me. Nobody else did that. You said. Mira puts her arms around you. Mira? You said. She then kiss you. You know how long I\u2019ve waited for you to say that? She said. A long time. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t get it. Why didn\u2019t you want to rule? Luke said. I\u2019m no ruler. Imposing my will onto the masses? This isn\u2019t medieval times. You said. Stronger than me. I\u2019d take over everything and erase Kyle\u2019s name from history. He said. And hold daily blood sport and demand everyone provide you one skull per month. You said. Per day. He said. And they called Kyle a tyrant. You said. As you both talk, you sense something. (You feel that?) He said. (Yeah. An energy source. Faint, but it\u2019s there. Thing is\u2026. I\u2019ve never felt this one. It\u2019s almost ominous as it\u2019s mysterious.) You said. Hey! What are you doing with one of my skulls!? Luke said. Oh, shit. Got to go! Tom said. Good nature hijinks. Don\u2019t kill him. You said. He\u2019ll wish I did! Luke said disappearing. (Let\u2019s go.) You said. You leave the mansion and trace the energy to m district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. Rebuilding\u2019s look nice. You said. (Think we should use of reputation?) He said. (Prefer to be discrete, but no one will stop us if I just walk in.) You said. You continue on and keep a low profile; even though people knew who you were. (I never get tired of seeing scared faces.) He said. (Draws attention.) You said. You look around and see a clothes store. (Of all the things in this world.) He said. You slip inside and the owner backs against the wall. That how you treat customers? You said. He starts to sweat like crazy. You pick out a shirt that it black and has a red snake with its mouth open, black pants, and boots. You change into them and put money on the counter and walk out. (I think he pissed himself.) He said. You continue to trace the energy until you get to o district. You look around and see a group of women. Some of them have markings on half there body, while others have on black hoods. They\u2019re standing in a black circle with Kyle in the center. What the hell is this?  Kyle?You mutter. You quickly hide and listen in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs everything ready? One of them said. Ready. Everything is prepared. Another said. Then let\u2019s begin. She said. The group starts chanting. (Should we save him?) He said. (I don\u2019t know. That ominous feeling has skyrocketed. What the hell are they doing?) You said. Are you sure this is going to work? A voice said. T-that voice\u2026. You said. You look to the left and see Kira and Kim. What are they doing here? You said. You pull out your phone and start recording.  Positive. Not the first time this ritual has been done. Another voice said. (That voice\u2026.) You said. (Miss indecent.) He said. You look back at the circle and see Kyle is gone. Then it starts to glow purple. After a few seconds, you see someone coming out of it. S\u2026.Sue!? You said. (Did these girls just bring her back from the dead?) He said. When it was done, Ashley opens her eyes. Ash! Kira said, hugging her. Argh\u2026. My head. Kim? Kira? She said. Who else? Kira said. But\u2026 Whose life did you use? Ashley said. The masters. After Kim was done with him. Kira said. Which is why it took so long. Kim said. Wait. The master\u2019s? How did you even get him. It\u2019s a long story. Kira said. You put down your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What the fuck is going on here?) He said. This\u2026.changes everything about her. You said. You duck back into the shadows and head back to the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter and see Tom being bandaged up. Told you he wouldn\u2019t like it. Dante said. Damn\u2026.. Didn\u2019t think he\u2019d care that much. Tom said. I take it Luke didn\u2019t like the joke? You said. Outright hated it. Broken every rib. And said that was getting off easy. Tom said. Where is he? You said. Dusting the skull. I don\u2019t think he should be bothered right now. Tom said. Right\u2026. You said. You walk away; still lost for words at what you saw. (What was that? I never believed in black magic, but that looked like it.) You said. (And you saw the other ones. Like Sue, they had markings on half their bodies.) He said. (Sue got onto me about my powers. And here she is part of some secret sect.) You said. (You think her friends are in as well?) He said. (Kira and Kim? No. They were as surprised as me. But Sue\u2019s keeping a secret. One I plan on finding out.) You said. </span></div></div>",

He said. (She\u2019s probably on a tour of to see m district is finally safe. Girl might break out in tears.) You said. (Then have an ulcer from hearing you took over.) He said. (If I recall\u2026. There was only one base that could hold Sue and her friends.) You said. You head to that base. You acquire yourself a uniform of a soldier and sneak in. (I don\u2019t think stealing a uniform\u2019s going to work anymore. Our face was plastered all over tv.) He said. (Sue hasn\u2019t seen it. Just need to stay out of her friends\u2019 eye sight. You said. You head into the base and find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re kidding me?! Of all the people who could have done this, it had to be him. Ashley said. He did remove the master. Did what we couldn\u2019t do for months. So it\u2019s not all bad. Kim said. I\u2019m more concerned why. He didn\u2019t do it to help us, not out of some kindness, or anything like that. Who knows why. For all we know, he could have taken the title and prop himself up as the new ruler. Trade one tyrant for another. She said. I don\u2019t think being a ruler is for him. Remember, he wanted money from us to kill him. He\u2019s not some despot. Kira said. If that\u2019s the case, then why did he take the mansion? Or left that god-awful prison still standing? Ashley said. The prison has no use to him. We\u2019ve been using it ever since the master was removed. And as for the mansion\u2026.. Not like the master needs it anymore. Kim said. So all he\u2019s done is claim the mansion? No thing else? Ashley said. Nothing. He went in there and hasn\u2019t come out. Kim said. Can you blame? That place is like 3 five-star hotels wrapped into one. Kira said. So where do we go from here? If he took money from us, what\u2019s stopping him from taking money again to do the same to us? Ashley said. Nothing. And I doubt we could raise an army against him. No one would want to fight against him after what he did in the arena. Kira said. So where just waiting until someone gives him enough money to lay waste again. Ashley said. (Mass destruction, death, and chaos\u2026. I\u2019d do it for free.) he said. (And make no bottom line, charity case.) You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelll\u2026. What if you and your friends\u2026.. Kira said. NO! I\u2019m not asking them for help! I want nothing to do with them ever again! Ashley said. (Trouble in paradise?) You thought. Why not? You told us about your\u2026.gift. And you saw the footage of him fighting. Kira said. It\u2019s not\u2026..that simple. Why is that? Kim said. \u2026\u2026What I am and what I can do comes at a heavy cost. I\u2019ve paid for it with my humanity and soul. The things I\u2019ve done, the things I\u2019ve seen\u2026.. I don\u2019t want to go back to that. I\u2019d take the master\u2019s tyrannical rule over going back to those people. She said. (Sue isn\u2019t bubby-buddy with those other girls we saw.) You said. (She straight up hates them.) He said. (Still doesn\u2019t help us.) You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen\u2026. What do we do? Kira said. Only thing that left\u2026.. Go over there and offer a peace treaty. Kim said. You want us to extend an olive branch? After everything he\u2019s done!? Kira said. What choice do we have? If we fight him, we\u2019re dead. And all we\u2019re doing here is waiting until he comes here to do it. And Ashley doesn\u2019t want to use\u2026..that. Kim said. (They really think someone is going to offer me money to wipe m district off the map.) You said. (You know you would do it for money.) He said. (\u2026\u2026.I would.) You said. Ashley\u2026. Kira said. I feel the same way, Kira. And it makes my stomach turn, but we either make the first move. Or he does. Ashley said. (Am I really that hard of a person to like?) You said. (Means we\u2019re doing it right.) he said. You quickly leave and take off guard\u2019s clothes and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look like you\u2019ve made a discovery. Luke said. I did. Put on your Sunday best. We\u2019re having guests. You said. Guest? You said. Sue and her friends are coming. They think I\u2019m just waiting here for someone to pay me to take them out. You said. Are you? He said. No one has come by to offer me to. Unless you\u2019re willing. You said. At your rates? I\u2019m good. He said. Tell the guys we\u2019re expecting company. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir, those people you were expecting have arrived. Dante said. On my way. You said. You walk to the front and see Sue and her friends. And here I was thinking you girls forgot about me. You said. Let\u2019s cut the banter and get to the reason we\u2019re here. Kira said. Back that attitude up, or you\u2019re going to see the moon. You said. Kira. We didn\u2019t come her to let emotions fly. Kim said. \u2026\u2026Fine. She said. Good girl. Now, why are you here? You said. To offer a truce. Ashley said. Really? An olive branch? What brought this along? Scared I might target m district next? You said. You know you will! He\u2019s probably already been paid to do so! Kira said. If I was, would I be here talking to you? And I just might do it if you shout at me again! You said. Kira. Kim said. But he\u2019s\u2026. Fine. Kira said.  So you want peace between me and you to ease your paranoia? You said. Concerns\u2026. Kira mutter. So I don\u2019t mass genocide m district and you and your friends and whoever else protects it. You get what you want. What about me? What do I get out of this treaty? You said. Name your terms. Ashley said. You really did skip the first day of negotiating class. You said. Just say- KIRA! Kim said. Rgh\u2026 Kira said. (I\u2019m going to have so much fun.) Fine. I won\u2019t harm m district or anyone there. In exchange, I get to move in and around m district. Freely. So no surveillance. Two, stay out of my business. You don\u2019t ask what I\u2019m doing or anything. Don\u2019t interfere with what I\u2019m doing if you see me. You said. Done. Ashley said. (Cave so quickly. Really wants this peace.) Then we have nothing more to discuss. You know the way out. You said. Come on. Ashley said. Her and her friends leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trust them, Sir? Bruce said. Hell no. Tap all their communications. You said. Yes, sir. Let\u2019s go, guys/ Bruce said. Bruce and the guys leave. What about us? Sam said. Wait on the outskirts. Just in case they need a quick exit. You said. Right. Kate said as they left. You two can hold down the fort while I\u2019m gone? And not get on each other\u2019s nerve? You said. I don\u2019t start anything. That\u2019s Em. He said. She rolls her eyes. Right\u2026. Try not to kill each other. You said. You disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear in O district. Where is she? You said. You hear the sound of someone singing. (Singing? Out here?) He said. You follow the sound until you come across Heather. I knew you\u2019d come after me sooner or later. She said. I\u2019ve been busy. You said. That\u2019s right. You dethroned the loathsome wanna be king. We really should celebrate. Just\u2026.the two of us. She said. (That ominous feeling is back.) You thought. I\u2019m not here to fraternize with you, Heather. You said. Oh, come now. Stop being so uptight. Live a little. She said, wrapping her arms around you. (Ugh\u2026.! Why do I feel so much pressure?!) You said. A cute hero like you needs to be rewarded. She said. You push her off. Enough! What\u2019s the meaning of this!? You said, tossing her your phone. She looks at the recording. There\u2019re people on their wearing the exact same thing as you. And Sue coming out of that circle. What\u2019s this all about? You said. You mean you don\u2019t know? Ashley didn\u2019t tell you? She said. Tell me what? Sue doesn\u2019t tell me anything. She wouldn\u2019t tell me the time of day if I asked her. You said. Not even Luke? She said, surprised. How\u2026.do you know Luke? You said. Heh\u2026..hahahaha! Oh, this is going to be fun. I\u2019ll be watching with interest. She said, blowing you a kiss and vanishing into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2026.the fuck? You said, picking up your phone. (Well\u2026. That was a bust.) He said. (Someone knows something. Heather won\u2019t talk. And Sue sure as fuck won\u2019t tell me anything.) You said. (She mentioned Luke\u2019s name. So he must know something.) He said.</span></div></div>",

Sue\u2019s bound to have something here that reminds her of her past.) You said. You pick the lock and open the door. She could be back at any time. Better hurry. You said. You scour the place and find a box. When you open it, you find a black robe. It\u2019s the same one Heather wears. You said. Under it, you see a note. What the hell is this? These words make no sense. Ba\u2026. Bastilka? Zultra? Cratil? What are these? You said. (Someone who doesn\u2019t English well?) He said. You look around some more and find another note. This I can read at least. You said. \u201cFinally\u2026. I\u2019ve finally left my old life behind. The pain and suffering\u2026.. No more. I can start a new life out here. It said. Pain and suffering? What did Sue go through? You thought. (I thought she was a punishment enforcer turned good.) He said. (It must be something. Just listen to the tone of the note. Whatever pain and suffering she went through, it made her want to leave.) You thought. You hear the sound of a door closing. Shit\u2026! You said. You hear Ashley\u2019s footsteps get closer. You pull out your knife and wait. When she steps through the door, you grab her. What the?! She said. You quickly slit her throat and push her away. You quickly pull out your phone to record the marking that form on her arm and travel across half her body. (Done.) You thought. You quickly leave before Ashley sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop when you get to a safe distance. There. Concrete proof. No way Luke will deny this. (Now for the hard part.) You thought. (And that is?) He said. (Confronting Luke. And this is only going to end one of two ways.) You said. You head to o district and wait. Now, it\u2019s just a waiting game. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm, you need to calm down. Luke said. Em looks at Luke worried. I keep telling you to stop babying him. You can\u2019t act like this every time he\u2019s gone. He said. EM looks at Luke serious. You\u2019re doing him no favors being this protective. I\u2019ll find him. Luke said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in o district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..I knew you\u2019d come eventually. You said, getting up. You being this far out in o district\u2026 What are you doing out here? He said. Collecting stuff\u2026. Like this. You said, throwing your phone to him. Care to explain all that? You said. He watches the videos you\u2019ve recorded and the audio of Heather mentioning your name. \u2026..I see you\u2019ve been busy. He said. How does Heather know you? And what was all that ritual that brought Sue back to life? You said. There\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know. You\u2019re no where near ready for this. He said. Fighting 4 bitches who stole my powers don\u2019t count? You said. They have nothing on the people in these videos. Ashley alone is more than enough for them. So what is she? What makes her so threatening? You said. Like I said, you\u2019re not ready to know. He said. Then let\u2019s see if I am ready. You said. Are you serious? You think you\u2019re ready to fight me? He said. I know I am. I win, you tell me everything. You said. \u2026..Very well. He said. (Best to hit the ground running.) You thought. You charge and both of your fists clash. You both disappear and clash all over. He blocks your kick and you block his punch. He grabs your arm and throws you at a building. You stop yourself and leap back. He ducks your elbow. You shift your weight to your left leg and spin kick Luke legs out from under him. While in the air, he vanishes. You sense him out and block his attack. You push his arm away and he grabs yours as you punch. He toss you over his shoulder and slams you into the ground with force. When the smoke clears, your gone. Where\u2026.? Luke said. He senses you out and blocks your attack from the front. You smile a little. What? He said. He looks behind him and sees you a clone ready to attack. Tch\u2026! He said. He pushes you behind him and your clone hits you into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dust clears, you stand up. A clone. Nice touch. He said. Not a clone. An afterimage. You said. Afterimage? Even better. You almost had me. He said. (I get the feeling he\u2019s just toying with us.) He said. Let\u2019s end the warmup and get to the real stuff. He said. I agree. No holding back. You said. You unleash your power. (So this is his energy when he powers up. It\u2019s higher than I thought it would be.) He said. I\u2019m not done yet\u2026.! You said. You power up more. (W\u2026what?! It\u2026. It just keeps climbing!) Luke thought. As you increase your power, your muscles expand. The ground starts to shake violently. (It\u2019s still rising\u2026! There\u2019s no limit to it! Is\u2026. Is this what those girls felt when they fought him?!) Luke said. A bead of sweat runs down Luke\u2019s face. GRRRRRR! Let\u2019s do this! You said. You stop powering up and charge him. Ugh\u2026.! Luke said. He dodges your punch. You spin kick him. Luke barely had time to put up his defense as he gets hit and sent through multiple building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019s gotten faster. And stronger. Luke said. As he gets up, you appear in front of him. You punch him and he blocks it. You attack him again and he blocks all your attacks. (I\u2026. Can\u2019t believe this\u2026.! I\u2019m being overwhelmed\u2026! I was worried about hurting him. But he\u2019s going to do that to me if I don\u2019t retaliate!) He thought. You break through Luke\u2019s defense and send him flying with a punch to the face. You disappear and reappear behind him and he uses the momentum to leap of your leg and behind you. You turn around and block his kick. You ground yourself and are pushed back. When you let your arms down, you see Luke is up close. You dodge his attack and attack back. He intercept your punch with another. You both clash all over the area; destroying buildings and the ground along the way. Both of your fists meet again and the force behind it pushes you both away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Huff* *Huff* *Huff* Luke pants. *Huff* *Huff* You pant. I haven\u2019t\u2026..been pushed like this in years. You\u2019ve done what no one has done. He said. Luke stands up. But\u2026. I haven\u2019t lost a fight before\u2026. I don\u2019t plan on starting now! He said. Luke rips off his tattered coat and not only can you feel his power increase, you can see it. A dark purple aura surrounds him. He\u2019s finally getting serious. (Ugh\u2026.! I increased my power too much in one go. My body can\u2019t handle this forever. I have to hurry\u2026.) You said. You ready yourself as Luke finishes his power up. Now\u2026. Let\u2019s continue. Luke said.</span></div></div>",

Luke was on her mind as well, but her main focus was you. She knew you were out there somewhere, and she doesn\u2019t know what state you\u2019re in. You could be dead for all she knows. She calms herself down. The last thing she wants to do is panic. She would wait, but not for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in o district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re sent through a building and skid to a halt. You block Luke\u2019s attack and kick him hard enough to send him flying. When he stops himself, you appear behind him and he intercepts your fist. You both push each other off. It\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve had a real challenge. I\u2019ve forgotten what it felt like to bleed. He said. (He\u2019s enjoying this. Almost as much as I am. My body\u2019s going to give soon from the sudden power rise. Have to end this.) You thought. You charge at him and disappear. Where\u2026.? Luke said. You reappear behind him and Luke feels his body being assaulted. Ugh\u2026! He said. You kick him and send him flying into the air. You disappear and reappear and dive down. Before you made contact with him, he vanish and you crash into the ground; making a huge crater on impact. You step out of the crater as Luke reappears in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to say. I\u2019m really enjoying this. Been way to long. He said. Ugh\u2026. You said. Looks like your body is finally catching up. Such a rapid change has its consequences. \u2026.Argh. He said. (Let me take over. I can handle him.) He said.  (No. Me and him.) Looks like I\u2019m not the only one feeling those consequences. You said. After all we\u2019ve done to each other, our bodies we\u2019re bound to tell us when soon. So\u2026. How about we end this. He said, pulling back his right fist. Couldn\u2019t agree more. You said, doing the same. You both charge at each other. You both punch each other in the face. Ugh\u2026..! You both said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both held that position for a few seconds before you fell back on the ground. Heh\u2026. I\u2026.win\u2026.. Luke said as he fell down too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision is blurry and your body aches. It takes a minute for your vision to clear up. You see you\u2019re hooked to an IV machine. Where\u2026 Am I? You said. You take in your surroundings. I\u2019m\u2026..in the mansion\u2026. How did I get here? You said. (Finally awake.) He said. (Did\u2026..you carry me here?) you said. (No.) He said. (I take it I dropped first. So Luke must have.) You said. (You did, but Luke went down after you did.) He said. (He did? So who brought me here?) You said. (Em did. The look on her face something. She couldn\u2019t run fast enough back here with you both.) He said. (And I guess the guys were the same.) You said. (Right. But Kris was the one who was the most worried out of everyone.) He said. (Kris? Her? Thought she only tolerated me.) You said. (Seems like she had a change of heart. The girl didn\u2019t leave your side for 6 hours straight.) He said. (And I take it Em didn\u2019t like that much.) (Not a bit. She didn\u2019t take kindly to someone else playing guard dog.) He said. You get out of the bed and hold your side. As you do, black markings appear on half your body. What the? You said. All the soreness in your body is gone. You quickly run to a mirror just in time to see the markings vanish. What the? You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Tell me you saw that?) You said. (Saw what?) He said. (The markings. Black ones just appeared on me.) You said. (I didn\u2019t see anything. Everything went dark for a second.) He said. Ok. Now you need answers now more than ever. Luke\u2019s probably out cold. So that only leaves one person left who can tell you anything. You climb up and out the window and head to M district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(M district? What are we doing here?) He said. (Getting some damn answers. Sue\u2019s going to talk even if I have to destroy this damn place to loosen her lips.) You said. (Wouldn\u2019t that violate the treaty?) He said. (Not on paper. Not official.) You said. You push past multiple people to find her. Sue! You said. Huh? Oh. It\u2019s you. She said. Can the fucking attitude, Sue. You said, growing. What do you want? She said. You\u2019ve got some explain to do. You said. Like what? She said. You toss her your phone with the video loaded. Care to explain that? You said. She watches it and her eyes go wide. And the conversation with Heather? You said. H-Heather!? She said. Yours and Luke\u2019s name where mentioned. Why was that? You said. \u2026..I have nothing to tell you. She said tossing your phone back. Grrr! You said. You grab and headbutt her. Then you kick her knees out from under her and uppercut her in the chin. Ohhh\u2026..  Whail on me all you like. I\u2019m not saying a word. She said. That was just to get your attention. You said. You build up energy in your hand. You point it at her. Then at a portion of the city and fire. The ball hits a building and explodes; consuming everything in that area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou animal!! She said. She gets up, but you knock her back down. How many was that? 5,000? 10,000? You said. You could see the anger on her face. So are you going to talk now? You said. Fuck you!! She said. Vulgar\u2026. You said, throwing another energy ball into the city. The explosion is 2x as bigger than the last one. You\u2019re suppose to be their protector, Sue. The one they can count on. And yet, here you are. Watching as they die. Screaming. Wondering where is there guardian? On her knees watching them die. You said. You\u2026.!!! YOU!!!! She said through gritted teeth. She gets up to punch you, but you grab her fist and headbutt her back down. M district dies because of you. You said, building up energy. You see markings appear on her arm and her eyes start to glow a bright purple. Hmph. You said. You blast her and she swats the beam into the air. I\u2019m going to rip you apart!!! She said. Let\u2019s see what the protector of m district can do. You said. </span></div></div>",

It\u2019s not the first fight I\u2019ve been in and got hurt. Just check in and make sure he\u2019s ok. Luke said. Em nods with a smile. And don\u2019t start with Kris again. If she\u2019s there, then she\u2019s just as worried as you. He said. Em\u2019s smile turns annoyed as she left. That demon\u2019s going to be the death of me. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026I know you\u2019re there, Orex. Stealth isn\u2019t your strong suit. He said. In a puff of smoke, a tall, muscular built guy in a black, open duster and black boots and pants with a black hat appears out of the smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor someone dressed in all black, sneaking isn\u2019t your thing. Luke said. \u2026\u2026You almost lost to him. He said in a gruff voice. I wasn\u2019t in no real danger. I was having fun. Been a long time since I had a real challenge. He said. Your fun put the others on edge. You rarely get serious like that, and to get there against an outsider has the others a little shaken. He said. I was indulging him and myself. I might have gotten a little carried away, but I wasn\u2019t in any real danger. Luke said. Your body says different. Soreness, bruises cuts. He said. Point of a fight. He said. If he was our quarry, you wouldn\u2019t dare let him injure you like that. He said. But he\u2019s not. He\u2019s one of us. Luke said. You told him? Orex said with surprised. No. He\u2019s not ready to know yet. Which is would explain why he\u2019s been so active. Luke said. Does he know who his parents are? Or what he has? Orex said. He\u2019s starting to get wise to it. But he doesn\u2019t know anything. Luke said. You think Heather might tell him? Orex said. Heather won\u2019t tell. She\u2019s more likely to do what I did. When he\u2019s strong enough, I\u2019ll tell him everything. Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in m district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou punch Ashley from behind and shove her face into the ground. This all ends if you tell me what I want to know. You said. The only thing I\u2019ll tell you is how slow or quick you will die!! She said. (A complete 360 from how she usually acts.) He said.  This is all on you, Sue. You said. You put your arm around her neck and hold her an you shoot multiple energy balls into the city. NO!!!! She said as multiple explosions happen across the city. All those lives, Sue. All of them you swore to protect. Ended in a blink. Your precious little city burns as you watch. You said. RGHHHH!!! I\u2019LL KILL YOU!!! She said. (Mad as hell. And you didn\u2019t want me on the loose.) He said. She headbutts you, making you lose your grip on her. While you stagger, she punches you in the gut. You catch her fist while bent over and uppercut her. You punch her again and tackle her to the ground. You can end all of this, Sue. You said. It\u2019ll end when I kill you!! I\u2019m going to wear your bones as jewelry! And trap your soul in a locket and wear it around my neck! She said. (That\u2019s some voodoo mystic shit. Hell, I just grind the bones to dust and make a suit out of what\u2019s left.) He said. You fire off more energy balls into the city. So much destruction and death, Sue. You said. (All before lunch.) He said. ARGHHHH! She screams. You see the markings on her body start to appear all over her. (That can\u2019t be good\u2026.) You thought. She pushes you off her and is immediately in front of you ready to strike. You catch her fists and she kicks you in the gut. Ugh\u2026.! You said. The force of the kick broke at least two ribs. She kicks you back and pulls her arm back. Shit\u2026. You said. You dodge her punch just in time, yet the wind behind it left a cut on your side. You take her legs out and as she falls, she disappears. You look around and see her in the air and she comes crashing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to move out the way just in time. She\u2019s just being reckless now. You said. You wait for the smoke to die down, but she appears right in front of you and punches you through the chest. Ack! You said. DIE!! She said. You catch her other fist and put your other hand right to her gut and blast her. When you stop, you see her a few feet away; surrounded in a purple bubble. The hole in your chest closes up. RGH! I\u2019ll stop that regeneration of yours!! She said. You ready yourself when Susan appear and place her hand on Ashley\u2019s forehead. Aubaza. She said. Ugh\u2026.! Oh\u2026. Ashley said as her markings disappear and her eyes stop glowing. She hits the ground with a thud as she passes out. She picks her up and disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Well, Ms. No clothes saved us.) He said. (But what did she do? You heard what she said? Aubaza? Sue just stopped fighting and collapsed.) You said.  (So I guess we can scratch Sue off the list.) He said. (She wasn\u2019t going to talk anyway, but had to try. Shit\u2026..) You said. Looking around at the destruction, you shrink back down and head back to the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door and are immediately picked up and hugged. Ugh\u2026. Nice\u2026to see you too, Em. You said. EM!!! Luke shouts. Uh-oh\u2026. You said. Em ignores Luke and hugs you tighter. Em\u2026. I still need to breathe\u2026.. You said. Hearing you, Em loosens her hold on you. Thanks\u2026. You said. Put him down! Luke said. Em nuzzles you for a second before putting you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look like shit. Luke said. Not easy out there. Everyone wants a piece of you. You said. You look\u2026..sadden. Luke said. Em perks up when she heard that. I said sadden, not hurt. Luke said. I\u2019m fine. Sue\u2019s just gave me the run around. Calm Em down. She\u2019ll listen to you. You said. I\u2019ve been meaning to do that. Luke said. Em just rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later on the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid not see this coming. Not any of it. You said. Come on. You can\u2019t be prepared for everything. Tell me we\u2019d be fighting giantesses and a despot, I\u2019d call you crazy. Your dark half said. I guess\u2026. But I feel better when I am. Still a detective deep down. You said. I\u2019d say our new position is better. Can\u2019t get a mansion like this on a detective salary. He said. Still have upkeep. I don\u2019t think a detective will do well here. You said. So back to mercenary work? He said. I prefer bounty hunter, but it\u2019s all the same. Pays more too. You said. You look out at the m district. \u2026\u2026We still got a lot to do. People to kill. And\u2026.. You said. Hey, you know what happened wasn\u2019t your fault. He said. But it happened. And I still don\u2019t know anything. You said. Well\u2026. You remember what Sinclair said? About those eyes of yours? He said. You mean when my eyes change? You said. Yeah. He said they could see into the future. So maybe they will give you the answers you need. He said. \u2026..The thing about looking into the future is that it changes every time you look. I could make things worse. You said. Or better. He said. I don\u2019t like that kind of power. And yet\u2026.. Sitting here wondering isn\u2019t helping. And no one is telling me either. You said. So\u2026.? He said. You think for a moment before your eyes change. When they do, you are shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, they change back. Find what you where looking for? He said. \u2026\u2026Yeah. And that\u2019s the worse part. You said. Time will tell. He said. \u2026..I guess so. In the meantime, get ready. We have a lot to do and accomplish. And people counting on us. You said. Don\u2019t forget people to kill. He said, going back inside you. Yeah\u2026. Let\u2019s leave our mark on this world. You said. </span></div></div>",

This is the story of the man people came to know as Devil Dog. A notorious mercenary and witch hunter who wasn\u2019t liked by people. This is his story. Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO district witches building. In the holding cells with dad giving worship to the witches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s got to be a way out of here. There\u2019s always a way. You said. You look over your shoulder to see your dad doing his daily ritual of worshipping the witches. The grizzled old man never had an ounce of dignity or self-respect. Now you know why grandpa escaped. Dad, get off your damn knees. Have some dignity. You said. I must do this every day to show my gratitude to the divine witches. He said. How can you even do that? They don\u2019t even treat us right. Matthew was brutally ripped apart limb from limb and they didn\u2019t even let him die. They brought him right back. You said. That\u2019s the glory of our benevolent masters. They won\u2019t let us die. He said. Now I see why grandad left you behind when he left. You said. Grandpa was a fool! All he wanted to do was get out. He didn\u2019t see the benevolence of our masters. Dad said. He saw how brainwashed you were and how evil those bitches are. The only time you put up a fight was when grandpa tried to take me and you wouldn\u2019t let him. You said. I did so he wouldn\u2019t fill your head with lies. The witches aren\u2019t evil like he said they are. He said. Yeah, keep telling yourself that. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait around a few hours until you see your buddy luke. Neither of you have that much love for the witches. Luke was a troublemaker who gives the witches daily headaches. Luke. What are you doing out? You said. Ah, looking to see if I can start some trouble. You want in? He said. Better than being with dad here. You know how to break the seal? You said. This low level magical lock? Easy. He said. You hear luke mutter some chants and the lock disappears and the door opens. Let\u2019s go before Bertha checks in. He said. Yeah. Don\u2019t want to be hers for a minute. You said. The masters won\u2019t approve of this. Dad said. Yeah, yeah. Go back to your daily worship. You said. You and luke head to the main interior. Ok. Time for a little hijinks. You ready? He said. Just don\u2019t go overboard with witchcraft. You know what that stuff does to non-witches. You said. I know. Just be ready. He said. You take up a position next to the stairs. After a few seconds, you can hear the ground shaking footsteps get closer. You look and see its Viola. A known hot head who disregards the slaves as playthings or dirt. She\u2019s in her usually slightly revealing witch clothing. She steps near you with her boot. Now! You said. When she takes her first step on the stairs, luke says a few witchcraft words and the stairs turns to a slide and Viola slides all the way down to the ground hits the wall. You and luke start laughing until Viola sets her sights on you both. You insects! She shouts. Uh-oh. Split up? Luke said. Yeah. You said. You head right while luke head left. When I catch you both, you\u2019ll beg for death! Viola shouts. You ran a good distance and come to a stop. I don\u2019t hear Viola\u2019s mammoth sized stomps behind me. I must be in the clear. You said. You get a good look at your surrounding and see you\u2019re in a different section of the building. You don\u2019t know anything about this part. Where the hell am i? You said. You walk around to learn about your new surroundings. Hmmm. Seems like I\u2019m well out of the zone I should be. You said. As you walk, you feel your body being constricted. What the hell?! You said. Then you are lifted in the air and land on something soft. Well, what is this? A voice said. This isn\u2019t going to end well. You said. When you get a good look at your captor? She has long, burnette hair, black eyes, and marking on the left half of her body, and is wearing a hoodi. When she\u2019s done eyeing you, you don\u2019t feel constricted anymore. Are you ok? She asked. You stonewalled her when she asked. When she sees that you aren\u2019t talking, she moves her index finger to you. You brace to be hurt, but instead, she\u2019s stroking your back to comfort you. There? Feeling better? She said. I\u2026..i\u2026\u2026I do. You said. You see a smile spread across her face. See? That wasn\u2019t so bad. She said. You\u2019re at a loss for words. A witch just comforted you. A witch! Not a single witch you\u2019ve seen has ever been comforted any man before. By that shocked look, I can tell you never been shown any kindness by a witch. She said. \u2026\u2026No. I haven\u2019t. You said. Well, let\u2019s start off with the basics. I\u2019m Leah. She said. \u2026..My name is\u2026\u2026Alex. You said. Ok. Good. Off to a good start. She said. \u2026..It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t talk. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m talking to a witch. You said. Oh, I see what\u2019s the problem is. I don\u2019t expect you to believe me yet, but I\u2019m not like my sadistic sisters. She said. Sadistic isn\u2019t a big enough word. You said. I know. My sisters have a cruel tendency. She said. \u2026\u2026How can you call any of them sisters? You said. It\u2019s a bond that is tight. When born into witchhood, you accept a bond with your sisters. She said. \u2026\u2026.You sound proud of it. You said.  I didn\u2019t get to choose who I was born to or what I was born into. I had a lot of standards to live up to. She said. Standards? I didn\u2019t know witches had them. You said. We\u2019re not born powerful beings. Day in and day out of practicing witchcraft. She said. \u2026\u2026But from those markings on your arm, you\u2019re a siren. The most powerful kind of witch. It should be easy for you. You said. It was actually. It\u2019s what the expectation of what I had to do. I HAD to powerful! I HAD to know magic! I HAD to be mean and cruel just to be recognized by my sisters! You can see you\u2019ve upset her. Any other time, you\u2019d disregard it. But with Leah\u2026\u2026you feel a little sorry for upsetting her. So you set out to make her feel better. \u2026.Hey. I, uh\u2026..didn\u2019t mean to make you feel bad. I just assumed you were like the rest. You said. It\u2019s fine\u2026.. If I sounded mad, I didn\u2019t mean it. She said. \u2026..Look, uh, I have nobody for today. If you want to\u2026\u2026.i\u2019ll be yours for the entire time. You said. Well\u2026.. I wasn\u2019t expecting my turn for a while, but if you\u2019re insisting. She said. You don\u2019t know if you\u2019d just signed your death warrant or not. You\u2019re really hoping Leah is nice as she says she is.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Leah gets to her room, you see it\u2019s not what you expected. It\u2019s just like a normal teenage girls room, except leah\u2019s walls are tinted pink. Not what you were expecting, huh? Leah said. \u2026..Not at all. You said. As leah removes her hoodie, you see she\u2019s just wearing casual clothes. After she gets comfortable, you wonder what she wants you to do. Alright\u2026\u2026 Let\u2019s get this over with. What do you want me to do first? You said. Nothing. She said. Nothing? You said. Yeah. I\u2019m not going to tell you to do some demining task. To get some cheap, sick thrill out of it? I don\u2019t think so. She said. So if you\u2019re not going to make me do some demining shit, what are you going to do? You said. Nothing. I said I\u2019m not cruel like my sisters. She said. Leah sits you down on her bed and sits by you. How do you put up with them? You\u2019re nothing like them from what I\u2019ve seen so far. You said. Even though I don\u2019t agree with my sisters on everything, they are somewhat of a family to me. She said. You don\u2019t have know any regular people? You said. I do, but they don\u2019t know I\u2019m a witch. They think these marking are tattoos. She said. You can see she\u2019s quiet after saying that. You know that witches can live for hundreds even thousands of years. Who knows how many friends Leah has lost to time. Have you ever told anyone? You said. Only one person. Apparently, he heard the myths and stories about how cruel we are. I never saw him again after I told them. He thought I was no different, yet I never was mean or cruel to him. She said. You can see she\u2019s sad about reminiscing. Even though she\u2019s nice, she\u2019s been defined bad just because of her horrible sisters. (Great job, Alex. Now I\u2019ve gone and made it even worse. I better do something to fix this. This will be the first time I do this willingly.) You thought. You jump down and land on the ground. You make your way to her feet and see she\u2019s painted her toes with an aqua blue color. You start to rub her heel. Leah had felt something rubbing her foot. It wasn\u2019t something irritating, but was something gentle. She felt her problems and sorrows all going away as she started to relax. You hear a Leah let out a moan of delight, which tells you that you\u2019re making her feel better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a 10 minute massage on both of her feet, you look to see a smile on her face. (Never thought I\u2019d want to see a witch smile for once.) You thought. If you\u2019re plan was to make me feel better, it worked. Leah said. I do what I can. You said.  You aren\u2019t tired or anything? You said. I\u2019ve been doing this and other crap for years. You said. It shows. You knew what you were doing. She said. You are suddenly lifted into the air and land in Leah\u2019s open hand. I think a reward is in order. She said. Leah kisses you right on the forehead. I\u2026..uh\u2026.wasn\u2019t expecting that. You said. Leah holds out her hand and the marks start to glow. Then it stops after a few seconds. Here. She said. Leah gives you a purple yang symbol. When you take it, it lodges itself on your left hand. I give those to the men under my care. She said. Everyone gets one? You said. Well, yours is a little more special. I imbedded a little bit of my magic into it. Just in case you get into trouble. She said. That seems like special treatment. You said. Well\u2026.you are cuter than most men I\u2019ve seen. Leah said while blushing. \u2026\u2026Cuter than most? I.... I\u2026.. I don\u2019t know what to say. You said. You and Leah are blushing just from the friendly exchange of words. \u2026\u2026How about you\u2026..stay here\u2026\u2026with me for a while? She said. I\u2019d\u2026..like that. You said. With staying with Leah, the time just ticks away. Everything bad just goes away while with Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 months later. Back in your cell with dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m getting out of here! You said. There\u2019s no escaping our benevolent masters. Dad said. Dad, get a grip! Have you been blind these last few months?! When I came back from Viola and had bruises and scars all over, you said it was generous. How? You said. You\u2019re alive, aren\u2019t you? Our masters won\u2019t let us die. He said. You know what, dad? I\u2019m done trying to convince you of them. Live in your fantasy world if you want, but you\u2019re going to live in it without me. You said. Since Viola was the last one who had you, she forgot to put the spell lock on. All you do is push open the door and walk out. The outside world is a harsh one! You won\u2019t last without our masters protection! Dad said before you leave the holding area. You head over to where luke is being held. Luke? You in there? We\u2019re getting of here. You said. Finally had enough? He said. Something is off with luke. The way he said that was like he waiting for you to finally decide. Yeah. We\u2019re getting out of this hellhole. You said. Then what are we waiting for? He said. Luke grabs the bars and easily bend them. Luke\u2026.. You said. Come on. Luke said. Since the witches don\u2019t go looking for escaped men, getting to the front door was easy. Shit. There\u2019s no way to open that heavy door. You said. Stand aside. Luke said. Luke puts one hand on the door and open it with ease. (What the hell has happened to luke?) You thought. You were stunned that luke easily pushed the door open. You coming? He said. \u2026.Yeah. You said. You and luke step outside for the first time. So this is what o district looks like. It\u2019s a wreck. You said. Let\u2019s go. M district is waiting for us. He said. \u2026\u2026Yeah. I might not be all sunshine out here, but I\u2019d take hard living over slavery any day. You said. You and luke head to M district, leaving behind the witches and never going back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. We\u2019re here. Luke said. Finally. That was a long walk. You said. And we\u2019re in luck. It\u2019s still day time. Luke said. Why is that considered luck? You said. The giant preteens don\u2019t attack m district that much during the day. Most of them only come at night. He said. Are they always preteen? You said. The occasional teens and adults, but most of them are preteen. He said. So what do we do now that we\u2019re free? You said. Anything. Live how you want to live. He said. I\u2019ve got nothing to my name. No house, no money, nothing. I might as well join the army. You said. Well at least it builds structure. I don\u2019t take well with authoritative people. He said. So what are you going to do? You said. Like I said, anything. He said. Well\u2026.. Get busy living or get busy dying, I guess. You said.  </span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve lost many close friends to those preteens. A soldier said. It\u2019s just that as dangerous as most men make them, you think they\u2019d be more frequent. You said. It\u2019s all about timing. Just be glad you lived though one of their attacks. They aren\u2019t known for sparing us. Another solider said. This might sound stupid, but is there a chance we\u2019ve manage to kill one? You said. Not even close. Bullets bounce and missile just tickle them. A soldier said. Well, there was a rumor that was floating around last week that we got lucky and did do one in. Another soldier said. Anything to raise morale, I guess\u2026 Come on. We\u2019re still on the clock. You said. I don\u2019t see the reason for looking for survivors of this attack on this part of M district. Those giant bitches never leave anyone alive, and if they do, they enslave them. A soldier said. There could be. That\u2019s how we found Alex here. An angel or someone was looking out for him. Another soldier said. You and the other three soldiers look through the carnage of the attack. Shit. Crushed cars, bodies, bloodstains, and destroyed buildings. Yeah. This was the work of preteens. You said. Damnit. They just keep coming. At this rate, they\u2019ll be at our front door in no time. A soldier said. As you all continue to search, you hear a rumbling. Is that someone\u2019s stomach? You said. The three soldiers nod their heads. Then the ground starts to shake. Oh boy! A soldier said. The ground starts to shake more violently until you hear a monstrous roar. Damn. What do they prove by doing that!? You said. As you all look around for her, she right in front of you. Holy\u2026.shit! Preteen! A soldier said. She has red hair that\u2019s in a ponytail, wearing some kind of weird black clothing, and has red eyes. You see she\u2019s on her knees and look down right at you all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhhhh. I knew coming back would be worth it! She said. Worth it? So you did all this?! A soldier shouts. Sure did! All by myself! She said. What do you get out of doing this, huh?! What do you get out of making us suffer!? Another soldier shouts. Knowing that you can\u2019t do nothing to stop me! That\u2019s what I get out of it. Watch. She said. The girl places her index finger on you. You struggle to get her finger off you. See? I\u2019m not even pressing down on him. I\u2019m just resting my finger on him and he can\u2019t get it off! She said. She then lifts her finger off you. Brat\u2026.. You said. So why don\u2019t all of you do the sensible thing and just surrender? She said. No way! I know what happens to captured men! It ain\u2019t happening! A soldier said. He starts to fire his weapon, but the bullets don\u2019t penetrate her skin. Seems like you\u2019ve made up your mind. She said. The girl\u2019s giant hand looms over the soldier and she slams it down on him. Mike! Another soldier said. You bitch! The other soldier said. Both of them shoot at her face, but it doesn\u2019t even faze her. She grabs both of them and proceeds to crush them in her hand. She then wipes the bloodstains off on her clothes. (The way she just killed all three of them. Nothing to any girl, but they would laugh as they do it. She kept a calm face while doing it.) You thought. You just sat there and watched as I killed them. Does that mean you\u2019re smarter than they were? She said before she looms her giant hand over you. Or do you want to join them as stains? She said. (This brat\u2019s a witch. A regular girl would tease then threaten. She\u2019s just up and threatened me.) You thought. Well? She said impatient. (I\u2019m not going back to that insane place, but I\u2019m not dying today!) You thought. Just before she could do anything, she\u2019s suddenly hit right in the face and comes toppling down onto the ground. Making friends with the locals? A familiar voice said. Luke? You said. It\u2019s been a long time, Alex. Luke said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou haven\u2019t change in two years. I see the witchcraft is treating you well. You just knock this brat out cold. You said. I was going for decapitation since she was a small witch. He said. It seems like I\u2019m plagued to be haunted by these witches forever. You said. Escaping is one thing, it\u2019s staying away that\u2019s the tough part. Luke said. It is. We didn\u2019t get childhoods, luke. They bred us to serve them. You said. They do. I still hear the laughs of them. Luke said. What right do they have to just do that? You said. You sound like you want revenge. Luke said. I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t. I want every single one to pay. You said. You\u2019re talking about going up against powerful, magical beings. If revenge is what you want, then you\u2019re going to need an edge. He said. Like what? You said. Magic can only be stop by magic. If you want revenge on them, then you\u2019re going to have to do what I did. He said. You mean\u2026..take the book that has all witch spells? You said. Precisely. Luke said. Breaking out was one thing, but breaking in? You said. We have our ticket right here. Luke said. She\u2019s not just going to help us willingly. We don\u2019t need willingly. Over the past two years, I\u2019ve been experimenting with a few high level witch spells and mastered a hypnosis spell that will get us in. Luke said. Luke, do you know what high level spells will do to non-witches? You said. I know. I\u2019ve seen it happen right in front of me. Luke said. \u2026\u2026If it can get us in, than do it. You said. Excellent. Luke said. Luke walks to the girl\u2019s ear and says the hypnosis spell. The girls eyes shoot open and are now a glowing yellow. When she looks around and sees luke she kneels before him. Master, what do you command of me? She said. Luke? Master? I don\u2019t like those words in the same sentence. You said. I do. It\u2019s about time someone finally realized that. Luke said. Gets a witch under his control and now he thinks he\u2019s hot shit. You mutter. Come on. We got a ride there. Luke said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and luke are sitting on the young witch\u2019s shoulder. This sure as hell beats walking. You said. The only way to travel. Luke said. A few minutes later, the girl comes to a stop. Why did she stop? You said. We\u2019re here. She said. Just then, a building appeared out of thin air. The building was invisible?! You said. Yeah. That way, no prying eyes will find it. Luke said. The witch heads inside the building. Ok. We\u2019re in. What now? You said. The book should be in one of the witch masters possession. Luke said. So how do I get it off them? You said. It won\u2019t be on them. It will be on a pedestal. He said. Any traps I need to worry about? You said. Not at your current size. Oh, and when you find it, look for the growth spell. It will make stealing the book easier. Luke said. Growth spell? Ugh. Just what these bitches need. You said. You are placed on the ground and start looking. I only know a few witch masters, but I know there\u2019s more. You said. You move around until you find one if the master\u2019s rooms. The smell of incents. This is the place. It shouldn\u2019t be hard to find a pedestal. You said. You look to your right and see a pedestal, but when you climb it, the book isn\u2019t there. Damn. Then this one doesn\u2019t have it. You said. You climb back down and look for the next one. While looking, you came across the holding cells and see your father. Oh, Dad. You said. Well\u2026..look at this. Come crawling back? He said. I didn\u2019t come back to be a blind servant like you, dad. I came here for a different reason. You said. Then why\u2026\u2026you said you were never coming back, yet here you are. He said. When you get a good look at him, you can tell he\u2019s starting to wither up. Seems like the witches spell is under way. They\u2019re going to slowly turn you to bones. You said. It\u2019ll be an honor. He said. (Blind man\u2026.. I should just leave him. If he wants to die for them, fine. But he is my only father\u2026..) You thought. Look, dad. We never saw eye to eye on this witch stuff, but there\u2019s a lot to life we\u2019ve missed out. You said. What kind of life is that without our masters? He said. Freedom, dad. Freedom. Where you can dictate whatever you want. I\u2019m going to do the same thing grandpa did. I\u2019ll unlock your cell lock, but you decide if you want to leave. Just know that there is a life beyond serving these bitches. You said. You say the enchantment and the lock pops off. I hope to see you again dad. You said before leaving.</span></div></div>",

As you explore the halls, you\u2019re hoping this is the last time you do this. You know how dangerous these halls are. Men who walked them are not the same after they do. You come across another head witch quarters. Ok. Same plan as las time. You said. You find the pedestal and climb it, but don\u2019t see the book. Damn! Another dead end. If the first head witch doesn\u2019t have it and the second one doesn\u2019t, then who has it? You said. Quite the mystery. Luke said. Luke? Where\u2019d you come from? You said. From thin air. He said. Oh. More witchcraft. I can\u2019t find that book. There are only two head witches here and neither of them has it. You said. Maybe one of the regular witches have it. Luke said. That could take forever. You said. No it won\u2019t. Thanks to some information i....obtained through some peaceful means. Luke said. Yeah. Peaceful. You shock down and threatened Dave when he stole your money. You said. Oh! You know me so well. Anyway. Turns out, neither of the masters have it. A witch named Leah does. Luke said. Leah? You said. Yeah. Apparently, she\u2019s the best witch in generations. Learned summoning at the ripe age of 90. Luke said. 90? In witch years that\u2019s\u2026..toddler, right? You said. Yeah. It usually takes longer to learn it, but she learned it at that small age. Luke said. If she learned to summoned demons and monsters at a toddler\u2019s age, who knows what else she knows? You said. All the more reason. Find where she lays her head and take that book from her. Luke said. I know where she is. You said. You climb back down and head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you go down the hall, you wander which way to go. Damn. Where is she? You said. Then you see a door on the right is open. When you peek in, you see it\u2019s Leah\u2019s room. When you look around, you see Leah is asleep on her bed. Oh boy. This just got worse. You said. You start climbing up places and start looking around and find it on her dresser mirror. Ok. Here it is! You said. To your luck, it was already open. Ok. Growth spell. Growth spell. It better be in this big, black book. Here it is. I hope I can say these words. You said. Before you could say the spell, you hear something. You stop dead in your tracks. You look to see it\u2019s only Leah tuning over on her side. I need to get out of here. But first that spell. You said. You find it again and say the spell. Giga gardum giantism. You said. You suddenly feel your body expanding. Those better be the right words! You said. You jump down to the ground. After a two minute wait, you suddenly expand to the same height as women. So this is what it\u2019s like. I hope there are no side effects. You said. You look over at Leah as she sleeps peacefully. She won\u2019t be an easy one, but I\u2019ll be ready. You said. You grab the book and run outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head to a safe spot in o district. That was somewhat easy. I wonder if there is a shrink spell. You said. To your surprise, there is. Hmmm. Simi status. You said. You start to shrink back down. That was an easy spell to say. You said. I see you have the book. Luke said. Again with the coming out of thin air? You said. Yes. Beats walking. So. How are you going to do this? Luke said. The witches aren\u2019t dumb. If I kill one, they\u2019ll know I stole their book and come down like lightning. No. I need a cover. You said. Something to fool them? Luke said. Yeah. Something they wouldn\u2019t bat an eye at or look into. I know. A mercenary. You said. Like a bounty hunter? Luke said. Yeah. They always get there targets. You said. But that\u2019s a lonely life. You\u2019ll be hated by everyone. Luke said. I know, but it\u2019s the perfect cover. Like you said, we can live how we want. This is the life I\u2019m going to live. You said. *sigh* The one time my words are used against me. Luke said. Luke. I know you care about me, but I\u2019m doing this. You said. \u2026..Then you\u2019ll need a new name. He said. A new one? You said. If you go around with your regular name, the witches will know it\u2019s you. You need a new one. He said. How about\u2026..Devil Dog? You said. I like it. Strikes fear into people. Make it a name people remember. He said. But\u2026.i don\u2019t know the first thing about being a mercenary. You said. Just do cruel, mean, unethical things for people who will pay you. The attitude will come on its own. Luke said. Ok. Then who do I go after? You said. M district. Look for someone who\u2019s desperate and willing. Luke said. Ok\u2026.. I guess this is my new life as Devil Dog. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head out and reach m district. (Ok. Just find someone desperate and willing.) You thought. You look around and see a guy is looking angry. You look like a guy with a problem. You said. I am. I need someone who has nothing to lose for something dangerous. He said. How dangerous? You said. Killing a woman. He said. I\u2019m listening\u2026. You said. Recently, a mother and her daughter came through here and laid waste to us. Just a regular day in m district until you come to find out your own son is dead. I want that mother to know what it\u2019s like to feel the loss of her own. He said. You want me to kill her daughter? You said. Right in front of her!  I\u2019ll give you all the money I\u2019m carrying right now if you can pull this off! He said. \u2026\u2026Done. You said. Really?! Thanks! They live in F district. He said. How will I tell if it\u2019s them? You said. The daughter has pink highlights in her hair. Here take this. He said. He hands you a boot knife. From my time in the army. That on top of all my money. Make her death as brutal as possible. He said. Ok. You said. You head out for F district. If I head there on foot, I won\u2019t last. Maybe something in this witch book will help me get to a rooftop. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to f district, you remain low and out of sight. I\u2019m in the dragon\u2019s den. If they even catch a whiff of me, I\u2019m a goner. Where is that spell? You said. You look through the book and find the one you\u2019re looking for. Here it is. Let\u2019s see\u2026.. Teleptis. You said. You suddenly appear on the rooftop you were looking for. I think you and me will be the best of friends. You said. You look around and spot your targets. Here they are. Brat can\u2019t be no older than 13. Mother looks to be in her mid-30s. Ok. Time to go to work. Teleptis. You said. You teleported right over to their building. You slip right under the door and make it inside. Huh. Fancy living here. Let\u2019s paint these walls red! Whoa. Where\u2019d that come from? Anyway. Better even the odds here. Giga gardum giantism. You said. You quickly grow to 100ft. You go looking of the mother. Just when you\u2019re about to pass a door, it suddenly opens. Acting on pure instinct, you immediately grab the mother and force her to the ground before she could act. You found some heavy string and tie her arms together. Stay here. You said. You quickly find the daughter and do the same to her. With both of them tied up, you sit them together in the middle of the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRgh! I don\u2019t know who you are, but you will regret this! The mother said. If I were you, I\u2019d zip it before this situation got worse. You said. Mommy? The daughter said terrified. It\u2019s alright honey, everything will be alright. The mother said. No. It won\u2019t. A certain person sends his regards. Come here, brat! You said. You grab the girl roughly by her hair. No. No! You stay away from my daughter! She said. Mommy! The daughter shouted. Watch closely. You said. You pull out the knife and slit the young girls throat. NO! The mother shouts. You toss the lifeless body to the floor. The mother\u2019s expression goes from sadness to anger. I swear\u2026\u2026 I promise you\u2026..I WILL find out who made you as tall as women. And when I\u2019m done with them, YOU\u2019RE NEXT!! I WILL KILL YOU!!! She said. Save it for someone who\u2019s scared of your ass. Because I\u2019m not. You said. You will be\u2026.. I\u2019ll make sure the last emotion you experience is fear! She said. Blow it out your ass. You said before leaving. With it being dark already, it will be easy to get back to m district. You make your way back to m district and say the spell that shrinks you back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, you find the guy pacing back and forth in the street. The daughter is dead. You said. Really?! Thank you! Maybe my son can finally sleep easily now. Here. Just as I promised. He said. He hands you 100 dollars. 100 dollars? Just like that? A guy could get use to this. You said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So how was your first job? Luke said. It was\u2026..amazing! I slit that brat\u2019s throat like a hot knife through butter! You said. (His attitude is changing. One of the effects of being exposed to witch magic.) Luke thought. And look! I got 100 dollars easy. Just imagine what I could get for killing someone important! You said. Slow down there. You only did one contract. Luke said. More will come. You said. As you and luke continue talking, a random guy approaches you. I hear you can get things done. He said. That\u2019s right. You said. Well how\u2019d you like to make a small fortune? He said. Depends on how much? You said. 500 dollars. All you have to do is kill someone for me. He said. Who am I killing? You said. This guy in the army. He\u2019s scum. He goes around harassing people. Our life expectancy is already short. It doesn\u2019t need to be difficult. He said. Where can I find the bastard? You said. Around this time, he\u2019s usually giving people shit right about now. Show him that we already have enough problems. He said. Gladly. You said. He\u2019s not far from here. Just listen for him. He said. I\u2019ll be right back. You said. You head out looking for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk the streets, you can hear someone arguing. That must be him. You said. You follow the voice until you see a guy in military uniform giving another guy shit. That\u2019s him. You said. As you approach him, you pull out your knife. Before he even acknowledged you, you stab him two times in heart and he drops dead. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ll shed a tear for this guy. The other man said. Life\u2019s already difficult. He was just making it worse. You said. You\u2019re becoming quite the killer, Devil Dog. Luke said. Comes with the territory. You said. Quite. Here. Just as I promised. The man said. He hands you 500 dollars. Nice. You said. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll do business again soon. Devil dog. The man said before leaving. My name will spread like wildfire! You said. Yeah. Before you get an ego, I have something to tell you. I found a witch. Luke said. A witch? Where? You said. She\u2019s in o district. Can\u2019t tell what she\u2019s doing there. I hoe you\u2019ve been practicing with that book. Luke said. The only way to kill a magical being is with magic. You said. Well, yeah, but there are other ways. Luke said. Like dropping a house on her? You said. No, that\u2019s fairytale you tell children. You can kill her with magic or you could either rip her heart out or burn her to death. Luke said. Rip her heart out? You said. Yeah. Anything less than those three won\u2019t kill a witch. Luke said. Easier said than done, but I guess I have to start somewhere. You said. You head for o district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to o district, you spot a woman looking through some destroyed buildings. (What could she be searching for?) You said. When you get closer, you get a better look at her. I don\u2019t see any marking, so she\u2019s not a siren. That\u2019s good. You said. You pull out the book. Ok. Which spell to use? This one sounds good. Icic bella spikies. You said. Suddenly, ice spikes appear and shoot into her back.  Ouch! She said. With a simple wave of her hand, the spikes are removed. She moves her head side by side to see who attacked her, but all she sees is a man just standing there. You get a really good look at her. She has red hair and eyes, wearing what looks like a dark black jumpsuit, and D breast. You also see what look like guns holstered on her hip. Oh. Just a shrimp. Hmm. We\u2019re not allowed to, but nobody is here so\u2026. She said. You\u2019re wondering what she\u2019s talking about until she quickly press down on you with her index finger. Unlike the last one, she was trying to kill you. You were expecting your body to give out, but instead, you\u2019re just in complete pain. When she finally pays you attention, she sees you haven\u2019t exploded into a gory mess on her finger. Huh? You should be dead. She said. After a few more minutes of being pinned under her finger, she finally lifts it off you. She then grabs you and starts looking you over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re a tough one, aren\u2019t you? She said as she poked and prodded you. (If she wasn\u2019t a witch, this situation would be nice.) You thought. She then rubs her thumb all over you. (Really. Now is not the time for my imagination to run wild.) You thought. I don\u2019t see or feel any magic in you. Maybe I wasn\u2019t pressing hard enough. She said. (I\u2019ll be a smear on the ground or her hand if I up and fight her. I need to be smart about this.) You thought. Hmm, what kept you from popping like a zit? She said. Maybe I was just lucky? You said. I wouldn\u2019t call it lucky. Maybe I should just squeeze the life out of you. She said. She starts to squeeze you in her hand, but she stops after a few seconds. But I don\u2019t want to wipe the blood off on my clothes. She said. Perhaps you could let me go? You said. Yeah, no. She said. Worth a try\u2026.. You said. While she ponders what to do with you, you quickly open the book. (Got to find a fire spell! There\u2019s one!)  You thought. Pyrus val. You said. After you said the spell, the woman catches on fire. AHHHHHHHH! She said. You manage to jump down onto the ground before you were caught in the flames. You watch as the woman is burnt to ashes. She burnt nicely. You said. You see her two guns fall to the ground. Ah. Those will be a nice trophy. You said. You say the growth spell and pick up the guns. I like this shiny black color. You said. You say the shrink spell and head back to m district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey luke. Look at my new toys! You said. You show luke rhe guns you found. Those\u2026.you actually did it. Luke said surprised. I didn\u2019t fight head on. She was distracted about how I didn\u2019t die when she tried to crush me with her finger. All I said was a fire spell and she lit up like a charismas tree. You said. The guns you now have only belong to an Umbran variant. Luke said. Umbran? You said. Yeah. They aren\u2019t easy to kill since they can temporarily stop time. Luke said. Well, she didn\u2019t stop time. These will come in handy. You said. The bullets these things shoot are deadly. A normal person would only survive one shot from these things. Luke said. If that\u2019s so, then my business will flourish. You said. You\u2019ve only gained a small amount notoriety, all right? And you\u2019ve only killed one witch. There are plenty more out there. Luke said. Well then, I best get to work. With my name starting to get out there, there are people who will need my expertise. You said. (He\u2019s changing. Soon he won\u2019t be the same Alex. This is what I feared would happen if he was exposed to the dark magic of the witches. I only hope it\u2019s just his attitude and not his behavior.) Luke thought. </span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t think forcing that man and his child onto the streets signals good. Luke said. He didn\u2019t have the money, so I asked for his house. You said. You know, you\u2019re one sided deals is one of many reasons why people hate you. Luke said. Better to be hated than loved, right? You said. I\u2019m thinking all this is going to your head. Luke said. Maybe it is. But like I said years ago, Get busy living or get busy dying. You said. You know the men are dying because of your little stunt with that convoy, right? Luke said. What doesn\u2019t kill them makes them stronger. Unless they like the sound of living in fear. You said Well, they won\u2019t be living in despair that much. Luke said And why is that? You said. M district army has recently finished a satellite that can pick up any incoming female attack. Luke said. I see. What the point of destroying a town if you don\u2019t kill people in said town. You said. Right. Takes out half the fun of rampaging. Luke said. So does the public know? You said. No. They are keeping this a secret from them. They don\u2019t want those giant hags to catch wind of this. Luke said. Not telling the public. Isn\u2019t that the best thing to do? You said. The army doesn\u2019t want to take any chances of the news getting out. Luke said. As long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with my work. You said. Speaking of work, how\u2019s the witch hunting going? Luke said. Third witch this week. Wanna see the heart? You said. You show luke the heart of the witch you ripped out. Wow. A witches\u2019 heart is black. It is. You want it? I already have more than enough in my collection. You said. Nah. I have my own collection. Luke said. Oh, yeah. Your collection of skulls. Guess the sharks eat good tonight. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days go by, you and luke watches as mass amount of men evacuate from one part of m district to the next. Those girls are mad as fuck. You said. I told you it\u2019s not as fun when you have no one to kill. Luke said. It\u2019s not. You said. Then your phone goes off. Hello? You said. I\u2019ll make this brief. I have a job for you. A female voice said. Can you pay? You said. Handsomely. She said. What do you need done? You said. The only joy my daughter had is now gone. She said. By that, you mean having fun in m district. You said. Precisely. As I said, I can pay you a lot. Just take out whatever thing those bastards have and you could live like a king. She said. A king, huh? Any retirement plans, Luke? You said. Well, I was hoping to spend my golden years near a beach. Luke said. Consider it done. You said before hanging up. Live like a king. I could have anything I want. You said. The thought of anything does seem a little enticing. Luke said. You could even find that lucky lady. You said. Well\u2026.i\u2026.wouldn\u2019t mind having a significant other\u2026.. Luke said timidly. There we go. Find you a nice, proper lady who will like you collection of skulls. You said. She might find that creepy. Luke said. Come on. We got work to do. You said. You and luke jump down to the ground and head to the strong point of the m district army. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. This part of m district seems more advance. You said. Of course it is. This is where the heart of the army is. Luke said. Hey, look. That satellite in that machine there. You said. That looks like what\u2019s giving them headaches. How should we proceed? Luke said. Hmmm. A few soldiers on guard is all they have around it. You said. We could kill them before anyone notices. Luke said. Heh. We could. Get ready. This has to be perfect timing. You said. Iceicles! You both said. All the soldiers on guard are suddenly frozen in ice. Hmm. Human Popsicle. We\u2019re not going to smash them? Luke said. No today. Still picking ice out of my hair from the last guy. You said as you approach the console. Ok. System check. Function. Shut down. You said. The satellite withdraws into the huge machine. Ok luke. You\u2019re up. You said. Luke approaches the machine, picks it up with one hand and toss it directly into the ocean. I think that\u2019s a new record. Luke said. Let\u2019s go. You said. You and luke leave m district and head to o district. This is going to be good. Luke said. You pull out your phone and call the woman back. It\u2019s done. No more heads up for them. You said. Excellent. She said. And as for that payment? You said. The money\u2019s already been transferred. She said. Luke? You said. Luke checks the account. It\u2019s here. He said. Pleasure doing business with you. You said before you hang up. This is a lot, Devil Dog. We could buy out Paris and still have enough for huge mansions for the both of us. He said. She wasn\u2019t kidding. You want to watch the destruction tonight? You said. Got nothing better to do. Luke said. You and luke wait until night time and watch as preteens and a few teens lay waste to multiple parts of m district. I love it when it all comes together. You said. If you aren\u2019t hated, you are now. Luke said. Not like they can do anything. Hey, how about that blond one? You said. The shy one? No, no. Luke said. Aw come on. Didn\u2019t you say you like blonds? You said. Well\u2026.. Luke said. Just go to her. She\u2019s not going to hurt you. She\u2019s not even joining in the death and destruction. \u2026..you\u2019re right. I hope. Luke said. Luke starts to approach the shy blond girl. When she notices him, she gives him a warm and comforting smile. She picks luke up and she asks him his name. Luke stutters out his name to her which makes her smile. Heh. They are getting along good. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see luke comes stumbling into your makeshift hideout. So how did your moonlight rendezvous go? You said. \u2026..I gave up on women after the witches, but I think I\u2019ll give them another chances. Luke said. She was pretty young. You didn\u2019t\u2026..you know. You said. Nah. Luke said. I think I smell love in the air. You said. I\u2026well\u2026..we\u2026..her\u2026.Luke said. You\u2019re so easy to read. You said. Enough about me! What about the witches? Luke said. I\u2019m thinking about expanding my hunt. Globally. You said. Take it to other nations? Luke said. Yeah. He witches aren\u2019t just here. They are all out there. You said. \u2026..I won\u2019t stop you, but if you do this, you\u2019ll be hunted for as long as you live. Luke said. I know what I signed up for. Not only will be hunted by witches, but also by humans as well. You said. If you\u2019re serious about this, then let me tell you about other witches. The Russian witches are part of the military. Determined, deadly, and vicious. They specialize in upfront, in your face fighting.  The French witches are a part of society. Being born a witch means you will enjoy the finer things in life. They are more adapt to magic than anyone else. The Japanese witches are a part of the government. Anything government related equals them. They specialize in horror. They will literally make your worst nightmares come true. You skipped Germany. You said. Oh, yeah. The witches there are just thugs. Watch your back, as they are unrivaled in the arts of shadow. Luke said. And the Middle East? You said. No witches there. They tried, but it\u2019s too inhospitable. Luke said. Then I\u2019ll pack up for the trip. You said. How are you going to cross the ocean? We don\u2019t have or know anyone with a boat. Luke said. This book. I\u2019ll just teleport there. You said. I guess you\u2019ve thought of everything. Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of packing your most personal things, you and luke are standing in the outskirts of O district. You sure you don\u2019t want to come along luke? Witches wronged you just as much as they wronged me. You said. I\u2019d love to\u2026..but\u2026.. Luke said. The girl. You said. I haven\u2019t felt attached to someone in forever. Luke said. Feels good, don\u2019t it? You said. I\u2019ve never experienced this before. \u2026\u2026How long are you going to be gone for? Luke said. I didn\u2019t know you cared. \u2026..I don\u2019t know. Months, years. I don\u2019t know. You said. I know what you\u2019re trying to do. Don\u2019t make me say it. Luke said. I might not come back at all. You said. Alright! Alright! \u2026..Be careful out there. Luke said. Goodbyes aren\u2019t your thing.  Don\u2019t worry luke. I\u2019ll be back before you and your lady friend tie the knot. You said. You give luke a bear hug. Aw, come on! You know how I feel about this. Luke said. Which is why I love to do it. You said before letting go. You pull out the book. Take care, luke. Teleportis. You said. You suddenly vanish into thin air. \u2026\u2026.Goodbye\u2026\u2026Alex. My\u2026..friend. Luke said.</span></div></div>",

You see a flyer just lying on the ground. What\u2019s this? You said. The flyer says that there is a Gala happening tonight. Hmmm. A Gala. Hosted by a lady named Vicky. If the witches here are a part of society\u2019s elite, that\u2019s where they\u2019ll be. But I have no idea where it will be held at. Plus, I doubt that a guy could get in there. You said. You get an idea. If my name hasn\u2019t made it to Europe, it will. Time to do what I do best. You said. You head out to Paris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, you feel like you stick out. I look nothing like a Frenchmen. That could be bad for me, but I\u2019ll worry about that later. First off, I need to settle somewhere. You said. You walk a few feet to find a perfectly vacant building. This\u2019ll do nicely. You said. You go into the building and climb to the 3rd floor. You go into a room with the door is slightly opened. This one will do. You said. You set up your stuff. Ok. Everything is set. Now I just need to get that information. You said. And what would that be? A voice said. You turn around to see a guy standing in the door way. That\u2019s a bit personal. And you reek of cologne. You said. And you reek of bacon. He said. Heh. Nice one. I wasn\u2019t expecting my first conversation to with a French person to be in English. You said. Let\u2019s just say I wasn\u2019t fond of learning it. Anyway. I hear you\u2019re looking for information. He said. I am. But I know how this works. What will it cost me? You said. Only your skills. Word has got out here about you. He said. Maybe it has. Alright. No bullshit. I need to know about a Gala that\u2019s happening tonight. I need to know where and how to get in. You said. I could tell you where, but as for getting in. You might have to hit the streets. He said. Then I\u2019ll have to work fast then. Just tell me what you want me to do. You said. On the outside, France looks like utopia, but look really good and you\u2019ll see the dirty underside. Late night wheeling and dealing, corrupt people, and people willing to sell out their own. He said. The point? You said. Straightforward. I can respect that. I need this guy killed. He\u2019s not as important as one of the Ladies, but he has some power. He said. What\u2019s the story? You said. This guy is not as squeaky clean as people here want to believe he is. He does things on the down low. And nobody can and won\u2019t stop him. But you\u2026..you can kill. That\u2019s what I want you to do. Although you might be casted in a negative light when people find out. He said. I\u2019m use to it. Just tell me where the guy is. You said. Right now, he\u2019s enjoying a day off in the south of France. Cut his vacation short. He said. \u2026..Gladly. You said.  You head to the south of france.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, you are surprised at how beautiful it looks. Heh. I\u2019ll have to refer this to luke when he\u2019s going on his honeymoon. You said. You look out in the field and see a person. That must be him. You said. You make your way to him and as you get closer, the scent of cologne gets stronger. Ugh. That smell is horrible. You said. You see the guy is having a smoke and after he toss the cigarette away, you snap his neck. That crack sound. \u2026\u2026Music to my ears. You said before going back to your hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019s dead. You said. Excellent. One less degenerate in the world. He said. I held up my end, Frenchman. You said. The Gala is being held by Lady Vicky. The most affluent woman in France. Her word is basically law. She does this Gala of hers every year. He said. Why? You said. It\u2019s like a gathering of the social elites to see who can throw the best one. Lady Vicky undefeated when it comes to it. Her Gala\u2019s are the fanciest, prestigious, and highly envied by all. He said. So where is this Gala being held at? You said. Lady Vicky resides near a lake on the outskirts of Paris. You can\u2019t miss it. He said. Wait. I think I\u2019ve seen it when I got here. Huge, white building? A castle in the form of a mansion? You said. That\u2019s Vicky\u2019s place. He said. Ok. Now I just need to know how to get inside. You said. I don\u2019t know how good this will do you, but I heard a rumor that Lady Vicky had hired out some mean looking guards. The thing is, they are men. She said. Men? What good will they do in a place filled to the brim with giant women? You said. I heard they aren\u2019t just any regular men. That they kill giant women as if it was just like killing another man. He said. Hmm. I think I found my way inside. If Vicky is hiring out dangerous people. I just have to make her hear my name. Then all I have to do is walk right in. You said. But the guys Vicky hired kill giant women. Have you? He said. More than my fair share. I only have a few hours before this gala begins. I need to work fast if I want my ticket. You said. How are you going to do\u2026..whatever it is you do in only a few hours? He said. When you\u2019re as good as me, it only takes a few hours before people know who you are. But I don\u2019t have that kind of time. I\u2019ll need a boost. I have a favor to ask Frenchman. You said. I think I know where this is headed. He said. You bet your ass. I need you to spread the word. Start rumors, stories, whatever you can think off. You said. I guess it\u2019s the least I can do. He said. Good. While you do that, I\u2019ll be working. You said.</span></div></div>",

Seems like This Lady Vicky knows how to throw a party. You said. You look around to see women conversaing with each other. Luke said that witches here are a part of society\u2019s elite. If every women here is a witch, then I have my work cut out for me. But how am I going to tell who is a witch and who isn\u2019t? You said. You pull out the book. Here. A tracking spell. I\u2019ll be able to tell who\u2019s who. Now how do I say this? Takirus. You said. After you said the spell, everything turns grey in your sight. When you look around, you spot a witch amongst a group. There\u2019s one. Now to spot the rest. But I better be discreet about it. Don\u2019t want to raise any suspicion. You said. You go around spotting all of the witches. I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ve scratched the surface of how many are here. I need to get high up. You said. You make sure no one is watching you. You look up the giant, golden chandelier. Teleportis. You said. You appear right on the chandelier. High up. Better be careful. Alright. Time to spot out some witches. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuards pov.<br>\r\nAll clear over here. Zeke said. I\u2019ll admit. This Vicky knows how to throw a party. Damon said. What the hell? Zeke said. What is it? Scot said. There\u2019s a guy on the chandelier. Zeke said. How and what\u2019s he doing up there? Damon said. Look. He just disappeared into thin air. Zeke said. Alert everyone else. Damon said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pov.<br>\r\nYou reappear on the second floor. Ok. That\u2019s all of them. Now should I just kill them all now? Or wait it out? You said. Hey. What were you doing up there? A voice said. That\u2019s for me to know and you to go away. You said. First off, you need to watch that tone. The voice said. Like you can do anything about it. Now beat it. I\u2019ve got things to do. You said.  When the person abruptly turns you around, you see it wasn\u2019t a guy, but a woman at your size. She then pushes you against the granite column. Don\u2019t make me do something I\u2019ll regret later! She said. (Wait. Those blue markings on her arm.) You thought. You head butt her to get her off you. Ow! She said. You see you gave her a nose bleed. When you get a good look at her, you see she\u2019s wearing a black and red vest and black pants. She\u2019s green haired, blue eyes, and has a c cup. What the hell\u2019s you\u2019re problem?! She said. You grab her by the throat and slam her into the wall. But before you could do anything, you see a guard coming this way. Tch. This isn\u2019t over. You said before letting her go and running off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop when you get a good distance. Like I didn\u2019t have enough on my damn plate. Plus, I don\u2019t think this spell is wearing off. My vison has come back, but I can still spot witches. Maybe it will go away after some time. You said. As you look around at the partygoers, you are suddenly lifted into the air. Hey! Personal space here! You said. Now, that\u2019s no way to talk to a hostess. The lady said. You look to see a woman in a white, elegant dress that has some gold sparkles on it. She\u2019s also wearing jewelry on her hands and around her neck. (From the look of her, this must be Lady Vicky. If she was anymore white, she\u2019d blend in with that dress. I\u2019ll tread carefully with her.) You thought. You must be Lady Vicky. You said. The one and only. And you must be\u2026.. She said. Name\u2019s Devil Dog. You\u2019re last minute hire. You said. Oh, yes. I was waiting for you to show. I trust that everything here has been to your liking? She said. I\u2019ve seen some fancy homes, but yours blows theirs right out of the water. You said. Why thank you. I do pride myself a little on that. She said. She takes a look around her huge mansion. While she\u2019s gazing, you look her up and down. (Her bust is\u2026..massive.) You thought. Her breast were the size of mountains. At least double or triple D. (Most girls would kill to have breast of that magnitude.) You thought. But enough about me. I want know more about my honored little guest. She said. Honored guest? You said. Even though there aren\u2019t that many, I have a thing for powerful men. And you being able to fell someone 5x your size is\u2026..quite intoxicating. She said. Well, I do what I\u2019m paid to do. You said. Which is good and all, but where would that get you in the end? She said. Huh? You said. Don\u2019t take this personally, but the route you go leads to death. Someone or some people will kill you, and then everything is taken from you. She said. I get the feeling that you are implying something here. You said. You have a sharp eye. Then I\u2019ll be frank. How\u2019d you like to be mine? She said. Yours? What will I be, exactly? A slave? One of those penguin suited guys down there? You said. No, no. I have more than enough servants. What I ask of you is on a more\u2026..intimate level. She said. You\u2026..want me to be your lover? You said. Yes. Think about it. Everything you ever desired. A life of luxury and finer things. And I saw you staring. She said. With a smile, Vicky drops you right in her cleavage. Is this what was going through your mind? She said. (Not even close.) You thought. Vicky pushes you down deeper and squeezes them together. Then she plucks you out.  All this and more can be yours. She said. (I\u2019d sooner eat nails, but this could be the perfect cover I need. If I\u2019m under Vicky\u2019s care, then no one will think I\u2019m killing them off.) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright. I\u2019ll be yours. You said. Excellent! Take a look at your new life. In luxury. She said. Yeah\u2026..luxury. (I hope this works as I intend it to.) You thought. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the party starts to wind down, you start walking around. This is a nice place. I might use it as a summer home when Vicky\u2019s dead. You said. As you start think about your plans, you are suddenly turned around. Ok pal, you\u2019ve got- Shut up! The person interrupts. You see it\u2019s that same girl from before. She forces you against the wall. The impact creates small cracks in the wall. \u2026\u2026You\u2019ve got a lot of nerves. You said. Keep quiet. I\u2019ve got him. Main entrance. She said on her radio. You kick her in the stomach to make her get off you. You grab and rip off her wire. You really don\u2019t want this to happen. She said. I want this to happen. I\u2019ll gut you like a pig. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attack her, but she grabs your arm and shoves you back into the wall. She goes to punch you, but you move out of the way. When her fist hits the wall, the cracks form a small hole. Luckily, she had got her arm stuck. You take advantage of this and punch her right in the face and kick her straight through the wall. You fan away the dust and are suddenly charged and forced to the ground. You move your head before she was able to hit you and flip her over. You then proceeded to punch her until she grabs your arm and breaks it. Ugh! Fucking bitch! You said. You manage to get your arm free from her and snap your arm back in place. Hrg! That\u2019s going to hurt tomorrow. You said. You! She said. You look to that the marking on the left half of her body are glowing. I\u2019ll beat you to within of an inch of your life! She said. (She\u2019s a siren. Luke told me they are the strongest type of witches. Not to be taken lightly. The longer this drags out, the more magic she will draw upon. I\u2019ll have to end this fight quickly.) You thought. \u2026.Bring it. You said. Before you two can go at each other again, you feel a bullet go straight through your left leg. Argh! Fuck! You said. The sudden and sharp pain makes you fall on one knee. What just shot me? You said. You spot someone on the upper level. (He has a sniper rifle? Why would he even have that to begin with? Doesn\u2019t matter. I have to dress this wound.) You thought. You force yourself to stand up. This isn\u2019t over. Not by a longshot. Teleportis. You said before teleporting to your safe house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appear in your safe house. Next time. It\u2019s for keeps. But first, this wound. You said. Thankfully, you took a course in first aid back in the army. You clean your blade and heat it up. Ok. Should not have to worry about infection. Now comes the hard part. You said. You grit your teeth and start to dig the bullet out of your leg. You get the bullet out of your leg. Ok\u2026\u2026 The hard part\u2019s over. Now there should be a spell in here that helps. You said. You look in the book. Come on. Healing. Healing. Here it is. You said. You say the spell and your hand start to glow. You hold your hand over the wound and it starts to heal quickly. There. All better. Hey. There\u2019s the strength spell luke used. Hmm\u2026.. Worth it. You said. Bycic stengtis. You said. After waiting a few moments, nothing happens. Hmm. I think I said the wrong one. You said. You grab the handle on the door and when you open it, the door comes off its hinges. Holy shit! You said surprised. You try to put the door back in its frame, but it falls inward. Damn. This\u2026. This makes my job a lot easier. Now to test it against a witch. You said. You head back out and start looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember seeing one when home early. If I recall, she lived closer to the city of Paris. You said. You head to the city limits and see her house. Not as fancy as Vicky, but still showing off. After all that talking and mingling, she should be asleep. You said. You see the door is creaked open enough for you to get in. Now if I was a super-rich, pampered, influent, social elite, where would I lay my head? At the top. You said. Since it\u2019s the dead of night, all of her servants are in their quarters asleep. Should be easy. You said. You spend at least an hour until you find the master bedroom. You can hear her sawing logs in there. You say the growth spell and grow to their size. You open the door slowly to see her asleep in her bed. It\u2019s like a queen\u2019s chamber in her. Pink carpet with white walls and a luxury bed. You said. You walk to the right side of her bed and see she\u2019s facing up. Good. Don\u2019t have to turn her over. You said. You look right at her and can just feel the anger in you build up. Your kind is a plague. You\u2019ll be the first off many. You said. With no hesitation, you punch straight through chest. Her eyes shoot open, but you manage to rip her heart right out before she could act. She moves her arm towards you, but that\u2019s when she dies. You look at her heart and toss it to the side. You walk right out of the building, but not before cleaning off all the blood on your hands. Best to keep up appearances. You said. You head back to Lady Vicky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, you see all of the partygoers are gone. Damn. I was hoping they all still be here. You said. Lover. What\u2026..how did you get so tall? Lady Vicky said while walking down the flight of stairs. (Damnit. I forgot. Better make up something.) You thought. One of your\u2026..associates played a joke on me. You said. Ah. Must have been Vile. She said. Vile? You said. Name is as implied. Her real name is Vilene, but among the rest of us, we call her Vile. She said. Is she that mean? You said. She\u2019s\u2026..not as kind as I am to my servants. She said. Sooo\u2026..am I stuck like this? Because being like this forever wouldn\u2019t be a problem. You said. Hmmm\u2026..As much as I love your new height and the thought of things you can do for me\u2026.and to me. I prefer my men small. She said. Suddenly, you start shrinking back to normal. (She didn\u2019t even say the spell. Does all she have to do is think it?) You thought. You jump onto her open palm and she lifts you up to face level. Even cuter small. Plus, there\u2019s a lot more of me to love. She said. (More like a lot to hate.) You thought. It\u2019s late, my love. It\u2019s time for us to retire. She said. But what about this huge mess? You said. Oh, child\u2019s play. She said. With a simply wave of her hand, all the trash, tables, and remaining food and trashed and storage. All done. She said. (Even though it was a simple clean up, she\u2019s still powerful. Being around witches for all my life, I can perfectly measure how powerful they are. Vicky\u2019s power is terrifying. I can tell that by just standing in her palm. I need to work delicately with this one.) You thought. Lady Vicky walks up the flight of stairs with you in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Vicky is taking you to her chambers, you begin to ask her questions. If I may pry, Vicky. You don\u2019t talk French or have an accent. You said. I\u2019m half French. On my mother\u2019s side. My father was American. And between you and me, I prefer my American tone than my French tone. She said. So can you speak French? You said. I can. I just prefer not to. She said. Ok. I was just wondering because I heard most of the guest talking in French. You said. After walking down a hallway that has pictures of Lady Vicky and her relatives on it, she opens the door to her room. The lady of the house room. She said. It\u2019s not what I expected. Just a gleaming, white queen like room that smells of\u2026..burning incents? You said. Oh, they help me sleep. Sometimes I have difficulties sleeping. She said. She places you down on her queen sized bed and with a wave of her hand, her elegant dress turns into a black bra and panty. (I guess there is a spell for everything.) You thought. Ahhh. That\u2019s better. She said as she climbed over you, which gave you a good look at her massive breast. Why is it always the pretty ones that are bad? You mutter. Vicky sees you staring and smiles. Come closer. I won\u2019t bite. She teased. I hope not\u2026.. You said. You walked closer to Vicky and she held you close to her while she slept peacefully. You, on the other hand, had an uneasy time sleeping and literally slept with one of your eyes open.</span></div></div>",

I knew better, but did it anyway. You said. You look to see that Vicky is still sleep. Jeez. A sleeper just like Luke. You said. Then you hear rapid footsteps. Uh oh . Better hide. You said. You hide under the covers as one of lady Vicky\u2019s servants comes charging through the door. Miss Vicky! Miss Vicky! Wake up! She shouts. Vicky starts to stir awake. Ohhhh. What is it, Yvette? Vicky said. It\u2019s too shocking! Come see! She said. Lady Vicky throws off her cover and follows Yvette. I wonder\u2026\u2026 Teleportis. You said. You teleport to where Lady Vicky and a few of her servants are watching the TV. Tensions will rise if I\u2019m spotted. I\u2019ll be discreet. You said. You watch the news on the tv. Thank goodness they are talking in english. You said. You listen to what is being told. \u2026\u2026Lady jen was found earlier this morning with a gaping hole in her chest. A closer look at her body reveled that her heart was brutally ripped out. How the killing happened is a mystery as all the doors and windows were locked tight. We will have more information as it becomes available. The reporter said. It\u2019s a tragedy. Who would want Miss Jen dead? A servant said. I pray this is a onetime thing and find the killer. Another servant said. Seems like my late night kill has been found. It\u2019s only going to get harder and harder with the more I kill, If they aren\u2019t watching their backs already. You said. You watch as the servants start to talk all at once. Vicky catches all their attention by whistling. Now\u2026. I\u2019m sure they will find the person responsible for this crime. Vicky said to reassure them. Hmmm. Things are going to become tight around here. I should keep up appearances every now and then not to raise suspicion. But who am I kidding? There\u2019s no way they think a guy would or could kill someone 5x their size. Anyway, I should get back to work. Teleportis. You said. You teleport to your safe house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. Now for an inventory check. You said. You go around to make sure you have everything you need. Laptop\u2026.check. TV to watch was going on\u2026\u2026check. Witch book\u2026.check. Witch guns\u2026..check. And other things I have\u2026..check. Ok. I\u2019m all set. You said. As you do a look over, you see a guy standing in your door way. You need something? You said. I heard that\u2026..you are a person who can get things done? He said. Why the hell are you jittery? You said. I\u2019m a wanted man. He said. Wanted? What kind of trouble can you get into? You said. Against another man, none. But I crossed a certain woman who has the police in her pocket. He said. Police? They have police here? You said. You haven\u2019t been in France long. Unlike in America, things here are more authority wise. He said. Like? You said. Well, in my case, breaking into a rich lady\u2019s mansion means I get life in small jail cell. He said. Damn. Is France a dictatorship? You said. Not really. It\u2019s just that these rich ladies are well liked by everyone and any bad action against them is unacceptable. He said. So what do you need me for? You said. \u2026..Do you have a problem with killing? He said. No. You said. The police commander and the lady whose house I broke into are very close. If one of them were to\u2026\u2026go away. The other wouldn\u2019t know what to do. He said. So I kill either the police guy or the lady? You said. Yeah. Whichever one you decide. He said. I\u2019m not doing this for free. You said. O\u2026of\u2026..of course! I wouldn\u2019t expect you too. Here. He said. He hands you a burlap sack filled with cash. You look in it to see it\u2019s all 100 hundred bills. 100 hundred dollar bills?! How\u2019d you get all this?! You said. That house I said I broke into\u2026\u2026 I stole a few valuable things in there. He said. How did you even manage to carry the things out? They\u2019d be 3x your size. You said. I didn\u2019t say it was anything big. He said. Well, this is more than enough for one killing. Where is the police guy? You said. Earlier in the morning\u2026.. He\u2019s out taking his morning cigarette pack in the police courtyard. He said. A whole pack? In one day? If I don\u2019t get him, the cigarettes will. I\u2019ll go after the police guy. You\u2019ll be able to more around freely soon. You said.  You head out to the police station.<br>\r\nYou manage to find the police station. There is it. Sort of sticks out like a sore thumb. The only small building between to giant ones. And there he is. You said. You spotted him with his dark blue uniform and smoking his pack of cigarettes. Damn. Like a chimney. Best get to it. You said. You down from the building you were scouting from. You walk right behind him and stab him in the neck. His body slumps to the ground while blood pours out of his neck. You grab and take his police star and cigarette pack. You won\u2019t be needing these anymore. You said before leaving back to your hideout. You get there to see the guy looking out the window. The police commander won\u2019t be bothering you anymore. You said. Really?! Thank you!! Now I won\u2019t have to look over my shoulder as often! He said. While you\u2019re still looking, spread the word. Devil Dog. You said. I will. I\u2019m in your debt! He said as he leaves. Now to get all this money on card. At least you can do that here. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of finally transferring all the money to a card you have, you finally sit down at your laptop you\u2026..\u201dborrowed\u201d from someone. While playing solitaire, you hear on the tv that the police commander\u2019s body was found with a wound in his neck. About time they found it\u2026\u2026.. Damn. I didn\u2019t want that card there. You said. After 15 minutes of playing, you finish the game. That one little mistake costed me. You said as you stand up. Then you hear a knock on the door. It\u2019s open. You said. The door doesn\u2019t open, but the knocking continues. When you go to open it, you see no one is here, but you do see a note on the door. \u201cGo to the south of France.\u201d It said. I prefer face to face, but I guess I\u2019ll have to get use to these type of talking. You said. You head to the south of France and when you get there, you see another note attached to a tree and a brown paper bag. \u201cOpen me.\u201d It said. You open the bag and see a wad of cash in it and another note. \u201cThis should cover your expenses. Kidnap the person in the picture and leave them at this place and at this time.\u201d The note said. A kidnapping? First time for everything. You said. You look at the picture to see it\u2019s a guy in a black business suit. Hmmm. He looks important. Better get going. You said. You head back to the city and look for him. Black business suit\u2026\u2026 You said. You look and walk around until you find a guy in a black suit. Hmmm. Black suit and all of the features. You walk up close to him and grab him. Move a muscle, I\u2019ll snap your neck. You said. The man puts up no resistance. Come with me. You said. You take the guy to your hideout, bind him and wait until darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the moon high in the sky, you take the guy to the destination you were instructed. Here? You said. You\u2019re two minutes late. A voice said. You look to see a scruffy forty looking butler. A butler? I was hired by a butler? You said. I was a mere messenger. He said with a heavy French accent. As long as you can pay, I don\u2019t care. Here. All wrapped for you. You said. You push the binded guy forward. Your skills are extraordinary to take a guy in the middle of broad day light. He said. Yeah. I\u2019ve got other things to do. You said. Of course. Come, you! Madame Evet is waiting. He said leading the guy off. Speaking of ladies\u2026.. It\u2019s time. You said.</span></div></div>",

Ok. Let\u2019s do this. You said. You say the growth spell and pick the door open. It takes a few seconds, but you manage to pick the door open. You walk quietly not to alert anyone. Good thing this one has red carpet. Masks my footsteps. You said. You walk around for half an hour until you find her bedroom. She\u2019s in there. Time to do what I do best. You said. You open the door slowly and walk quietly to the side of her bed. Ugh. All that powder on her face. You said. You punch right through her chest. Her eyes shoot open and she quickly tries to fight you off, but you rip her heart right out. As you tend to the scratches on your face, her body slumps over to the floor and her blood starts to pour out. You quickly leave the same way you entered. Night\u2019s still young. Time to find another. You said. You head out to find another witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith blood dripping from your hands, you find another witch. There she is. Second verse. Same as the first. You said. You pick the lock in the door and open it. Hmm. With blood dripping from my hands, it\u2019ll leave a telltale on this tile. You said. As you step lightly, you hear the sound of something opening and closing. You go to investigate and you see your target next to her refrigerator. You walk slowly up to her from behind. You so close to her that you can smell her perfume. You wait a few seconds and punch straight through her. You pull your arm out and kick her to the ground. You use the sink to wash away all the blood on your hands arm. You look in the refrigerator and eat some of her food before leaving. You go to find another witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find another witch and this time, break in through the window. You walk quietly until you come to a complete stop when you hear something. After waiting a few seconds, you continue moving until you stumble onto a servant who looks like she\u2019s waiting for someone. You peek around the corner to see her searching. Is she looking for something? You said. Gauging how far she is by the sound of her clicking high heels, you wait until she\u2019s right next to you. You grab her and force her into a room and bar the door. Is someone out there? A voice said. Shit! You said. You look around and hide behind the red curtains. Hello? Is someone here? The voice said. You see a figure walk by the curtains you are hiding behind. (That\u2019s her. I can feel her power.) You thought. You come out of hiding and creep slowly behind her. You leg sweep her and when she hits the floor, you punch right through her chest and quickly rip her heart out. You watch as she stops moving. That makes three. More than enough for tonight. You said. You quickly bolt back to your hideout and stay there for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs dawn breaks, you wake up. Three witches in one night. A record. You said. You look at the time. I better get back to Vicky before she wakes up. You said. Before you can even say teleportis, you teleport right in lady Vicky\u2019s bed. Whoa. I didn\u2019t even have to say it. You said. You are suddenly grab and are pressed up against something soft. (Great. Now I have to shower in acid.) You thought. Ahhh. Let\u2019s just lay here all day. You and me. Vicky said. (Keep it in check. Not now.) You thought. For a long 5 minutes, you were nuzzled close to Vicky\u2019s breast before one of her servants comes bursting in. Lady Vicky! Come quickly! She said. With you in her hand, Lady Vicky follows her servant. Lady Vicky and her servants all watch as the news shows the body of three witches. Oh dear God! The person has struck again! A servant said. While listening, you hear the report drop the name Devil Dog. (Now my name starts circulating.) you thought. You think this Devil Dog is responsible? A servant said. I wouldn\u2019t pass up on it. Another said. Miss Vicky! I think we need extra security around here! A concerned servant said. No way! I\u2019m not letting whoever this is know that I\u2019m scared! Vicky said. But mistress! This person has killed numerous people! We must take every precaution! She said. I can handle myself! Whoever this person is won\u2019t find me as easy as all the other victims! Vicky said. (That\u2019s what you think.) You thought. But miss\u2026..! This individual comes in the dead of night while his victims sleep! Please! You must at least consider the idea! Another concern servant said. Lady Vicky ponders the idea for a few seconds. Ugh. Fine! If it makes everyone feel better, I\u2019ll hire some extra security. Vicky said. With the announcement of that, you hide your grimace. (Just great. Now I have to worry about jackasses trying to stop me.) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day goes on, everyone is walking on eggshells. While walking around, you see one servant who jumped when she heard a door creak. There was another servant who broke out in a sweat when she was tasked with tending Vicky\u2019s garden. Wow. I didn\u2019t know I could have such an effect on people. You said. As you revel in the fear the servants and butlers, you didn\u2019t pay attention to Vicky as she walked up behind you. Love, you really shouldn\u2019t be walking around. Vicky said as she picked you up gently. You see Vicky is wearing her floral white dress. What? Are you worried? You said. Yes. For your safety because my servants don\u2019t watch where they step. And they are on edge, so who knows what they will do out of panic. Vicky said. They are scared shitless. You said. They have a right to be, but I think they might be taking it way out of proportion. Vicky said. So when is that extra security getting here? You said. They will be here soon. Hopefully, that will put everyone at ease. She said. (Whatever guards are here won\u2019t stop me.) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs night approaches, you get ready to sneak out. Ok. Time to go. You said. You walk u t Vicky\u2019s door and push it open. Whew. Door didn\u2019t come off. You said. You walk through the open door and push it close. Ok. Time to go. You said. You get to the stairs and see the front door. That\u2019s my target. But something doesn\u2019t seem right. Where are the guards Vicky hired? You said. You take it slow and steady as you make your way to the door. Are they a no show? You said. You get to the door with no problem. This seems too easy. You said as you push on the door. Damn. Locked. Well. I don\u2019t need to use the door. You said. You look around to make sure no one sees you. Nobody\u2019s around. Ok. You said. Before you could say the spell, someone grabs you and forces you against the wall. Don\u2019t move. A voice said. You remember that voice. (Her again.) You thought. You grab her arm and slam her against the wall. You again!? She said. I\u2019m just as upset as you are. You said. There\u2019s\u2026\u2026there\u2019s no way you can be the killer. She said. (As much as I want to do her in, I can\u2019t. It will be too suspicious.) You thought. If that\u2019s what you want to believe. You said. What do you mean by that? She said. Nothing. If you think I\u2019m the killer, then that\u2019s what you think. You\u2019re entitled to your own opinion, aren\u2019t you? You said. \u2026\u2026You\u2019re trying to get at something. She said. Like what? You said. I mean you being here is something of a coincident. She said. Coincident? Even as crazy as it sounds, you really think I am the killer. You said. I wouldn\u2019t put it past. You are far from normal. She said. How are you going to get to a conclusion like that? You don\u2019t even know what the killer looks like. How are you going to think I am the killer? If you\u2019ve forgotten, all the victims were women, who are 5x my height. So how am I going to rip her heart out at my size? You said. I never said you were the killer\u2026.. She said. Told you. You said. But that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t know who the killer is. She said. Really? From one stupid idea to another. You think I know who the killer is? You said. If you don\u2019t know who the killer is, then tell me why you are here. She said. Since when do I have to answer to you? You said. That little statement proves my point. She said. What point? You said. You might not be the killer, but you know who the killer really is. She said. You must be really dumb to get to that conclusion. You said. Won\u2019t know until I know for sure. She said in a fighting stance. You really don\u2019t want this to happen. You said. Tell me what I want to know and I won\u2019t have to. She said. \u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know anything. But I know who is not walking away from this. You said. You\u2019re right\u2026\u2026. As long as you\u2019re able to talk, I can beat you into the dirt. She said. Try it\u2026.. You said. </span></div></div>",

She charges at you and you move out of the way of her punch. Her fist hits the wall and the impact makes a hole in the wall. (She\u2019s a witch, alright.) You thought. You attack her and kick her through the hole. Better get going while she\u2019s under that mess. You said. You start to say the spell, but you feel pain shoot through your arm. Argh! Goddamit! Again?! That fucking sniper! You said. Not thinking that clearly, you kick the door open and run out into the darkness off to safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble through your hideout door. That fucker\u2026.. There every time she is. You said.  You look to see the bullet went through you clean, but left a big hole than the last one. Need to bandage this right. You said. Just as soon as you said that, the wound is all patched and sealed. Heh. I guess just thinking it will make it work. You said. As you grab the guns on the table, you hear a knock on the door. Thinking quickly, you hide the book. The knocking continues. Who the hell could that be at this hour? You said. When you open the door, you are suddenly grab by the throat by a tall looking guy. He walks in and plants you in a chair. What\u2019s\u2026.the big idea, geronimo? You said. Shut up and don\u2019t move. Target\u2019s seated! He shouted. As you struggle in this guy\u2019s iron grip, you see two people come in with guns pointed. The first person walks in is wearing what looks like some exo power suit and a what looks like night googols and he\u2019s wearing some a red and black hunter outfit. (This guy must be a bounty hunter.) You thought. The second person you see is someone of a familiar face. That witch from before. You look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost. She taunts. Yap While you can! When I get free\u2026\u2026 Zip it. The tall guy interrupts. Yeah. You\u2019re oh so threatening as you are now. It\u2019s clear, Damon. She said. A few seconds later, you see a man with short black hair and a dark black bounty hunter outfit on, walks in. Not too tight. I need him alive. He said. (This ass is the leader of this band.) You thought. Jess, are you sure he\u2019s the killer? All of the people had their hearts ripped out. He said. He might not be the killer, but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t know who the killer is. She said. Me? Why would I know anything about that? You said. Then why were you at Vicky\u2019s mansion? She said. I don\u2019t have to explain myself to a starry eyed bitch as yourself. You said. What did you say?! She said angry. Cool it, Jess! Damon said. This is ridiculous. Either question him or kill him. Because we have another person to look for. The other guy said. I know. I know. Ok. Let\u2019s make this quick. Damon said. (Just fucking great. I need an exit plan.) You thought. Ok. This is going to be quick and simple. Do you really know who the killer is? Damon said. No. And why would i? I have nothing against the people who were killed. You said. Then why the hell were you there at vicky\u2019s? Jess said. Do I have to repeat myself, bitch? I don\u2019t answer to you! You said. Just give me five minutes with him! That\u2019s all I need! Just five minutes to kick his ass! Jess said. No. What were you doing there? Damon said. Can\u2019t I go where I please? I don\u2019t have a right to go where I please? You said. He does bring up a good point. The other guy said. Good enough for you? Is your mind at ease now? You said. \u2026\u2026We got what we wanted. She said as she left in a huff. Come on, Danny. Dimitri, let him go. Damon said. Dimitri lets go of you and follows the others out. \u2026.Bastards. You said. You look outside. Night\u2019s still young. I can\u2019t go out killing witches tonight. Not with them out and about. But I can go back to my mercenary work. You said. You grab the book and head outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the moon hanging high in the sky, you manage to find some work. You look like you have a problem. You said. Do i. But are you\u2026..him? He said with a heavy French accent. Yeah. The one and only. You said. Have you killed before? He said. Plenty. You said. I\u2019m not talking about no back alley killing. I\u2019m talking about an assassination. He said. I\u2019ve done a little of that. You said.  Good. Now do you have a problem with becoming a public enemy? He said. Not really. You said. Ok. You know those high class women who have been killed? He said. I heard about that. You said. Well\u2026.. I want one more added to that list. A miss Vile. He said. Her? Why? You said. As the name implies, she\u2019s a nasty, cruel, evil person who would hurt a kid if it brought her satisfaction. He said. She wronged you? You said. In a way, yes. While the other rich ladies give back to the community, Vile just spends it on herself. Not even her assistants are getting pennies. He said. So you want me to kill her because she doesn\u2019t give anything back to the city? You said. Yes. While people like Vicky, Evelyn, and so on giving thousands back, Vile doesn\u2019t give a dime. You\u2019d be doing everyone a big favor by removing her. He said. Any specific ways you want this done? You said. I don\u2019t care how you do it, just make sure her name is on the morning news and in the newspaper. He said. Heh. How do you plan on paying for my services? You said. Anything she has is yours. Everything in there is worth a small fortune. He said. Consider it done. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the cover of darkness, you make your way into Vile\u2019s mansion. Ok. Time to find Vile. You said. As you go around looking, you get a strange feeling. Why do I feel like I\u2019m being watched? You said. You look everywhere for her, but can\u2019t find her. Damn. How hard can it be to find a 100ft tall witch? You said. As you\u2019re ranting, you see someone looking out a window. There she is. You said. As you creep towards her, you grow to 100ft tall. Quick and painless. You said. You ready yourself to rip her heart out, but when you do, she disappears in a puff of black smoke. A fake? You said. Then you are bound by shadow like tendrils. So you\u2019re the one who is doing all the killing. A voice said. You see Vile appear out of nowhere in her purple dress. Vile. You said. I should have known it was a former slave going around doing the killing. She said. Slave? What makes you say that? You said. I know the look of a slave when I see it. And you stole the book that contains all spells. Shouldn\u2019t have trusted it to the American witches. She said. You better believe it. And I plan on using it against you bitches. You said. Oh please. What makes you think you can do what the ancient witch hunters couldn\u2019t do? She said. I have it, don\u2019t i? So I\u2019m light years ahead of them already. You said. Just because you have it doesn\u2019t mean you know what you\u2019re doing. You aren\u2019t the first person to steal it, but you\u2019ll wind up like all the others who did. Just wait until the people hear about this. She said. Ha! You think they will believe you? \u201cA giant man breaks into lady Vile\u2019s house.\u201d They will think you\u2019re crazy! You said. Not if I show them you dead corpse. She said. Her left hand starts to glow with a menacing dark energy. Before she could kill you, you break free from the tendrils and grab her arm and break it. Argh! My arm! She said. You attack her, but she stops you with her other arm. Then she disappears. Damn. She\u2019s gone. This mission is a bust. You said before bolting out from her mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the news. Hm. All boring stuff. Wait. You said. You see your face on the screen. How the hell did they get my face? That jackass\u2026. He set me up. The entire police force will be on me. Not to mention those assholes\u2026\u2026I need to leave France. You said. Taking only what you can carry, you head out. I need to get to the border. I\u2019ll deal with Vicky and the rest another time. You said. You keep a low profile and are almost out of France. Almost there. You said. You\u2019re almost home free when someone sees you and calls to you. Hey. Hey! You there! Stop! The voice said. Shit. You said. When the person approaches you, you grab him by the arm, toss him to the ground and hit him in the face. Then you feel something against your head. Don\u2019t move. A voice said. (That sounds like Russian.) You thought. Ok. Ok. You have me. Let\u2019s talk about this. You said. Aryn. Come on. We have our package. He said.</span></div></div>",

You get up and step out of the van. You look around to see you are on the outskirts of a town. (Given the people I\u2019ve been taken by, I\u2019d say I\u2019m in Russia. A slight detour, but I plan on coming here anyway.) You thought. Levi! Why didn\u2019t you drive further in? One said. Can\u2019t. We\u2019d stick out like sore thumb. Come. We walk. Levi. Said. Yeah. You could use the exercise anyway. You said. As you walk into what looks like Moscow, you see that it\u2019s not as crowded as you thought. You\u2019ve only seen a few people here and there. We\u2019re here. Do it. Levi said. You\u2019re suddenly blindfolded. Is this really needed? You said. After being guided and hearing the sound of a huge metal door opening up, the blindfold is taken off. You look around to see you\u2019re in a medium size room with a lamp that hangs over a wooden that has a map over it. Heh. And here I thought you wanted to shoot me. You said. Then a man in a military uniform comes out of the darkness. He looks to be a general that has a few medals on his chest. He eyes you up and down in disgust. This is the so called Devil Dog? He said with a heavy Russian accent. Yes. If you wanted me, my number is in the phone book. You joke. Bah! The day I turn to a mercenary\u2026\u2026. I knew this day was coming\u2026.. He said. Judging by the painful look on your face, you seem like you need my help. You said. If you are as good as you say you are\u2026\u2026then yes. He said. Then what is it? You said. I\u2026\u2026.We\u2026.need some help to wage a war. He said.  A war? Against? You said. Our dictatorship government. He said. Aren\u2019t you guys known for having the worst kind of government? You said. Not as bad as the one we have now. Levi said. I assume you saw the few people out in the streets. No one dares to leave their homes nowadays. The general said. I take it\u2019s that bad. You said. It makes being a slave look good. One guy said. \u2026..Which is why we need your\u2026..expertise. The general said. Flattered, but how are you going to pay for my services? I\u2019m not a charity case. You said. I knew it. I just knew it. The general said. We\u2019ll find some way. Just help us out now. Another guy said. Unless you can come up with a way to pay, this government stays. You said. Fuck. We can\u2019t pay his price. *Sigh* Looks like another year of hiding from those damn dresska. Levi said. Wait\u2026..Dresska? What the hell are those? You said. Just the premier\u2019s right hand branch of military. All women with weird markings and strange fighting ways. But they ruthlessly police us. Levi said. \u2026\u2026.Do they answer to anybody? You said. Only to the premier and sometimes he let them have free reign when they want it. The general said. \u2026\u2026I\u2019ll help. You said. What? They all said in unison. I\u2019ll help you. The Dresska will be my form of payment. You said. A person\u2019s life as a form of currency? And I thought the Dresska\u2019s were evil. The general said. But if we\u2019re going to do this, we\u2019ll need the support of the people. You said. That will be hard to do. Everyone knows the premier rules with an iron fist. Levi said. We need to show people that these\u2026\u2026Dresskas aren\u2019t as dangerous as they look. You said. Make a  100ft tall mountain of a woman look like an innocent kitten? The general said. Any better ideas? You said. Everyone is silent. Then it\u2019s decided. Where is the nearest Dreeska? You said. Well, they mostly patrol at evening and night, but I saw one making her rounds near St. Petersburg. Levi said. I\u2019ll be back. You said. After settling the matter, you head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you had no idea where to go, you were able to find her through your sense of smell. Found you. You said. You start to identify her. Hmm.  She\u2019s a witch alright. Her smell gives it away. But I can\u2019t identify what kind of witch she is. You said. You say the growth spell and creep up behind her. You then grab her from behind. What\u2019s the meaning of-Argh! She said as you shoved your hand right through where her heart is. You retract your arm with her heart in your hand and she falls to the ground with a thud. You toss her heart aside and check her. No marks, so she\u2019s not a siren and I don\u2019t see any guns, so she\u2019s not an Umbran. What the hell is she? Never mind. I better get this body to a good spot. You said. You pick up her body and place it in the streets. You say the shrink spell and head back. You knock on the heavy door and they open. You walk in and the general sees one of your arms is drenched in blood. Jesus. You\u2026\u2026You actually killed one? He said stunned. I told you. I\u2019m good at what I do. So what now? You said. We wait. Let\u2019s see how the Premier takes the news of this. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re sitting at a table counting the money you made while doing your contracts. How\u2026.How much is that? Levi said. Five hundred thousand so far. You said. So far?!he said. Yeah. I still have a lot to go through. You said. You keep counting until the general approaches you. All that dirty money\u2026. He said. Don\u2019t hate. Have you heard? The Premier is cracking down. You said. Yeah. After you killed more of his Dresskas and you always come back with hearts in your hand. He said. A necessity turned trophy. You said. I heard the Premier is so scared, that he has even went out and hired some\u2026.unsavory types. Levi said. Ok. That\u2019s when I go make a personal call. You said. You\u2026.you\u2019re going to him? The general said. Straight there. You said. But the Premier is well guarded. Levi said. I got a few tricks of my own. General, you can keep the money. I\u2019ll make it all back. You said. You leave and head out for the Premier\u2019s building. </span></div></div>",

I smell a few witches around, but I\u2019ll kill them later. The Premier is my target. You said. You walk right up to the main gate and kick the gate open. The sound of the gates being forced open alerted a few guards. When they surround you, all you do is smile. Teleportis. You said. In a blink of an eye, you vanish and appear right behind one. You snap his neck and do the same to the others. You continue to the building. You kick open the door to see a lot of guards looking your way. Easy. Karack. You said. A ball of purple magic forms in your hand and you throw it. When it hits the ground, it explodes and kills everyone in the hall except one guard who fumbles his gun as you walk towards him. He backs up until his back hits the wall. He tries to fire his gun, but you grab the barrel and crush it. You kick him hard and the force opened the door. What the?! A well-dressed man said. So you\u2019re the Premier? You\u2019re just an old coot. You said. Explain yourself! Who are you!? He said. You suddenly grab him by the throat. You don\u2019t ask the questions. I do. Who did you hire? You said. What do you mean? He said. I heard you hired some people to help you. Who are they? You said. Don\u2019t take me lightly because I\u2019m old! He said. He goes to hit you, but you stop him and slam him hard against the wall. Don\u2019t test me, old man! Your bones can break easily. You said. You\u2019re bluffing! He said. You grab his arm and break it. Ahh! You animal! He said. You want a broken leg with that arm? You said. Ok! Ok! The people I hired are known for getting things done. He said. More details, Ivan! You said. All I know is that their leader! He said. Who is it? You said. Damon! Some guy named Damon! That\u2019s all I know! I swear he said. Damon. I\u2019ve met him. One last question. How many does he lead? You said. I didn\u2019t ask, but I assume a good number. He said. You stay here. I have a few people who would love a word with you. You said. You force him into his chair and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral. The Premier is waiting. You said. And you? He said. Our contract is up. Unless you want to hire me for something. You said. No. No. That won\u2019t be necessary. He said before you left. That\u2019s one problem taken care of, but now I have another one. You said. As you formulate a plan, you notice someone behind you. Don\u2019t even. You said as you point your gun at him. You see him hold his arms up, but you can\u2019t understand him. English. You said. I hear you can do what no one else can he said. Maybe. Depends on who ask. You said. A guy who\u2019s desperate. He said. Heh. Just how desperate are you. You said with an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne year later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi. I have some\u2026.dangerous people after me, and I need a way out of Russia. You said. We did have these runners who could get anything under the Premier\u2019s nose. One of them could help. He said. Know any? You said. Yeah. Arthur. He said. Arthur? Not very Russian. Eh, his mother wanted his name American. I could get him, but he\u2019s not going to do it just because. Levi said. Just call him. I\u2019ll handle any transaction. You said. Right as soon as Levi picks up his cell phone, you get an ominous feeling. (This heavy feeling. Like someone or thing is in the shadows.) You thought. Ok. Arthur will do it, but he wants cash up front. Levi said. Levi. No sudden movements. We have a prowler. You whisper. Who? Levi said. Someone in the shadows. Stay still as a board. You said. Levi doesn\u2019t move a muscle as you work out where this mysterious person is. (Not in front, behind or beside.) You thought. You sniff the air. (Witch, but I can\u2019t tell what kind. She\u2019s near.) You thought.  As you focus, you pinpoint her magic. Levi. Get going. You don\u2019t want to be around. You said. No need to tell me twice. He said. Levi leaves the building. Your arm starts to glow purple and your arm goes into the shadow and you feel something. After a short struggle, you pull her out. (She\u2019s\u2026.different from the others.) You thought. She\u2019s dressed in what looks like skin tight black leather, her burnette hair goes to her waist and covers her left eye, and her skin looks a little paler than others. (What is she?) You thought. \u2026..This just proves my point even more. She said. (I feel like I\u2019m looking at darkness itself.) You thought. You have the book of spells. It doesn\u2019t belong to you. She said. You\u2019ve stared down witches before, but this one makes you a little unnerved. You take a step back. A witch hunter afraid? This is unheard of. She said. (Only one person is responsible for this.) You thought. Teleportis. You said. You disappear and reappear on the streets. Vile. You said. Suddenly, a white van pulls up and you see a bearded man driving it. You\u2019re the one who needs a runner? He said. Yeah. You said. Cash. He said. You hand him ten thousand right out of your pocket. Hop in. He said. You get in. Where to? He said. Paris. You said. Arthur begins the long drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long drive, you arrive back in Paris. You step out and Arthur drives off. I\u2019m coming for you, Vile. You said. You head out to Vile\u2019s mansion. You get there and force open the window and jump down onto the soft carpet. Strange. No servants around, and it\u2019s the middle of the day. You said. You say the growth spell and start looking around. Hm. Where is she? You said. As you ponder, you are constrained by shadow tendrils. Again?! You said. You hunters are all predictable. Vile said as she comes out of thin air. Vile. How\u2019s the arm? You said. Why don\u2019t you tell me? She said. She slaps you hard. Must be fine if you hit that hard. Let\u2019s skip the pleasantries and get down to it. You hired some asses to hunt me. Who are they? You said. What makes you think I hired them? She said. I came across a fucking witch who was able to use shadow powers like you. Not only that, but i saw her with a guy named Damon. You said. Heh. Alright. I marked you. But you\u2019re a witch hunter and bounty hunter, so you should be able to handle it. She said. I can. But first! You said. You power free from the tendrils. I\u2019m going to take out the person who hired them. You said. You really think you can match me? I\u2019ve been alive for since the very first witch hunters. If they couldn\u2019t kill me, what hope do you have? She said. That was then. This is now. Let me see how you\u2019ve lived so long. You said. With pleasure. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a staring each other down, you attack first. When you reach her, she\u2019s gone. Where did she go? You said. Then you feel a presence behind you. You attack her, but your attack phases through. What?! You said. No brute attack will land on me. Now. My turn. She said. With a flick of her wrist, several shadow like tendrils surround you. You block and dodge their attacks, bit one clips you in the leg. The pain throws you off balance and the tendrils start barrage you all over and then, one by one, impale you. Hmm. One minute and thirty seconds. The longest any witch hunter lasted. She said. Just\u2026.call me\u2026..special. You said. Well, a special person like you deserve a special end. She said. She walks towards you and as she does, her hand is glowing purple. When she gets to you, she grabs your head. Now last smart remark? She said. \u2026\u2026Yeah. Just one. Barkuko. You said. The tendrils dissipate and you shove Vile\u2019s own arm right into her heart. Ugh\u2026.! Heh. So\u2026..a witch hunter\u2026\u2026finally got me. I\u2026.must be\u2026\u2026getting old. She said before closing her eyes and collapse to the ground. You take a moment to heal your wounds and look down at the dead body. All that\u2019s left is Vicky. You said. Taking one more look at the body, you shrink back down and head out for the last witch in France.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re so in thought, that you don\u2019t realize you took a wrong turn onto an empty street. Not this way. You said. As you turn around, you see someone behind you. \u2026..If have no business with me, beat it. You said. The shadowy figure comes closer. You take a step back. \u2026\u2026Don\u2019t make me do something I\u2019ll regret later. You said. \u2026..You\u2019re not running away this time. Zaku! The figure said. You suddenly feel your body freeze in place and the person comes closer. You see it\u2019s the witch from before. You again\u2026.. I\u2019ve got no time for you today. Inzimious! You said. You feel your body becomes free, but before you could do anything, you are blindsided by a hard punch that sends you through two buildings. Ow\u2026..You said before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your conscious returns, you can hear voices. Jesus. How hard did you hit him? One voice said. Did you want him to get away again? Another voice said. (That one sounded feminine. Oh no.) You thought. Well he hasn\u2019t woken up yet. You couldn\u2019t have done it any lighter? Hey. Wake up. Wake up! The voice said. Feeling the voice close to you, you instinctively head butt them. Ow! I think my nose broke! The voice said. You open your eyes. Oh. You jerks again. Including you. You said. You look dead at Jess. Believe me. I wanted to knock your damn head clean off your shoulders. She said. Yeah? Well don\u2019t let Damon stop you. Because sure as fuck won\u2019t when get out of here! You said. Damon, you see how violent he is. You know I could easily take someone like him. Jess said. \u2026..No. He said. Damon\u2026.. Jess said. We hired to kill him. He said. Don\u2019t expect a pay day. You\u2019re employer\u2019s dead. You said. You\u2026.killed\u2026\u2026You! Jess said angry. Jess! High emotions get us nowhere. Damon said. \u2026\u2026.I only did what I was paid to do. Just like you lot. You said. How?! Jess said. One of you already knows the answer. You said. Who? Damon said. Me. A voice said. You see her come out of thin air. Kat. You know? Damon said. I do. She said. Sis\u2026. Why didn\u2019t you say something?! All the lives we could have saved! Jess shouts. He would have gotten them anyway. His kind always do. She said. His kind? Damon said confused. Leave. I want to talk to this one alone. But\u2026.! Jess said. Leave! Kat said. \u2026..You heard her. Let\u2019s go. Damon said. They all leave except Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....It\u2019s been years since I last saw a witch hunter. She said. We\u2019re a dying breed. Tell me. What kind of witch are you? I know Umbran and Siren, but you are\u2026..different. You said. \u2026..I\u2019m a shadow. She said. A shadow? Aren\u2019t they like assassins? And don\u2019t they prefer to be alone? You said. Yes. We are. But that\u2019s most shadows. You saw my sister. She\u2019s the main reason I didn\u2019t become the standard shadow. She said. I can tell. She\u2019s a pain. You said. Tell me. The witch hunting I get, but what do you get for killing others? She said. I\u2019m a bounty hunter. You pay me for my services. Killing, stealing, kidnapping. Name it, I\u2019ll do it. For the right price. You said. So are you using the bounty hunter as a cover? She said. Yeah. You said. \u2026..You know how it always ends for you witch hunters, right? She said. \u2026..I know. But I\u2019m going to take all the witches I can with me. You said as you stood up. You know I can\u2019t let you up and leave. She said. I was going to leave anyway. If I\u2019m leaving or stepping over your body while doing so is your choice. You said. \u2026..Your fate\u2019s already sealed. She said. You punch down the heavy door and walk out. The loud bang draws attention. You see a guy in an exo suit run towards you. You side step him and he falls to the ground. You make your way down the corridor and bump into a tall person. Oh. Hey Geronimo. You said. It\u2019s Dimitri. He said. Whatever. You said. You dodge and hit him hard in the back of the head. The hard impact knocks him out. You keep going until you see Damon with the book. That book\u2026\u2026It\u2019s mine. You said. Why is that? He said. That\u2019s all you need to know. Just hand it over. You said. At least be honest about it. He said. Would you do me the same kindness? Would you tell me every secret thing about you? You said. \u2026\u2026I wouldn\u2019t. Not at first. But my friends know every single thing about me. He said. And that\u2019s what separates us. Your friends. I don\u2019t care who you associate with. You said as you walked to Damon. Now. Hand it over. You said. Damon hesitates, but hands you the book. Then you feel something jam into your back. Jess! Damon said. I\u2019m sorry Damon. But I\u2019m not taking a chance with this one. She said. I\u2019ve had it with you. You said. You kick her back and aim for her heart, when Damon steps in your way and your arm goes straight through him. What the?! You said. DAMON!!! Jess shouts. You take your arm out off him and he falls down with a thud. YOU!!! You\u2019ll pay for this!!! She said. She comes at you with a full head of steam and you dodge her. Teleportis! You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou disappear a reappear to a different building. Oh Jesus. I don\u2019t fucked up! I had one rule. No innocent person, who I\u2019m not paid to killed, would die. You said. Then you hear a faint voice. For your sin. Your hands will be forever marked with the blood of the innocent you slain. It said. You see magic energy form around your hands and curses your hands to remain soaked in them. My hands\u2026..cursed to forever bear the mark of the innocent. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands are concealed in your pockets as you walk to the border of France. Germany\u2019s just a cakewalk away. You said. Before you cross over into Germany, you move you head to the right and dodge a bullet. When you turn around, you see Jess standing there, with hatred in her eyes. You\u2026. I\u2019m not letting you walk away from this! She said. You remain silent and turn to walk away until she appears in your way. You think you can just kill people and get away with it? Well, you killed the wrong person. She said. You see the marks on her arm are glowing bright. Every second you\u2019re alive is an insult! Witch hunter, bounty hunter. I don\u2019t care what kind of hunter you are! It\u2019s time for you to die!!! She said. Fueled by anger, Jess comes at you fast. You sidestep her. She was waiting for you to attack her, but instead, she saw your hands still in your pockets. You start to walk away when she stands in your way again. Don\u2019t you ignore me like some pest! She said. She comes at you again and you dodge her. Still, your hands don\u2019t leave your pockets. You try to leave again, but she stands in your way again. Quit running! You\u2019re not getting away! She said. She rushes you with a flurry of attacks and you dodge them. When she goes to attack you, you jump out of the way. When her fist hits the ground, the impact makes a huge crater. You watch as she pulls her out of the ground and leave. You go to cross the border when you dodge a punch. You see it\u2019s that guy with the exo suit. You kick him to the ground and stand over him. What are you waiting for?! What\u2019s one more to you?! He said. You close your eyes and turn away from him. You walk away when you feel your body freeze. Against your will, your body turns around. You\u2019re not crossing that border. Not without a fight. Jess said. As you turn to walk away, you see Dimitri in your way. You turn to face Jess, who\u2019s marking are glowing bright. Time to pay the piper! She said.</span></div></div>",

You continue to dodge when you see a flash in the distance. You move your head left and avoid the bullet. Damnit! I said no shot, Viz! Jess said. As you back up, you are grabbed by Dimitri. This should make it easier. He said. You gauge when he shoots and disappears before the bullet hits you. The bullet goes through Dimitri. The bullet hit him right in the chest. Ahh\u2026.. So this\u2026\u2026is what dying\u2026.feels like. He said as he collapse. Dimitri\u2026.! Jess said. You watch as Jess and her friend rush over to Dimitri. When she looks at you, you close your eyes and walk away. Jess appears right in front of you and you dodge an attack aimed for your heart. She was wide open after her attack miss and she knew it, but you didn\u2019t attack her. You walk right past her. You think you can up and ignore me?! I\u2019m fighting to kill you and you\u2019re just ignoring me! Well! Let\u2019s see you ignore me after this! She said. She mutters a spell and shoots back up to her original height. You look up at her with a straight face. Just try to ignore me now! She said. She tries to stomp you, but you move out of the way. You can\u2019t dodge forever! She said. She keeps trying and you keep dodging without breaking a sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can run, but you\u2019ll die tired. She said. You look her dead in the eyes and say a spell. \u2026.Brako dro. You said. Jess suddenly shrinks back down and is brought right to you. Go. Do it! Do what you do best! I\u2019ll save you a spot in hell and we can fight for eternity in the lake of fire! She said. Even though she stares daggers at you, you walk away. You\u2019re just about to cross when you see two figures in the air come down at you. When the hit the ground, they don\u2019t see you. What? Where\u2019d he go? One said. They see you behind them. You look squarely at them and then you walk away. When you cross over, you look back for attack. Not seeing one, you turn back when you see both Jess and Kat attack you. The both slice you across the chest. The slashes both cross each other. You fall one knee as blood drips from the wound. You smile as you stand up, much to Jess\u2019s shock. \u2026..heh. Sorry, Luke. \u2026\u2026looks like\u2026..i\u2019ll be late. You said. You walk a few feet before collapsing onto the ground. You can feel the blood pour out as you lay there for what feels like an eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week later.<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to see you\u2019re not standing in front of God. \u2026..I\u2019m alive? You said.  You see you have bandages over the two gashes. Who saved me? You fight against the pain and get to your feet. You see you were in a room that had a bed, a dresser that had bandages and peroxide on it. Who helped me? You said. I did. A voice said. You know that voice. You see the person steps out of the shadow and it\u2019s Luke. Luke\u2026. How\u2019d you find me? You said. I feel a huge drop in magical force. I rushed from my comfortable living to find you bleeding out in the streets like a dog. He said. You up and hug him. Oof. He said. You hold him tight. Come on, man. You know how I feel about hugs. He said. You let go of him. Sorry. After so long\u2026.. it\u2019s good to see a friendly face. You said. I guess a year of witch hunting and bounty hunting will do that. Luke said. He sees your hands have blood on them. I sense\u2026..a curse on that blood. He said. I\u2026.killed an innocent who I wasn\u2019t paid to kill. And my hands are cursed to forever be stained in them. You said. A heavy curse. Magic might be fickle to who uses it, but when it comes to promises, it\u2019s no nonsense. He said. So how\u2019s the girl? You tell her about the\u2026..you know. You said. I told her I\u2019m special. I don\u2019t want her anywhere near this witch stuff. He said. Good. The farther, the better. So where are we? You said. Germany. You can\u2019t feel the Bleak atmosphere? He said. Yeah. Now that you mention it. I do feel the gloom in the atmosphere. You said. I see the magic has been good to you. He said. Yeah. It\u2019s been good. Saved my ass a few times. You said. Speaking of magic, where the book? You said. I guess the people who left me for dead took it. You said. Then you need to get it back. That book can give the powers to the wrong person. Luke said. I don\u2019t even know where they went. Plus, they have a shadow on their side. You said. A shadow? Luke said. Yeah. Aren\u2019t they like assassins? You said. Yeah. If they have a shadow, then you need to go up against some shadows. Luke said. But where? Shadows are a rare kind. You said. Not here in Germany. Every witch here is a shadow. Perfect for fighting against shadows. Luke said. Well. Best to get out there. You said. You and luke walk out onto the isolated street. More deserted than Russia. You said. Yeah. Let\u2019s go find a shadow. Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke. The shadow I came across wasn\u2019t a towering behemoth. She was our size. You said. Witches wouldn\u2019t be our size just because. Either she was in love or protecting someone. Luke said. In love? You said. Yeah. As outrageous as it sounds, witches fall in love. She must really want to be next to her lover or protect someone close. Luke said. Well that explains her sister. You said. She had a sister? Luke said. I don\u2019t know if she meant by blood or just because she\u2019s another witch. But both of them weren\u2019t giant mammoths. You said. Hmm. Maybe one was in love or something. Luke said. She must have been. When I killed Damon, I saw rage like I\u2019ve never seen before. You said. Yeah. She was in love. Luke said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and luke walk, you get the feeling of being watched. Luke. You think we\u2019re alone out here? You said. \u2026..No. We\u2019re being watched. He said. You and luke are suddenly frozen in place. Hey. Who\u2019s doing this? You said. Aw. Look at them A voice said. Why do you insist on playing games? No need to prolong a person\u2019s death. Another voice said. I like to gauge my victims first. Where\u2019s the fun in just killing them so casually? The voice said. Quick. You said. Painless. Luke said. Less humiliating and demeaning. You said. You and luke see two shadows appear out of nowhere. They seem to be wearing the same thing the last one you saw wear. Plus, these two are cuter than the last. The brunette said. You hear that luke? Someone thinks you\u2019re cute. You said. I\u2019m not cute. I\u2019m handsome. Luke said. Said no one ever. You said. You\u2019re suddenly floating right in front of the brunette\u2019s face. Especially this one. She said. Just hurry up and decided before I do. The blonde said. Cranky. Hey, Luke. You ready? You shout down to him. Just waiting on you. He said. Whenever you\u2019re ready. You said. Luke\u2019s hands start glowing and with a wave of his hands, a huge black wave of energy comes between you and them. This makes the one holding you lose focus and release you. Now. Luke said. Daruk. You said. Luke flashes right behind them and they fall to the ground with a thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNice spell choice. I thought you were going to go with Borok. Luke said. Nah. Not this time. You going to take their skulls? You said. No. He said. You sure they are shadows. The one I went up against was better. You said. They are. We just took them by surprise. Which is what we need to do to get the book back. Luke said. We don\u2019t even know where they are. But I think I know who does. Follow me. You said. </span></div></div>",

Now\u2026.if I can just find\u2026..Here. You said. You find an intercom behind a pushed over column. You push the button. W\u2026who\u2019s out there?! The vice said. A solider from America. You said. Specify. He said. M district army. Number:3245. Rank: Corporal. You said.  After a second of delay, you hear a click. Ok. No sudden moves around him. He\u2019s a little unstable around people. You said. Fine. luke said. You open the door to see Wolfgang running back and forth to his surveillance equipment. State your business quickly. They are always listening. He said. I need to find a band of people. Last seen on the border of France. You said. Wolfgang moves to his computer and starts typing on the keyboard. There. The people you are looking for are at this big building. He said. Must be using it as a base. Thanks Wolfgang. You said. You and luke head off to the building you saw. He was\u2026.jittery. Luke said. He thinks someone is out to get him. A few things happened to him and one thing lead to another and\u2026..jittery Wolfgang. You said. I guess in a world like this, being on edge is the closest thing to being sane. Luke said. Well talk about that later. Right now. We get that book back. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and luke make your way to building. Front door is out of the question. The window. You said. Teleportis. You both said. You both teleport to the roof and climb through the open window and land on a catwalk. Fucking unkempt bastards. Luke said as he looks at all the items on the ground. Worry about cleaning later. You said. You and luke make your way to the railing on the catwalk. You look to see the book, but it\u2019s in the hands of a familiar person. Is that the shadow? Luke said. Yeah. Notice how pale she is? You said. Usually the paler they are, the stronger. Luke said. You and luke watch as one by one, the bounty hunters fill in. Is this all of them? Luke said. No. There was fewer. How long was I out for? You said. An entire week. Luke said. A week? Either they must have done some serious recruiting or there was always this many. You said. You and luke watch as they talk about the book until you see something that surprises you. Damon?! You said. You know him? Luke said. He\u2019s the one I killed, but\u2026\u2026 He\u2019s alive. You said. No. He\u2019s not. Take a good look. He looks to be alive like nothing happened. But his body carries a horrible secret. Luke said. You look at Damon for a few seconds. Holy\u2026.. Hoy shit! They brought him back with magic?! You said. Sure did. Idiots don\u2019t know the consequences of bringing a dead person back to life with magic. Luke said. Then let\u2019s get it back. You said. No. That shadow and other witch will kill you. You need a lot more training before this. Luke said. If it means getting that book back, I\u2019ll do it. You said. Teleportis. You both said. You both teleport back to deserted streets of Germany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what kind of training do I need to tango with a shadow? You said.  The witch hunter trials. Luke said. Trails? You said. Yes. By the ancient witch hunters, you\u2019re only a trainee. You need to be at least master before you take on a shadow. Luke said. But I don\u2019t have that kind of time. It takes years to reach that level. You said. Which is why you\u2019re taking the express route. Luke said. Luke says some enchantment and a portal opens right in front of you. This portal will take you straight into the trails. What would normally take years, you\u2019ll get in a day. Luke said. Years of training and learning in a day? What\u2019s the survival ratio? You said. fifty to one. Luke said. Then I\u2019ll be sure to become the one percent. You said. You step into the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke\u2019s pov<br>\r\nWhen Alex\u2019s steps into the portal, it vanishes. While Alex\u2019s doing the trails, I\u2019ll get that book back. Power like that in the hands of idiots will be the downfall of us all. You said. You disappear and reappear back in the warehouse. That book is here somewhere. You said. You sneak around in darkness until you find the book on a podium. You grab it. I forgot what it was like to hold this. You said. As you hold the book, you could feel the power in it. So much power\u2026\u2026can\u2019t stay in the hands of fools. You said. You\u2019re about to leave when you duck down to dodge an attack and punch the person. You see it\u2019s the shadow Alex pointed out. You\u2026\u2026 Another witch hunter. She said. I don\u2019t hunt anymore. I\u2019m too old for all that. You said. Enough joking. You and I both know what that is and you still hunt. I can smell the blood of fallen witches on you. She said. Heh. I can see why shadows are the assassins. But aren\u2019t your type usually silent? You said. I have my sister to thank for that. Now, hand it over. She said. Hand this back to the person who knows damn well what happens when you bring someone back to life with magic and they do it anyway? No. In a fool\u2019s hand, this book is dangerous. You said. I just wanted the book back. I had nothing to do with bringing a dead person back to life. She said. But you let her do it anyway. Knowing that Damon would not be himself. This book is coming home with me. You said. I don\u2019t think so. Letting it stay in a witch hunter\u2019s hand is dangerous. After all your kind has done\u2026..that book is staying here. She said. I know the atrocities the hunters committed, but you witches are the greater evil. There will be one less evil after today. You said. Prove it. She said. Very well. You said. With the book in your hands, you stare down the shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two size each other up for a minute before she comes at you. You block her with one arm and go for the kill, but she disappears and reappears where she originally stood. Nice escape. My turn. You said. You disappear and reappear right in front of her and attack her, but she side steps you and you hit the wall with your fist and make a giant, gaping hole. Quick on your feet. You said. As are you. She said. Let\u2019s end this warm up and get down to it. You said. I agree. Let\u2019s do this for real. She said.</span></div></div>",

Both your attacks and her attacks negate each other until you both punch each other in the face. You could feel the force of her punch as her fist hit your face. You quickly grab her and force her through the wall. Not wasting any time, she burst right out of the rubble and charges at you with her arms in a black magic shroud. You duck and dodge her attacks. When her arms get close, you grab both of them and toss her over on the ground. (Now!) you thought. You quickly go for the kill, but she disappears as soon as your hand hits where she was laying. She\u2019s gone?! You said. You look around, but don\u2019t find her. (Trust my senses\u2026..) you thought. You close your eyes and listen to the world around you. After a few seconds, you feel a presence behind you. You roundhouse kick high and connect with her head. She stumbles back from the hard impact. Ugh! You are no rookie at this\u2026. She said. I wouldn\u2019t be a witch hunter if I\u2019d let myself get beat by you. You said. You witch hunters\u2026\u2026 Even in modern era, you all are still cocky little asses. She said. Comes with the territory. You said. You look to see someone is checking out the hole you made in the wall. Ahh. Seems like we have a spectator. Or should I say spectators. You said. You see a few people that alex had pointed out to you. Hey, hey! What\u2019s going on here?! A guy said. Friends of yours? Great. You said. Don\u2019t you even! She said. Calm down. As much as i love a high body count, I got what I came for. If you want it back, come find me. If you dare\u2026.. You said as you disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear right in the building you patched up Alex. You hold the book in your hands. You feel the magic in it as you hold it. The power this book holds. You said. Just touching it makes you want to read all of the spells again. Maybe\u2026..just one more read of it. You said. You open the book and read all of the spells. As you read the book, you don\u2019t even know that a portal open up and alex steps out of it. Luke. Luke! He said as he takes the book from you. Oh. Your back. Has it been a day already? You said. You look at alex to see that he has change significantly. That joking attitude he had was gone and replaced with a face of content. You survived the witch hunter trials. How do you feel? You said. \u2026..Tell me everything about them. The history of witch hunters. He said. Why tell when we can experience? You said. Volumos cor portos. You said. A dark purple portal opens up. Come. We will experience it together. You said. Alex walks right into the port and you follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex pov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step off of the portal into a dense evergreen forest. You look to your right and see a tall wooden building with crest on the upper frame. The witch hunter were a group of former men who were former slaves of witches. It was a very exclusive club. The only way anyone could join was to pass the trials, which you did. So you\u2019re an official witch hunter. Luke said. You see a guy in rags goes into the building. Who was that just now? You said. That man in rags? That was Argus. The best witch hunter who ever lived. Let\u2019s go. Luke said. You and luke head into the wooden building and see a rectangular table with all of the seats having a person in it and you see a man in golden armor siting in what looks like a throne. The one in the throne\u2026\u2026.is Argus? You said. Yeah. Known as the leader of all the witch hunters. He was VERY good at killing witches. Luke said. Why is he in armor? You said. That\u2019s what he hunts in. He nickname among the other witch hunters here was knight. He doesn\u2019t look like he lives up to the chivalrous code of a knight. You said. We\u2019re witch hunter, alex. We don\u2019t live by a code. We just kill witches and anyone associated with them. Keep watching, we\u2019re about to have a show. Luke said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and luke see a guy clothe in black comes bursting in. Del? Back from your hunt so soon? Argus said. No, Argus. I come bearing news. Another witch hunter\u2019s body was found. Same condition as the last one. He said. The whole place goes in an uproar. That\u2019s the third one this season. Argus said. Yes, but I found something on the body. A personal mark from the killer. Del said. He pulls out a black rose. A black rose. Only one person leaves a black rose. One guy said. Arlic. Another said. That\u2019s absurd! Arlic has been a hunter since we first came together! He has nothing to gain by killing his own! A guy clad in white attire said. Come to your sense Bol! Arlic is the only one of us to leave a note on his kill. All of the other bodies found had a black rose on them! I say we hunt down Arlic and kill him! A guy said as he stands up. The others all shout in agreement except Bol. This is madness! Are you all so bent on seeing Arlic dead? He\u2019s one of us! Bol said. You only say that because you and him are friends. Argus would agree with us. One hunter proclaims. Argus! Surly your sight is clear on this? Say you don\u2019t believe these bloodthirsty animals?! Bol said. Argus closes his eyes for a second and then opens them. We all took a vow to kill all witches and their associates. Even if they are hunters like us. I understand the friendship you have with Arlic, but we have a killer among us. Argus said. Argus! You must be reasonable! Arlic has been with us all since the beginning! Are you going to throw it all away on some coincidence?! Bol said. The entire room becomes silent as Argus delivers his verdict. \u2026..Very well. Out of deference to you and your service, I will not mark Arlic for death. Argus said. T\u2026.Thank you, Argus! Bol said. But\u2026..if any more hunters are killed. Not only will Arlic be marked, but you as well. Argus said. U\u2026.Understood. Bol said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite the show, huh? Luke said. Indeed. You said. Come. We have to get back. Luke said. Already? You said yeah. We can only be in the past for so long. Luke said. Luke says the spell and you both step back through the portal home. Ahh. Present time. No elves or pixies. Just witches. Lots and lots of witches. Luke soiad. Luke sees you looking on in the distance. Penny for your thought? Luke said. \u2026..Go back home. This is my hunt. And take the book with you. You said. You sure? Luke said. Yes. I have a standard to live up to, but no code to follow. You said. Very well. Good luck. Luke said before vanishing. You stare up at the sun and go back to your hunt. You head back to Wolfgang and see he\u2019s still panicking. Wolfgang\u2026.. You said. Ja? He said. What are you doing? You said. What\u2019s it look like?! I\u2019m going on the run! Someone\u2019s coming for me! I know it! He said. You\u2019re paranoid. Nobody\u2019s coming after you. You said.  That\u2019s what they want me to think! I don\u2019t have time to waste. If you\u2019re still around. Meet me at my new place in Berlin! Now go before someone comes in! He said. With a roll of your eyes, you leave. Guy\u2019s scared of his own shadow. You said. You walk around looking for witches, but can\u2019t find any. Where the hell are they? Do they come out at night? You said. Psst. A voice said. who\u2019s there? You said. A man coved in a tan overcoat and a hat covering his face steps out of the shadows. I\u2019ve seen you interacting with wolfgang. He said. Yeah. And? You said. I\u2019ve been looking for him for a long time. He said. So? You said. I can make it worth your while if you tell me where he\u2019s going. He said. Can you afford the information? You said. He places a stack of ten thousand dollars in your hand. Berlin. He\u2019s moving to Berlin. You said. Good. When he gets there, I\u2019ll be waiting for him. He said. You should feel bad about selling out Wolfgang, but you don\u2019t. If you\u2019re looking for some work, I have a job for you. He said. \u2026\u2026What is it? You said. There\u2019s this group of people I want taken care of. Been a pain in my ass for years. He said. Who are they? You said. I don\u2019t know who they are, but their leader is a man called Damon. He said. I\u2019ve meet them before. I fought them before. You said. You have? Then you know how much of a pain they are. Do them in, and you\u2019ll be able to retire earlier. He said. \u2026.Done. Their heads are yours. You said. As pleasant as that sounds, having their heads over my fire place, I don\u2019t want to deal with all the blood I have to clean. He said. I\u2019ll find them. You said. </span></div></div>",

Since luke took the book, I bet they are looking. Best go find Wolfgang before that hitman does. You said. You go to the building Wolfgang showed you. You open the door and see someone on the ground. You go next to the person and see it\u2019s Wolfgang. One to the head. Killed instantly. Seems like you had a right to be paranoid, Wolfgang. You said. With Wolfgang dead, your own your own on this bounty. That guy didn\u2019t play. He came down here to do what he needed to do. You said. You look at all of Wolfgang\u2019s equipment. I did do a little bit of surveillance training back in the army.  I think I can work this machine. You said. You type on the keyboard and punch in some data, but nothing comes up. Damn. Nothing. Seems like I\u2019m doing it the old fashion way. You said. You leave the building and head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. They\u2019re around when i don\u2019t want them, but now that I want them, I can\u2019t find them. You said. Then you get an idea. Wait. They are bounty hunters like me. They\u2019ll come if there someone contacts them. But I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll show up for a random person. It needs to be something that sparks them.  Me. You said. You see a random guy out and about. You grab him and force him against the wall. L\u2026.Look. Just take whatever you want! D\u2026.Don\u2019t hurt me! He said. Unless you do as I say, you will get hurt. You said. What? He said scared. With an evil smile, you tell him what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait inside a abandon building for your targets. You see the door creek open. Heh. You said. Moving across the rafters, you watch as they come in. All here except the shadow. You said. You focus and sense her presence. She\u2019s watching from the shadows. Literally. Time for some entertainment. You said. Secalus trovas. You said. In the blink of an eye, a clone of you appears next to you. You point down towards them and move your thumb across your neck. With a nod, your clone jumps down and wastes no time in attacking. A shot should ring out right about\u2026..A bullet rips through the glass and your clone dodges it with ease. Yeah. Called it. The clone\u2019s holding its own out there. Idiots don\u2019t know I\u2019m watching all of their moves. You said. Your clone lasts 9 minutes of fighting before collapsing. Damn. The spell wore off. Wait. Where\u2019s the shadow? You said. You turn around to see her coming right at you. You disappear and she hits the ground leaving a small creator. You reappear to see her pull her arm out of the ground. You stare down at them for a second and disappear into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear back in Berlin. So is it done? A voice said. No. No yet. You said. What\u2019s the delay? The voice said. Stow it, Hans. If you wanted them dead, you would have killed them yourself. You\u2019re a hunter like me. You said. You see Hans walk out into the open with his trench coat and hat. Yeah, but where\u2019s the fun in doing it myself? He said. You\u2019re a sick man. You said. We\u2019re hunters, Alex. We don\u2019t have a thing called a conscious or morals. He said. Which is why there are fewer hunters now then there was back in the first witch hunt. You said. We hunt witches. It doesn\u2019t get any more dangerous than that. He said. Yeah. Sign up to hunt a giant woman who has magical powers. You joke. Someone has to do it. And we\u2019re it. He said. Yeah. And it\u2019s a pain. You said. Speaking of pains. What about them? Hans said. Null and void. In their position, I\u2019d done the same thing. You said. No. The two witches. He said. We\u2019re suppose to hunt down them and kill anyone with them, but I\u2019ll make an exception for those two. You said. A conscious? In a witch hunter? Argus would be shocked if he was alive. Then he\u2019d kill you on the spot. Hans said. We can\u2019t all be stone face killers, can we? You said. Well, 99% of us are, but to each his own. He said. So are you going to do it then? You said. Nien. I only kill witches. He said. So do you want to finish the witches here? You said. You know the rules of the hunt. He said.  I know them, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to have an extra hunter. You said. Alex. You know the road we hunters walk. We\u2019re destined to be alone in the world. Whether it\u2019s hunting witches or living out our years, we always alone. We even die alone. He said. Sort of a grim outlook. You said. What can I say? I\u2019m a realist. Now, if you\u2019re so kind, I have some hunting to do. Hans said. Hans disappears in a fog of black smoke. \u2026..Are we really destined to be alone forever? You said. You spend a few days in Germany. As much as you wanted to hunt, you couldn\u2019t interfere in another witch hunter\u2019s hunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your temporary housing, you watch from your window and see the streets are populated with a few people, Hmm. Hans is good at what he does. The streets are safe to walk. You said. You hear a knock at your door. Hopefully, someone with a contract. You said. You open the door and see Damon. Damon? You said. Devil dog. He said. (He\u2019s changed. He\u2019s not talking with that laid back tone.) You thought. Relax. I\u2019m alone. He said. \u2026..Then get in here. You said. Damon walks in. After your little stunt, I decided to find you. He said. Well, you succeeded. So why are you here? You said. I came to learn. I have a lot of questions he said. \u2026..Fine. What do you want to know? You said. I don\u2019t feel like myself. He said. \u2026\u2026Did you feel a burning sensation in your chest? You said. I did. He said. Did you feel like you woken up from for the first time? You said. I did. He said. Do you remember anything before you woke up? You said. Vague in and out moments. He said. Damon\u2026\u2026 You were dead. You said. Dead? He said. Yeah. Dead. You took a hit for jess and died on the spot. Your friends stole the book I had and brought you back with magic. You said. Is that a good thing? He said. No. It\u2019s not. You\u2019re slowly changing. Everything that made you what you were and slowly changing you into something you\u2019re not. And that if the magic likes you. If it doesn\u2019t\u2026\u2026.well, I\u2019ll spare the details on that one. You said. So\u2026..i\u2019m not myself? He said. No. That magic will turn you into what it wants you. You said. So if this is in both of us, what are you? He said. A hunter. I hunt witches. Which is what your two friends are. You said. That doesn\u2019t seem like something that you just decide to do. He said. No. There\u2019s a long history between the witch hunters and witches. You said. So are you hunters morale? He said. No. We\u2019re all cold blooded killers who kill without any remorse or feelings. You said. You make it sound casual. He said. To us, it is. We know witches won\u2019t spare us, and if they do, it\u2019s a lifelong slavery. You said. So do you enjoy it? He said. Killing witches? Of course. I don\u2019t know what lies your witch friends told you, but us hunters are as evil as you think. If we want you dead, we kill you. Plain and simple. Witches make you suffer and wish for death. You said. And the innocent caught in between? He said. We leave them alone. If you\u2019re not a witch, then we don\u2019t bother you. You said. That stunt you pulled\u2026.. He said. I was venting. I was mad about almost being done in. I wasn\u2019t really going to kill them. You said. You weren\u2019t? He said prying. Well, the two witches. But your other friends would walk away. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sigh* Are they really as bad as you make them sound? He said. Yes. If they weren\u2019t bad, then there wouldn\u2019t be any witch hunters. You said. Jess isn\u2019t bad, she\u2019s just a strong headed. And he sister\u2019s is the same, but to a lesser degree. He said. That doesn\u2019t fly with a hunter. If you\u2019re a witch. We go after you. You said.  So are you? He said.  Am I what? You said. Going after jess and her sister? He said. You wait a few seconds, then answer. \u2026..You\u2019re the only person to offer me a hand instead of a fist. We hunters maybe a cold lot, but we acknowledge the slightest sign of respect. You have my word. I won\u2019t touch them. That\u2019s reassuring. Now do it. He said. Do what? You said. If I\u2019m not coming back the way I am, then I\u2019d rather be dead. He said. \u2026\u2026You sure? No spell will bring you back if I do this. You said. I know. Jess\u2019s sister filled me in on a lot about what you hunters have. Just do it. He said. Very well. You said. You concentrate your energy. Verlio bella corceo bal. You said. Damon feels weak and suddenly falls on his knees. Then he dissipates as he hits the ground. It won\u2019t take long. If they aren\u2019t already looking for me, they will be now. I best get out of here. Maybe Japan. Pay a visit to the east. Hans has this place under wraps. You said. You disappear into thin air.</span></div></div>",

Not as many people walking around and I don\u2019t know the native tongue. Just have to blend in. You said. You walk out onto the streets and blend in. As you walk, you overhear a conversation. You would have kept walking, except you overheard the word witch. So you eavesdrop on the conversation. You hear about a huge government building that is rumored that no one comes out of. A building that no one comes out of. Smells like a witch trick. I\u2019ll go pay a visit. Then I can work on some contracts. You said. You head out to the building. When you get there, you can feel the magic. Yep. Witches. I smell them. You said. You\u2019re about to go inside when you feel the ground shake. Oh boy, I forgot what this felt like. You said. You turn around to see a woman in a kimono. (Hm. Black hair, blank stare. Bad combination.) You thought. You need something? Otherwise, beat it. You said. Devil Dog. You will come with me. She said. Ha! I\u2019m flattered you know my name, but I\u2019m not going anywhere with you just because you ask. You said. I wasn\u2019t asking. Let me restate it. You WILL come with me. She said. I don\u2019t want my first day in Japan to be messy. So just go back to whatever shrine you left. You said. You can tell your insult stung her a little. Don\u2019t think you can foul mouth out of this. I\u2019ll force you to listen if I have to. She said. Really? You want to dirty that kimono? You said. Don\u2019t worry. Stains come out of it with ease. She said. Is that a threat? You said. And if it is? She said as she looms over you. Don\u2019t think your size is intimidating. It will do you no good. You said. Even if I was your size, I\u2019d still wipe the floor with you. She said. Prove it. I\u2019ll use your kimono as a blanket. You said. Before either of you could carry out your threats, you both are interrupted by another woman. She\u2019s wearing black dress and skirt. Friend of yours? You said. Mizuki\u2026\u2026 What\u2019s the delay? You were tasked with this job for hours. She said. Kizuna\u2026\u2026! I was just getting him. Mizuki said. Yeah right. She spent the last three minutes saying empty threats. You said. Mizuki\u2026\u2026 Kizuna said. I was about to force him. Just give me a few minutes and I\u2019ll have him in tow. Mizuki said. Still waiting on that. You said. I\u2019ve had more than enough of you. I\u2019ll take you by force. Said it before, prove it. Not even thirty seconds. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches for you, and when her fingers get close, you grab it and flip her on her back. You disappear and reappear on the bridge of her nose. Told you. Not even thirty seconds. You!! I\u2019ll pay you back one hundred fold for this humiliation!! She said. I\u2019m right here. On your nose. I\u2019ll stand perfectly still for you. You said. Enough! Kizuna said. Her voice rings out across the entire area. Nice sonic boom. You said. Devil Dog. You are just as they say. She said. Flattery still won\u2019t get me. You said. Unlike my associate there on the ground, I won\u2019t say uncle from a measly flip. She said. (Something\u2019s special about this one. She\u2019s more than a witch. Something greater.) You thought. You wait a few seconds and then come to a decision. You know, I\u2019ve had my daily laugh today and it put me in a good mood. So I guess I\u2019ll come with you. You said. Hmph. Very well. Kizuna said. She grabs you, but you disappear and reappear on her shoulder. I prefer a shoulder ride. You said. Come, Mizuki. If your done embarrassing yourself. Kizuna said. Mizuki stands up and follows Kizuna to where she\u2019s taking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKizuna takes you to a ritzy looking building. Hm. Someone of importance must live here. You said. Kizuna stops at the sliding doors. You\u2019re dismissed, Mizuki. She said. \u2026..Understood. Mizuki said. She gives you a nasty look before heading off. Kizuna opens the sliding door. Master. I\u2019ve retrieved Devil Dog. She said. You see a guy in a well-dressed suit kneeling in front of a shrine. He stands up slowly and turns to face Kizuna. You disappear and reappear in front of him. You\u2019re the guy who sent them? You said. Yes. He said. Normally, I\u2019d kill someone for doing that, but you must have a reason to send them out for me. You said. I do. Leave us, Kizuna. He said. As you wish. She said. Kizuna leaves. \u2026\u2026Puppet. Now what do you need with me? You said. You have a way of get things done. You\u2019re not blinded by a code, morality, or a sense of compassion. He said. Crunches. That\u2019s what those are. You said. And not everybody has it. Take a wild guess. How do you think I got this huge building and a woman calling me master? He said. You didn\u2019t give a damn about anyone to get it. You said. Right. You see, we as men, don\u2019t have anything. We are lucky to even have a name. Women get what they want. We have to struggle and fight for it. Give a poor person money, and they\u2019ll do anything to keep it. You said. I know. I\u2019ve seen a man killed over some scrap of food. You said. And that\u2019s how they want us. But not me. If I\u2019m going out, it\u2019s going to be in the lap of luxury. He said. People aren\u2019t going to be happy knowing you are living like this while they suffer. You said. You don\u2019t get like this without making a few enemies. He said. Let me guess. You want me as protection? You said. I do. He said. But doesn\u2019t someone like you have an army of women at your call? You said. I do. And nobody wants to do something knowing they aren\u2019t coming back, but you\u2026.. You have a reputation that people fear. Nobody crosses you. Not even a giant woman. He said. I do. In the line of work I do, you can\u2019t have fear. You said. And that\u2019s why I want you on my pay roll. He said. Can you pay? My protection fee is higher than my kill fee. You said. Of course. And it comes with expenses. Fine food, drinks, and ladies. Not all in that order. He said. Very well. Then I\u2019m your bodyguard or whatever. You said. You look to see Mizuki peeking. You make a smug smile at her and she\u2019s not happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your new contract, you had to put your witch-hunting on hold and spent a year as a bodyguard. You didn\u2019t bother getting to know anyone there, let alone the other bodyguards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne year later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the roof of the building and look up at the clear sky. The contract\u2019s almost up. I can go back to my hunt. You said. You jump down on the ground and lean against the wall. While minding your own business, you see Mizuki walk up to you. You need something, Godzilla? You said. The name\u2019s MIZUKI! She said. Your name could be mud and I wouldn\u2019t care. If you have nothing for me, get lost. You said. You rotten, little insect! She said. That might work on a normal person, but I don\u2019t take kindly to insults. You said. Yeah? What are you going to do about it, worm? She said. You jump right into her face and punch her square on the nose. The force sends her flying through two walls. The crash alerts a few guards. They see Mizuki is out cold and you standing right in front of her. What? You said. When you walk away, the guards hurriedly get out of your way. When you get to the main entrance, you see Kizuna standing guard. You two share a glance at each other and you head inside. You head up to the second floor and lean on the wooden arm way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevil Dog. A voice said. You see it\u2019s Mr. Hamachi. Hamachi. You said. All of my guards are on alert for some reason. What\u2019s going on? He said. Mizuki got smart with me and I sent her through two walls. You said. Mizuki was known for her mouth. It got her in trouble a lot. He said. You might want to keep them on alert. You said. Why? He said. Someone\u2026\u2026.no. Some people are coming. You said. How can you tell? He said. I can tell by the wind and smell. I\u2019m a special kind. You said. Any idea when? He said. Tonight. When the moon is at its highest. You said. I knew it. I just knew someone would work up the nerve. He said. They aren\u2019t here for you. It\u2019s me they want. You said. You? He said. Nothing to fear, Hamachi. They won\u2019t even look at you. You said. That\u2019s\u2026..somewhat reassuring. He said. (I promise Damon not to harm his friends, but I\u2019ve been paid in full to keep Hamachi safe. It\u2019s not like they are going to go after him. To them, he\u2019s just a civilian.) You thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When night comes, you continue to watch the sliding doors. You\u2019re so intent that you don\u2019t notice Kizuna has approached you. You waiting for someone? She said. Nothing that concerns you. Shouldn\u2019t you be guarding Hamachi as he sleeps? You said. I\u2019d love to, but he\u2019s given me the night off. She said. Then why don\u2019t you hit the town? See what kind of trouble you can get into. You said. And leave this place in the hands of mediocre protection? She said. Was that a shot at me? You said. No. You carry yourself well. Like a hunter of sorts. Always ready even if there\u2019s nothing to be ready for. She said. Well I told you since day one that I was a bounty hunter. You said. Bounty hunters don\u2019t carry themselves like you do. You are a bounty hunter, but you don\u2019t fully operate as a bounty hunter. She said. If I don\u2019t operate or carry myself as a bounty hunter, then what am i? You said. I\u2019m still trying to piece that together. You have high intelligence, very powerful, and a rugged charm about you. She said. Aren\u2019t all those the qualities of a bounty hunter? You said. They are, but yours goes to another level. Just\u2026.what are you? She said. You\u2019re going to work yourself into the ground thinking like this. Hamachi\u2019s given you the night off. Just take it. You probably don\u2019t get this often. You said. I\u2026..guess I will. Maybe the answer will come to me soon. She said. Kizuna walks away. Thunderous footsteps. Still not as bad as Viola. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to watch the door and it opens. You see it\u2019s Jess who walks in. Where are the others? You said. Where are the others? You said. Come on. Where is he? You heard her said with your enhanced hearing. Far from home? You said. If it wasn\u2019t for you, I\u2019d be home. She said. Then why don\u2019t you just go there? You said.  Not while you\u2019re around. After all you\u2019ve done, I\u2019ll be doing a public service. She said. A public service? You do the same thing I do. What makes you better than me? I know. It\u2019s because I killed Damon. You said. You don\u2019t get to say his name! She said. I didn\u2019t know you witches have hearts. You must have cared for him if you\u2019re that angry. Dare I say, love? You said. SHUT UP!!! She said. Must have hit a nerve. No matter. Go home, witch. You said. No! Not until I finish this! She said. It takes two to tango. And I don\u2019t feel like tangoing with you. You said. Whether you like it or not, you are. She said. Like you can force me to fight you. She said. Actually, I can! Bimos! She said. A purple dome engulfs you and Jess. You think this can hold me? You said. It will. This dome won\u2019t go down until one of us can\u2019t continue. She said. You\u2019re an idiot. Do you really want to do this against a hunter? You said. If I get to drag you to hell with me, then I\u2019m fine with it. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess comes right at you, but you side step her. Keeping her balance, she attacks you again, but you dodge her again. You can\u2019t dodge forever\u2026.. She said. She keeps attacking and you keep dodging  until your back touches the dome. Jess charges at you. When her fist is near your face, you dodge it. Her fist hits the dome and it doesn\u2019t even crack. When she turns around, you hold your gun close to her head. Those guns\u2026.. She said. The ones Umbrans carry. And they kill people. Witch or not. You said. You coward! Only a coward uses firearms during a fist fight. She said. I told you I\u2019m not tangoing with you today. Drop the shield. You said. You wouldn\u2019t shoot me. She said. You shoot her in her left foot then her knee. OW!!! She said as she hops on her right foot and drops on one knee.. Next one\u2019s for you brain. Drop the shield. You said. You see Jess has a smile on her face. What\u2019s so funny? You said. That you thought this was all I had come up with. She said. You look to see her right arm is twitching for a few seconds and changes into a double tip, curved blade. What the?! You said. You jump back just as she slashes at you. What the fuck did you do?! You said. A new trick I learned. Now hold still! She said. She comes charging at you. You dodge her and she collides into the shield. The force shatters the shield easily. Holy shit! You said. I didn\u2019t want to fight like this, but for you, I\u2019ll make an exception. She said. (What kind of spell did she use?) You said. She comes at you again and you dodge her again. I said hold still! She said. She run towards you and is already at you before you could react. You are pushed against the wall. You push back against her, but she slowly over powers you. The blade got close to your midsection. Before it got any closer, you kick her away. She recovers quickly and slashes high. You duck down and tackle her to the ground. She pushes you away before you could do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Damn. She\u2019s faster and stronger than before.) You thought. She comes at you again, You dodge her attacks, but they get quicker and quicker until one of them slices your right arm off. Argh!!! You shout.  Quit whining. It\u2019s just a flesh wound. She said. She comes at you again. You duck and dodge her attack until your back touches the wall. Jess charges at you and shoves the blade through your stomach. Ugh\u2026\u2026 You said. She pulls out the blade and holds it against your neck. And here I thought you were good. She said. You grab the blade before it slices you. You hold her back for a few seconds and kick her back. With an angry look, she comes back at you, but stops when she sees the moon is high in the sky. She starts to step back. You got lucky tonight, but I\u2019ll get you next time. She said before bolting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there a few seconds before consulting your injuries. Her arm turned into a blade. What kind of spell did she use? You said. Your grab your dismembered arm and say the spell to reattach it. Nobody said hunting would be easy. You said. You wait until morning to leave. At the gate, you see Kizuna is waiting there. Kizuna? Shouldn\u2019t you be near Hamachi? You said. I took what you and master said to heart. I\u2019m trying not to be overbearing. She said. One day at a time? You said. One day at a time. She said. Good. Maybe now you can start enjoying things. You said. Maybe\u2026.. She said. During the whole conversation, you two had avoided eye contact. Which means only one thing. You knew what I was since you saw me. You said. \u2026\u2026I did. She said. So were you just leading me on the entire time with all that not knowing? You said. \u2026\u2026I wanted to see if you\u2019d tell me, but you wouldn\u2019t. She said. Would you tell me you were a witch if the roles were reversed? You said. \u2026..No. I wouldn\u2019t. She said. You know what happens when you go around parading it. You said. So\u2026..how does this end? Do we follow the path of our ancestors? She said. You\u2019re a witch and I\u2019m a hunter. You said. Is that a yes? She said. \u2026..We hunters are loners and cold blooded, but we acknowledge the slightest signs of compassion or respect towards us. You could have follow the path of your witch sisters, but you didn\u2019t. You said. And what about your hunter brothers? Aren\u2019t you all suppose to kill witches on sight? She said. We are. You said. Isn\u2019t sparing a witch a sign of betrayal to them? She said. Any contact with a witch outside of fighting is considered a betrayal. But the founders are dead. You said. So you\u2019re not going to follow them? She said. In this case, no. You said. In that case, let me return the favor. I know what you were going against. I felt a spell that has been used and shouldn\u2019t be used. She said. Shouldn\u2019t be? You said Yes. A forbidden spell. Found too dangerous to be used. The spell she used is called Vlacous. She said. Vlacous? It turns a person\u2019s arm into a blade? You said. Yes. It\u2019s a spell that eliminate the physical and mental barriers of a witch. It was meant to counter you hunters, but the effects of it was too great. The spell consumes the person\u2019s mind. They go from hunting hunters to hunting anything. She said. So how do I beat her? You said. Nothing cunning, tricks, or manipulation will work. The only thing that will work is beat\u2026.no, obliterate her. She said. You mean I have to make sure she doesn\u2019t get back up. You said. Yes. Nothing less of complete obliteration. She said. Nothing less\u2026.. Hmph. Thanks Kizuna. You said. You know you can stay. She said. \u2026\u2026My contract is up. Plus, she\u2019ll be back and I don\u2019t want any collateral. You said. You walk away from the Kizuna. </span></div></div>",

It takes you an hour until you find Jess, but she\u2019s not alone. She\u2019s with the rest of them. Come on. We have to find him. Jess said. Boy. Never seen her so worked up before. Zeke said. I think she\u2019s enjoying this too much. Dan said.  Sis, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re rushing this? The shadow said. Rushing? No. I almost had him last time. I\u2019m not letting him slip away. Jess said. Still Jess. Dimitri said. You take a deep breath and jump down from the building you were watching from. You land right in their path. Speak of the devil. Dan said. Good saves me the trouble. Jess said. Sis. I recommended we do this as a team. The shadow said. You grab your knife and point it at Jess. A duel? Fine by me! She said. She charges at you and her arm turns into that blade again. Let\u2019s pick up where we left off! She said. You grab the blade and force her to the ground. You go to punch her, but she pushes you through a building. You stop when you hit another building. Just as you open your eyes, she\u2019s an inch from you. You punch her hard and send her through an opposite building. You disappear and reappear in behind her when she comes flying out from the other side and kick her into the sky. You look up to see her coming back down. You jump out of the way from her attack as she comes down with authority. Ha! You\u2019re trying this time! Good. More satisfying. She said. She comes at you and you dodge her attacks until she slices at you face. You grab the blade in time and throw her into the sky. You disappear and reappear above her, grab her and hit the ground hard enough to cause the ground to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is crazy! We have to step in! Dan said. No. We\u2019ll only get in her way. The shadow said. He\u2019ll kill her! Zeke said. Just wait. He\u2019ll tire soon. She said. You get up and see Jess is gone. Up here! She said. You look to see her above you and slashes downward. You jump back and she hits the ground. *Sigh* You said.  Through the dust, Jess rush at you and forces you against a building. You push back, but you can feel her strength increasing. The blade gets closer and closer. You manage to kick her away, but she comes right back at you. You side step her and she crashes into the building. Then she come right back at you. She jumps and aims for your neck. You hold your arms up and the impact forces you to the ground. You try to push her back, but she slowly gets the upper hand. The tip of the blade touches your neck. You kick her up in the sky. You jump and punch her into a building. As you go for another, you are grabbed by her and she stab the blade into your stomach. Ack\u2026..! You said. She takes it out and goes for another, but you grab the blade and use it to cut off her other arm. AHHHHHH! She said. You take a second to catch your breath. I\u2019m not done with you! She said as her arm regenerated back. She slashes high and you duck. You punch her in the stomach. While she is kneeled over, you kick her hard through another building that crashes down on her. You take a few seconds to catch your breath until you see Jess burst out from the rubble. (No way.) You thought. Jess snaps her right arm back into socket and it turns back into its blade form. Nice hit. Let me show you a better one. She said. She comes charging towards you. (Only one move left\u2026.!) You thought. You jump high into the sky. What\u2019s he planning? Jess said. You concentrate all of the magic inside you. Then you feel a fire in your stomach. What\u2019s he doing? Dan said. It takes a few seconds, but the shadow figures out what you\u2019re about to do. Find some cover! She shouts. Everyone of them scrambles away except jess who has a grin on her face. Come on! Take your best shot! She said. (This is going to hurt\u2026.. But it will put her down!!) You thought. You breathe in and breathe out a giant wave of black fire. The wave incinerates everything it touches. I\u2019d expect no less from a hunter! AHHHHHHH! Jess said as the wave engulfs her. The wave continues to go until there is no air left in your lungs and you fall to the ground and barely land on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe heavily as you get some air into your lungs. Didn\u2019t\u2026.think\u2026.i\u2019d get it\u2026..on my first go. You said. Using that much magic took its toll on your body. You can barely stand and your insides feel like they are melting. As you look at the now barren landscape, you sigh in relief. Finally\u2026.. You said. Then you feel a sharp pain. You look to see a blade pierce through your heart. When the blade is pulled out, you are kicked to the ground. Then you feel another stab in the same spot. You can feel the blood pour out of you until you want to sleep. Jess nudges you, but gets no response. Heh. Seems like the myth was wrong. Hunters do die. She said. She checks for a pulse and doesn\u2019t feel one. Just making sure. Now to make sure everyone else is ok. Jess said. She runs off. Your body lays there on the ground for 5 minutes before being carried away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and rub your head. You check your surroundings and see you are in a dark room. You walk around until you come across a rectangular table and a throne like chair at the head of the table. This place looks familiar to you. Then you remember this is where the first witch hunters resided. You see a faint glow on your left arm. You look to see it\u2019s the witch hunter\u2019s crest that\u2019s been marked on your arm. You look at the raven crest on the table and then on your arm. You see the door and head for it, but stop when you hear multiple voices at once. Congratulation, brother Alex. You have finally experience death. The last requirement to become a true, full fledge witch hunter. Now that you have experience death first hand, nothing stands in your way. The raven crest on your arm shows that you are one of us. Our numbers maybe few, but we have no equals. Magical or non. This world or another. Now go. And join the ranks of your brethren who have hunt and hunted before you. The voices said in unison. You look around, but see no spirts or ghosts. But you put it out of your mind as you head for the door. You open it and step back into the barren landscape. \u2026\u2026..Find the one. You said. The first thing you\u2019re going to do is find the person who gave out that forbidden spell, and you have a good idea who it was.</span></div></div>",

She gets a good look at you. You\u2019ve\u2026..experience death for the first time. That means\u2026..you\u2019re a true witch hunter now. She said. \u2026..Yes. I know who let loose the knowledge of that spell. You said. Who? She said. Mizuki\u2026. You said. Mizuki?! But she doesn\u2019t know anything about us. She said. She\u2019s not one of you\u2026.. You said. What are you getting at? She said. You say the spell and grow 100ft. \u2026.Follow. You said. You find Mizuki at the back of the estate. What do you want? I was finally enjoying the peace. She said. You grab her by the throat and hold her against the wall. Hey! Kizuna! You just going to stand there and let him hurt me?! Mizuki said. \u2026.Quiet. Kizuna. Roll up her sleeve. You said. Hesitant, Kizuna rolls up Mizuki\u2019s  kimono sleeve and sees the witch hunter insignia on her fore arm. Mizuki\u2026.. You\u2019re a\u2026..witch hunter?! She said. K\u2026..Kizuna. It\u2019s not what you think. Mizuki said. Oh yes it is. Kizuna. Did you ever know anything off about her? You said. I\u2019ve always wondered why she was so distant. Kizuna said. Distant. Just like a witch hunter. We prefer to be alone. You said. Mizuki\u2026\u2026.why? Kizuna said. I know why. She meet Jess under the darkness of night and told her about the forbidden spell. She was hoping that it would kill me and you. You said. Mizuki\u2026\u2026 Kizuna said stunned. I\u2026..I\u2026. Mizuki said. Go on. Tell her why you are a hunter. You said. I\u2026.can\u2019t\u2026. She said. You\u2019ll tell her or I will. You said. Because your kind killed my mother! She said. Killed\u2026..your mother? Kizuna said. Mizuki is one of the oldest hunters. Dating back to medieval times. You said.  Mizuki\u2026\u2026 Kizuna said. Yeah. I joined the hunters after my mother was killed by your kind. She meant no harm to any of you, but she was still killed. The hunter were skeptical at first, but I showed that I could be just as good as them. I\u2019ve been hunting for years, but my anger is still hot. Just looking at you, Kizuna, makes me want to kill. Mizuki said. Stow it. You let loose a dangerous spell just to get rid of me. You said. So? A hunter can kill another hunter unless that hunter is a traitor. She said. Letting loose a spell like that. I\u2019m sure the founders will make an exception. You said. A black aura surrounds your left arm and you pierce through Mizuki\u2019s heart. With a thud, she falls to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2026..was a hunter this entire time. If she wanted to, she could have\u2026\u2026 Kizuna said. Kizuna is still stunned, but you still have a hunt to finish. Wait! Devil Dog! She said. You stop and turn around. This might be the first time in history. \u2026\u2026Thank you. She said. You\u2019re shocked that a witch has thanked you, but you don\u2019t show it. You turn back around and disappear. You reappear back in front of the building you came across a year ago. You kick open the door and head in. You see it\u2019s strangely dark inside even though the sun\u2019s out. You walk around and start looking. As you look, you could hear footsteps. They sound like they are behind you, but there is no one behind you when you look. After walking a few feet, you could hear laughter. Like a school girl laughter. You follow the sounds of laughter until your legs are constricted by magic. Ah. Another fly caught in my web. A voice said. You see a witch step out of the shadows and comes to you. She has her hair in a ponytail and she\u2019s wearing a Japanese school girl attire. A hunter. There hasn\u2019t been one of you in hundreds of years. She said. She looks you over. Let\u2019s see if you have any fears. She said. Her eyes turn bright yellow. You feel her shuffling around looking for your fears. What?! That\u2019s impossible! She said. With her off guard, you head butt her and she stumbles back. With her concentration broken, the magic binds disappear. You\u2026.. How can you have no fears?! Even the ancient hunters had fears. They hid them well, but they had them. She said. You walk up to her. Stay back! She said as she makes purple wall. You take one step and walk right thought it. How?! She said as she makes another. You walk right through that one. Y\u2026..You\u2026\u2026can\u2019t be just an ordinary hunter. She said before you grab her and struggles in your grip. She starts punching you in the face, but her hits has no effect on you. You ball up your hand and punch through her heart. You toss her aside and continue onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head in deeper, you can feel the magic get stronger. As you check your surroundings, you see a black smoke wrap around your body. The upper half of the smoke manifests into a woman who puts her hand on your cheek. You see that she\u2019s naked as well. She stares right into your eyes with her bright red eyes. Shhhhh. This won\u2019t hurt a bit. She said. Her hand glows as she moves it to your fore head. Hmm. Buried deep. No matter. She said. She plants a kiss on your lips. (Be mine. Forever). She said in your head. You breathe in through your nose and breathe out black fire into her. The fire completely incinerates her. You wipe your mouth from her kiss and head in. You continue your search. You notice that there isn\u2019t a lot of witches her. Everywhere else they are left and right, but here, they are few. You continue to walk until you are engulfed in a purple light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmph. The should do it. A figure said. The smoke clears and the figure sees you are still standing there and your clothes are tattered and singed. Impressive\u2026.. The person said. You snap your fingers and your clothes are replaced with a black leather duster and black jeans. You see the figure steps out of the shadows. To survive that, you must be a hunter. She said. You feel the magic in her is great. If you\u2019re wondering why there aren\u2019t that many of us, it\u2019s because that we work the closest to the dark. She said. She disappears and reappears next to you. She grabs your arm before you could attack. Take my advice and go home, hunter. She said. You force her up against the wall. \u2026..Valcouse. You said. The forbidden spell? Who? She said. \u2026..Tell me how to beat it. You said. Nothing less than a complete beating will suffice. She said. You ease up off her. You\u2019ve encountered the person before. No amount of preparation will help. It all comes down to who is stronger. She said. You give her a swift gut check. \u2026..I\u2019ll be back for you later. You said. You head back to the entrance. I can\u2019t focus on hunting knowing that spell is still active. Nothing less of a complete beating, huh? This started with a fight, it will end with a fight. But she thinks I\u2019m dead. One sure fire way to get a witch\u2019s attention is a high magic output. You said. You shrink back down and focus all of your magic in and around you. The concentration of magic grows stronger and stronger that an aura has appeared around you. You concentrate for a few more seconds then drop it. That should be a big signal she can\u2019t ignore. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait a few seconds before Jess just appears right in front of you. You! But\u2026..! She said. Dead? No. You\u2019re using a spell that is forbidden for a reason. You said. So? She said. You have no idea what that spell will do to you. You said. I know what it will do! It will help me put you down for good this time! She said as she charges at you. You catch her fist and punch her back. I\u2019m giving you a chance to quit using the spell before I make you. You said. Ok. Everybody deserves one. She said as she got back up. Don\u2019t be stupid. Seal the spell and I won\u2019t have to knock you unconscious for the next 6 months. You said. Never! This spell was made to counter you hunters. And I\u2019m going to use it to its fullest potential. She said. The I guess I have to beat you silly. You said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She comes at you again, but you side step her and shove her face first into the ground. When she gets up, she has an angry look on her face. Why you\u2026.! She said. She disappears and reappears right in front of you with her arm pulled back. You catch her fist and rip her arm off. ARGHHHHHH! She shouts. She stumbles and lets the magic regenerate her arm. That\u2019s as nice as I\u2019m going to be if you don\u2019t quit. You said. NEVER! I don\u2019t know how you got so good, but I\u2019ll make sure you stay dead this time!! She said. Her arm fully regenerates and transforms into a blade. This time\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll cut you into pieces! She said. She charges at you. You side step her attack and kick her in the head. Jess goes to slice your head off, but you grab the blade and toss her into the air. You jump into the and punch her down into the ground. Jess crashes into the ground hard. You land on the ground and see the impact made a hole in the ground. You look in the hole for a second and see jess jump out and comes down on you. Jess sees that you are gone. Where\u2019d that coward go?! She said. You reappear behind her. Sercost. You said. You punch her in the chest and she explodes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the smoke clears, you see she\u2019s gone. (So that\u2019s one of the witch hunter\u2019s spell? Potent.) You thought. You turn around and do a round house kick her. Jess lands on her back and slowly tries to get up. H\u2026How? I had you\u2026..on the ropes last time\u2026.. She said. Don\u2019t you see? A witch hunter learns and gets better with each engagement they are in. Valcouse is a dangerous spell to us, but that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t ready to face it. You might kill some novice hunters, but you won\u2019t top a seasoned hunter. You said. Are\u2026.you implying\u2026..that you hunters are\u2026..better? She said. Look at the ratio. How many of your kind do we kill before you can kill one of us? We watch, we wait, we plan, and execute with things going our way 99% of the time. You said. So\u2026\u2026you\u2019re telling me\u2026..that I did all\u2026\u2026this still to come runner up? She said. You did. No amount of training or preparation will help against a hunter. Now. One last time. Seal the spell. You said. After a few seconds of silence, Jess stands back up. My sister was right. You hunters are arrogant. She said. (What\u2019s she doing?) You thought. You think just because things go your way or you can kill hundreds of us, that you can do whatever you want. You want to know why there aren\u2019t as many hunters as there was back then? They let their egos get the better of them. You hunters are nothing but soulless monsters who spread misery and anger wherever you go! How many lives did you think you destroyed then you murdered Damon? More than one!! And not even an apology. Wouldn\u2019t have solve anything, but it would have shown you had a heart. She said. If you want someone to blame, blame him. He decided to get in the way of my attack. You said. See. Just like I said. Anyone but you. You hunter don\u2019t know when to own up to your own mistakes! Yeah, I used the forbidden spell, but if anyone saw you how you hunters are, they\u2019d justify me. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you done ranting? She said. Yeah. I\u2019m done talking, but not fighting. I wasn\u2019t around to see the downfall of the hunters, but I can see the death of a hunter right in front of me! She said. Jess comes at you full tilt. You idiot! You said. You grab the blade and rip it off. The strength you use to rip it off sends jess into the and you throw the blade and it impales her right in the heart. Ugh\u2026\u2026 She said. You walk up to her. You know, for everything that you did to me, I was never planning on killing you. You said. Please\u2026..who are you trying to fool? You\u2019re\u2026\u2026.no different than the\u2026\u2026rest of them. All hunter\u2026..are killers. You got what you wanted. At least\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll\u2026..be\u2026..reunited with Damon. She said before her head hangs low. You check her and get no pulse. You take out the blade and it turns back to her right arm. As her body falls lifeless to the ground, you take a moment to look at her corpse. You grab Jess\u2019s body and carry it outside. As you carry her, it becomes nighttime and the moon hangs high. You head to the barren area and bury her in the middle of the impact area. As soon as you look at her grave, a beam of moon light shines down on her grave. You walk away into the darkness of night. <br>\r\n2 days later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out of building and head down the street. As you walk, you feel a presence. I know that\u2019s you, Hiro. You said. Out of thin air, you see Hiro appear in his black ninja outfit. It\u2019s been a long time Alex. He said. Six months. I thought you were in Hiroshima. You said. I\u2019ve been back. Watching you. I saw you kill Mikuzi. He said. She let loose a forbidden spell. You said. Valcouse. I didn\u2019t want to believe it, but when I saw you bury the witch\u2019s body, I knew it was true. He said. Since when do we allow women to be witch hunter? You said. It a rare occasion. We\u2019re pretty skeptical about letting one become a hunter. That\u2019s why they are subjected to even more rigorous requirements. He said. Well we need to do background checks of them. You said. Speaking of them, you haven\u2019t killed a witch in the past two days. He said. I know we don\u2019t give into our feelings, but I\u2019ve been down lately. I killed a witch, but I felt different about her. You said. How many times have you encountered her? He said. Multiple. You said. You killed your rival. He said. Rival? You said. Each hunter has one. Witches who we come across multiple times. He said. I must have respected her then. I gave her a proper burial. You said. Showing respect to a witch. Shows how far we come. You know what the ancient hunters did to witches? Desecrate them. He said. Didn\u2019t you do something to your rival as well? You said. I place a yellow flower on her body. He said. We\u2019re nothing like the ancient hunters. They killed witches and didn\u2019t shed a tear. We kill them and give them burials and stuff. Are we really hunters? You said. We are. We just don\u2019t follow in the old hunter\u2019s footsteps. He said. So it\u2019s ok to show respect to them? You said. If you\u2019re going to respect them, you might as well be their slave. He said. Never again. You said. Then you\u2019re a hunter. He said. Hiro walks a few feet away then stops. You know her friends will be after you. And one of them is 1:00 clock high. He said. You form a black magical ball in your hand and throw it to where Hiro said. The ball hits the building and explodes on impact. I know they will be after me. They have been since I\u2019ve met them. You said. Choose what type of person you are before it\u2019s done for you. One more thing. Do not go hunting tomorrow. It\u2019s that time. Hiro said before vanishing in black smoke. Time to see if I\u2019m a hunter or not. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou disappear and reappear at your hideout. You look at your table and see your equipment. You holster your guns and put on your mechanical wrist blade. You press the button on the side and the 10 10 inch blade shoots out. The blade glows purple from the magic you infused in it. Ok. I\u2019m ready. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a contact from a source to meet you in a private area. You arrive at the destination. Before you go in, you put your hand on the wall. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be this sluggish. Best to finish this contract and head home. You said. You go inside. You walk around and see that the area is dark. You grab a red flare, take off the cap, pop it, and throw it in the center of the room. (This should flush her out.) You thought. After a few seconds, you see her coming stand next to the flare. Hmm. I guess you shadows don\u2019t burn when expose to bright light. You said. She doesn\u2019t have that dull look on her face, but she\u2019s looking at you with a look of hatred. My sister\u2026.. What did you do to her? She said. What makes you think- I asked you question! She interrupts. Nothing. You said. Is she dead? She said. You hesitate on that one. Did you kill her?! She said. You remain quiet on that one. You just couldn\u2019t let her live, could you? You hunters are monsters! Never stopping to think about how your actions!! Death, misery, sadness, and despair where ever you go! If i knew this was going to happen, I\u2019d kill you when I first saw you! I won\u2019t make that mistake again! She said. The flare starts to dim then it goes out. I\u2019ll make sure you pay for this!! She said.</span></div></div>",

Then you feel something wrap around your waist. Then you see a set of eyes. Acting quickly, you get an arm free and pop a flare. The sudden brightness pushes her back. You attack her and slam her face into the wall. Ow! You\u2019ll pay!! She said. She pushes you into the wall and her nails turn to claws. She slashes high and you block her attack. You punch her back and hit her with a flurry of punches. She grabs one of your punches and slams you into the ground. You roll out the way before she can curb stomp your head. You see the flare go out and the room goes back dark. You lose sight of her in the pitch blackness. You walk carefully until you sense something. You move to your left and hear a gunshot. (Where the fuck is he?!) You thought. You pull out your gun and shot up. The bullet ricochet until you hear a grunt. (Far right!) You thought. You dash to your far right and run someone into the hard wall. You punch the person through the wall. Before you could breathe, you feel someone\u2019s hand around your throat and lift you up. You pop a flare to see it\u2019s Dimitri. Get off me, Ivan! You said. You kick him hard and he lets go. You go for another, but the shadow grabs your fist midflight. Her grip felt tighter than last time. She tosses you into the wall. She walks over to you and you blind side her with a slap to the face. The force makes her stumble back to the flare. She crushes the flare and the room goes back dark. (That was my last flare.) You thought. You try to sense them out, but can\u2019t feel anything. ( Oh no.) You thought. You duck down and dodge an attack. You keep guessing and moving until you take a random shot and feel your fist hit someone\u2019s head. Taking advantage of your luck, you keep attacking in all directions until you feel your arms being held back. You are brutally slammed into the ground and thrown into the wall. The force you were thrown with knocks the lights back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn. You said he\u2019d be weak. Ass hits like a freight train. Dan said. It\u2019s a gradual thing. As the day goes on, he gets weaker. The shadow said. Shouldn\u2019t we have waited until night? Gale said. Then he\u2019d be able to hide to morning. She said. He\u2019s not moving. You think\u2026. Zeke said. Go check. Gale said. Fuck no! Zeke said. Sasha. You go. Gale said. Very heroic. Dimitri said. You so brave giant? You go.  Dan said. Dimitri walks over your knell over body and places two fingers on your neck. Well? Dan said. I don\u2019t feel a pulse. He said. Just as he said that, you stab him in a non-vital spot. You stand up straight. Signa de falon. You said. You toss him with force into everyone else. Only Sasha is able to move fast enough. When Dimitri hit everyone, they were confined in dark spheres. You! What did you do?! She said. Keeping your friends in place. She said. When she goes to touch one of the spheres, it shakes violently. You don\u2019t want to do that. Those things are volatile. You said. I should have known you play dirty. She said. This is a fight. Not some contest. If you fight someone on equal grounds, you must be the dumbest person on the planet. You said. You hunters are still fight underhandedly. All of you know you could never beat us fair. She said. Hmph. Fair is something you take your kids to. I\u2019m out to win. And here I thought a shadow would understand. She said. I understand. Understand that your blood will stain these walls! She said. I\u2019d be more threatened if you were towering over me, but not by much. Someone who doesn\u2019t understand the premise of a fight should go home and watch their soap stories. You said. I\u2019ll kill you!! She said as she rushed at you. When she slashes at your midsection, her nails past through you. She sees a smile on your face as your upper half is separated from your lower half. Heh. Your turn. You said as you disappear in a puff of black smoke. Stunned, Sasha is blindsided by you stabbing her in the heart. She falls onto her knees as you hold the blade to her throat. You didn\u2019t pierce her heart fully, so she wasn\u2019t dead, just mortally wounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo on. Do it. Do what you accursed hunters always do. She said. Any other time, it would be easy, but you hesitate on the final strike. What\u2019s the hold up? End me so I can join my sister. She said. (Why\u2026..am I hesitating? She\u2019s a witch. I should be able kill her. But do I really want to?) You thought. You remember everything that you learned about the hunters and what luke  and Hiro told you. (I took an oath! To kill them! I will not be their slave!) You thought. Then you remember all the horrible things you heard about the, and what Jess told you. (Am I that cold? The promise I made.) You thought. What are you waiting for?! You\u2019re a hunter, aren\u2019t you!? So do it! Kill me!!! She said. You are a hunter, but can you be like the ancient hunters? Cold hearted killers who never shed a tear? Who killed anyone associated with witches? (Am I a hunter?!) You thought. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t plan on atoning for them behind a cell door or on your terms. You said as you take off the gauntlets and toss them at her and walk away. If you run, you know I\u2019ll find you. She said. No. You won\u2019t. You said as you disappeared. You reappeared near the coast. You wait a few minutes before a boat pulls up. How much do I owe? You said. Depends on how far you want to go? He said. \u2026\u2026Britain. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 days later in the UK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave a pub after a long line of contracts. Hey, Duff! Whatever you did this time with the beers, write it down. You almost made me buy you out. You said. You leave the merrymaking of the pub and walk down the night light lit streets. You stop to lit your cigarette. You take one puff and  toss it in the air. You grab the person behind you and hold your gun to his head. He\u2019s wearing a gas mask and all black. (SAS?) You thought. Then you feel a gun to your head. Drop it! He said. You leg sweep him and he falls down and you put your boot on his chest. (These guys look like SAS, but I don\u2019t see the winged dagger patch on them.) You thought. Then you feel multiple bullets go through you. You turn around to see another on holding a p90. Really? You said. You disappear and reappear in front of him, grab him by the throat and hoist him up. I don\u2019t like being shot. You said. Drop \u2018em, Alex. They\u2019re just working stiffs. A voice said. You turn to see Gavin in his trench coat. Gavin. Give me a sec. I\u2019m about to turn a man inside out. You said. As much as I\u2019d like to see that, don\u2019t. These arsese are with me. He said. You let go of the man and he gasps for air. Still hunting? You said. Yeah. It\u2019s went from a hobby to a routine. He said. I thought you worked alone. You\u2019re adamant about it. You said. I do. But I\u2019ll tell you why when we don\u2019t have prying eyes. He said. Are you sure you want\u2026\u2026regulars with you? They\u2019ll get in the way. You said. Don\u2019t remind me. This is the ninth squad this month. He said. So they are ok with you being a witch hunter? You said. Ok? I think the UK is the only place that looks at us in a good light. We\u2019re basically heroes here. He said. Heroes, huh. Knowing that you were prone to your anger and went on a massacre? You said. I was young and inexperienced then. He said. This is a small band to go out hunting with. You need at least a village of regulars. You said. Ok. You\u2019ve seen through it. Gavin said. With a wave of his hand, time all around you both stops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. Real talk. Witch hunting in UK is sanctioned by the government. He said. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m not finding any around. Does that get in your way? You said. Not really. I get to the witches before they do. Pisses them off good. He said. It should. Hunting witches is no joke. You know what happened last time regulars hunted witches? You said. Yeah. The towns population dwindled to 25 people. Anyway, I said it went from a hobby to routine. I lied. These SAS wannabes have my sister. He said. Stell? You said. Yeah. I\u2019m telling you this in the strictest of confidence. She\u2019s a witch. He said. Stell? A witch? You said. I know. Shocking. He said. So\u2026..what do we do about it? You said. Hunter code is to kill witches. Hard to do when that witch is your sister. She\u2019s not cruel like the others. She\u2019s one of the rare ones. Wouldn\u2019t harm a fly or anyone. He said. Does she use her magic? You said. Rarely. Only if she has to. They\u2019ve been using her to find other witches. Threaten to kill her if I didn\u2019t hunt under them. He said. How would they? You said. I\u2019m not taking chances while they have her, so I have to play nice. Alex. It\u2019s rare for a witch hunter to do this, but I\u2019m coming at you as a man who\u2019s at the end of his rope. Help me get Stella away from them. He said. Stell\u2019s always been nice to me and luke. We\u2019ll get her, Gavin. You said. That\u2019s reassuring. He said. What about these guys? You said. Play dumb for now. Assert yourself every now and then, but let them think they have control. He said. Ok. We\u2019ll play nice. For now. You said. Gavin snaps his fingers and time resumes. So what was you mission, Gavin? You said. Well, You. He said. Me? You said. Well, you didn\u2019t keep a particularly low profile. A high-profile assassination, smuggling, extortion, kidnapping, black market dealing. Need I go on? He said. No. But it pays. Look. You said. You toss Gavin a stack of ninety thousand dollars. Damn. And this is just today\u2019s take? He said. So far. So. How much to forget you three saw me today? You said. Really? Bribing? Gavin said.  It works. Come now. Do you really want to work for scraps when I can hand you each thirty thousand right now? You said. Deal! One quickly said. You hand them each thirty thousand dollars and they quickly run away. Wow. Gavin said. See. All is well. Now, let\u2019s go find Stell. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin takes you all the way to parliament. I can feel her energy in there, but I can never find her. He said. Have you tried using your nose? You said. You mean sniff her out? Tried. Every time I do, the scent is mask by a heavy odor. He said. Ok. Stay here and enjoy the sights. And I don\u2019t mean the building and historical monuments. You said as you phase through the metal gates. I\u2019m not that much of a Casanova. I get around, but not like that. Gavin said. You kick open the door and sniff the air. For one second, you have Stella\u2019s scent then it\u2019s replaced with a heavy odor. Hmm. They\u2019re masking her scent with the smell of a witch\u2019s caldron when she\u2019s making a potion. Finding her by scent is out of the question, so I\u2019ll have to give whoever\u2019s in charge a good scare. You said. You walk around until you find the Prime minister\u2019s office. Candy gram! You said as you boot the door down. The hell?! A middle-aged man in a dark blue suit said. Oh. You must be Devil Dog. He said. The one and only. You said. You being here means only one thing. Who hired you? Whatever they are paying you, I\u2019ll triple it. He said. I\u2019m not here to kill you, prime, but I\u2019ll hurt you if you don\u2019t listen. You said. What? He said. A friend of mine said you took a certain someone from him. You said. Gavin\u2026. If you met him, he must have told you about the hunts. He said. He did. Only a hunter can find a witch. How are you regulars doing it? You said. You already know. He said. I do. So you know the dangers of the hunt. Do you know what happened last time regular people hunted witches? The entire tow dwindled to only twenty-five people. A bustling town was reduced to a ghost town. The UK\u2019s a huge country for now. But the number of people will get lower and lower every time you send out people who aren\u2019t hunters to hunt. Do you want the UK to become a shell of its self? You said. Ok! Ok! We\u2019ll leave the hunts to the professionals. He said. Good. Now, where is she? The secret bunker in the lounge. He said. Good. That scent better be gone when I get there. You said. You head to the lounge area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, the odor is gone. Nice. Now where is she? You said. You sniff and catch the scent. Behind this huge as bookcase. You said. You punch down the wall and walk into the bunker. You can hear the soft humming of a female voice. Further in. You said. You keep going until you come across a huge, heavy door. You grip the door and pry it open. Stell! You in here? You said. Alex? She said. You see Stella come out from the shadows. Alex! Stella said. Stell always dressed up in normal clothes than wearing her witch attire. But you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell back then. Stell. Still looking young and still haven\u2019t cut that waist length hair. It\u2019s still blue? You said. Well, yes. I told you last time I used permanent dye. But where\u2019s Gavin? She said. He\u2019s waiting outside for you. Your time being a detector is over. You said. Then come on. She said as she lowers her hand. Stell, you know how I feel about that. You said. Alex, have I ever given you a reason not to trust me? She said. No, but still. You said. Alex. She said. Hesitantly, you step onto Stella\u2019s hand and she lifts you up eye level. You look deep into her emerald green eyes. (Why are the nice ones with the bad guys?) You thought. See? Uninjured. Are we going to do this every time? She said. \u2026\u2026It\u2019s a trust thing. You said. Stella walks out of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella! Gavin said as Stella puts you on the ground. See. Told you I\u2019d get her out. You said. Did you lean on him? He said. The prime? Yeah. Just rattled him. I didn\u2019t put the fear of God in him. You said. Or the fear of witches. Stella said. So Gavin, how many did you charm? You said. I\u2026.don\u2019t understand. He said. Come on, Gavin. Everyone knows you\u2019re a charmer. You said. And it\u2019s sickening. Stella said. \u2026..Ten ladies while you were in there. He said. You are such a playboy. Stella said. What\u2019s you secret? The English gentlemen approach? You said. Uh\u2026.Before I find myself in a world of trouble, how about you stay a while? Gan said while sweating. I guess I could. It\u2019s going to take two people to make sure you don\u2019t lose your shit. You said. I\u2019m\u2026.not that much of troublemaker. He said. The incident at the pub, the massacre through Boston. You said. The partial destruction of Big Ben, destruction of the oldest building in the UK. Need we go on? Stella said. No\u2026. I\u2019ve heard enough. Gavin said defeated. Good. Now let\u2019s show a pretty lady a good time. You said. You compliment made Stella blush red as a tomato. After you, m\u2019lady. You said. Such a gentleman. She said. And when I do it, I get a stern lecture. Gavin said. That\u2019s because she your sister and she cares. She\u2019s just looking out for her brother. You said. I guess a protective sister is better than a sister who treats me like trash. He said.</span></div></div>",

Home. I\u2019m finally home. You said. You walk around the debris of o district. It was a bad place before I left. Nothing\u2019s change. I wonder if m district has changed any. You said. You head to m district. When you get there, you see army vehicles on the move. The m district army is still kicking. Won\u2019t go down so easily. You said. You walk through the streets of m district and it\u2019s not the warmest feeling you get. I get the feeling that I\u2019m not welcomed around here. You said. Am I getting old? Is that Devil Dog? A voice said. Come on, Luke. That shadow talk doesn\u2019t scare me anymore. You said. Worth a shot. He said as he appears in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke. You haven\u2019t changed a bit. You said. Neither have you. I\u2019m guessing your hunt is over? He said. I wouldn\u2019t say over. Just postpone. By the way, Stell said hi. You said. Stella. I haven\u2019t seen her in years. Gavin still a lady\u2019s man? Luke said. Still. Don\u2019t know his secret, but he knows how to charm a woman. You said. He always had a way with those gargantuans. Luke said. Relax, Luke. They aren\u2019t all bad. You said. I guess\u2026. Luke said. So have you been hunting? You said. Yeah. But I don\u2019t take as long as you do. He said. Oh. Jokes now. Remember who saved you from that first witch when we were slaves? You said. Key word \u201dwhen\u201d. He said. You look on Luke\u2019s finger and see a ring on it. Oh my God. Luke are you\u2026..! You said. I was hoping you wouldn\u2019t notice. He said. Oh my God! You\u2019re engaged! Who\u2019s brave enough to coral you? You said. \u2026.You know who. He said. That cute little blonde girl?! Oh my! Luke\u2019s getting married, everyone! You said. Yeah, get it out of your system. Luke said annoyed. Did you tell her about your skull collection? You said. No. He said. You put your arm around luke. You pull out your phone and take a picture. \u201cBest man and soon to be groom!!\u201d will be the title of this. You said. I\u2019m friends with you because? He said. Because me and you go together. You said. You said with a smile. Right. He said. Well, how long have the two of you been seeing each other? You said. Ever since you left. He said. Awww. I can already see little Lukes running around. You said. Don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t thought about adding your skull to my collection. Luke said. You know you wouldn\u2019t. Now come on. You said. Where are you taking me? He said. You\u2019re getting married. You need to have at least one good night on the town. You said. You know how I feel about socializing. He said. Not hearing it. We going to paint the town red! You said. Oh boy\u2026.. Luke said defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day turned to night, you and luke are stumbling through the streets, reeling from your good times. Ok. I\u2019ll admit\u2026\u2026 I had a blast! Luke said. Told you. 40 glasses of beer AND vodka and still can see straight. You said. I have a high tolerance. Luke said. Any ordinary person would have succumbed to alcohol poison. You said. I\u2019m not ordinary. Far from it. Luke said. Luke howls at the moon. I feel great!! I feel like I\u2019m the king of the world!! He said. I\u2019ll say. A beautiful girl, a proficient hunter, and carrying more than five thousand dollars. You said. I\u2019m dangerous at a game of Blackjack. I never bust. He said. So lively. I like this version of luke. You said. As you and luke get closer to where his fianc\u00e9, you see blood on the ground. Blood. Too big of splash to be a man. You said. You think it\u2019s that time of the month? You said. Can\u2019t be. There\u2019s a trail of it. Luke said. Dare you to taste it. You said. Ok. With any luck, I\u2019ll be able to tell who. Luke said. Luke taste the blood. Well, detective? You said. It\u2019s AB type. Just like\u2026.. Luke pauses. You don\u2019t think\u2026. You said. Luke runs ahead, following the blood trail and you do to. At the end of the trail, you see luke kneeling down next to a blonde woman\u2019s bloody corpse. Is\u2026..is that\u2026.. You said. \u2026\u2026.Leave. Luke said. Luke\u2026\u2026 You said. LEAVE!!!! He shouts. With the rcho ringing in your ear, you leave luke alone to grieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold up in the old hideout you and luke set up when you both escaped. After hours of waiting, you see luke come walking in. Even though he\u2019s hiding it, you can tell he\u2019s been crying. Luke\u2026\u2026 Do you want to talk? You said. No. Every time we get a shred of happiness, those vultures come and take it. They take our lives, our dignity, our self-respect and esteem, and anyone we dare love. No more. NO MORE!!! Summon the other hunters. Luke said. Luke\u2026.. Think for a second. If we do this, there\u2019s no going back. You said. Just do it!! He shouts. You concentrate and mentally connect t the other hunters and tell them to come to America. In a second, all the hunters appear at your hideout. What\u2019s going on? Gavin said. Yeah. I what in ze middle of a good kill. Han said. Hunters. For too long have we taken the oppression of the witches. They made slaves out of us, but we broke free and hunt them down! But does they stop them? They continue to take and take and take. For some, it was honor. For some, it was dignity. And others were a lot more personal. Luke said. (He really wants this to happen if he\u2019s appealing to what was taken from them.) You thought. How much more will they take from us? Until we\u2019re old and senile? Well, I for one, am done with it. I say we follow in the footsteps of our witch hunter ancestors and late elven allies and wage war on those bitches! Luke said. War?! Everyone said. Luke, our numbers aren\u2019t as great as they were. We can\u2019t possible wage a war against them. Gavin said. Have you forgotten the ratio of that? We kill hundreds of them before they kill one of us. Besides, I can't be the only who doesn\u2019t dream of the day when they are no more witches. Hiro. They took everything from you. Family, your prestige, the fear your name had. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re content with staying in the shadows. Luke said. \u2026\u2026They took my life from me. I have nothing to lose. He said. You don\u2019t. Hans. From one hunter to another. You aren\u2019t the only one who\u2019s lost a love one to them. Luke said. Mein buttercup. Mein sweet, beautiful buttercup\u2026.. !!!Hans said while breaking down. What if you find love again, Hans? Do you want her to fall victim to them? Luke said. *Sniff* No! If I manage to find the sweetness of love again, they will NOT take it from me again! Hans said. Gavin. I know why you are such a ladies man. Those bitches destroyed you. Took away your self-respect and esteem. Made you feel like shit. Made you think you wouldn\u2019t be anything. Do you want them to be right? Luke said. No. I never want to feel that worthless again. He said. We\u2019ve all been wronged by them. All of us. From Hiro\u2019s lost past to Dub\u2019s lost child. Luke said. They took him right from me, they did. Never seen my child again. Dud said with his Irish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buck stops here. No more. They\u2019ve taken from us for the last time. We might be fewer in number, sure. But we are the apex predator! Witch hunters have no equals! Raise your weapons or fists in the air if you want the witch scourge to end! Luke said. All the hunters raise their weapons in the high. Then it\u2019s war!!! Go. Go to your home country or wherever there is a witch presence. Hunt them, kill them. Make them regret they are witches! Etch your name in their blood! We will achieve our ancestors dream! A world without witches!! Luke shouts. A world without witches!! Everyone shouts. With deadly determination, all the hunters disappear back to where they came from. So it\u2019s war. There will be a lot of death. You said. To be expect of the witches. Luke said. Not them. I mean civilians. There will be lots of civilians killed in this war. You said. A trifle matter. Come. We have witches to hunt. Luke said.</span></div></div>",

You said. Like every other day, well. He said. How many? You said. Are you still concern about those civilians? Luke said. Yes. I became a hunter to kill witches, not people. You said. You say nothing when you\u2019re bounty hunting. Luke said. That\u2019s because I\u2019m paid to kill. I\u2019m not being paid to kill this time. So excuse me if my conscious is getting the better of me when I see hundreds of people die in one engagement with a witch. You said. You\u2019re being melodramatic. Luke said. Really? When we were in m district last month, we fought two witch. A magic attack missed me and incinerate a building. Killed one hundred people. When you did stomped the ground and the ground shock and split open, it consumed a m district army base. Kill four hundred soldiers. We are killing the population as we war with them. THAT\u2019S a fact. So don\u2019t tell me I\u2019m being fucking melodramatic! You said. If only you direct that anger to the witches. You\u2019d be a deadly adversary. Luke said. I\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m pissed! We\u2019ve been at this stupid war for three whole months! We did more damage to our own kind in two hours than what those damn preteens do in a day! You said. What do you think war\u2019s about? Holding hands and being friends? If that was the case, we\u2019d be buddy buddy with those bitches. I told you from day one that the life of a witch hunter is filled with being hated and alone. Luke said. With the fucking witches! But what about our own?! If we aren\u2019t accepted by our own kind, then where are we accepted? You said. Is that what this is about?! Being accepted by people who\u2019d rather live in fear than having the guts to stand up for themselves?! Luke said. We were the same way, luke! You said. But we did something about it! We carved out our own future! Not have it dictated to us like we\u2019re some mindless slave! Luke said. So that\u2019s it?! That\u2019s our future?! We\u2019re destined to be alone and hated in the world? Not having anyone give a rat\u2019s ass about us?! To just be feared, hated, and reviled everywhere we go?! You said. It\u2019s better than living in servitude for the rest of your life! Luke said. Well, if hated is what we\u2019re destined for, then let\u2019s be hated! You said as you stormed out. Alex! Luke said as he followed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop when you get to a army base. What are you doing?! Luke said. The only thing we\u2019re destined for, right? Iku ba se bella! You said. You throw a purple ball of magically energy at the base and it blows up like a nuclear explosion. The fuck\u2019s gotten into you?! Luke said Just being what us hunters are. Hated! You said as you storm off again. You stop when you come to a populated part of m district. Diam sol! You said. You smash the ground and a violent earthquake tears apart the place. Building collapse and crumble down; crushing cars, people, and anything else. Is this making you feel better?! Luke said. Only doing what we\u2019re fucking destined to be. Why stop at war with witches? When we\u2019re done, we can terrorize the public! You said. Ok. You\u2019re out of control! Luke said. Control?! Coming from the guy who wanted to pick a war with the witches! You said. At least I\u2019m doing something about them! You\u2019d rather being their slave! But who am I kidding? You are just like you\u2019re father. Luke said. That\u2019s when you punch luke hard in the face. Hard enough that he goes flying all the way to f district ruins. You disappear and reappear right to where luke is lying. You listen to me good. I am NOTHING like my father. I became a hunter to get away from them. To make a new life. Just because every other hunter wants to live a lonesome life doesn\u2019t mean I want to. The only fucking reason I haven\u2019t ripped you apart is because you\u2019re the only person who I called a friend in this world. I\u2019ll be a part of your damn war, but after that, you live how you want, and I\u2019ll live how I want. You said before disappearing and reappearing back at the hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 months later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since you hit luke, the two of you have been avoiding each other. The only time you two even are together is when you\u2019re out fighting, but even then, you two don\u2019t talk to each other. When nighttime comes, you see a visage of all of the hunters. How goes it? Luke said. Good on my end. Been killing left and right. Gavin said. I too am slaying my fair share of witches. Hiro said. I\u2019ve etched not only my name in their blood, but also mien Buttercup\u2019s name! Hans said. All the other hunters go on about how their part of the war goes. Civilians casualties? You said. High. Gavin said. Death speads to everyone here. Hiro said. Ze population is getting smaller by the day over her. Hans said. Like a plague. Dub said. Fuck. You said. We actually might see an end to this. Gavin said. What do you mean? Luke said. The higher up witches came together to address this problem about us and all of them are in agreement with their solution. Hans said. Which is? You said. There best vs our best. Whoever comes out on top wins this war. Gavin said. Who\u2019s there ace? You said. Leah. Hiro said. Wait. The Leah?! The spawn of Lilith?! Hans said. Who\u2019s Lilith? You said. The worse of all the witches. Mean, cruel, evil, nasty, but all powerful. Only one hunter could match her. Gavin said. Who? Luke said. Argus. But he\u2019s long dead. Hiro said. So who\u2019s going in? We\u2019re all good, but we need someone on their A game if we fight Lilith\u2019s daughter. Dub said. Luke has the highest kill count and knows the all the spells. Gavin said. Ja. Luke should go in. Hans said. No. Alex is going. What?! Everyone said. Why me?! You said. Yeah. Why Alex? Even though he\u2019s a true hunter, he\u2019s still the newest hunter. Gavin said. Listen. I know this will sound crazy, but alex is part of Argus\u2019s family. You said. Alex?! A descendent of Argus?! Dub said. What makes you say that? Hiro said.  There was a tense moment between us. When alex hit me, I saw a power only someone related to Argus would have. Alex has the power of Argus. That\u2019s a power that will overcome any witch. Even Leah. Luke said. Alex\u2026. Hiro said. I don\u2019t see what luke sees, but if it puts an end to this war, then I\u2019ll step up to the challenge. You said. I vote alex. All in favor? Luke said. If he\u2019s the actual descendent of Argus, then i vote alex. Dub said. Me too. Hans said. I too. Hiro said. All of the hunters nominate you. Then it\u2019s settled. Luke said. All of the visages disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the fuck was that lie, luke? You said. It wasn\u2019t a lie. You are a descendent of Argus. Which means you have a power that outdoes any hunter or witch. Luke said. I don\u2019t feel this power you see in me. You said. It will come. It just has to be under the right conditions. Luke said. I just want this to be over\u2026.. You said as you leave. You head further into o district. You look around at the run down area. This place is shit. You said. Then you are suddenly lifted into the air and placed in soft hands. (Oh no. She\u2019s found me before I could find her.) You thought. Devil Dog\u2026\u2026 Alex. Why? Just tell me why. Leah said. As you look deep into her eyes, you feel your heart race, but you\u2019re not scared or nervous. \u2026\u2026You wouldn\u2019t understand. You said. Understand? Understand what? That you were mistreated, used and abused, and angry? That you wanted a shred of dignity and respect? Why didn\u2019t you come to me? She said. So you can make things worse? You said. Alex, I wouldn\u2019t have done anything to you that you didn\u2019t want happen to you. Do you remember what I gave you? She said. Then yang symbol. Still have it on my hand. You said. Yes. I gave that to you to let you know that I cared about you. She said. You told me you give it to every man who you had. You said. I care for all of them, but you\u2026.. I felt something special with you.  We don\u2019t have to do this, alex. We don\u2019t have to be a part of this. Just come with me. She said. And go back to a life of servitude? No! Never again! Alex, Please! I don\u2019t want to hurt you! Leah pleaded. I\u2019ll never go back to a life as a slave. You said. You disappear and reappear on the ground. (What\u2019s this feeling? Why is my heart racing like a horse? Could I be\u2026\u2026.) You thought. Alex. Please. I don\u2019t want to fight you. Leah said. I\u2019m not going back to that life. You said. Even though leah has her head down, you see a tear roll down her cheek. \u2026\u2026.Fine. If you won\u2019t listen\u2026\u2026then \u2026..I\u2019ll drop you at death\u2019s door!! She said. With that expression said, you felt a sudden increase in her magical power. (Is it never ending?! It still hasn\u2019t hit a roof! Whatever power luke said I had better match hers!) You thought. </span></div></div>",

You thought. As you try to think up of a plan, Leah comes right at you. You barely have enough time to dodge with how fast she just moved. You had jumped high in the air and leah\u2019s fist hits the ground and makes a gigantic creator. Jesus! That\u2019s four times the size me or luke makes. It could pass as a sinkhole. You said. When leah spots you in the air, she moves her arm to the side and blue wisp coming flying at you. (She didn\u2019t even say the spell!) You thought. You deflect two of them and dodge the third one. You fall to the ground and as you do, you say the spell to grow to 100ft. Ok. I might just stand a chance. A small one, but it\u2019s a chance nonetheless. You said. As you assess the situation, you see leah has teleported behind you with her left arm pulled back. Thinking quickly, you block your face as her fist hits. You quickly go for a high kick, but leah disappears. Where is she? You said. You try to sense her, but can\u2019t. (I can\u2019t find her. Her enormous power should give away where she\u2019s at, but I can\u2019t sense it.) You thought. Then leah appears right in front of you and punches you. The force sends you flying all the way to f district. You go crashing through multiple building and come to a stop when you hit the ninth building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis isn\u2019t going well. She\u2019s covered more ground on me than any other witch I\u2019ve faced. She\u2019s putting me in a corner, but I\u2019m not out yet. You said. Before you could power out of the rubble your under, leah appears right in front of you. (Not good. I can\u2019t block any spells in this position!) You thought. Leah could have attack you right there, possibly killing you, but instead, she starts to dig you out from under the rubble. (She\u2026\u2026saving me?) You thought. Leah takes off all the heavy debris, pull you out, and hoist you up on your feet. (This witch just helped me. Why\u2019d she go out of her way to do that when she could have easily leave me there. I don\u2019t know her intentions, but I\u2019m not about to find out.) You thought. You go for a knee to the gut, but leah stops your attack dead. You struggle to get your leg free, but leah toss you through a set a buildings again. You stop when you land in the streets. She\u2019s treating me like a rag doll. I need to turn this around in my favor. You said. Before you could get up, you are shoved back down in the dirt. You feel leah place her hand on your back and feel a burning sensation. You suddenly feel weaker and sluggish. The hell you do to me?! You said. All the magic that was inside you is gone. She said. You took away my magic?! Isn\u2019t enough that you\u2019re beating me. But humiliate me as well? You said. You know that with the magic gone, the growth spell will wear off soon. (This feels like an advance seal. If it\u2019s Konbu, then I need he blood.) You thought. If this is the only way to get you to listen to me, then yes! She said. I\u2019m not buying what you\u2019re selling. You said as you manage to force her off you. Alex. You really don\u2019t want to do what you\u2019re about to do. She said. Then you don\u2019t know me at all. (I need to get her blood so I can negate this seal on my back. You said. You rush her and she easily dodges you attacks. She grabs your arm and twist it to the point of almost taking it off. Don\u2019t make me do it, Alex! She said. You quickly grab your knife and stab leah in the gut. The surprise attack makes her release you. You take you blood soaked knife and rub the blood on your left hand and place it on the seal. The seal disappears just before the growth spell was just about to wear off. Ok. Back to my normal self. And as for you\u2026.You said. You go up to leah while her back is turned. When you turn her around, she shoves her entire arm through your chest. Then she pulls her arm out and in her hand was your heart. You look at the gaping hole in your chest then collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah, still clutching your heart, walks over to your body. Alex\u2026. Goddamnit, Alex! Why?!?! Why wouldn\u2019t you just listen to me?!?! Why!?! Leah said. Leah knees down next to your body. Leah puts her hands on your body and starts to sob. While sobbing, leah sees your body start to shake for a few seconds then your eyes shoot open. Alex! Leah said. You see your heart in leah\u2019s hand. You hand moves so fast that even she couldn\u2019t see it. You place your heart back in the gaping wound and the magic coursing through you starts to quickly reconnect all the veins and arteries to the heart and quickly seals up the gaping wound. You stand back up and look at leah. Akex. Please. For all that\u2019s holy, let\u2019s stop this. We don\u2019t need to fight anymore. She said. You simply grab her by the throat and lift her up. Alex\u2026..! Leah said. Your turn. You said. You toss leah through a few building. After a few seconds, leah appears right in front of you. This time, you catch her fist. Leah disappears again and you catch her fist again. No more sneak attacks. You said. You slam her into the ground hard enough that it shakes the earth. Leah gets right back up and the marking on her right arm stat to glow. This has gone on long enough! I\u2019m done wasting breath on you! If you aren\u2019t going to listen, then maybe this will get your attention! She said. Leah starts saying an enchantment as the marks on her arm glows brighter. You watch as a giant purple seal appears in the sky. The seal is in the form of the witch symbol, which is the full moon. The seal starts to radiate with power as leah enchantment goes on until it\u2019s bright enough that the entire sky is lit with a dark purple. When leah finishes her enchantment, a huge, powerful beam comes flying at you from the seal. The beam comes roaring towards you. Even though leah was fully committed to this enchantment, she had lied to herself about not wanting to waste anymore breath on you. (Oh God! I couldn\u2019t make it less powerful!) Leah thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndeterred, you hold out your hands and the beam hits. With your newly acquired power, you force the beam back at leah. Ugh!! Not good!!! Leah said as the beam engulfs her. The beam keeps going until the seal disappears from a lack of power. You go to where leah was standing and see her on the ground covered in life threating injuries. You stand over her as she manages to open her eyes. So\u2026\u2026this is how I die\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve always imagined my death\u2026\u2026.a\u2026..peaceful one\u2026\u2026I\u2019ve lived a good five hundred and ninety nine years. I\u2019ve\u2026\u2026.achieved everything\u2026\u2026I wanted. Expect\u2026\u2026finding that one true person\u2026\u2026I wanted to\u2026..spend eternity with\u2026.and\u2026\u2026reaching you. I guess\u2026\u2026.i didn\u2019t reach\u2026\u2026far\u2026.enough. Leah said. Leah coughs out blood before she continues. I guess\u2026\u2026.first time\u2026\u2026for everything\u2026.. i didn\u2019t think\u2026..my first lost\u2026\u2026.would be my\u2026\u2026last\u2026\u2026.She said before coughing up more blood. Well\u2026\u2026.? What\u2026..the hold up? You\u2019re\u2026\u2026a\u2026\u2026witch hunter\u2026\u2026aren\u2019t you? Go on\u2026\u2026..do what hunters\u2026\u2026do best\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m ready\u2026..for death. She said. Any other witch, you\u2019d put out their misery, but leah\u2026\u2026 you couldn\u2019t. What\u2019s\u2026\u2026.keeping you? Come on\u2026\u2026.don\u2019t keep\u2026..a\u2026\u2026girl waiting. She said. You tried to steal your nerves, but couldn\u2019t. You\u2019re heart this time, wouldn\u2019t let you this time. You pick up leah\u2019s body and carry her into one of the ruined houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place her down on the couch. You check her pulse and it\u2019s a faint one. You see a few of the minor scars and bruises have healed, but the major ones are still there. Hmm. She seems to have fallen asleep. Before I do anything, I should go to luke first. You said. You shrink back down and head back to the hideout. You get to the hideout and head inside. Is it done? Luke said. Done. You said. You look\u2026.different. Luke said. I don\u2019t feel different. You said. Hmm. Looks like you did unlock your hidden power. The other hunters must be told. Luke said. I don\u2019t see what good it would do\u2026.. You said. Luke contacts the other hunters and they are here within a second. He does have a different stance about him. Gavin said. He no longer has that optimistic look. Dub said. Even though we agreed earlier, I\u2019m still not seeing it. Hans said. You still doubt, Hans? Luke said. Argus defined what a hunter should be. This isn\u2019t something that should be joked with. Hans said. Perhaps a demonstration. Argus had a special move no other hunter could do. If Alex here can do it, then he\u2019s a descendent of Argus. Luke said. No better way to decided. Hiro said. Ok, then. Show them. Luke said. Ok\u2026.. You said. You concentrate for a few seconds and feel the magic build up inside you. The magical build up gets higher and powerful to the point of the ground shaking and becomes a visible as a black aura. (Ok. Now for the hard part.) You thought. You let the magic flow all over your body. (Concentrate. Don\u2019t lose focus or control.) You thought. The aura starts to merge onto your skin. The aura takes the form of armor of a knight as it covers your body from head to toe. After another minute, you stop. Any doubters? luke said. Not anymore. Hans said. So do everyone acknowledges? Luke said. Yes. They all said. What does this all mean? You said. Means that whatever you say is law. Argus had the final say about anything among the hunters. Since you were able to do his move perfectly, whatever you say goes. Luke said. Then my first declaration is call an end to this war. Continue to hunt, but not for war. You said as the armor disappears. Understood. They all said. The hunters disappear into the shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, already make big decisions. Luke said. So we\u2019re talking again? You said. Drop it, would you? I don\u2019t hold grudges like you do. Luke said. Then why haven\u2019t we talked to each other in 2 months? You said. Because you\u2019re a stubborn asshole. Luke said. Guilty as charged. You said. </span></div></div>",

You place your hand on her four head. Hm. Temperature increase. She\u2019s running a fever. Strange. Witches are usually immune to normal aliments. You said. You see she\u2019s sweating like crazy and her breathing is rasp. Her body must be trying to compensate with her quick recovery. You said. Your hand glows purple. A purple wave shrouds leah for a few seconds then disappears. Ok. That should take care of the fever. Now all she needs is rest. You said. You leave the building to let leah recover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leave, you shrink back down. You head to m district. I have no idea how to lead the hunters\u2026.. But I know who does. You said. You cut both of your hands and let the blood drip to the ground. Dark magic of the void, hear me\u2026\u2026 I offer my blood to you as condolence to you to bring back a hunter long gone to us. The one and only. You said. The blood becomes a pool and out of it you see a white bearded man in golden armor rises from the it. He slowly opens his eyes and takes in his surrounding.   Lord Argus. You said. As he takes a step he stumbles. Easy, your leadership. It\u2019s been years since you walked the earth last. You said as you help him. Time gets us all. He said. Argus. The reason I brought you back was because I need some guidance. How do I lead the hunters? You said. The thing about hunters is that we don\u2019t have a leader. He said. But what about all the things you did? Leading the war against witches? You said. I didn\u2019t lead the hunters actually. I\u2019ll tell you what the hunters truly stood for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing all hunters had in common was slavery to those hags. What they took from us, we regain as a hunter. He said. What would that be? You said. Liberty. Freedom to do whatever we want. Freedom to be whatever we want. He said. So you never lead them in anything? You said. As head, I had the final say in any decisions we made as a group. Besides that, we all did our own thing. He said. So it\u2019s true. We are destined to live lonesome lives. You say defeated. Not necessarily. We are hated and feared, but we still try to make a life. He said. Even you? You said. Yes. When I was hit five hundred. I stopped hunting them. I walked the earth in search of a home. He said. How long did it take with everyone knowing you? You said. 4 seasons of hunting. He said. That\u2019s a long time. You said. It is. Everywhere I went, I was met with disdain and a few attempts on my life, But a hunter has tenacity down to a t. I searched until I finally found a village I could call home. He said. But is there more to being a hunter than being hated? Like love? You said. Love is a fickle thing for a hunter. Some find it, others don\u2019t. He said. So love: maybe. Acceptance: no. You said. Something like that. He said. What if that love happens to be a witch? You said. Falling in love with a witch? I laughed when I first heard that. He said. So impossible? You said. Our standards won\u2019t allow it. It\u2019s considered an act of betrayal. He said. So that would mean your golden armor is\u2026\u2026 You said. Yes. It was long before I became a hunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a knight actually. For a very powerful queen. I was her choice to deal with anyone who was against her. I was merciless, brutal, feared. He said. Doesn\u2019t sound too bad. You said. Not at first. All the glammer was after her repeated conquest for new land. For my take in them, I received this golden armor. No sword or arrow could get through. I felt like I couldn\u2019t be touched. But after she got all the land she wanted, I went from knight to service boy. I was humiliated day in and day out until I left the castle and never looked back. When I found and joined the hunters and told them of my armor, they took it as if I loved her. I told them I didn\u2019t and to prove it, I\u2019d bring back her head as proof. He said. What did it feel like? To kill your first witch? You said. It was\u2026\u2026satisfying. All those days suffered worth it as I got revenge for it. The feeling left when she cursed my armor to be locked on until the death of all witches. He said. She must have believed you\u2019d die before that. You said. She did. Doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t try for it. He said. I know a spell that could temporarily make it so the armor comes off. You said. Do you? He said. Ackbal kubal. You said. Argus\u2019s armor start to shake and suddenly breaks. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been able to take it off. He said. Come, your lordship. I have a man I want you to meet. You said. You take Argus to your hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke. Someone wants to see you. You said. If it\u2019s that bum again tell him\u2026\u2026Lord Argus?!? Luke said. Who is this bum you speak of? I may be in rags, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that bad. Argus said. N\u2026..No your lordship! Not you. Someone else. W\u2026.What or who brought you back to life. We didn\u2019t plan on your return for another three hundred years. Luke said. One of my bloodline actually did. Asked me how to lead the hunters and other stuff. Argus said. He did. Did he also take your golden armor? Luke said. No. He actually removed it. Even if it\u2019s only temporary, I can move like a young man again. Argus said. Lord Argus, you must be careful! The world isn\u2019t how it use to be. Luke said. Aw let the man have fun. That bulky suit isn\u2019t holding him back anymore. You said. Argus runs all over the place and stops after doing it the 20th time. I feel so loose. He said. Perks of not having that armor. Watch. You said. You swing at argus, but he dodges it with ease. She how quicker you are without it? You said. A lot. Even though I made due with the armor, I never feel quicker. He said. Ok! I think that\u2019s enough of endangering lord Argus for today! Or any day! Time to go back to sleep. Luke said. But he just got here. You said. No, no. Luke\u2019s right here. I\u2019ve already had my time on earth and my fair share of hunts. Time for me to let the new generation take the reins. He said. But we were going to bring you back in three hundred years anyway. You said. And I look forward to it. Now, hunter luke. I think you know what to say. Argus said. Yes, your lordship. Arbu ka cervil dorum. Luke said. A red circle appears under Argus and he sinks back into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a killjoy. You said. It isn\u2019t killjoy when preserving what Argus stood for. Luke said. Oh please. You just wanted to get on his good side. I never thought you\u2019d kiss ass. You said. I don\u2019t kiss ass. He said. Not anymore, you don\u2019t Wasn\u2019t that your thing to do when we were slaves? You said. \u2026\u2026Asshole. Luke said. And yet, you know you love me. You said as you put your arm around him. What you call love, I call tolerate. He said. Hehe. I know you\u2019re just saying that because you don\u2019t want to show emotions. You said. And don\u2019t forget that. He said. </span></div></div>",

It\u2019s his buried valuables. He should dig it up. You said. As you dig, you toss a purple spiked magic ball behind you. When you don\u2019t hear an explosion, you already know who it is. \u2026..What do you want\u2019 Leah? I\u2019m busy. You said. Digging through garbage? She said. One man\u2019s junk is another man\u2019s treasure. But I wouldn\u2019t expect a witch to see the value in anything. Your kind don\u2019t respect anything. You said. You said. Ugh! Would you quit with that shit?! She said. No. we aren\u2019t friends. We\u2019re not associates. We aren\u2019t even two strangers. I\u2019m a hunter and you\u2019re a witch. End of story. You said. End of story my ass. You know as well as me that there is something between us. She said. Nothing is between us. Whatever spell or potion you made must be affecting your brain. You said. Then why didn\u2019t you kill me when you had the chance? She said. The reason is because you\u2019re the only one who actually gave me a challenge. Something your sisters couldn\u2019t do. You said. Bullshit! I know witch hunter kill witches no matter how good of a challenge they are. She said. Goes to show how little you know. The code said I have to kill witches. It doesn\u2019t say when I have to. You said. Then how about right now? She said. What? Now? You said. Yeah. Right now. If there is nothing between the two of us, then it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. She said. Wow. I knew witches were dumb, but this is a whole new level. Fine. If you\u2019re in that much of a rush. You said. You grow to 100ft and you were about to kill her when you stop short of punching through her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell? What\u2019s the hold up? She said. As I said before, you\u2019re the only one who gave me a challenge. Wouldn\u2019t feel right to do it outside of fighting. You said. Then let\u2019s fight. Right here and now. She said. For the love of\u2026. How long are you going to keep this up?! You said. As long as it takes. And that\u2019s a long time. We both will live for hundreds of years. And if not then, then I\u2019ll bug you in hell about it. She said. Good grief! Fine! I let you live on a whim! Happy?! You said. Not good enough. She said. Then what the hell do you want me to say?! \u201cYou\u2019re better than me\u201d? Fine. You\u2019re better than me. You said. No. Not what I want to hear. She said. What is it you want me to say?! Say it so I can say it and you can go back to your so called witch sisters. You said. I love you. She said. What?! You said shocked. Say it. I love you. She said. You have to be the most dumbest witch I\u2019ve come across. The strongest, but dumbest. You really think that I didn\u2019t kill you because I love you?! You said. What else stop you? Two times you had to kill me and both times you chickened out in the end. She said. A witch hunter loving a witch. Whatever you\u2019re smoking, keep it away from me. You said. Then either say I love you or kill me where I stand. She said. How about this. I turn and walk away and we both go on with who we are. You said. Not happening. She said. The marks on her arm glow and she cast a white light that engulfs the both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open your eyes, you see you\u2019re still standing in the same spot. Whatever cheap parlor trick you used, it didn\u2019t work. You said. Really? Look around. She said. You look around and see nothing out of the ordinary. Look really close. She said. You focus and see that time is standing still. You\u2026..stopped time? But\u2026..you\u2019re not Umbran. You said. Like you said. I\u2019m the strongest. She said. Every spell has a counter. I just need to say. You said. Not this time. There\u2019s only one way out of here and I mentioned it before. Either say I love you or kill me where I stand. She said. You\u2019re going to hold me hostage just to say three words?! You\u2019re so petty. You said. Not like you were doing anything important to begin with. Now either say it or kill me. She said. You\u2019re a real pain. Bugging the hell out of me, demanding me to say I love you or kill you, stopping time just get your damn point across. A witch true and true. I see why we kill your kind. You said. So\u2026.. Are you going to kill me or ramble on like a jackass? She said. You know what\u2026.. If it puts your mind at ease and gets you off my back, fine. I love you. Happy?! You said. All I needed to hear. She said. Leah snaps her fingers and time continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere. I said it. Now get lost! You said. Not yet. She said. What now?! What more do you want?! You said. Leah pulls you towards her and kisses you. After struggling for a few seconds, you push her off you. What the fuck\u2019s your problem today?! It\u2019s called affection. Something two lovers do. She said. You\u2019re sick! I\u2019m a hunter and you\u2019re a damn witch! She said. And? She said. We kill your kind. Kill! Not love! You said. Oh. Well then kill me. She said. Would you quit sounding so nonchalant about it?! Why do you keep doing that? You said. Because I know you won\u2019t kill me. If you haven\u2019t by now, then you\u2019re not going to. She said. You sound so damn sure about. How do you know I\u2019m not just keeping you alive for fun? You said. Because you\u2019re not fucked up in the head. If you wanted to kill, you\u2019d kill. Plain as that. She said. If you\u2019ve forgotten, I\u2019m a hunter! We\u2019re all fucked up in the head in our own ways. Hans writes his name in blood, Hiro cuts his targets aparts. Slowly. Gavin eats the hearts of witches he kills, and Luke collects skulls. What makes you think I\u2019m different? Because you\u2019re not like any of them. I know every single hunter that is out there. I could go and kill them, but I know that each one has been wronged by my sisters in some way. And so have you, but you don\u2019t have any sick depravities live the others. She said. Don\u2019t try and sympathizes with us or me! You have no damn idea what it\u2019s like so don\u2019t try and understand! You said. I\u2019m not! But Alex\u2026. I\u2019m willing to be that happiness you\u2019re looking for. She said. Get away from me! You said as you pushed her away. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re the strongest witch, if I see you again, I\u2019ll gut you like a pig! You said before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappreared next to the hideout and shrink back down. You go inside. Luke! Luke!! LUKE!!! You shout. Jeez\u2026.. I\u2019m right here. No need to fucking shout. Luke said as he appears next to you. What\u2019s got you all worked up? He said. Leah. She came to me. Demanding to know why I didn\u2019t kill Her and- You didn\u2019t kill her? Luke interrupts. Let me finish! She demanded to know why and came to the conclusion that I loved her because I didn\u2019t kill her. You said. \u2026\u2026Well do you? Luke said. No! I mean\u2026\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say love love but\u2026. It\u2019s a yes or no question. Luke interrupts. Fine. \u2026..I do. I feel like you when you meet the one you liked. I\u2019m usually disgusted or not interested, but leah\u2026\u2026 She was the only one to show me respect and kindness. She showed me more in one day than I\u2019ve gotten in years. Is it that bad to be in love with a witch? You said. \u2026\u2026It is. Alex. You\u2019re a hunter. A hunter can\u2019t love the thing he hunt. If we\u2019d love them, we\u2019d stay in slavery. He said. But she\u2019s not like those other bitches. She really cares. Look. You said. You show look the yang symbol on your hand. She gave that to me. A gift from her. A gift! This one thing is 100x better than what the other witches gave us. Remember how they kill us for fun then quickly revive us? You said. That was annoying as hell. Just when you think you\u2019ve gotten the sweet release, they pull you back. He said. Leah\u2019s not that cruel. In fact, I don\u2019t think she can be cruel or mean even if she wanted to. Isn\u2019t there some way around our code? You said. Well\u2026.. There is one, but there a small chance of it working. He said. What is it? You said. You\u2019d have to get the approval of the hunters. He said. You mean I have to get all of their say so? You said. Yes. And it\u2019s not easy. Every single hunter has to say yes. Which won\u2019t be easy. He said. Nothing\u2019s ever easy for a hunter, but I\u2019m willing to go for it. You said. *Sigh* Very well. Luke said. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few minutes, the other hunters appear. This is very sudden, luke. What\u2019s going on? Hiro said. Alex. Luke said. Ok. Don\u2019t overload when I say this, but I\u2019m in in love with leah. You said. In love\u2026..with a witch?! Hans said. Don\u2019t blow a gasket just yet, Hans. Alex. This goes against everything we stand for. To love a witch is to betray the hunters. Gavin said. I know, but she\u2019s not like any of the witches I\u2019ve come across. You said. How so? Hans said. She\u2019s nowhere near cruel as any witch. She treated me with more respect in one day than I\u2019ve gotten in years and she\u2019s the nicest. You said. Hmm. Any proof of this kindness? Dub Said. My hand. Look at this. You said. You show the yang symbol on your hand. This is a gift from her. A gift! A normal witch doesn\u2019t hand out gifts. You said. I already check it. It\u2019s a genuine gift from her. Luke said. This adds to his story. Hiro said. So she gave you that. How do you not know she\u2019s playing you? Gavin said. She\u2019s not. I can read people perfectly. She\u2019s not like Viola. If she wanted to screw me over, she would have done it. I wouldn\u2019t be here right now. You said. I\u2019m not convinced! This could just be a farce! Hans said. I\u2019m not going to deny you the joy of bashing me, but you of all people should know how love is, Hans. You were the first hunter in three centuries to find love. Would you really deny another hunter the same joy? Witch or not? You said. Hans want to say something, but he can\u2019t. You\u2019ve silenced Hans rebuttals in one go. You must hunter must really believe this. Dub said. A hunter doesn\u2019t say die. You said. Very well. But what makes you think she\u2019s nice in general? Gavin said. Xur. An ancient hunter before Argus had spoken about a witch who doesn\u2019t follow the way of her sisters. He said that instead of cruelty, she\u2019ll be filled with kindness towards all. Even hunters as ourselves. You said. Your research of our history is most pleasing. Hiro said. I\u2019m always prepared. You said. But wasn\u2019t Xur the outcast among the hunters back then? Dub said. He was, but he also spoke of a hunter who wouldn\u2019t kill. Not even witches and he was the only one that people liked and that one came true. You said. He\u2019s right again. Even though Xur\u2019s prophecies made him an outcast, they all came true soon. Gavin said. So then this kind witch\u2026\u2026is Leah. Who is the spawn of Lilith who was the worst witch to walk the earth\u2026.. Hans said. I know. She must be turning over in hell right now. Dub said. So what\u2019s the decision of the hunters. It must be unanimous. I say\u2026\u2026yes. Luke said. Yes. Gavin said. Yes. Dub said. Hai. Hiro said. The only one left is Hans. Master Hans\u2026.. You said. I\u2026. allow  this union. But if your love is as strong as it was when you shut me up, you better love her every single day. Then it\u2019s decided. Alex. You manage to do what hasn\u2019t been done since the first hunter. The hunters have signed off on your love for a witch. Luke said. Thank you. You said. As the hunters disappear, you put your arm around luke. Didn\u2019t think you\u2019d vouch for me. Say it. You said. No. He said. Say it. It starts with an f. You said. I said no. Luke said. I\u2019ll say it. Friend. You said. \u2026\u2026.Tell anybody, I\u2019ll rip your spine out! F\u2026..F\u2026Friend. Luke said. Now was that so bad? You said. I need acid. Throat melting acid. Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rummage through a destroyed convoy heading to m district. Damn. They\u2019re at a lost when it\u2019s fighting, but at least they get the good kind of food. You said. As you dig, you sense something. Alright. Here we go. You said. You are lifted up into the air and placed into a open hand. You just can\u2019t take a hint. You said. You can say that, but you said you loved me. She said. Leah gently rub you with her index finger. And who am I not to return said love? She said. I said I\u2019d gut you next time. You said. And? She said. (She knew I was just blowing steam. Yet she didn\u2019t call me on it until now.) You thought. Well, are you? She said. \u2026\u2026No. You said. And the love between us? She said. I\u2019ve come to accept it. You love me and I love you. You said. That\u2019s all I wanted to hear. She said. Leah brings you close and kisses you and almost engulf your head. Then she breaks it and holds you close to her heart. The slow, rhythmic beat makes you almost forget the troubles of your past. I\u2019ll keep you safe. I promise. She said. (Protection from a witch? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good thing or not.) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne year and a half later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo married\u2026..to a witch. Luke said. Yeah. And  kids on the way. You said. I didn\u2019t think family was up your alley. Luke said. Neither marriage. A full year of it. You said. Did you ever think two slaves like us would come this far? He said. Not really. I thought we\u2019d either be dead or in servitude for life. You said. Me too. So the wicked wonder still a good wife? He said. Aw come on luke. Still pissed about that trip to her stomach? You said. Out of respect, I didn\u2019t burst out of her and cut her in half. Even though she\u2019d heal like nothing. He said. Can\u2019t you two get along? You said. No. The bitch ate me and you know how a feel about that. Just like you and being sat on. Luke said. The worst. Stepped on was one thing, but being sat on is the worst. You said. Does leah? He said. Nah. She has a lot of respect for me. Even by her own standards. You said.. Hm. Like she always wanted to be a wife and expectant mother? Luke said. I guess so. In the world we live in, I thought being a mother was low on the list. You said. Heh. Remember our dreams we had? Luke said. Yeah. You said you lead an uprising against all females and I said I wanted to join the army. You said. Heh. That\u2019s before we became hunters. Luke said. Is that a smile I see? You said. Yeah, take a picture. It\u2019ll last longer. *Click* That\u2019s going to be my screen saver. You said. Well I did say so. He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the months go by, Leah gives birth to a girl and boy. Leah was attached to both of them, but she was more attached to her son since he\u2019d soon have to live in a world were men are slaves. One day while out and about, Luke asks for a favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want me to go to Europe with you? For what? You said. Something important. I need your expertise. Leah won\u2019t even know you\u2019re gone. He said. All right. I guess so. You said. Good. Let\u2019s go. Luke said. You and luke disappear and reappear in Germany where Hans is waiting for both of you. Luke. Alex. About time. He said. Hans? What\u2019s all this about? You said. It\u2019s that time. Alex. We\u2019re unsealing the optical eyes. Luke said. Optical eyes? You said. They were a set of eyes born to a hunter. Deemed to dangerous, Argus had them sealed. Hans said. But with the witches growing everyday, we need those eyes. Luke said. So how do we unseal them. You said. We need one eye from a hunter and on from a witch. Hans said. Luke gouges out his left eye. Now all we need is the eye of a witch. Alex. Time to pay an old friend a visit. Luke said. You mean\u2026\u2026 I knew I\u2019d see them one more time. You said. Get her right eye and we can start part two. Hans said. No problem. I know just how to get it. I\u2019ll just go back to where I first started my hunts. You said. </span></div></div>",

You walk into Paris and see a wanted poster. Devil Dog. Wanted. Heh. Only fifty thousand. What\u2019s that in American dollars? You said. As you walk the streets, you pass Lady Vicky\u2019s Mansion. Not today. Some other day. Now how do I get their attention? Do what I did last time. You said. Not wasting anytime, you do some contracts and wait. Three assassinations, a kidnapping, and high profile interrogation. That should get their attention. I bet she\u2019s still mad about me killing her sister. You said. You head to the south of France and wait for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait, you sharpen your blade. There. Should get the job done. You said. You sheath your blade. I wouldn\u2019t try that. It won\u2019t end the way you want. You said. A clawed hand goes through you. Never listens. You said. As the hand is remove, the hole in your midsection heals. Still mad at me, Shadow? You said. She swings high and you duck. I take that as a yes. You said. Hold still! She said. You grab her hand as she tries to slash you. Calm down, shadow. Aren\u2019t your kind suppose to calm and calculated? You said. Not when you kill my blood sister! She said. She grabs you with her other hand. Now die! She said. Before she could attack, you grab you knife, stick it into her temple, and yank her right eye out. Ow!!! You bastard!! Nothing you do will hurt me as much as you killing my sister!!! She said. I\u2019d love to indulge you and your damn goons, even though I\u2019d kill all of you in 8 minutes tops, I\u2019m on business. And I\u2019ve got what I came for. See you later. You said. You disappear and reappear right next to Luke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. I\u2019ve got her eye. You said. Good. Now we can start part two. Luke said. You don\u2019t want to handle your eye first? You said. Luke holds his right hand over his left eye socket and a glows purple for a few seconds. There a new eye. Hans. Luke said. The eye of hunter and witch. Ja. Now you both need to channel every drop of magic in you to unseal the eyes while I say the spell. He said. This better be worth it. You said. You hold one eye and luke holds the other. Don\u2019t slouch, Alex. He said. Let\u2019s just get this over with. You said. You channel the magic in you into the eye as Hans says the spell. This thing is sucking me dry! How much longer?! You said. Not until you can\u2019t even walk. Luke said. You can feel every drop of magic just being taken into the eye until you feel weak. Then Hans stops saying the spell. It is done. Let\u2019s see. He said. It takes a few minutes until you feel better. You open your hand and see three dots on the eye. Perfect. The optical eyes. Luke said. What can they do? You said. What can\u2019t they do? Perception, speed, strength, anything. Hans said. So\u2026.who gets them? Hans? You said. No. No. I prefer not to not what the future holds. He said. Luke? You said. I agree with Hans. It\u2019d be boring knowing everything. He said. Guess I\u2019ll do. As a test to see how they work. You said. You grab the eyes and they phase into your eyes. The three dots appear in your eyes. Well? Luke said. I see\u2026..everything. You said. Who was Hans\u2019s soon to be wife? Luke said. Isle. You said. He\u2019s right. Hans said. One more. Alex. Hit me. Luke said. Why? You\u2019d see it coming. You said. Just do it. He said. Luke You attack luke and kick him when he was expecting you to punch. I know when you want to punch or kick. What did you see? Luke said. I saw you expecting a punch, so I kicked. You said. Those eyes are a god sent. With any luck, we\u2019ll be hunting for a few years instead of three hundred. Luke said. Which would mean more time for Hans to work on his beard. You said. A beard? Hans. Luke said. Who doesn\u2019t love a bearded man? Hans said. You\u2019re German. You\u2019re more mustache than bearded. Alex. Let\u2019s go. Luke said. You and luke disappear and reappear back in o district<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome sweet hell. Luke said. O district\u2019s a dump, but it\u2019s been good to us. You said. You\u2019re just saying that because you live here with the bitch from the west. Luke said. Can\u2019t you at least try to like her? You said. She. Ate. Me. So no. He said. Worth a shot. You said as your eyes revert to normal. So what about your son? Going to bring him into the family business? Luke said. Oh no. I don\u2019t want him high or low with witches or hunters. You said. Fair enough. Someone should have kept us away from them. But give the eyes to him. We still live in a world filled with behemoths. Luke said. Alright. Maybe he\u2019ll get better use out of them. You said. You go home to see Leah is cradling her son. You still haven\u2019t put him down? You said. He\u2019s just too precious. I just can\u2019t. She said. Well get all the time you can. He\u2019s my size when the magic wears off. You said. Does he have to? He\u2019ll start to grow up and won\u2019t be my baby anymore. She said. I take it your mother didn\u2019t coddle you. You said. Somewhat. Only if I showed I could be as mean as her. Leah said. Which would mean you weren\u2019t loved that much. You said. Right. Which is why I wanted to be a better mother than her. Shower my little baby with unconditional love. She said. Just the baby? You said. And my little husband. She said. Thank you. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few years go by and your son has shrunken down to your size, to leah\u2019s dismay. When he was old enough, you introduced him to luke, who he took an automatic liking to. Alex. Come get your kid! He won\u2019t let go of me! He said. He likes you. You said. Get this brat off me! Luke said. You call your son and he comes to you. Don\u2019t let uncle luke get to you. He adores you. You said. Said no one. Luke said. Your son goes to a pile of rubble and starts digging. He likes you a lot. You said. I hate being liked. He said. After a few minutes, your son shows luke a skull he made out of rubble. A present for uncle luke? You said. Your son shakes his head. What would I want with a skull made of junk? Even though it\u2019s finely crafted. He said. Come on luke. He looks up to you. Which is a shock. You said. Luke takes the skull. Smiling, your son latches onto luke\u2019s leg. I hate kids\u2026. He said. Yet he likes you. A miniature luke. Do you want to be like luke? You said. Your son shakes his head yes. Luke. Someone wants to be like you. You said. Ugh! Now I have to be a role model for this snot nosed brat. Luke said. Hey. That brat has those eyes. He could kick your ass if he wanted to. You said. If this brat beats me in a fight, I\u2019ll be nice to leah as long as that hag\u2019s alive. You said. You take your son home. Stay with mother. I know she\u2019s frightening, but you\u2019re the son of Devil Dog. You\u2019re not scared of anything. Are you? You said. \u2026\u2026No. Your son said. Good. I\u2019ll be right back. You said. You leave your house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head to m district, you grow to 100ft and stop. I know you\u2019re there. Let\u2019s get this over with. You said. You see a witch with a regal purple dress on appear from the shadows. \u2026..What do you want? You said. She looks you over for a few seconds. Even a dirty man like you must know. Has no one ever told you not to steal from a witch? She said. I didn\u2019t steal anything. You said. The optical eyes. They never belong to hunters. They belong to us witches, and we\u2019d like them back. She said. I don\u2019t have no optical eyes. That doesn\u2019t sound valuable. You said. So the hard way. Very well. She said. She hold open her hand and your heart appears in her hand. No more playing. Where are the eyes? She said. I don\u2019t know, lady. Just do it. You said. Well, if that\u2019s the way you want it. She said. She crushes your heart in her hand. You collapse on the ground and smile. (From what I\u2019ve seen, I\u2019ve left those eyes with the right person.) You thought. You close your eyes and drift off into slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that\u2019s how it all started? Tom said. Yeah. Luke can verify every word. You said. You think without those witches, you\u2019d be as you are? Cody said. Maybe a hunter, but nothing to hunt. Alex said. Hard to believe he wanted to be like luke. Bruce said. And what\u2019s wrong with that? Luke said. N\u2026.Nothing! Dante said. Who wouldn\u2019t want to be like you? Tom said quickly. You have them scared shitless. Alex said. The way I like it. Luke said. But it\u2019s not right. You said. Sir. You finished all you need? Hank said. I did. You said. And Arif? Alex said. I\u2019ve talked to him. Told him everything about the both of us. His only request so he would help. You said. And Leah? Tom said. Yeah. What about her? Dante said. Hey. I thought I talked to you three about my wife. Alex said. Calm down, Alex. Let the three cute boys drool. I said it was a curse. Leah said. You heard the lady! Tom said. We\u2019ll be with her. Making sure she\u2019s ok! Dante said. Heh heh. Come along boys. Do good and one of you gets a kiss. She said. Tom, Dante, and Bruce blow past Alex and follow leah. I\u2019ve never seen those three like that. Cody said. I see they need more discipline. From me. Luke said. Save it for later. Right now. We have a green light. You said.</span></div></div>",

Remember it was the first thing you did after we left Luka?) he said. (It just surprises me that they could do this, and yet needed me to fight their battles.) You said. (Is it wrong to be needed?) He said. (Don\u2019t rely on a crutch.) You said. A you walk, you come across the building. This is the place. But why did the contact want to meet here? You said. You twist the knob on the door and it opens. And the door\u2019s unlocked? You said. You walk inside and it\u2019s pitch black. (Someone didn\u2019t pay their light bill.) he said. Bad idea to walk in the dark\u2026. You said. You step lightly and feel around. (Think I found the light switch.) You thought. You flip it and feel something jammed to your head. On the ground. A voice said. Asshole\u2026. You mutter. You elbow him and knock him to the ground. (He\u2019s dressed for night ops. Night googols and all.) You thought. You kick away his gun and grab him by his clothes. What are you doing lurking here? You said. You stop his knife attack and break his arm. Argh!! He said. You want a broken neck with that arm? You said. Fucking hell\u2026.. Why did I volunteer for this? He said. Volunteer? For what? You said. (Let me handle this.) he said. Your eyes change to red and you grab him by the throat. You\u2019re going to be volunteering to be in a full body cast and a wheel chair will be your only means of moving if you don\u2019t talk. You said. Jesus\u2026.. Get in here!! Get the fuck in here NOW!!!! He shouts. You see a bunch of guys with guns rush in and surrounded you. (Fucking hell?) You both said as red lasers come onto your body. Grrr\u2026. Stay here. I\u2019m not done with you. You said, knocking him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around. (Guess we found the army. Can I kill them?) He said. (They went through all the trouble. Let\u2019s not disappoint.) You said. Hehe\u2026\u2026. You said. You disappear and reappear with your knife in one. You slice through him and knock the next guy\u2019s head off. Time for a spree\u2026. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. From here all the way to that quarter on the bottle. Dante said. No way. You need at least a 15x scope. Can\u2019t hit that with 10x. Tom said. Care to add more to the table? Dante said. I\u2019ll add another one hundred. 150 if you dial it to 5x. Tom said. A challenge. About time. Dante said. Hell I\u2019ll get in on that. Cody said, putting fifty on the table. Bruce? Dante said. I\u2019m in. He said, putting forty. You guys are idiots. Luke said. Get ready to have your money taken. Dante said. He adjust his sights to 5x and aims. He waits a few seconds before firing. \u2026..It\u2019s a hit. Hank said. Ha! Dante said. No way. Double or nothing. Iron sights. Tom said. Now you\u2019re talking. Dante said. As Dante takes off his scope, Kim and Sam come running in. Whoa, girls. Where\u2019s the fire? Cody said. And can it wait? I\u2019m about to hit bank. Dante said. Luke we found these guys outside looking for a way inside.  Sam said. What? Where are they? He said. Sam puts them on the ground in front of Luke. Bruce kicks the knees out from all them and binds there hands. What are you jarheads doing out here? Tom said. None of them talk. Let me do it. Luke said. Luke\u2019s hand starts glowing a dark purple and he places it on one of the soldier\u2019s head. The soldier\u2019s eyes go wide and a purple line goes to the other soldiers heads. What\u2019s he doing? Cody said. I\u2026think he linked their minds. Hank said. Soon all the soldiers eyes go wide and they start sweating like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK! OK! We\u2019ll sing! Just stop it! One shouts. Luke pulls his hand back. What did you do? Bruce said. Showed them what true fear. Now talk. He said.  W\u2026.we were sent here to infiltrate the place. Scout out who else is in here with him. One of them said. And who were you going to report that to? Dante said. Ashley. It was all part of her plan. He said. Plan? What plan? Luke said. It was suppose to be quick and easy. But he came too early. So we had to push it up to now to take secure the mansion. He said. Secure? For who? Tom said. Before he could say, a loud crash was heard. Everyone turned to see Kris and Em come flying through the doors unconscious. The hell!? Bruce said. Walking through and over them, Kyle and his elites come in. Well then, seems like we got some freeloaders. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to your pov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slice and kick the last guy\u2019s head off his shoulders and through a window. Goal! You said. You look around at the dead bodies. All in a days work. He said before you take over. (Did you really have to put that one guy back to together and cut him apart again?) You said. (A promise is a promise.) He said. (Guess this was a trap. I bet Sue had something to do with this.) You said. Your wrist device goes off. Sir\u2026. We have a problem here. Bruce said. Problem? What kind? You said. Hello hero. Kyle said. (Kyle\u2026.? But I saw him\u2026.) Kyle\u2026.. You said. I\u2019ve seen you\u2019ve been living it up in my mansion. And you\u2019ve been very busy. You even manage to turn one of my enforcers. Not an easy thing to do. He said. What have you done with them? You said. Nothing. Although I can say for sure about Amy. She\u2019s a little\u2026..livid. He said. You or any of your croons touch them\u2026..! You said. You know that\u2019s not how this works. I have a lot of work to do. So I should get busy. He said, hanging up. You quickly leave the building to see the entire army outside. (Wow\u2026. They really came out for us. Tanks, helicopters, and I get the feeling of a long range missile from a submarine.) He said. (If only they did this two and a half years ago.) You said. You pull out your knife and get ready to cut them all down when your wrist device goes off again. Ah, ah. I wouldn\u2019t do that. Kyle said. I\u2019ll deal with you when I get there. You said. Now, see, if you attack them I\u2019ll be forced to\u2026..have your friends her killed. He said. You wouldn\u2019t dare! You said. I think I\u2019ll start with the overtly dressed, silent one. Or maybe I could make her one of my newest members. He said. (Em.) you thought. (Em becoming a enforcer\u2026.. That scares me a little.) He said. This isn\u2019t over, Kyle. Count the fucking days. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Fucking\u2026.) You said. (Well?) he said. (I\u2026.can\u2019t risk it. Not while he has them.) You said. (What about Luke?) he said. (Kyle wouldn\u2019t have called if that was the case.) You said. (Don\u2019t tell me\u2026.) He said. (First time for everything\u2026.. This is an alliance made in hell.) You said. You sheathe your knife and hold your arms up. A few of them slowly approach you and quickly tie your arms together and take your knife away. You\u2019re then loaded into a truck. (So this is what it\u2019s like to be arrested?) He said. (Pretty much. Except this is a military truck and not a police car.) You said. After driving for a good while, the truck comes to a stop. You hop out and see a huge building. (New army HQ.) You said. You are lead inside and into a cell. You easily brake the hand cuffs and your dark half comes out. These jokers got new toys. You think Sinclair is funding them again? He said. No. I think this is all Sue and her merry band\u2019s doing. Jesus\u2026.. The girl hates me that much that she brings back Kyle and his croons? I didn\u2019t even do nothing to her. You said. You killed her for money, spit all over her ideals, threaten her friends and did more damage to m district than those preteen monsters ever did. He said. Ok\u2026. I\u2019ve done wrong by her, but is Kyle really a better option? He\u2019s the one who made that prison and made men fight in that arena. You said. Guess she\u2019s still mad you didn\u2019t do anything to stop all that. What\u2019s the plan of action? He said. We can\u2019t do anything rash. Not while Kyle has my friends. You said. He\u2019s going to turn the girls into his elites or enforcers and have the guys kill each other in the arena. Or re-educate them. He said. I\u2019ll rip his fucking head off and play kick ball with it if he does that!! You said. I\u2019d shove it up his ass, but that\u2019s just me. He said. I can\u2019t leave this cell. Not with the army and Kyle working together. You said. So what do we do? He said. \u2026..I need you to act like me. You said. Easy enough. Only someone whose been around you long enough will know the subtle difference. He said. You bend the bars enough to get out. Keep a low profile. Find out anything you can. Rescue the guys and the girls. You said. And you? He said. I\u2019ll stay here. Have a chat with Sue when she comes. Hurry before someone comes. You said. He walks out of the cell and you re bend the bars as he disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat have you done, Sue? You said. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sit there and wait until you hear footsteps. You perk up and see it\u2019s Ashley. Hello, Sue. Of all the things I thought you\u2019d do\u2026. You said. I didn\u2019t want to do this. But you didn\u2019t leave me any choice. She said. If you told me what I wanted to know instead of being stubborn, we wouldn\u2019t be here. You said. It was none of your business to begin with. She said. So tell me. What warranted a deal with Kyle? Me not doing anything to stop him? Or was it me destroying m district? Or both? You said. You know why. She said. So in your mind, I\u2019m worst than Kyle. I wasn\u2019t the one who built that prison to keep men there for the rest of their lives. Or make them fight in the arena. All that was Kyle\u2019s doing. You said. And you did nothing about it! You turn your back like he did! She said. I told you before. What right do I have to him? Just because some people think what he\u2019s doing is bad? You said. It was bad! You saw that prison and that arena! She said. I did. Prison is horrible in general. And the arena is a chance to prove themselves. You said. Those fights, which are terrible as a whole, were one-sided! She said. And yet I came out alive. You said. They didn\u2019t have what you have! She said. They didn\u2019t need it. I still can\u2019t believe you think the guy on the sidelines is worse than the guy doing the terrible acts. You said. He\u2019s just as guilty. She said.  Only in your crazy head. You really think Kyle\u2019s going to leave m district alone and let men live their lives? You said. I know so\u2026.. I made sure of it. She said, muttering that last part. I\u2019ll let you have that delusion, Sue. Just know you have no idea what you\u2019ve just done. You said. In a huff, she storms away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there in the cell for 2 days. Good thing I don\u2019t need eat anymore. I\u2019d be delirious from hunger. I haven\u2019t heard back yet from them. They should have been rescued by now. Unless\u2026. They were expecting just that. You said. Then your wrist device goes off. Audio only. You said. Sir\u2026 Sir can you hear me? Bruce said. Bruce. Where are you? You said. Good to hear from you. We\u2019re in prison. He said. The others are safe? You said. Yeah, but they got us in separate cells. It\u2019s no picnic here. All the enforcers that were locked up here are free. And they are 4x as worse than before. He said. All that time locked up\u2026. More than enough time to brew anger. Can you get out? You said. We would have already been out, but something\u2019s on the cell lock. Some kind of seal. He said. (It might be a magical seal.) You thought. I\u2019ve been trying to get out ever since I got here. And I think the others have to. He said. Did you happen to see Em? Or Luke? You said. They put Luke in a special cell. We haven\u2019t seen him since. Em is with the girls. Going through\u2026.. Re-education. He said. Re-education? So Kyle is trying to turn her? You said. Not just her, but Sam, Kris and Kate. He said. (Kate and Sam are one thing, but Kris\u2026. She was a former enforcer. She\u2019ll go back to her old ways if left alone.) You thought. What are we going to do? He said. Sit tight. Once I get out of my situation, I\u2019ll come for you guys. You said. Hurry. I don\u2019t think they plan on keeping us here long. He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dark half should have saved them by now. What\u2019s going on? You said. You pace back and forth and hit the walls in frustration. Damnit! I can\u2019t stay in here! You said. You bend the bars and walk out to find the exit. You find it and about to walk out when you hear footsteps. Fuck. Sue\u2019s coming back. You said. You hide in the shadows and wait for her to walk by. When she gets to the door to your cell, she stops. Grr\u2026. The only thing he\u2019s going to do is work me up again. She said. She said. You slowly creep out of the shadows and grow to 100ft. This was the right thing to do. Every precaution was taken to make sure of it. She said. You get a little bit closer. Why does he have to be so stubborn? She said. You quickly grab her head and shove it wall. Ashley\u2019s body slides down and falls over to the side unconscious. I need my knife. You said. You look around and find the storage that had your knife. You sheathe it and run out to the exit when your body freezes in place. W..what the?! You said.  Out of the shadows, Susan appears with her left hand glowing. Urgh! (Goddamn witch!) You said. I came to make sure Ashley wouldn\u2019t go mad when she sees you again. Didn\u2019t expect to find this. She said. Grrrr! You said. You just need to focus your energy like Luke taught you. Don\u2019t make this any worst than it has to be. She said. (Concentrate\u2026.) You thought. You focus your power to your hands and they faintly glow purple. (Concentrate!) You said. Then they begin to glow brighter. What\u2026.? She said. The magic barrier surrounding you is absorbed into your hands. *Huff* Damn witch\u2026.! You said. So\u2026. You can use magic. Not very well, but still. She said. I don\u2019t\u2026.need judgment from a bitch. You said. You\u2019ve exhausted yourself doing that. I don\u2019t want to hurt you. She said. That makes one of us. You said, readying yourself. Why\u2026..? Why won\u2019t you listen to reason. Neither of us have anything to gain from this. She said. I do have something to gain. The knowledge of another dead witch! You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waste no time and throw your knife at her. She moves out the way and when she looks, your fist is halfway to her face. She vanishes at the last second. Damn\u2026. You said. You sense a faint energy source and move to your right, dodging her hand. (She basically came out of thin air\u2026. ) You thought. You move your leg to kick her, but she grabs it as her hand glows. When you kick her off, you can feel your leg. (What? My leg\u2026. It feels like it\u2019s asleep.) You thought. You nearly fall before you stabilize yourself. Wh-what did you do to my leg?! You said. I stopped all messages from your brain to your leg. She said. (Fuck\u2026.!) You said. You can stop this anytime. She said. I\u2019m not done just yet\u2026. You said. You disappear and reappear behind her. She turns to block your afterimage while you attack her from behind. You then feel her palm hit you right on the heart. Ugh\u2026! (She didn\u2019t even turn\u2026! She\u2026.responded so quickly to my attack\u2026.) You thought. You feel your heart start skipping beats as you feel. Your chest feels like it\u2019s on fire as you gasp for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nearly stop your heart. I don\u2019t want to hurt you any farther. She said. (She\u2019s\u2026..not like the rest. Or Sue. She\u2019s trained. Either that, or I\u2019m not prepared for her. I have to get away.) You said. Your hands start to glow. You can\u2019t keep fighting in your condition. Just stop. She said. Don\u2019t tell me what I can do. Calpus! You said, clapping your hands together; Causing a huge flash. Arghhh! She said, shielding her eyes. What was that fucking cleansing spell?! Nuetra! You said. You feel a soothing feeling wash over you as you regain feeling in your leg. Ahhh\u2026 You said. My eyes! Susan screams. You get up just in time to see Ashley come walking out while holding her head. Exit stage left! You said, disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear in o district and shrink back down. You feel exhausted. Two spells and I\u2019m tired as fuck. You said. You can\u2019t rest at all. Not while Kyle still has your friends. I\u2019ve got to get them out. Come hell and high water. You said.</span></div></div>",

You break open a window and climb in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmph. The janitor must not get paid enough to clean this place. You said. You sneak around to find Luke first. Get Luke out first. It should be easier to break everyone out with him. You said. You look around for his cell until you find a lone one and hear someone mumbling. Luke\u2026. You said. You approach the cell and see him knelling down in a straight jacket. Jesus\u2026.. They treated him like he\u2019s a loon. You said. You grip the bars to rip them open, but feel your power being sapped. What the? You said, letting go. The bars start to glow purple and you see a seal on them and under Luke. Good God\u2026. What did they do? You said. They trapped him within his own mind. A voice said. You turn to see your dark half. Where the hell have you been? You said. I got caught. They were expecting a rescue. He said. For two day? You said. They had a cell all prep and ready for me. Like they were expecting Sue to give us to them. He said. Damn it, Sue. You said. So what do we do? He said. It\u2019ll take a lot of magic just to brake the seal on the bars. And even more just to free him. You said. Didn\u2019t he train you to use magic? He said. Not of this level. Only minor ones. Damn\u2026..I hate to leave him trapped like this. You said. There\u2019s nothing we can do. Let\u2019s go get the others. Maybe Em can help. He said, going back inside you. Yeah. You said. You leave Luke\u2019s cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey separated the guys. I better find them. You said. You look around and see an enforcer talking to someone in a cell. Thought you were pretty big, huh? Sitting in the master\u2019s mansion. Now look at you. Right where you belong. She said. Come closer and say that. Not in front of the bars. Bruce said. I would, but that would ruin everything. I plan on making it slow and enjoy every minute of it. She said. Why wait? Are you scared of getting in trouble? You said. You\u2019re just asking for it, aren\u2019t you? She said. I\u2019m right here. I\u2019ll even give you 3 minutes to start off. Bruce said. Seems like class will starting early. She said. She opens the cell. Get over you- You grab her and slam her into the cell walls and then into the ground. Class is out. Permanently. You said, slamming her head into the ground one final time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnew you\u2019d come. He said. Well you shot your mouth off back there. Only a matter of time before she got sick of it. You alright? You said. A damaged ego over surrendering, but I\u2019ll heal. He said. Where are the others? You said. Scattered around, but I\u2019m worried about the girls. He said. Me too. Sam and Kate won\u2019t go against their principles, but Kris\u2026. You said. She was a former enforcer. It won\u2019t take much to make her go back to it. And Em. She\u2019s scary when she wants to be, but if she falls\u2026. He said. Nightmare fuel. We got to get them all out. You said. I\u2019ve been here before and know the layout better. I can find the rest. He said. You get the guys out and head to O district. Only safe place for us. I\u2019ll get the girls. You said. Right. But if you see Kyle and his elites, watch yourself. Something\u2019s\u2026..not right about them. He said. Noted. Get moving. You said.  Bruce leaves the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the cell and go looking for the girls, but come up empty. They\u2019re not here. Where would they\u2026.. Shit. You said. You head out of the prison and head to the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get there and see Sam, Kate, Em, and Kris. You said. (There they are.) You said. (Along with Kyle. And his thugs.) He said. You look at them and everything seems normal about them. (Look. It\u2019s Soya.) He said. (Something tells me she was the one who orcastrated this entire thing.) You said. (I thought that fucking coward wouldn\u2019t have the guts to show her face ever again after she bailed on her friends.) He said. (How did she even find out about magic?) You said. (Heather?) He said. (Wouldn\u2019t put it past her. She\u2019ll always looking for a way to get under my skin, but this is an extreme way to do it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome now ladies. There\u2019s no point in resisting. Kyle said. Says you! I\u2019m no killer like your clowns here! Ugh! When I get this collar off. Kate said. You say that. But you worked with him. And I know he doesn\u2019t let just anybody follow him. He\u2019s made you kill before. Kyle said. Shows what you know\u2026.. He didn\u2019t force us to do something that we didn\u2019t like to do! Sam said. I find that hard to believe. Why else would he take one of my enforcers as his own. He said, looking at Kris. She was holds a man in her hands and her hands were trembling as he was. She was fighting every urge to crush him in her hands. She remembers the power and feeling of doing it. And the rush that followed. Then she remembered what you told her about self control and restraint. To take a former enforcer, he must have wanted killers. Right, Kris? He said. She looks at him. You remember the feeling of doing it, Kris. The power, the rush. It\u2019s still there. He said. Don\u2019t listen to him, Kris! Sam said. You know what you are, Kris. An enforcer. Keeping men in line was something you to pride in. He said. That\u2019s not you anymore, Kris! Kate said. The conflict was killing her. To feel that rush again, to be feared again. Her fingers started to curl. Kris!! Sam said. The sound of Sam\u2019s voice made her stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee? Deep down, you\u2019ll always be an enforcer. He said. Always thought you knew everything, Kyle. You said, landing on Amy\u2019s back; forcing her to the ground. I was wondering when you\u2019d show. He said. Not hard to find you. Just look for the goon squad. You said. Guess that\u2019s something w both have in common. He said. They came to me of their own free will. But I\u2019m not here to argue. You said. I agree. I believe my girls have some\u2026.unfinished business with you. He said as Amy gets up to attack you. You stab her in the neck, but she pulls your knife out. I\u2019m going to shove this down your throat\u2026.! She said. Still making threats. Nice. You said, head butting her. She stumbles back and you go to kick her when Luna catches your leg. (Fast\u2026) You thought. You shift your weight to your other leg, but she catches that one too. Heh. You said. You put your hands on the ground and use your leg muscles to toss her. Before she crashes into the wall, Yumi catches her. (Teamwork? That\u2019s new.) You thought. Come on. I\u2019ll take on all of you. You said. Grrrr\u2026..! Amy said, attacking you from behind. You catch her fist and punch her in the nose. As she stumbles back, you duck and leg sweep Luna as she comes at you and punch her into the ground. You disappear and reappear behind Kouki and Yumi and bang their heads together. You dash forward and headbutt Soya and pick her up by the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take it your responsible for them being back. You said. You know\u2026.. It all came to me when you punched me that day. As my nose bled and I tried not to slip into a coma, it left me with my thoughts. You\u2019re not well liked. And someone like you must have more enemies than you could count. And wouldn\u2019t you know it. Those girls who protect m district didn\u2019t have a high opinion of you. We had a common enemy. You said. So Sue did make a deal with the devil. You said. You call it a deal. I call it getting everything back to normal. If there was someone like you out there in the world, who knows what else is there? And boy did I find it. There\u2019s a lot of special people out there. And they hate you. So I proposed a deal: Bring back\u2026.my friends and the master, and M district won\u2019t be touched again. And you would be taken care of. She said. And my friends were collateral!? You said. No. They were icing. Argh! She said as you increase your grip. You have no idea what kind of forces you\u2019re playing with. You said. I should\u2026.be saying that\u2026.to you. She said. As she said that, Luna appears in front of you and hits your arm; making you drop Soya. Fucking\u2026. You said. You punch her, but she grabs your fist and bends it. Ugh\u2026.! You said. You head butt her away and go to attack, but you\u2019re intercepted by Koyuki. She slams you into the ground and you protect your face and kick her off. As you get up, you pull out your knife and go to stab her, but Amy grabs your arm. I said I\u2019d force this into down your throat! She said.  She rips the knife from your hand and stabs you with it. Rgh\u2026. You said. You push her off you and are suddenly punched by Yumi. Then kicked by Koyuki. As you stumble, Soya throws you into the wall and your punch in the gut by Luna and Yumi. The force of the combined punch made your ribs crack and broke the wall. You knell over and spit out blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What is this\u2026.? How are they\u2026.) You said. Your eyes change optical. (No wonder they hit so hard. Their bodies have been infused with magic. Sue didn\u2019t bring them as they were when they died.) You thought. Move! Amy said. She pushes past her friends and grabs your head. I\u2019m going to carve my name into your skin. And that\u2019s only the beginning. She said. You eyes go wide as the knife gets closer; until Em tackles Amy to the ground. About time he finishes\u2026.. You said. Sam and Kate also rush the elites. What?! How did they break off the collars? Kyle said. I did. Your dark half said, grabbing him. T-two of oyou?! He said. There\u2019s always been two. I\u2019m the one you experimented on. And I\u2019ve been waiting to pay you back. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam and Kate keep Luna, Koyuki, Soya, and Yumi busy and Em clawing at Amy, you sit there recovering. Then you feel a hand on your shoulder. You flinch and see it\u2019s Kris. Kris\u2026. You said. She looks over you worriedly and sees your wound. It\u2019s nothing\u2026. Argh. I can heal from this no problem. You said. The wound quickly heals up. See? You said. Unconvinced, she presses the button on your armband and you shrink back down. What are you\u2026. You said. She picks you up and holds you against her chest as she runs out of the arena. Let\u2019s go! Sam said. Her, Kate, and Em run after her, but not before Em grabs your dark half as he beats up Kyle. Hey! I\u2019m not done yet! He shouts.</span></div></div>",

You can speak? I took you for a mute. You said. I just chose not to talk. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to speak to the guy who brought everything down. She said. I have a knack for making people mad. You said. You know I was a enforcer. I gave the men nightmares. You know how it felt to be working beside the same kind of people you spent your whole life filling with dread and terror? She said. Wasn\u2019t an easy transition. I was the one who trained you all. You said. You gave me a hard time, yet you didn\u2019t hold it against me. You basically gave me a second chances. Even though I hated your guts. She said. Had no reason to turn you away. Not like you did me anything. You said. And yet you did everything for me. You taught me restraint and control. Even when I had Cody in my hands and threaten to crush him, you didn\u2019t beat or berate me. She said. It was a learning point for you and him. You said. You showed me I\u2019m more than just some walking terror. Overtime, my hatred became caring. For you and the others. You said. I was surprised when I heard you stayed next to me when I was on bedrest. You said. Me too. First time I had someone to worry about. Although Em basically wanted to tear me to shreds over staying by your side. She said. Yeah. She has that appeal. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I held that man in my hands and saw the fear in his eyes, I felt like my old self. The fear, the power, the rush, the joy of knowing I had the power to end his life. It was\u2026.ecstatic. I felt like my old self. I almost gave in. I wanted to apologize for it. She said. Shit, no need to sorry. None of us are perfect. We all have our faults and weaknesses. You said. Y\u2026 You\u2019re not mad? She said. Why would I be? We are who we are. You\u2019re an enforcer and I\u2019m a mercenary. We really aren\u2019t the best of people. You said. So even if I did slip back into my old ways for a minute, you wouldn\u2019t be upset? She said. Nope. Just be who and what you want to be. Why do you think I never went against Kyle in the first place? He just couldn\u2019t leave well enough alone. You said. You see her eyes well up, then she clears them. T\u2026thank you. She said. Don\u2019t mention it. She said. After a minute, Sam, Kate, and Em show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think we\u2019re safe here. No one comes out this far. Kate said. I wasn\u2019t done back there. You dark half fumes. Hey, girls! Over here! Tom shouts. The guys come out of hiding inside a building. Take it was a rough time for you as well? Dante said. Shock collars and re-education. Sam said. They were about to put mind control ones on us. Hank said. Wait. Where\u2019s Luke? Bruce said. He\u2019s still in the prison. His cell was\u2026.special. I couldn\u2019t get him out. You said. So\u2026. What do we do? Cody said. We got enemies all around us. Sue and the army. Kyle and his thugs. You said. Is it really true that Ashley did this? Dante said. She did. Brought one tyrant to take out another. In her demented mind, I\u2019m worst than Kyle. All because I sat on the side lines. You said. She really thinks that? You\u2019re not the one who did all those horrible atrocities. Cody said. I did nothing to stop them either. She said I\u2019m just as guilty. You said. So why would she bring him back? And how did she? Bruce said. Magic. Sue knew how dangerous Kyle is. She didn\u2019t think the deal would be kept. But with magic, it would be. She really wanted to keep M district safe. You said. But how I M district more safe with Kyle back? Kate said. The girls will listen to him. No one is going to cross him and his elites. And if they do, Sue\u2019s right there to meet them. You said. This is a deal made in hell. Hank said. A deal that\u2019s about to be broken. What\u2019s the plan? Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have to be subtle. Our enemies are working together. I can\u2019t go into M district. Sue and her band are waiting for me. But\u2026. They aren\u2019t waiting on you guys. You said. Meaning\u2026.? Dante said. Sue knows what I look like. But not you boys. You have free access to m district. You said. I see\u2026. Go in and sabotage. Bruce said. More like sleeper agents. When I\u2019m done with Kyle, Sue\u2019s next. I want you all to go there and plant yourselves as civilians and extra help. Find Kira, Kim, and Susan and neutralize them. That leaves Sue all alone. You said. By that you mean kill? Hank said. We\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get there. You said. And Kyle? What about him? Kris said. Kris\u2026. You talk? Tom said. She just preferred not to. I\u2019ll deal with him. \u2026.And there\u2019s only one way for that. In the meantime, you guys get going. I have someone to meet. You said. With your instructions given, the guys and girls head out to m district. Who are we meeting? He said. An old acquaintance. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head to Alexia\u2019s building. When you get there, you head inside. Alexia. Where are you? You said. Out of the darkness, she appears. Still alive, I see. She said. You thought some witches would do me in? You said. Not really. She said. Time you start talking. You said. What do you mean? She said. You know a lot more than you\u2019re letting on. You knew heather like it was the back of your hand. You told me where to find where the witch\u2019s were all staying. You said. And that\u2019s weird how? She said. You either are a witch. Or\u2026.. A hunter? You said. A hunter? You mean witch hunter? That\u2019s crazy. She said. Drop the act. Luke told me everything, and I can feel and sense the magic in you. You said. *Sigh*\u2026..Very well. She said. With a snap of her fingers, her clothing changing black and red and a marking appear on her right forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t look like a witch. You\u2019re a witch hunter. You said. Give the man his prize. He\u2019s right. I\u2019m a witch hunter. She said. (Damn\u2026.) He said. So\u2026. Where\u2019s Luke? I don\u2019t see him. Or feel him lurking in the shadows. She said. He\u2019s been captured. You said. Captured? By who? She said. Kyle. Ashley brought him back and made a deal with him. Luke\u2019s locked up in a cell and trapped inside his own mind. You said. Shit\u2026. She said. The seal holding him is strong and I\u2019m still in training on magic. I don\u2019t usually do this. But\u2026. I need help. You said. It killed you to say that just now. She said. I don\u2019t have time for jokes. Luke needs my help. Whatever you want, I\u2019ll do if you help me. You said. No need to offer yourself up like that. I was going to help you anyway. She said. (Your negotiating skills need work.) He said. Usually, it\u2019d take years to become fully prepared. But\u2026 I\u2019ll send you on the expressed course. She said. Express course? You said. Show respect to the hunters. She said. She says an incantation and you are engulfed in a purple light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke\u2026. You better be right about him\u2026. Or I just sent another man to his death. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhhh\u2026 My head. You said. You look around and see you\u2019re in what looks like a wooden shack. This looks like a mead hall. You said. (These hunters take up after the Vikings?) He said. You look at the table and see names etched into it. Cor, Od, Val, Sigmour\u2026. Old European names. You said. You walk up to the throne. (Whose butt sat in this? Puts Kyle\u2019s one to shame.) He said. You touch the throne. This\u2026..is made out of gold. You said. (Real gold?) He said. (Real as the sun. And it shows no sign of age or decay.) You said. You see a name printed on the bottom. Lord Argus\u2026. You said. (Is it bad that I want my name etched in gold now?) He said. (What happen to blood?) You said. (I\u2019ll take either. Or both.) He said. You sense someone behind you. You turn to punch him, but he catches your fist. You try again and he catches your other fist. He kicks your leg out from under you and you fall down. He goes for a knee to your chin and you move and elbow him in the side. Tch\u2026! He said. He then punches you on the head, but you disappear and reappear right into his punch. Ack\u2026.! (He\u2026..anticipated me movement.) You said. Not only do you feel your bones break, but a few organs rupture as well. You are sent crashing into the wooden wall and slump over as you cough up blood. (That\u2026..was no regular hit.) you thought. You see him come charging when another guy appears in front of him and stops him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome now, Cor. Is that how you treat guests? He said. He comes to a full stop and looks on reluctant. No one touches Lord Argus\u2019 seat. He said. Rules were meant to be broken. Even Argus himself said so. He said. (These two are polar opposites. Cor\u2019s no nonsense and strict. The other guy is up beat and without a care.) You thought. You get up and he\u2019s right beside you. Ohhhh! A new prospect to join! I think he has what it takes. He said. This isn\u2019t a kids\u2019 club Od. You can\u2019t just let everyone in. Cor said. Aww. No one wants to join if the trials are too hard. He said. They\u2019re meant too weed out the weaklings. The others agreed. He said. Others\u2026.? You said. Out of thin air, the hunters appeared in their seats and you see a old man in gold armor appeared in the throne seat. (Oh fuck\u2026..) You both said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m telling you, lower the requirements and we\u2019d have a bigger influx. Od said. And let just anybody join and run the witch hunter name into the mud? No way. He already defiles this place by touching the throne chair and his blood. Cor said. Maybe if you didn\u2019t rupture 4 of his organs, he wouldn\u2019t be spitting it everywhere. Od said. Enough, you two. You. Get up. The one closest to Argus said. You get up like nothing as your body was already done healing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo. You\u2019re here to become a hunter? One of them said. Yes. You said. You don\u2019t look like someone who\u2019s been crossed by witches. Or a former slave of one. Cor said. I\u2019m nobody\u2019s slave. And believe me, I was crossed by them. And took my revenge. You said. He speaks truth. I smell a lot of witch blood on him. And their magical essence. (One foot in the door.) He said. It takes a lot more than killing a few witches to be called a hunter. Cor said. I didn\u2019t kill a few. I killed an entire coven. You said. A coven?! By yourself?! Nonsense! Cor said. It\u2019s the truth. You said. It\u2026.is. The magical essence I felt. Not a few, but it is a coven. He said. Are you positive Val? One said. No doubt, Seymour. He\u2019s been to a coven and survived. Val said. \u2026\u2026So your reason is revenge? Is that it? Cor said. No\u2026. I share your disdain for them, but it\u2019s not out of vengeance. You said. Then why are you here? He said. \u2026\u2026My friends. I want to protect them. You said. Your friends!? Cor said. That\u2019s a new one. Seymour said. Out of all the reasons, that has to be the most thoughtful one. Val said. Not only that. Luke\u2026.. He\u2019s in trouble. You said. Luke? He\u2019s still alive, the old bastard. Val said. What kind of trouble? Seymour said. He\u2019s been trapped inside his own mind. And the seal protecting him is more difficult than I can handle. You said. Trapped him inside his own mind? That\u2019s not pleasant. Od said. And not easy. Whoever did this must be serious. Val said. A deal made in hell started it all. Someone who\u2019s been a pain for far too long. You said. So you want to become a hunter to protect your friends and save Luke? He said. If that makes me look weak to you, fine. But I\u2019m sticking to that reason. My friends are the reason I want to become a hunter. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..Argus? Val said. \u2026\u2026These\u2026.friends of yours. You must care for them deeply. He said. I do. They are all I have left. You said. How\u2026.far are you willing to go for them? You said. The coven I wiped out\u2026. It was because one of my friends was killed by a witch. You said. *Sniff* Couldn\u2019t be for a nobler cause. Od said. I\u2019m willing to go any distance. You said. \u2026..Very well. The trails start now. He said. He\u2019s already manage to hit Cor. He\u2019s already ahead of the game. Od said. There\u2019s a lot more to be done than that, Od. Seymour said. Cor then punches you hard enough to go right through your stomach. Ugh\u2026.! You said. As much pain you\u2019re in, you don\u2019t fall. Ohhh! One be able to one hit this one, Cor. Od said. We\u2019ll see. The trails have just started. Cor said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in m district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese guys sure are spooked. They\u2019re setting up some major defenses. Bruce said. Rightful so. The commander got out and they\u2019re scared he\u2019ll kill them all. Dante said. Do we even know what these girls look like? Hank said. Look for someone standing 100ft over you. Tom said. Smartass\u2026. Hank said. Enough. Once we find them, stay close to them, and wait until the commander comes. Bruce said. I advise not too close unless you want to be stepped on. Tom said. These girls watch where they step. Still. Stay out of sight. Dante said. Where are the girls going to be? Cody said. They\u2019ll wait for our signal. Remember, we go we the commander gets her and starts wrecking shit. Bruce said. So\u2026. Anyone have any love lost for this place? Tom said. It was shit before and it\u2019s shit now. Hank said. Is it wrong that I preferred the prison over this place? Dante said. At least in there, you know you were going to eat and not be eaten. Hank said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breath in and out. Good. Focus. The more focus, the more potent the magic. Now. Repeat after me. Varic dez. Val said. Varic dez. You said. On the ground, a purple symbol appears and a beam of energy erupts from it. Good. Practice makes perfect. Again. He said. You focus your magic. Varic dez. You said. The symbol forms and a beam erupts. Try to make two of them. He said. You focus your magic and sense someone. You block an attack from behind and the side. Varic dez! You said, disappearing as two symbols appear under Od and Cor\u2019s feet. Vordus! They both said. The symbols disappear and you reappear next to Val. Impressive\u2026.. I see what Luke saw in you. He said. I had a lot to prove for him to even take me seriously. You said. You still have some proving to do. Cor said. Oh, lighten up, mr. mood. He\u2019s going strong. If he performed poorly, Val would have attacked him and not us. Od said. \u2026\u2026Just be ready. Your trails are over yet! Cor said. I see where Luke gets his seriousness from. You said. Remember, as powerful and helpful as magic is, It comes with a price. Val said. Price? You said. It will take something from you in exchange for its use. He said. Is\u2026.that with anyone who uses it? You said. If it likes you. If it doesn\u2019t rend the flesh from your bones, it will take a piece of you as payment. He said. A piece of me? Like my flesh or blood? You said. It could be anything. Your sanity, muscles, sight, hearing, anything. He said. Guess that explains the stick in Cor\u2019s ass. You said. Grrrr\u2026. He said. Once you get to know him, he\u2019s just a teddy bear. He just likes to give people a hard time. Od said. Enough. We\u2019re far from done. Val said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue your magic training with Val and luckily it didn\u2019t rend your flesh of your bones and continued training with Seymour next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy isn\u2019t one hunter allowed to hunt in another hunter\u2019s territory? He said. To prevent staring a conflict between the two. You said. Who were the two hunters who always tried to one up each other and got that rule in place? He said. Germond and Gerland. Two competitive brothers that there contest got them killed. You said. If two hunters\u2019 can\u2019t resolve their problems and must fight, what is the one requirement? He said. They must have a third hunter to oversee the fight. To make sure one does not kill the other. You said. Well done. Being a hunter is more than knowledge of magic and fighting. You must also have a brain. No body wants a dullard. He said. Yes. You said. Now, let\u2019s pick up where we left off. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder Seymour, you learned about the hunter\u2019s history and rules, and even learned how to think multiple steps ahead of the enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a grueling tutelage and near fatal hunter fight training under Cor, you stand before Lord Argus. Well? He said. Val stands up. He showed profound use of magic. He manage to bless his own weapon without my help and doesn\u2019t use it as a crutch. Val said and sat down as Seymour stood up. He hasa brain in there. He listed the rules I asked him to list and names of the hunters behind the specific rules. He said and sat down as Cor and Od stood up. Cor. Argus said. He\u2026..showed exemplary fighting skills. He thinks before heading in and plans out his attacks to a micro level. He has back plans for his back ups. He said. He kept Cor on his toes. Made him sweat a little and made him uses magic. Od said. Really? Is that true? Argus said. \u2026\u2026He did. He\u2019s one of the few people who made me think. He said. And that\u2019s not easy. Od said. \u2026..Knell. He said. You get on one knee as he stands up and pulls out his sword and traces it from shoulder to shoulder. Under intense conditions and odds, you have survived the trails laid out upon you. You did not falter or waiver and when beaten, got back up. I decree you as an official witch hunter. Arise. He said. You stand up. Told you. Od said. Hunter. Val said. Hunter. Seymour said. Hunter. Od said. \u2026\u2026..Hunter. Cor said. As they said that, a portal opens up. I will not disappoint you, Lord Argus. You said before walking through.</span></div></div>",

Guess I was the one. How long was I gone for? You said. Only a day. Time moves slowly there. She said. I have things to do. You said. You want back up? She said. You can come if you wish. You said, leaving. You head to the prison and make your way to Luke\u2019s cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(He\u2019s still in there. Hope all that training paid off.) He said. You put your hand on the bars. Kila ma don zeni a zuk. You said. The seal shatters and you pry open the bars. You walk up to Luke said cut the straight jacket off him. Hang on, Luke. You said. You put your hand on his head. Dura ga ba li mon cu sera. You said. Your hand glows and Luke stops muttering. You grit your teeth as you feel the madness and insanity flow through you. Zuka hil dorus! You said. You expel the madness and insanity from you and take your hand off Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke\u2026. You said. His head moves up slowly and the anger is showing in his eyes. Where\u2026..is\u2026..he? he said. The mansion. As always. You said. I\u2019ll cast his ass into an acid pit for locking me inside my mind! He said. Calm down. You\u2019ve been out of it for a while and your body is still recovering. You need to take it easy. You said. I\u2019ll take it easy when I\u2019m using his head as coaster for my beer. He said. (Why didn\u2019t I think of that? That\u2019s better than his head over the fire place.) He said. You\u2019ll be rushing in there and be right back in here. I\u2019ll handle him. You said. You\u2019re not a full fledge hunter yet. He said. I am now. Argus made me official. You said. A\u2026.Argus himself!? How did\u2026.. How do you even know the spell for the accelerated course? He said. Alexia helped me. You said. Alexia\u2026. I told her not to interfere with your training. He said. I went to her. It seemed fishy that she knew all about Heather. You said. So\u2026.you\u2019re a hunter now? He said. Fully. Em\u2019s waiting on you in o district. You said. Are\u2026.. Are you giving me a command? He said. No. That\u2019d impede on one of our founding principles. You said. And what is that? He said. Freedom and it\u2019s choices. You said. Spoken like a hunter. Very well. You got 5 hours before I take care of Kyle myself. He said, disappearing. Of course you will. You said. You walk out of the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If Kyle and his goons did that to Luke, can we even do anything against them?) he said. (Scared?) You said. (No. I just want to know if we have a plan.) he said. (Don\u2019t I always.) You said. You head to the mansion and appear on the roof. You look down to see Kyle and his goons. (Take the elites, I get Kyle. We have some catching up to do.) He said. (\u2026..Fair enough.) You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what are we getting out of this? This seems pretty one sided. Amy said. We don\u2019t touch their precious little district, and we et to do whatever we want to with the men we have in the prison. Soya said. That\u2019s no fun. Plus, it\u2019s only half filled. Not enough men to torture for the enforcers. Or ourselves. Luna said. They can\u2019t keep count of every single man there. Why not steal some? Yumi said. They\u2019ll know we\u2019re coming and who did it. Soya said. Don\u2019t we have any that knew their place in there? Koyuki said. They\u2019ve all returned to the prison. So have the ones afraid of him. Soya said. (Nice to see we still inspire some terror.) He said. So we just stay out of their district and we get to do what we want? Kyle said. Yeah. Pretty much. Soya said. Like I said, one sided. They get to keep \u00bc of the men that were in the prison. Amy said. We\u2019ll find a way to get more. We just have to be smart about it? Luna said. And him? Koyuki said. M district gets him. They want him to stay locked up? Soya said. Locked up? That\u2019s too slow! Where\u2019s the death sentence?! Amy said. They\u2019re not like us. They don\u2019t kill their prisoners. The worst offender there has a life sentence, yet he has a pretty cushy cell and gets fed whatever he wants. Soya said. \u2026\u2026Then they better not feed him or anything. Or sleep. Amy said. (Fed whatever he wants? Cozy cell? Sue really is a bleeding heart.) He said. (I didn\u2019t even get to my first meal.) You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where do we go from here? Amy said. We could try to pick up where we left off. Yumi said. Couldn\u2019t agree fucking more. You said. You drop down right onto Soya, knocking her out cold. What the?! You!! Amy said. (Go!) You said. You dark half leaves you as you charge Amy through a wall. Yumi, Luna and Koyuki follow after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kyle comes to his senses, your dark half kicks him in the gut. Hello, Kyle. Now\u2026.. Let\u2019s pick up where we left off. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop when you get outside and throw her to the ground. GRRR! You\u2019re going to wish you stayed in m district!! She said. Right\u2026. You said. You got away last time\u2026. This time, no one will save you. She said. \u2026..Who said I need saving? You said. You ill when I claw your heart out! She said. She disappear and reappear right in front of you. You punch right through her. Ack\u2026..! She said. So simple\u2026.. You said. Just as she falls down to ground the others show up. AMY!!! Luna shouts. Calvary\u2019s here. You said. You\u2026..BASTARD!! Luna shouts. She come charging at you. \u2026..Hmph. You said. You catch her by the throat and raise her off the ground. Let her go! Yumi said. \u2026\u2026With pleasure. You said. You snap her neck and drop her. NO!!! Yumi said. Before she could react, you toss your knife into her neck and slice her head off. You then stab Koyuki. Argh\u2026.. She said. You move your knife across her stomach and slice through her. \u2026\u2026Bitch. You said. (They should be back up about\u2026..) You said. One by one, their bodies get back up. The gaping wound in Amy\u2019s chest closes up. Yumi\u2019s body picks up her head and reattaches it. Luna snaps her neck back into position and Koyuki\u2019s lower body reattaches with it\u2019s upper one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Looks like Sue\u2019s magic did more than just bring them back.) You thought. You\u2019re going to pay for that\u2026.. Severely!! Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn o district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan\u2019t believe I let him put me in that state. This is going to be the longest 5 hours of my life. Luke said.  Good things come to those who wait. A voice said. You got some nerve Alexia. I told you to stay out of it. Luke said. She appears behind him, but is not 100ft. Oh, come on. You know it takes a village. She said. Unless said village is wiped out. Luke said. So is it true? Where you trapped in your own mind? She said. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. He said. *Snickers* How did that happen? I thought nothing took you by surprise. She said. It\u2019s not often when I am taken by surprise. Ashley must have imbued them with magic. He said. Ashley? The one who hangs out around m district? The one who made the \u201cdeal in hell\u201d? She said. That one. She only thinks of the right now instead of the future. Luke said. She either really hates him, or really wants to protect M district. \u2026..Should we help him? She said. No. This is his trail by fire. Plus, I gave him 5 hours to do it. Then I get my chance. He said. We really should look after each other more. There\u2019s not that many left of us out there in the world. She said. We do, but we still have t rely on our own power. We become like the witches if we rely on each other too much. He said. </span></div></div>",

You go to slice her, but Kouyki grabs your hand. We\u2019ve played with you long enough. She said. (Her eyes too. I think it\u2019s all of them.) You thought. You kick her off you and she catches your fist. (Huh?) You thought. You disappear and reappear to avoid Yumi sneaking up behind you. You kick her into koyuki and the fall over onto Amy. (Almost didn\u2019t sense her. It\u2019s like she was a\u2026.shadow.) You said. You then punch Luna and when she returns the favor, you catch her fist and headbutt her back. Ugh\u2026. GRRR! She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Something\u2019s\u2026..not right. They\u2019ve changed. It\u2019s like they\u2019re\u2026.. No. It can\u2019t be.) You said. You sense the magic in the building. (They\u2019re\u2026..turning into witches? How is that\u2026.? The magic. It\u2019s running rampant and unchecked to the point of altering their bodies. This keeps up, I\u2019ll be facing a shadow, two umbrans, and a siren. Time to end this.) You said. You close your eyes and concentrate. Don\u2019t give up now. We\u2019re just starting! Amy said. Your hands start to glow a dark purple. \u2026..Time to return you all back to the grave. Catoris. You said. A circle appears under them and bind their movement. What the?! Koyuki said. Alto zion dia cazo haz! You said. Out of the ground, multiple hands come up and drag them back to hell as they fought them off. No! Get off me! Amy said. Slowly but surely, they are pulled down. Your hands stop glowing and you turn back to the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, you see your dark half with his bloody hands holding Kyle\u2019s head. You\u2019ve been\u2026.busy. You said. No one experiments on me. He said, tossing the head away. So are they gone? He said. Yeah. You said. You say the spell again and the arms drag Kyle\u2019s body and head down to hell. And what about Soya? He said. Leaving her alive was a mistake I won\u2019t make again. You said. You say the spell one last time and Soya follows her friends down. Hopefully, an alive one earns me a few brownie points. You said. Then that\u2019s all that\u2019s left is m district. But they\u2019re prepared for us. Not like it will help. He said. It won\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t mean we get to be reckless. But maybe that\u2019s just what we need. You said, looking at your dark half. What? He said. \u2026..How would you like to finally go on that rampage of yours? You said. You better not be shitting me. He said. I\u2019m not. I just thought of something that will really need your apt of destruction and death. You said. You had me at destruction. He said. First, we need to make a slight change. You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re walking up to m district and see a heavy barricade with soldiers and turrets. They had a long time to prepare. And quickly too. You said. You walk up to the barricade and see a red flare going off. They know I\u2019m coming now. I\u2019ll just let myself in. You said. You blast open the door and the explosion takes out everyone on the barricade. You step over the barricade and head deeper in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk through, you see multiple tanks and soldiers coming. Not enough\u2026. You said. You toss an energy ball at them and the explosion consumes all of them. Heh\u2026 You said. You disappear and reappear over the crater and continue. Let\u2019s have some fun. You said. You fire multiple energy balls in random directions and destroy building and set them on fire. The screams should draw Sue out. You said. You then hear a jet fly over. Hm? You said. You see a few flying over you and starts firing missiles. You hold out your hand and from each finger, a beam fires; destroying the oncoming missiles and jets. Two blow up instantly while the third crashes into the ground. Nice\u2026. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep going, reeking death and destruction on everyone and everything. All this Sue\u2026.. Where are you? You said. Right fucking here! She said. You disappear and reappear as her fist hits the ground. You reappear at 100ft. About time, Sue. Thought I had to kill everyone here to draw you out. You said. I knew it was risk. To use one tyrant to dispose another, but if it meant safety for m district, I\u2019d do it again. She said. You really thought that you could use magic to control them? Keep them in line and dance like puppets on a string. You said. Don\u2019t you dare judge me! I did it to protect m district! All you care about is yourself! You\u2019d kill everyone here if it meant money. She said. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re any better than me, Sue. You\u2019re not as clean as you think. You said. What do you mean? She said. Here. You said. You toss the notebook at her feet. I think you know what that is. You said. This is\u2026. How did you\u2026.? She said. Your little coven of witches is gone. I found this in your former room, and I have to say, I\u2019m disgusted. I\u2019ve been a better person than you. You said. Ashley flips through the pages. I\u2019ve read everything. You\u2019re no better than your sisters. You said. I\u2019m\u2026.not like them. She said. The hell you are! How you killed your first slave. You used them for your sick pleasures and practice your dark arts on them. You\u2019re sick! You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2026!!! She said. And the worst one was what you did to a Catholic priest. You said. Her eyes go wide. You\u2019re a sick, perverted woman! Not only did you force him to renounce his faith, you also made him call you a god! And what you made him do after\u2026.. The deepest part of hell isn\u2019t enough for you. She said. N\u2026.No\u2026. That\u2019s not\u2026.. She said. All the memories of her time as a witch came flooding back. All the horrible things she did. Killing, enslaving, all of it came back. And you call yourself a protector, and have the guts to call me out? You said. I\u2019m\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026. That\u2019s not me anymore!! She said, throwing the journal away. You\u2019ll always be a witch. And everything you\u2019ve done is a reflection of it. All you\u2019ve done was make things worse. You just couldn\u2019t leave things as they were. They had to be on your terms or none at all. Like a true witch. You said. All I wanted to do was protect people!! She said. You can\u2019t protect anyone. All this on death and destruction on your watch, Sue. Leave it to a witch to watch as people suffer. You said. SHUT UP!!!! She screams as the markings on her body glow brightly and spread across her body. If protecting m district makes me a bad person, then fine! I\u2019ll gladly burn in hell knowing I protected this place from people like you! She said. That last part can be arrange. One less bitch and Mary Sue in the world. I\u2019ll be doing everyone a favor. You said. I\u2019m not going alone. I\u2019ll take you with me! She said. Sorry, Sue. But this trip is made for one person. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appear behind her and shove your fist through her chest. Ugh\u2026.! She said looking down. You kick her down to the ground. You sounded serious back there. You said. I was. These whores are disgusting. Your dark half said as his eyes change back to red. T\u2026.two of you\u2026..? She said, coughing blood. Still alive? Don\u2019t die easily. He said. There\u2019s always been two of us. You and Kyle weren\u2019t smart enough to know that. You said. All this, Sue. On your head. Just couldn\u2019t leave well enough alone. I just *cough* *cough* wanted to keep them safe\u2026.! Living in fear every single second of their lives. Seen\u2026..no higher than dirt. Treated as slaves the second they are born. And for what?! Just *gasp* because they were born a man? She said. That\u2019s life, Sue. It doesn\u2019t always go your way. You said. But why this way? Who\u2026.decided it to be like this? She said. Life is what you make of it. You go around letting people walk all over you and dictate you, all you\u2019ll be is a slave. Your dark half said. All that was needed\u2026..was a spark. To ignite a revolt. To turn\u2026.things around. Someone\u2026..needed to be the hero\u2026. She said. And look what that got ya. Come on, we\u2019re done here. He said. You turn and walk away. P\u2026.please\u2026. She said, making you stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP\u2026please\u2026.. There\u2019s a heart somewhere inside you. You\u2019re a good person, I know it\u2026.. You\u2019re not evil. Not like the master was. Just misunderstood. She said. You grit your teeth and clench your fist as she coughs up a storm. Please\u2026 I\u2019m *violent cough* begging you\u2026.. Protect m district\u2026.. You\u2019re\u2026.all that left\u2026. She said with her last breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout time. Come on. The guys are waiting. He said. Taking one last look, you head out as your ark half goes inside you.</span></div></div>",

He said. You kept going until you saw the guys with Kira, Kim, and Susan all bounded and on their knees. (A little shocked they were able to do this.) You said. (They had good teachers.) He said. (Is that praise?) You said. (Don\u2019t get use to it.) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet us go! Kira said as she struggled. I said keep still! Bruce said, hitting her with the butt of his gun. Nice job. Keep your distance from that one. She\u2019s\u2026.unstable. You said. I\u2019ll show you unstable you- Sit your ass down! Dante interrupts by shoving her into the ground. Ugh! What\u2019s this all about!? That deal we broker with the master? Kim said. We got a smart one on our hands. You said. Where\u2019s Ashley!? Kira said. Ead. Like should have stayed. You said. YOU\u2026.!!!! Kira seethes. A\u2026. Ashley\u2026.. Kim said. You just had to have more. Couldn\u2019t leave well enough alone. And look what that got you! Your precious m district in flames. You said. Someone had to look after them. You were a bomb just waiting to be set off as soon as someone paid you to do so! You\u2019d kill your own mother if paid enough! Kira said. How I earn a living. Speaking of living\u2026.. You said. Burning the district to the ground wasn\u2019t enough for you? You want to kill us too!? Kim said. Cut the head of a serpent and the body dies. Or in your case, heads. You said. You hear him, right?! This is the man you guys swore to follow?! All this destruction to prove a point and it\u2019s not enough for him! It never will be enough! Kira said. Zip it! Bruce said with a kick to the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s been enough death and misery today. We were wrong for what we did. No more lives need to be taken. Susan said. You are the last person I want to hear from. You spout all that nonsense, but you and your kind are twisted. And I\u2019ll end everyone of you. You said. As she looks in your eyes, she sees the hatred and anger in them. My god\u2026. You\u2019ve become a\u2026. Susan said. Quiet! Get rib of them. And burn that one\u2019s body. Make sure it\u2019s complete ash. You said. Yes, sir. Bruce said. As you turn and walk away, you hear the sound blood gurgling. (So\u2026. Does this mean I get this place as a playground?) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back to the mansion, you look out at the m district. The preteens and teens are going to have a field day on our scraps. He said. Assuming they don\u2019t think I protect it. You said. Heh. And here I thought you listen to Sue\u2019s last words. He said. Why would I follow the words of a witch? You said. You looked like you listened to her because you stopped walking. He said. I was angry that after all this time, she still barked up that tree after all this time. You said. Guess it was just lost on her. He said before going back inside you. (With Kyle gone and Sue\u2019s band taken care of, we sit at the table alone. As it should be.) He said. You see Em and Luke walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see you hogged all the fun for yourself. Luke said. You gave me 5 hours to get it done. You said. A mistake on my part. Gave you more time than I should have allowed. Shit, you didn\u2019t even keep the head around for me. He said. Take it up with my dark half. He\u2019s the one who ripped him apart. You said. Well, my day just got cleared. I was going to take my time skinning and cleaning his skull. Luke said. If you hurry to m district, you\u2019ll find a lot of bodies not needing them. Plus 4 special ones. You said. Special ones?! Keep the lights on for me. He said as he vanishes. That man loves his skull collection. You said. (Tell me about it.) Em said. You turn your head towards Em. D\u2026did you\u2026. You said. (Speak to you in your head? Of course. I can finally talk to you.) She said. I\u2026.thought you were a mute. Like Kris was. Neither of you spoke. You said. (Kris was just being moody. I really had no way to speak to you.) She said. That mouth of yours\u2026. You said. (It\u2019s a long story, but first\u2026.) She said, grabbing you and hugging you tightly. (I\u2019m so happy I can finally speak to you!) She said. (Great\u2026.. Two voices in my head now.) (Just remember, I was your first.) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the guys come back followed by the girls. Took longer than I thought. You said. We wanted to make sure that one we burned was good and gone. Bruce said. We also scatted her ashes to the wind. Tom said. Good. One less problem to deal with. You said. We also saw Luke. He was cutting off heads like a kid in a candy shop. Cody said. It his\u2026.hobby. Good work all around. You said. </span></div></div>",

With Ashley and her friends gone, m district is wide open. And the preteens and teens know this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir, I\u2019ve got movement on hundreds of those monsters moving on m district. Dante said. Now? Why did they wait so long? You think they\u2019d followed after we left. You said. I think they were waiting on you. To see if you were going to take over. He said. Like I\u2019d do Sue any favors. You said. You head up to the roof and watch from the mansion with binoculars. (Look at them all. It\u2019s like a feeding frenzy.) You said. (They\u2019re finally letting out all that steam. Sue kept them back for years. The prison was an outlet for them and that went up in smoke. They\u2019re making up for lost time.) He said. (At this rate, m district is going to be wiped off the map.) You said. (Can I join? Mindless destruction is my favorite.) He said. (Yeah, and you\u2019ll kill everyone there.) You said. You watch as it all goes down and from there, you can hear multiple monstrous roaring. Like the trumpets of Jericho\u2026. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you head into m district and devastation isn\u2019t the word to describe it. Jesus\u2026.. They showed no mercy here. Crushed bodies, missing limbs, ruined buildings\u2026. You said. (Makes o district look clean.) He said. You continue to walk through; looking at the aftermath. (So now that m district is a wasteland, what are these girls going to do for fun now?) he said. (They laid waste to here, that\u2019s for sure, but they didn\u2019t take everyone.) You said. (Why not?) he said. (Like you said, where\u2019s all the fun if it\u2019s over in one go? They took 95% of the men here.) You said. (Which would leave only 5% behind. So they can still have fun in this place.) He said. (Right. So even if the remaining men here manage to rebuild, those monsters will be right back here to topple and take them.) You said. (Making m district their official playground. These bitches aren\u2019t as clueless as I thought. I bet Sue is furious right about now.) He said. (She can be that way. This is what she gets for being a hero.) You said. As you walk, your device goes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir, Not to rush your expedition, but could you hurry it up a little? Dante said. Why? Is something wrong? You said. No. Well, Em is pacing back and forth like a mad woman and giving everyone a death glare. And Luke is busy with his skull cleaning to keep a leash on her. He said. Did you tell her that there is no danger out here? You said. Tom did, and he\u2019s currently having his ribs tended to. He said. Damnit, Em. Tell her I\u2019ll be back soon. You said. (Violent little thing, isn\u2019t she?) He said. As you finish up looking around, you hear singing. That voice\u2026.. Heather\u2026. You said. You quickly follow the sound until you see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if it isn\u2019t my favorite person in the world. She said. Only you would be out here in the middle of all this and singing. You said. Isn\u2019t it wonderful? All this death and destruction\u2026. How can I not? She said. You witches are sick and demented. You said. Is that you talking or that garbage hunter nonsense? She said. It\u2019s a damn fact. You said. It\u2019s slander, and I should sue over it. I\u2019m nothing like my sisters. I don\u2019t go out of my way to prove some fleeting ego of dominance. She said. So you admit it? You said. All I said was I\u2019m not like my sisters. I don\u2019t have a superiority complex I need to feed every minute of the day. I never once tried to make you my slave back in the coven. Although\u2026. Having you at my beck and call would be nice. She said. I\u2019d rather drink acid. You said. Come now\u2026.  You can\u2019t say you don\u2019t have feelings for me. She said putting her arms around you. Think about it\u2026.. You and me. Together\u2026.. And that girl you\u2019re dating can join in too. She said. That girl\u2019s name is Mira. You said angerly. Well, she can be our plaything. Any man would love to have two women fawning over him. She said. I\u2019d rather have you falling on a bed of spikes. You said. That hurts\u2026.. You know it\u2019s not polite to make a woman cry. She said. Please\u2026. There\u2019s nothing womanly about you. You said, stabbing her. Now that\u2019s\u2026..just not nice. She said backing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKilling you has been delayed long enough. You said. Again with this? You wouldn\u2019t kill a defenseless person, would you? She said. Yes. I would. (Yes, we would.) You both said. You charge her and she vanishes. Not this time. Shioma! You said. You vanish in a puff of darkness and after a few seconds, you tackle her to the ground with your knife to her heart. They sure do know how to train a person. But why did it have to be a cute one? She said. Shut it! You said. You don\u2019t know why you\u2019re hesitating. It should be easy for you to kill her now. (Why\u2026.is my hand trembling?) You thought. Well? What are you waiting for? Are you going to kill me? She said. You really want to, but something is stopping you. It won\u2019t let make that plunge to her heart. Heh\u2026 She said. She grabs your head and pulls you in for a kiss. She holds it for a minute before letting go. Let\u2019s do this again sometime. She said before vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Well\u2026. That was fun.) He said. (Let\u2019s just get out of here\u2026.) You said, leaving m district.</span></div></div>",

You head to where Tom is being tended to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, commander. Remind me never to speak to Em when she\u2019s pacing back and forth. He said. He\u2019s going to be ok? You said. Yeah. Luke healed up his ribs pretty quickly. Bruce said. To be honest, that\u2019s not the first time it happened to me. Tom said. Where\u2019s everyone? You said. Dante\u2019s out getting a new gun. You know that woman you found for Hank? He said. Cinthia? You said. Yeah. Get this. The two are engaged. He said. Really? You said. Never though Hank would find one. He said dating would be the last thing he\u2019d ever do. Tom said. I thought it was of his high standards. Ultra nice and never killed or wrecked a building. And Cody? You said. He went to M district to see the aftermath it was his home for a while. He said. And the girls? You said. They went with him. He\u2019s still the youngest out of us and they didn\u2019t want him getting hurt or worst out there. You said. Nice to see things are finally calming down. But don\u2019t get complacent. Kyle and Sue are gone, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re safe from any threats. The next enemy could be around the corner. You said. We\u2019ll be ready, Sir. As always. Bruce said. Take it easy. I\u2019ll be back later. You said, leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head to Mira\u2019s house and open the door. Immediately, Miley runs up and hugs you. Big brother! Your finally back! She said. Yeah. Did you get taller? I remember you being shorter last time. You said. You know why. She said. I know, you\u2019re 16 now. You said. Does this mean I can finally come along with you when you go out there?! She said. We\u2019ve talked about this. You said. But I\u2019m older. You said I could go with you when I\u2019m older. She said. A lot older, Miley. It\u2019s not safe out there. You said. Which is why I want to go with you. Someone needs to look out for you. She said. (She\u2019s got a point.) He said. (Just like that? Wow\u2026.) I mean like when you become an adult. I promise when that time comes, you can follow me. She said. I\u2019m holding you to that! She said. I know\u2026. You said. Mira comes out of her room as Miley runs to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re back\u2026. She said happily. It\u2019s\u2026.been a tough time out there. Old enemies, new enemies. You said. As she walks closer, you blush a little. You know\u2026.. Nothing\u2019s changed about you. You\u2019re still running off and leaving me here worried. She said. I had somethings to take care off. But not anymore. Hopefully we\u2019ve finally earn some time together. You said. You look to see her blushing as well. You look the same as when we met. You said. You were such an ass back then. She said. And you were a annoyance. How we fell for each other, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m glad it happened. You said. So am I. She said, kissing you. Unlike when Heather does it, you actually enjoy this. \u2026..I love you. She said. I\u2026..know. You said. Aw, come on. It\u2019s not that hard to say. She said. You know I have a hard time expression this feeling. You said. I bet if I was in a one piece bathing suit, you\u2019d say it like that. She said. \u2026..Do you have said bathing suit? You said. Ohhh. Mr. funny man, huh? She said. She fiddles with you arm band and you shrink down. Smiling, she picks you up and drops you in her open hand. Let\u2019s see how funny you really are when I tell Miley you\u2019re little. Ok, ok. I\u2019m sorry. You said. And? She said, waiting. And\u2026. I\u2026..l\u2026l\u2026..love you. You said. (Fighting giantesses, witches, and witch hunters no problem. Saying I love you, that\u2019s the Achilles\u2019 heel?) He said. (Like you and romantic comedies.) You said. (No greater torture in the world\u2026.) He said. Now that I think about\u2026. Miley shouldn\u2019t be the only one to kiss you non stop. She said. Oh, god. You said.</span></div></div>",

A third world country is better looking than o district.) Your dark half said. You know, A hunter\u2019s first hunt is overseen by his master. Luke said on your device. And be critique by you on how fast I kill witches? Pass. You said. Because you take too long. And you\u2019re doing your hunt in another hunter\u2019s territory. Luke said. Gavin won\u2019t mind. He\u2019s probably in the local pub getting hammered. You said. He does spend his time there. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sure about doing this alone? Bruce said. Yeah. It\u2019s tradition. Every hunter has to go on one. You said. It doesn\u2019t sound like you should be going alone. Bruce said. I don\u2019t think we should get in the way. Have you seen what these witches look like? Beautiful, yes, but I don\u2019t like the idea of being turned into a frog. Unless\u2026.the commander or Luke teaches us how to use magic. Tom said. You are literally the LAST person who should use magic. Hank said. Why me? I\u2019m not that irresponsible. Tom said. No, but you\u2019d conjure up some demon or plague or make a clone of yourself. Dante said. And one\u2019s bad enough. Luke said. And magic isn\u2019t something to toy with. It\u2019s very dangerous. You said. It can\u2019t be that dangerous. Tom said. You\u2019d become like Luke. You\u2019ll be grumpy, moody, cynical, short tempered and all that. You said. Flattery doesn\u2019t work on me. Luke said. \u2026\u2026Would I still be handsome? Tom said. Oh God\u2026. Dante said. You close the link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(So what\u2019s the real reason?) He said. (It\u2019s to beat Luke. Every time we fight, we push each other to the limit, but he always beat me.) You said. (Both of your bodies look like hell afterwards. Em has a heart attack each time.) He said. (But this gives me an opportunity. I can hone my skills against these bitches to perfection. I\u2019ll retake my number one spot.) You said. (Well, won\u2019t get there by just standing around here.) He said. (Right.) You said. You look around to start your hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were looking, you came across a pub and looked inside. Looks lively. These guys don\u2019t have a care in the world. And look who\u2019s at the center. You said. You see a tall man in a duster and black boots with jeans on raising a toast. Yep\u2026. That\u2019s Gavin. It\u2019s not even noon yet and he\u2019s getting hammered. You said. (Well when you live in a world full of giants, best to live like every day is your last.) He said. (Got that right.) You said. You go back to searching, but can\u2019t find any witches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange\u2026. I can\u2019t sense any of them. Or find their cove. You said. (What about that one?) He said. You see a woman in her teens looking like she owns the streets. You sense her out and feel no magical presence within her. (No\u2026.. She\u2019s not one of them. But her face looks so damn familiar.) You said. (Oh God\u2026. She looks just like\u2026..) (That girl from Star wars.) You finished. (Jesus\u2026. That\u2019s a spitting image of her. And you called Ashely a Mary Sue.) He said. (That\u2019s because she is. But I think I owe her an apology. This one right here is Mary Sue incarnate.) You said. (You think\u2026.?) He said. (Let\u2019s find out.) You said. You disappear and reappear behind her. Pst. Think fast! You said. Huh? She said, turning around. She reacts quickly and catches your fist. You knee her in the gut and sweep her legs out from under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Nope. She can\u2019t fight someone twice her size.) You said. Ow\u2026.! Oi! What\u2019s your problem!? She said with a heavy English accent. You looked like someone I\u2019ve seen before. Had to make sure. You said. Simply asking would have been nice! Not attacking me! She said. I didn\u2019t hurt you. Even though you look like certain Mary Sue. You said. Well I\u2019m not! And I have a bleeding name that I\u2019d like to be referred to! She said. Incapable? Useless? Flimsy? You said. You must be takin the piss out of me. No one\u2019s this much of an asshole. She said. Hey! What\u2019s going on here? A voice said. You look to Gavin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin. I thought you\u2019d be living it up in a pub by now. I was\u2026. Until I noticed another hunter. He said. A hunter? Where? This girl over here? You said. If Isle was a hunter, you think she\u2019d be on her ass right now? He said. Isle? Her last name is island? You said. Still taking the piss out of me\u2026..  Oi! Gavin. You know this American? She said. Yeah. He\u2019s our latest hunter. He said. Another one? How long has it been since then? She said. 100+ Years. He said. Stop\u2026. No need to flatter me. You said. And he\u2019s on his first hunt. Although out of territory. He said. Out of territory? Gavin, you need help hunting? She said. No, I\u2019m still capable. He said. Unless a shot of brandy is involved. You said. I\u2019ll have you know that I can hunt while sober or drunk. Isle, I\u2019ll take it from here. He said. Fine\u2026. I\u2019ll be waiting at home for you. She said walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home? Gavin, you dog. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d tie the knot. Someone fell too hard for that gentleman charm. You said. When you find the right one, you can already hear the wedding bells. And Isle\u2019s been there for me for a long time. He said. So is Isle a nickname you gave her? You said. It\u2019s\u2026.a long story behind it, but her name is Isabel. But what are you doing here? You know hunting out of your territory I forbidden. He said. Rules were meant to be broken. But I can\u2019t seem to find a witch around here. You said. Well\u2026. It\u2019s different outside the US. He said. How? You said. Witches differ from country to country. The witches from the US might hide in plain sight while the ones from Germany might be out in the open. Different culture. He said. So with how openly Isabel was talking about you hunting\u2026. You said. Witch hunting here is sort of a government affair. He said. Really? The government oversees your hunt? You said. Not\u2026.really. It\u2019s just illegal to be a witch in the UK. Long, boring history behind why. He said. That explains why I can\u2019t find any. So does Isabel\u2026.. You said. Go with me? No, but she\u2019s got fire for it. He said. Aw. I was sure since she looks like that Mary Sue, she\u2019d fight like her. Fighting someone with no training whatsoever. You said. You\u2019re referring to Ashley? He said. The biggest Sue of them all. But are you telling me I came to merry old England for nothing? You said. Only if you came for witches, there are other things here. He said. Well\u2026. I did see you down 6 glasses of beer and brandy back to back. You said. Now, you\u2019re talking. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re open the door to Gavin\u2019s house. Honey\u2026. I\u2019m *hic* home. Gavin said. All that alcohol and your liver is still working. You said. I should\u2026..say the same\u2026\u2026to you. All the drinks you downed\u2026.. You should be puking in a toilet. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel comes to see Gavin\u2019s arm around you. Drunk again, Gavin? She said. Only way to be, Isle. Say\u2026. When did you get a sister? He said. Help me lay him down. She said. You both set Gavin down on the couch. Zarfios. She said. Her hand glows as it rests on Gavin\u2019s head. He starts to snore like a bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2026.can use magic? You said. Only this spell. I use it to put him to sleep when he comes home drunk. She said. You do know what magic does to regular people, right Sue? You said. I know the risk. And my fucking name is Isabel! Not Sue! Do I look like someone who can do everything without much thought? You said. You really do. You look just like her though. You sure you two aren\u2019t sisters? You said. You watch too many movies. Just rest, love. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how long you\u2019ve known Gavin? You said. We met when he came stumbling out of that pub. Even drunk, he had that charm. And it\u2019s even worse when he\u2019s sober. The sweet little nothings, compliments, gifts\u2026. I felt like the only woman in the world. She said. Wow\u2026. You\u2019re one of the few to fall in love with a hunter. You said. Just couldn\u2019t help myself. And he felt the same. We made it official and it\u2019s only gotten better. She said. Right\u2026. You said. </span></div></div>",

When you left Gavin with Isabel, you double back and snuck back inside. You look to see Isabel standing over Gavin with her hand glowing. You disappear and reappear behind her and punch through her gut. Ugh\u2026.! She said. Stay away from my brother, you bitch. You said. You pull your fist out and knock her to the ground. H\u2026.how did you\u2026.? She said. When we first met. Reacting so quickly to my attack is what caught my attention. Then when you put Gavin to sleep, I felt the magic inside you was higher than it should be for only knowing one spell. You said. Coincidences! I\u2019m not a witch! Gavin would have killed me, not marry me. She said. Actually\u2026. That\u2019s not entirely true. Gavin said getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nG\u2026.Gavin\u2026. You knew? She said. When I first saw you. The government was taking me out of a job. So what better what than to find witches than using one of their own? He said. B-But how did you even find them? She said. All those time you put me to sleep, I was just storing it to find your sisters. When I gathered enough, I used let it all out and see the resonance of any magic user. He said. A long con. Devious. So what do we do with this one? You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, wait! Gavin\u2026.. You can\u2019t say there wasn\u2019t something real between us. All those years we spent together. Birthdays, anniversaries\u2026.. They meant nothing to you? She said. I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t feel bad about using a witch to find others. Makes me look bad at what I do. And it does sound like a waste to just throw it all away after so long. He said. See? Even though you were using me, you did have feelings for me. And we can show that hunters and witches don\u2019t have to be eternal enemies. Our marriage proves we can get along. She said. (This bitch is so close to crying I can smell the tears.) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s your wife, Gav. Think she\u2019s lying through her teeth? You said. I\u2019m his wife! I have no reason to lie to him! She said. Let say\u2026. I do listen to you. How do I know you won\u2019t do this again? He said. I won\u2019t! You know when I say something, I mean it! She said. I say take an insurance policy. Seal off her magic. You said. Trust but verify. Nice. Delfaro. He said putting his hand on her forehead. Dark lines run down from her head to her stomach and burns a circle on her. Ugh!! She said. There. That should do it. Guess that means I win every argument from now on. He said. Damn hunters\u2026.. She mutters. You hit her right in the cheek. Say it again and you get a kick to the throat. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where to now? Gavin said. France. I hear it\u2019s lovely this time of year. If you can get pass the smell of cologne and perfume. You said. Tell Remi I said hi. If he\u2019s too busy looking at art in the Louvre. Right. Sotsis. You said. You teleport right into France and instantly cover your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus Christ\u2026. These fucks need to lay off the damn fragrance. My nose is about to fall off. You said. (One of the reasons why the French can\u2019t win a war.) He said. Remi should be have a glass of wine at the Louvre. You said. You head to the Louvre and look for Remi until you see him admiring a piece of Art. Hey, Remi. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsn\u2019t it magnificent? All this art untouched and unspoiled. He said. Hard to believe in a world like this, creativity still strikes. You said. Beautiful. Even in this\u2026.desolate world of ours. Masterpieces like this continue to shine. He said. Aren\u2019t you an artist yourself? Still putting witches body parts together? You said. Alast, my artwork will never be in the halls of the greats. Uncultured swine don\u2019t know fine art when they see it. He said. Speaking of swine, I have a knife that needs pigs to cut. You said. You\u2019ll find our sworn enemy a little difficult to reach here. He said. Why? Are they a protected class? You said. Actually, yes. He said. (That\u2019s it. I\u2019m taking you to Vegas.) He said. Here, witches are the wealthy 1%. All those fancy mansions you see are all owned by them. He said. Shit\u2026 I bet they have some insane taxes to pay. So everyone bends the knee to them? You said. There are a few people who don\u2019t like the influence they hold on society, but the swine are so well liked, no one would dare to think doing anything against them. He said. So basically, everything starts and stops with them. You said. Take this place. A wonderful establishment. Tainted by their influence. It receives a large amount of money monthly from one family if it accepts all their paintings. He said. That must be a kick in the nuts to you. You said. Only fuels my hatred for them. But\u2026.. That gives me an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that is? You said. I can\u2019t go an kill them. Everyone will know and my art will never get accepted, but if they are killed and I\u2019m nowhere to near the crime\u2026.. He said. Your hands are clean and you can have your art admitted. You said. I\u2019ll show these cavemen true artist. He said. Right\u2026.. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(So the rich here are witches and we\u2019re about to go make their day horrible. I get the feeling we\u2019re trying to start a revolution.) He said. (Revolution would mean war. Class war, and it\u2019d be a one sided war.) You said. </span></div></div>",

You hop the fence and head to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Damn\u2026. Look at this. Well-tended gardens, a fountain, a gazebo. Shit\u2026.. I bet the servants have servants.) You said. (They aren\u2019t afraid to flash their money around. But they shouldn\u2019t. Might attract some\u2026..unsavory people.) You said. (Like us. By the way\u2026. When are we getting a fountain in our mansion?) He said. (They don\u2019t make fountains that spew blood\u2026\u2026or chocolate.) You said. (I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a spell for it.) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to the door and pick it open. In the clear\u2026.. Now I just need to find my target. You said. (What if everyone here is a witch?) He said. (Then we go on a spree. We don\u2019t stop until we\u2019re drenched head to toe in blood.) You said. (And it\u2019s not my birthday yet.) He said with glee. You crept around slowly as you look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThink I found her. She\u2019s the only one dressed in formal wear. You said. (Formal? She looks like she walked right out of 18th century England.) He said. (At least she\u2019s dressed for a formal event. A funeral.) You said. You sneak up behind her and punch through her chest. Ugh\u2026..! She said. Time to join your sisters in hell. You said. You pull your arm out and kick her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Well\u2026.. That was easier than I thought. Why can\u2019t it always be this easy?) He said. (Only because they\u2019ve never been hunted before. They\u2019ve gotten complacent.) You said. You look at the blood that is pooling and get an idea. (What are you planning?) He said. (Watch.) Izbundi. You said. The blood starts to rise up and flies towards the wall and spell out what you are thinking. (Rich doesn\u2019t equal untouchable. At least for us that\u2019s true.) He said. You sneak out and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hunt down and kill a few more until nighttime hits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve been busy. News of your kills has hit. Nice message you left. Let these swine know they can\u2019t be touched. Remi said. No one is untouchable. You said. That\u2019s true. You\u2019ve got them running scared. Some even refuse to come out in public. He said. Just makes it easier for me. And you as well. This place will have to take in your artwork soon. You said. Without those hell spawns in the way, I\u2019ll be among the greats. Leonardo, Picasso, Raphaelle\u2026. Soon. He said. Just have your art at the ready. You said before leaving. You head to another mansion and scope it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like this one has some extra security. Guards literally at every corner. You said. (And a intercom at the front door. No way of getting in without being in a penguin suit.) He said. (Or looking like one of the guards. Be a dummy to only have them on the outside.) Sporif. You said. Your body starts to become light until you disappear. When a breeze blew through, you reappear on the other side of the gate. Easy part\u2019s over. You said. You look and find a lone guard and knock him out. You take his clothes and head to the front door. One coming in. He called. The door opens and you walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Inside. Now I need to find the head of the house.) You said. (More guards on the inside. Maybe a distraction\u2026.) He said. (No, that will put everyone on alert. We have to do this one with no one being the wiser.) You said. You walk around like a guard while looking for your target. (So far, so good. Still no sign of her.) You thought. You go up some stairs and peek inside each room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This woman has a smoking room and a wine tasting room. What\u2019s next? A croquet field?) He said. (You got it. Right out back. And some are playing now.) You said. (I bet they have men strapped to the ball. Wouldn\u2019t put it pass them to do something sadistic like that.) he said. You keep searching until you come across a door that isn\u2019t lock, but won\u2019t budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWon\u2019t move\u2026.. Magical lock. No problem. Just need to- You suddenly feel your body freeze in place. What the?! You said. Et qu'est-ce qu'on a ici? Un voleur? A femine voice said. You turn your head if you weren\u2019t frozen like a block of ice. Until she puts her hand on your cheek and turns it for you. (Of fucking course\u2026.. Just didn\u2019t expect a witch to be patrolling on the inside.) You thought. (They really think highly of themselves. That white dress looks like it\u2019s made of the finest material.) He said. Vous ne ressemblez pas \u00e0 un voleur. Trop....beau pour \u00e7a. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Any idea what she\u2019s saying?) He said. (Not a clue. I took Russian, not French.) You said. She slides her hand down your chest and you see a gleam in her eyes. (She\u2019s got that same look Luke gets when he gets a new skull.) You said. (Chance she does the same?) He said. Beau ou pas, vous devez \u00eatre puni pour avoir viol\u00e9 et utilis\u00e9 la magie. Je suis s\u00fbr que madame Charlotte ne m'en voudra pas d'avoir pris et apprivois\u00e9 un intrus. She said. (Only thing I understood was Charlotte.) You said. (It\u2019s all gibberish to me.) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then kisses you on the lips and smiles. Right after she pulls away, blood spatters onto your face. Ugh\u2026.! She said. She looks down to see an arm through her and a hand clutching her ripped out heart. Noone\u2026. NOONE is allowed to kiss him like that except me. Heather said before crushing the heart and shoving the body to the ground.</span></div></div>",

And what do you want? You said. It was only a matter of time before you went on your first hunt. You didn\u2019t even ask if I wanted to come along. She said. Why would I ask a witch to come along? Makes no sense. Just like talking to you instead of killing you. You said. Really? You think you can muster the will to do so now that you\u2019re a hunter? She said. You appear at her chest with your knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026Well? She said, waiting. Grrrr! Leave before I change my mind. You said. And stopped short again\u2026. I knew we had something.

The fact you\u2019re talking about it is infuriating. And it\u2019s not a code. It\u2019s guidelines. You said. Well, whatever it is, you have to do what I say. She said. Like hell I am! To a witch no less! You said. Really? You\u2019d break the rules of the hunters? She said. We don\u2019t have rules. Freedom and its choices are all we need. I choose to go on my first hunt. I choose to do it alone. I choose to kill the witch that lives here. *Steps closer to Heather* I chose not to kill you today so you can continue living your wretched life. *Steps back* And I chose not to let you, a witch of all things, have her way with me.

He said. (No, but everyone here knows who the one percent is.) You said, leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have accomplished so much in only a two day time. Remi said. I aim to please. Keeps me in business. You said. The swine are so scared that I was able to play you off as a threat to get into the event tonight. He said. There\u2019s an event tonight? You said. An art show! I\u2026.negotiated my way in and now the whole world will see my masterpieces! He said. That\u2019s got to be good for you. You sand It gets better. The pig who\u2019 been blocking me the entire time will be there. He said. The one who donates to this place. You said. Precisely, this is long over do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMon amie! We can both get what we want tonight. My art admitted, and the death of another pig. All I ask is that you let me kill her. He said. Alright. Let\u2019s do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh\u2026. I look like a penguin. I hate formal events. You said. But you are dressed for success. Now, I will be next to the painting showing my art. He said. So what does this lady look like. Hard to miss her. Her nose will be up in the air and smell like lilacs. And she always has a glass of red wine. He said. Alright. Let\u2019s kill us a witch. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both go in separate direction and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPfft! This is what Champaign taste like!? It\u2019s awful. Your dark half said. Shut up, and look like you belong. He said. Ugh\u2026. Why are these penguin suits so tight? Is this what it\u2019s like to be important? He said. Pretty much. The suit makes the man. You said. You both hear Remi start talking and showing his art work. Remi\u2019s not a bad painter. Even if he does use witch blood as paint. What\u2019s his artwork called? He said. One of them is called Double Nature of Man. It\u2019s suppose to show the good and bad in people. You said. Should come to America. See all the bad and good there. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stake out until you see some woman with a glass of red wine and looking like she\u2019s the most important person in the world. I think we found our lady. Red wine, almost stepping on someone. And a powdered wig? He said. That\u2019s her real hair. See the roots? You said. But it\u2019s bigger than the Washington monument. What woman has that much hair to style it and still have enough to reach her waist? He said. Anime girls. Now let\u2019s go. You said. You both merge and mingle with the crowd and grow. Remember, in synch. You said. I know. You said. You both grab her by the mouth. Temporis. You said. Time comes to a sudden stop and you both disappear to the back of the museum. As you say the spell to seal her magic, she disappears. What? How did she-Urgh! Your dark half said as him and you are trapped in a magic stasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo\u2026. You\u2019re the one whose been going around killing us. She said. That\u2019s right. And you\u2019re next. You said. So that little art wannabe Remi called in another hunter? I was positive that goes against one of your many rules. She said. Shows what you know about us. You said. I know enough. I know that your kind is deep seated in rage and vengeance. Blind rage and vengeance. She said. Justified. Not blind. Your witches have this coming. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally? And what crime have I committed to warrant death? Being born a witch? Keeping little Remi from having his art admitted? She said. I\u2019ll take the first one for 300, Alex. You said. Proved my point. You really won\u2019t be satisfied until I\u2019m dead. Even though I\u2019ve done nothing to you. She said. That\u2019s how it works. Just like my job. You said. Even if it means the total breakdown of society? She said. I don\u2019t give two shits about society. You\u2019re my only concern right now. Just like the others\u2026.. Blinded by petty revenge, and only thinking of right now instead of the future. She said, appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this is where it gets you! She said. She waves her glowing hand and you felt a sharp pain in your chest. You see no weapon, but your heart feels like it\u2019s been pierced. Destroy the heart and snuff the fire. Only way to kill a hunter. She said. She waves her hand again, but is stopped by a hand reaching out off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nW\u2026.what sort of trickery!?! She said. Man, you witches are dumb as rocks. You said. Your dark half comes out of her slowly and breaks her hands. B\u2026..but how did\u2026. You did this when you first grabbed me. She said. We got a winner. The one next to me is just a clone I made. It was all over the second you let us get close. You said. Looks like you didn\u2019t think of the future. Your dark half said. I\u2019m not done yet\u2026.! I can- She\u2019s interrupted with a sharpened paint brush through the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMort aux porcs non cultiv\u00e9s. Pour les chasseurs et l'art! Remi said. The ends of the brush start to extend and wrap around her and start siphoning out her blood until she\u2019s all withered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2026..have long dreamed of this day. I thank you mon amie. He said. The world\u2019s a little brighter and better with each one dead. You said. It is for me. But not the world. There are still more than need killing. He said. They will Remi. Go. The masses are waiting for you. You said. I owe it all to you. Don\u2019t hesitate to call me. He said. Stronger together. You said.</span></div></div>",

Almost like they are afraid of interacting with each other.) He said. (Need to find Heinz. Can\u2019t start until then.) You said. You look around for him until you come across a graveyard and see a lone figure silently crying over a gravestone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..She wouldn\u2019t want you to put your life on hold, Heinz. You said. *Sniff* She was my only love. My desert rose. I never loved before and she showed me how. We talked about marriage, kids, everything a couple does when they plan their future together. She said. She would have been an excellent mother. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part of it all\u2026. It happened on the day I asked the question. I went to find the best spot to have our wedding. Come back to find my darling butchered like a cow in a slaughter shop! It was an initiation to them, but it was murder to me. And that\u2019s not the worst of it. They send little notes and messages with small details of how they did it. They taunt me and spit on her name! He said.  He stands up from the grave and you see him fully in his trench coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know why you are here. Your first hunt. We all go through it. But these rabid dogs are mine! My buttercup\u2019s death will be avenged! He said. I won\u2019t defile a man\u2019s wish. Especially where the dead sleep. I\u2019ve been to these more times than I can count. You said.  You conjure up a few white flowers on each grave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if I brought you the person or people responsible for her murder? You said. Heinz snaps to attention. I\u2019ve been looking for them ever since, and they elude me every time I get close! He said. They won\u2019t get away from me. My profession is getting to people. And killing them. You said. \u2026\u2026How good are you? He said. You heard about the French losing their wealthy people? All me. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..Find them. Bring them to me. Do NOT kill them. Hurt them if you must, but nothing fatal. He said. Done. Free of charge. How many were there? You said. My beloved said there was two of them. Sisters by blood. Both blonde and- Say no more. I know how to find them. You said, disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancisca\u2026.. My sweet\u2026. I\u2019m sorry\u2026. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Free of charge? Even I thought you\u2019d charge him.) He said. (That wasn\u2019t the place or the time for it. His lover\u2019s death affected him greatly.) You said. (So how do we find them?) He said. (Heinz\u2019s lover was killed as an initiation. A way to see if the two could go through with it. They aren\u2019t going around killing random people. It\u2019d lose its reasoning.) He said. (\u2026\u2026I have an idea. What if, and stay with me here, it was a hit?) He said. (A contract killing? But Heinz said she was brutalized. Too messy for a contract.) You said. (Unless it was to send a message. Heinz can barely hunt over it.) He said. (Then why send two people and not one?) You said. (Heinz said they were sisters by blood\u2026. They must have gone as each other\u2019s confidante.) He said. (\u2026..Then we\u2019re dealing with contract killers. And the best way to get them is to become a pain.) You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out your phone. (A phone call?) he said. (No. A gambit. Let my clientele find me first. Provide the same benefits at a cheaper cost. Less money, but Heinz deserves the closure.) You said. (This might attract more than just those two.) he said. (Only way to get there attention. \u2026\u2026Post.) You said. You wait a second before getting 4 messages. Already. Let\u2019s do this. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou work quickly and without rest; completing one contract after another. Until you get the message you were looking for. Bingo. A contract on yours truly. You said. (Hopefully they send the sisters and not some random.) He said. Now for the trap. You said. You go into a random empty building and set up. Ok. Now to make this look like a hideout. You say a spell and a weapons rack, laptop, burner phones, and guns appear in the right places. Now\u2026.we wait. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit at the laptop and look through the contracts until you sniff the air. We got visitors. You said. You disappear just as the door creaks open. You see two woman who look identical to each other in every aspect except one has blue eyes and the other brown eyes. (Identical twins\u2026. No wonder Heinz had a hard time.) You thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook like we just missed him, Olga. One said. I hate it when they run. Drags it out longer than I like. Olga said. And where\u2019s the fun if it\u2019s easy. The other sister said. No point in dragging out the suffering, Helena. Olga said. You can\u2019t say that. Remember that one Russia? You can\u2019t say you didn\u2019t enjoy his screams. Helena said. I didn\u2019t. Olga said. (Only time I\u2019ll ever agree with a witch. No need to prolonging the kill. Just do it and move on.) You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you can\u2019t say that about our first kill. You were so excited about it, you went over board. Helena said. You mean\u2026..her. Olga said. Yeah. Her. Send a message to her lover, but you went crazy. Helena said. She wouldn\u2019t stop screaming! And she kept crying\u2026.. I wanted her to shut and let me think. Olga said. (Found them\u2026..) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd shut she did. You beat her to a mess and ripped out her vocal cords with your bare hands. Helena said. (Damn\u2026. Can I shake that one\u2019s hand first?) He said. (The stench won\u2019t wash off.) You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s see if this laptop says where he\u2019s going. Helena said. As she searches the laptop, you slowly appear behind her. That\u2019s an invasion of private property. You said. You grab her arm as she swings. You breath in and blow out a purple mist in Helena\u2019s face. Ugh\u2026..She said falling unconscious. As the mist starts to fill the room, Olga covers her nose. Voltumos\u2026.! She said. An extreme gust of wind breaks the window and carries the mist out. You throw your knife and she dodges it. You appear next to her and she dodges your fist. She goes to attack when your dark half comes out and sucker punches her in the jaw; knocking her out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth blonde, this one has blue\u2026\u2026other has brown\u2026.. Yup, these are our girls. He said. Alright, let\u2019s get them out before they wake up. You said.</span></div></div>",

How did you find them in such short time? He said. They\u2019re contract killers. Your lover was marked. You said. A hit? My buttercup was killed over money!? He said, furious. Seems like it. I wasn\u2019t able to find out who marked her, but it turns out they\u2019re an organization of them. All of them witches. You said. It would explain the low frequency of them. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeinz walks over to them and slaps them. Wake up! Sleep when you\u2019re dead! He said. Ugh\u2026.. Ow\u2026..! Helena said. Ohhh\u2026\u2026 What hit me? Olga said. Heinz hits both of them. I\u2019m the only one asking the question here! How much? What was my fianc\u00e9e worth!? Heinz said. Fianc\u00e9e? Oh\u2026.. If it isn\u2019t Heinz. How\u2019s being a widower? Helena said. Heinz replies with punch to her nose. Who marked her for death? Who wanted my wife dead? Heinz said. And why would we do that? Helena said with a smug smile. Heinz starts to brutally beat her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeinz. That\u2019s enough. She\u2019s not going to tell you who placed it. You said. She will! I just haven\u2019t beaten it out of her yet! He said. She\u2019s not going to tell you either out of principle or you out pay her client. Trust me, I\u2019ve been in this situation. You said. Heh\u2026. *Spits blood* I bet\u2026..your girlfriend\u2026\u2026is glad to be away from you. She died with a smile. And thanked us for it. Helena said. Helena! Olga said. Heinz grabs her head and his hands start glowing. Rgh\u2026.! You think\u2026.you can\u2026. AHHHHHH!!! Helena screamed. Heinz. That\u2019s enough. You said. NO! She hasn\u2019t suffered enough yet! He said. We\u2019re not them. We don\u2019t drag out the suffering for a sick laugh. You said. Heinz grits his teeth and let\u2019s go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only mercy you\u2019re receiving is a quick end. More than you deserve. He said. (Man\u2026. I was hoping for a stay of execution.) He said. You have my thanks. My beloved will soon sleep easy. He said. No problem. You said. \u2026..This won\u2019t solve anything. Olga said. Oh great\u2026. You said. It will only lead to more bloodshed. All the killing won\u2019t fix anything. It\u2019ll just lead you down a path filled with despair and regret. Olga said. (I\u2026.think that\u2019 directed at you.) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t talk like you know us. You bitches don\u2019t do anything but ruin lives. You said. And that stops today! Heinz said. You walk away as Heinz arms start to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(So where to now?) He said. (East. Or more direct, Russia.) You said. (Russia\u2026.. Well, at least you know the language. And handle a drink.) He said. (Plus, Valenski\u2019s up for parole.) You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou disappear and reappear in Russia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, the Kremlin. Massive as it is corrupt. You said. (I wonder how communism would work in this world? Where\u2019s Ivan held at?) He said. (Difficult to capture a hunter. Holding one down is another, they\u2019d have to do what Luke went through, or make a special cell for him. Last I heard, they had him in a gulag.) You said. (Wow\u2026..) He said. (And there is only one gulag left running. Saved for the worst of offenders.) You said. You head to the gulag and scope it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniper towers, spotlights, a machinegun nest? And a heavy set of door?  Why would they need those two? Bullets don\u2019t have any effect on these giants. He said. I think the defense are more of keeping people in than out. Valenski\u2019s a troublemaker. Or as they say it, enemy of the state. You said. Enemy of the state? High treason? He said. He killed a few jar heads. I don\u2019t know how they got him. Valenski\u2019s always been a cautious one. You said. Vodka and a whole loaf of bread? He said. He\u2019d have to share it with everyone. Stay here. You said. And do what? Sightsee? He said. Watch for reinforcements and do what you do best. You said. Oh. Ok. He said.</span></div></div>",

(Go back the way you came and take a right. You'll come across a huge door, hard to miss.) He said. Thanks, Ivan. You said and knock him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLockdown in the female ward. Something\u2019s not right here. You said. You follow the direction you were given and see the huge door. The prison is split. Why would they need this? You said. You push on it and it doesn\u2019t budge. Not locked. This door is one way. Opens on the other side. Like that will stop me. You said. You punch a hole in the door and step through. You follow the path to the cells. Christ\u2026. Look at all of them. This side is on maximum lockdown. You said. You try to sense out Volenski, but can\u2019t. Something\u2019s blocking me. Have to find him the old fashion way. You start walking around and staying out of sight as all the guards here are female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk, you sense a faint trace of magic. You follow it to a dead end. Something\u2019s\u2026..here. You said. You place your hand on the wall and a magical seal appears. Then the wall starts to turn into a cell and in that cell, you see Volenski. Volenski? Volenski. You hear me? You said. He doesn\u2019t responded. You go to pry open the bars when you feel your magic being sapped. Sealed. A lot stronger than the one that held Luke. It\u2019s mind seal. Only two ways to break it. Overload it with magic or undo the seal. And to do that, I\u2019m going to be locked inside my head with my fears until I overcome them. A lot of magic will be used to overload it. Too much. It\u2019ll leave me winded for too long. So it\u2019s a trip into my psyche. Wonderful\u2026.. You said. You put your hand on the seal and you fall on your knees with a black expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to a dark place. Ugh\u2026.. That trip was sudden. You said. You stand up and see yourself. Well, this is a shock\u2026. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much darkness in you\u2026.. And yet\u2026. There is good inside you. A voice said. Good? Me? Wrong guy. You said. Do not hide behind lies. Magic reveals all. You could be so much, and yet you refuse to. It said. You sound like someone I know. Sue? Is that you? You said. There is no Sue. Only we and you. It said. We? You said. Your fears, your doubt, all of it. It said. Your mirrored self waves his hand and the area changes into M district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook around\u2026. An entire civilization destroyed because of you. It said. I didn\u2019t destroy anything. You said. And yet, you did nothing as it was laid to waste. Their cries ignored, their pleas on deaf ears, even their own savior came to you and yet you said no. It said. I\u2019m no hero. And it wasn\u2019t my fight. You said. Not a hero? Then explain this? It said. Your mirrored self waves his hand and the area changes back to home. Do you remember this? You save the town from that rampaging giant. Isn\u2019t that the trait of a hero? It said. My reasoning wasn\u2019t to save the town. It was to get revenge for my friend. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevenge, anger, hatred, greed\u2026. All of these things are inside you. Yet you have the potential to be a shining example. Why don\u2019t you? Are you scared of being idolized? Having people depend on you? Or\u2026.. Is it that you just can\u2019t? It said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026It\u2019s\u2026..not that I can\u2019t\u2026.. I don\u2019t want to. Chijinda\u2026.. He was a good guy. Hell, I thought he was a real-life superhero at one point as how good he was and he was hiding his superpowers. Then\u2026.. One day. He\u2019s gone. His death drove me to a dark place. Only caring for myself. Too afraid to let anyone close out of fear of losing them. You said. And to stop the pain, you become the same evil you sought to do away with. You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain. Sue\u2019s been both and look how she turned out. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen what about those people? Your friends\u2026. What are they to you? It said. \u2026\u2026I didn\u2019t want them at first. I didn\u2019t want a repeat. I kept them at an arm\u2019s length at first. Hell I left them in desolate in the outskirts to see how long they could survive on their own. Part of me hoped they did die out there. But as time went on, I started to care again. The feeling of friendship came back. The hole in my heart couldn\u2019t be fixed, but it could be filled with new things. The people who are with me aren\u2019t my friends. They are my family. I won\u2019t let any harm come to them. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why save a few and not everyone? What made them so special to warrant your attention? It said. You can\u2019t save everyone; You\u2019ll drive yourself insane doing so. Save all who you can, but don\u2019t get yourself killed doing so. They came to me and didn\u2019t preach to me. They wanted help, so I did. You said. And if this\u2026..Sue character\u2026.. If she didn\u2019t preach to you, would you be more incline to help? It said. \u2026\u2026No. I\u2019m no hero. I\u2019m not some savior. I\u2019m just some guy. Who wanted to be alone. You said. Your mirrored self disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink and come too. And sudden return\u2026. You said. You see the seal broken and pick open the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolenski? Shit mind trap. You said. You say the incantation and place your hand on Volenski. You absorb the sealing magic and see Volenski come too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolenski? You all there? You said. Ugh\u2026.. My head hurts\u2026.. He said. Side effect of the mind trap. Come on. You\u2019re up for parole. You said. Heh. How do you think I got here? He said. He steps out the cell and a alarm goes off. That doesn\u2019t sound good. You said. This place is about to be flooded. Let\u2019s go. He said. (I got Volenski. Keep the entrance clear.) You said. (On it.) Your dark half said. You both make it to the giant door and go through the hole you made. You both clear the way to get outside to see a row of bodies lying dead and small fires everywhere. Already more excitement than when I tried to escape. He said. You both phase through the fence and get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhhh. Freedom at last. Volenski said. How did you get caught in the first place? You said. A trap. They built a fake coven and I walked right into it. You said. A fake coven? You said. Right, not from here. Witches are militarized here. He said. Wait. You telling me witches are jar heads here? You said. Every single one of them. Why do you think I\u2019m so careful? He said. An army of witches at the government\u2019s call? Expected no less from the motherland. At least they won\u2019t be hard to find. You said. So if they\u2019re military, then all we need to do is attack the country. Your dark half said. And start an international incident. You said. Not like they\u2019re going to invade the USA. He said. They won\u2019t. They prefer to defend Russia than attack a country. Volenski said. So we got nothing to worry about except a human wave of witches? You said. Da. He said. Well, it shouldn\u2019t be that bad. Side by side with the man who wrestled a three headed serpent to the ground with his bare hands. You said. Heh heh\u2026.. That was over 300 years ago. And it was a young serpent too. Volenski said. Now you\u2019re being modest. Come. We kill these jar heads, then we drink until we can\u2019t see in front of us. You said. You sound more Russian than me. Volenski said.</span></div></div>",

Public enemy number one trapped in one place? Same way they got you. You said. If you say so\u2026. He said. I know so because he comes the red army now, and they rolled out the red carpet. You said. What do you see? He said. Lots of tanks, infantry, APCs, and\u2026..only 3 witches. Dressed as spec ops. You said. Do you see a red flaming skull patch? He said. \u2026..Yeah. You said. Shit\u2026. Not playing around this time. He said. You\u2019re quite popular, Vol. I can never get this kind of attention. You said. If this is being popular, I\u2019d rather be unliked. He said. Well, get ready to share. Ready? You said. A full blown massacre\u2026.. Do you have to ask? Your dark half said. Remember as soon as those three go in, you can have all the fun you want. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait patiently until you see the three witches move inside. Volenski. The witches are coming in. You said. Ok. I\u2019ll do my part. He said. Just as they are clear, a magic barrier seals them in. There in. Go. You said. Your dark half jumps down and lands on a tank. Hello, filthy commies! He said. You roll your eyes and head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see multiple holes in the walls. Damn, Vol. You said. You hear a loud crash. Oh, boy. You said. You follow it to see Volenski. *Grunt* Filthy.*Punch* Disgusting! *Punch* Pigs! *Punch* Damn, man. You didn\u2019t waste any time. You said. Can\u2019t. Not with death head squad. He said. Death head? You said. Elites in the army. Not the best, but one of them. You said. How many of them are there? You said. 15. Now only 12. Luckily, they have high standards, so we won\u2019t have to worry about them getting new members. He said. I think a little extra is needed. Help me with this. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..You sure this was a good idea? He said. What better way to announce you\u2019re out and about? You said. And the dog tags? He said. Just\u2026.something I do when I kill military personnel. Come on. You said. You both head outside to see the military presence destroyed. Dead soldiers, destroyed vehicles\u2026.. Really does look like an invasion. Volenski said. Then you see a tank and your dark half comes out the hatch. Hey! The commies were overwhelmed with joy to let me have this! He said. Well, ride with style. You said. Truth be told, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve ridden one of these. Volenski said. You both hop on and ride the tank away from the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, Vol. We made news. You said. They got my bad side as well. He said. Well, look at what they\u2019re call you. Local terrorist. Is that we you get called for doing a public service? You said. I\u2019d gotten a medal by now. He said. Well, they\u2019re still plenty out there.  Medal of honor is still possible. Get all the vodka you want with that. You said. I\u2019d do it even if the vodka was free. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what\u2019s the plan this time? Volenski said. We bring them to us. You said. And how do we do that? He said. Lay waste to capital. You said. What? He said. There\u2019s too many to bait into traps. Soon enough, they won\u2019t come at all. We need to get them while they are still gullible. You said. And attacking Moscow is the way? He said. Is it a problem? You said. No. Just making sure this wasn\u2019t a last minute thing. He said. I think in advance. Not during. Besides, being put in a mind trap must have angered you. Reliving the same nightmare over and over again. Only being let out for an hour or two then right back in there. You said. Alright, alright. No need to push anymore. I\u2019m all for it. He said. Ok then. Let\u2019s go. He said. You both build up magic in your hands and throw it into the sky. It combines and expands into a giant ball of energy. Let the death rain. You said. The ball moves and firing down smaller ones all around and exploding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm. All these screams remind me of my sacking days. He said. (Death and destruction. With the screams of the innocent. Ahhh. I love days like this.) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the city is layed to waste, it doesn\u2019t take long before your query arrives. There they are. Let\u2019s not keep them waiting. He said. No, let\u2019s outsource this one. As much fun it would be, we don\u2019t want to be here all day. You said. Let a giant ball of raining death do our work for us? Not as enjoyable, but time efficient. He said. You both concentrate and funnel more magic into the ball until it turns purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems like they are trying to disperse it. Volenski said. Don\u2019t let them. We keep it up, it kills them for us. You said. You both keep the ball in the air as it rains down explosive and fiery death. (Ahh\u2026. The screams of innocents. And burnt flesh\u2026.) He said. You both manage to keep the balls of energy in the air until the place is in ruins. Not sensing anyone. You? You said. No. Let\u2019s go. Volenski said. You both jump down onto the streets and look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne witch, two, three, Damn\u2026. You said, pulling off dog tags. What are you doing? Volenski said. Oh\u2026.. I\u2019m taking their tags. It\u2019s\u2026..something I do when I kill military personnel. They\u2019re still witches though. You said. You about to take another one when she starts moaning. Got a live one. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh\u2026. W\u2026.why? She said. You know why, dragon skin. Don\u2019t think aloe vera is going to fix that. You said. It\u2019s\u2026.because\u2026..we\u2019re witches\u2026.. She said. Got a smart one. You said. What\u2026.did we do to *gasp* warrant death? She said. Being a damn bitch. You said. We\u2019ve done\u2026.nothing but\u2026..protect the motherland. That\u2019s\u2026..all we wanted. She said. And locked me up in a mind trap. Volenski said.  Did you tell him why? After\u2026..what you\u2019ve done?! She said.  \u0427\u0442\u043e \u044f \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b!? \u0412\u044b, \u0431\u043b\u044f\u0434\u044c, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420! \u0422\u044b \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c, \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0447\u0435\u0437\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0447\u044c\u044e! \u0422\u044b \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043a!

I\u2019d still be in that trap and behind on kills. He said. We hunters have to stick together. Only so many of us left. You said. Right. Only so many\u2026. He said vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back to see a lady in a back dress standing a good distance from you. She stares you down for a second before disappearing. (Stalker much?) He said. (She looked at me like she got a personal problem. Let\u2019s go. Hiro\u2019s waiting.) You said, disappearing.</span></div></div>",

You sense someone behind you and block a sword with your knife. Heh\u2026. Nice to see you, Hiro. You both sheathe your weapons. You need some casual clothes. Ninja\u2019s aren\u2019t around anymore. You said. Even though he\u2019s covered in full black and ninja gear and his face is hidden, you can still tell he\u2019s staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re\u2026..on your first hunt. He said. Yeah. Had to go sooner or later. You said. Where\u2019s\u2026..Luke? He said. Back in America. I came alone. You said. And he was fine with this? He said. No. He protested heavily. You said. You think you can handle the ones here? He said. Wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t. You said. \u2026\u2026You are just like your father. He said. Luke says the same sometimes. I wouldn\u2019t know since I only seen him once. But I\u2019m here to hunt. Not talk. You said. You think you\u2019re ready for them? He said. I am Ready for anything they throw. You said. without saying a word, Hiro vanishes and the world starts to become disoriented. What the? You said. Soon, the world changes into a school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2026.know this school. The high school case. You said. You walk through the open doors and see a cell with someone inside. C\u2026.chijinda?! You said. He doesn\u2019t responded. Hang on. You said. You pry open the cell doors and immediately, he comes at you with his hands on your throat. You\u2026..left me! You let me die! He said. I was\u2026..on my way. You said. You weren\u2019t fast enough\u2026.! Do you have any idea what they did!? He said. I\u2026 I\u2026.! You said. You failed to save me! He said. His voices repeats until you snap back to reality with your own hands at your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are far from ready. Hiro said. How did\u2026. You didn\u2019t even say anything. You said. When you become more experienced, you don\u2019t have to say anything. Just think it. He said. I see why Luke holds you in high regard. Master. You said. You tell yourself your over it, and you\u2019ve been trying to, but deep down, you refuse to accept it. He said. I want to accept it, but\u2026\u2026 How do i? We\u2019ve been through so much together. Lived through so much. You go through so much to the point where you think you can\u2019t die. Until it happens. You said. Death is inevitable. And it\u2019s not an easy thing go through. And even harder to go on. We don\u2019t have to forget the people we lost, but they wouldn\u2019t want us to put our lives on hold to mop around and be miserable. He said. I know that\u2026.. But\u2026.. If I let go then I have nothing left. You said. You don\u2019t have let go, just move on. He said. \u2026\u2026Teach me. You said. I can not help you come to terms with the demons in your life. But I can help you with stand the terror tactics used here. Along with other things. He said. Let\u2019s do it. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro takes you to a field full of trees and has you sit. Close your eyes and empty your mind of all thoughts. He said. You do as he said. Good\u2026.. You\u2019ve connected yourself to the world around you. Now\u2026.. Expand that reach to the world. You concentrate and for a few seconds feel the entire movement of the world. I feel it\u2026. You said. What do you feel? He said. Every life, every breathe\u2026.. All of it. I feel the entire world. You said. Good\u2026.. He said. As you explore the experience, you feel a sharp pain in your back that rips you out of concentration. Ugh\u2026.! You said. You pull a throwing knife out of your back. You didn\u2019t move. He said. I couldn\u2019t sense the attack. There were so many connections to shift through. You said. While your reach is expanded, so are the connections. You must sharpen your mind to know exactly where the disturbance is coming from. He said. Again. Repetition is the path to success. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try again and again with multiple knives in your back until you finally caught the knife. Good. Again. He said. You connected to the entire world and Hiro throws three knives this time. You catch them with ease. Hiro throws more knives; this time from multiple directions. You sense the danger and dodge them one after another. Hiro then pulls out his sword and runs at you while creating no sound. You sense him out and dodge his blade. He swings again and you step back. You continue to dodge his attacks until he stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery good. You\u2019ve done well. He said.  Thank you. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witches here are fond of using a person\u2019s fears against them. It makes them easier to break and control. And with magic in play, those fears are amplified. He said. So the best way to beat them is to face the fears head on. You said. Yes. It\u2019s the only way to break the terror magic. The frightening thing about terror magic is how sudden it is. You could already be under its influence and not know. He said. So I have to be vigilant. You said. Yes. Always be on guard. You never know\u2026.. Hiro\u2019s voices starts to trail off and become distorted until he\u2019s gone. It is sudden\u2026. You said. You hear rapid footsteps and are tackled to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left me! He said punching you. You let me die! *Punch* What kind of friend lets them die!? *Punch* I hate you!! He said hitting you again. These words are hurting you a lot more than the punches, but you have to face this head on. He then stands you up and flings you into a tree and rams his arm into your throat. What was I to you!? What kind of friend are you!? He said. Ack\u2026. You\u2019re right\u2026.I am the worst friend. You want to know what you were to me? You weren\u2019t my friend. You were my brother. When I lost you, I entered a dark state. I refused to accept that you died. I lied to myself regularly to the point where my mind fractured. All I wanted was my brother back. But that can\u2019t happen. You\u2019re dead. I didn\u2019t want to accept that because I had nothing left. But I know you wouldn\u2019t want me to dwell on the past. All I can say to you now Chijinda is that I will live for the both of us. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you said that, he starts glowing white and he disappears in a bright light that engulfs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink to see you\u2019re still sitting there like nothing happen. Have you come to terms with yourself? He said. Yes. I will always remember my brother, but I must go forward for the both of us. You said, standing up. Take me to them. My hunt has been on hold long enough. You said. </span></div></div>",

And anything unsightly brings them running. Hiro said. Why do they wait? You said. Magic is stronger at night than day. And even more so during a full moon. You can fathom what kind of terrors they strike when those two combined. He said. Well, I\u2019ll be doing a public service and the construction company\u2019s job for them. You said. You disappear and reappear on the ground and walk inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This place is worse on the inside than out.) You said. (Paint peeling, ceiling caved in, giant holes in the walls, reeks of fear, death, and piss stained pants. They sure know how to make a place home.) He said. You walk up the creaking stairs to the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got a live one. A voice said. Ohhh! He\u2019s cute! Can I have this one? Another said. I want him broken and on his knees. Another said. (You hear that?) You said. (Yeah. Giggling Japanese girls means only one thing. Tentacles. Lots of them.) He said. You get to the second floor and the stairs behind you collapse in. (They\u2019re playing with us.) You said. (I have no intention of being someone\u2019s plaything.) he said. (Unless her name is Miley.) You said. (I\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026.. Shut up!) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to one of the many doors and turn the knob. Almost too scared to open. You said. You crack the door open and peek inside to see no one. Clear\u2026. You said. You open the door to see a hole leading to the room above and a beam leading up there. That\u2019s\u2026.convenient. You said. You walk up to the beam and stop before you step on it. (What is it?) He said. (Watch.) Volentis. You said. Your open your hand and it glows as magic flies from it into your hand. (Terror trap. Second you step on that beam, you locked in.) You said. (Shit, it\u2019s going to be like Okinawa. Watching where you step.) He said. You walk up the beam and into the room and out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only cute, but smart! A voice said. (Aw shit.) You said. He\u2019s mine. Another said. No! I called him first! Another said. As you walk, you sense something.  Get out of my head, witch. Deltorian. You said. You see her land on the ground. (A rine stone dress? A little formal for a bitch.) He said. My head is the last place you want to be. \u2026..A black dress\u2026. How original. At least you\u2019re dressed for a funeral. You said. She vanishes and you block her hand. She slinks into the shadows. Where are you\u2026..? You said. You then feel a hand on your head. Ugh\u2026. You said. You feel weak in the knees and fall on them. With a wicked smile, she moved her hand down to your neck until her hand started to burn. She steps back and your head turns 180. I told you..... My head is the last place you want to be. You said. You stand up and your eyes turn red. Now you\u2019re in my domain, bitch! He said. She tried to disappear into the shadows but nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTell me. What is your biggest fear? Being powerless? Helpless? He said coming closer. She tries to use a magic spell, but nothing happens. Being useless? Or maybe it\u2019s something more\u2026..practical. He said. She goes to punch him, but he grabs her hand. Not nice. You need to learn some manners. Luckly\u2026. I\u2019m just that guy. He said with an evil smile. S\u2026..stay away from me! She said. Let me show you what real fear is. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, you had your hand on her head and then you heard a gasp from her. You let go of her and she hits the ground dead with a thud. (Well. I had fun. What kind of witch is this?) He said. (It\u2019s\u2026..a shadow.) You said. (A shadow?) he said. (A rare kind of witch. At one with darkness and shadows. They are usually quiet and prefer to be alone. They use shadows to kill. Combine that with terror magic and you have a perfect shadow assassin.) You said. (Soooo\u2026.. They\u2019re like the goths of witches?) He said. (Pretty much.) You said. You look at your hand as the glowing stops and you start walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe killed her. A voice said. A triple package. I\u2019ll make him mine. Another said. He needs to be broken. Another said. Broken slaves aren\u2019t fun. Another said. (I feel like I\u2019m being auctioned.) You said. After walking, you come to a stop and sit down. You close your eyes and connected to the entire world. (They are here\u2026. But where are they?) You said. You sense someone sitting in front of you. Witch\u2026.. You have a lot of guts coming to me. You said. Coming from someone who came here alone. She said. You really think I\u2019m alone? You said. I see no one with you. We know all who step in here. She said. You say that like it\u2019s true. You said. Because it is. This is our home. No one escapes our sight. She said. Our? I\u2019ve only hear disembodied voices. And only seen only one of you. For all I know, you could be a voice too. You said. You feel a hand against your forehead. Am I a disembodied voice now? She said. No\u2026 And you\u2019re a sneak. You think I didn\u2019t notice your shadow bind when you touched me? I should knock your head off your shoulders if I could move. But you can\u2019t. And you won\u2019t. You\u2019re not going to lay a finger on your new masters. She said. Really? What makes you said that? You said. Because I didn\u2019t only bind you when I touched you. I marked you with our symbol. And anyone marked by it becomes ours. She said. Sneaky\u2026. You said. So now there\u2019s no escaping now. You\u2019re ours. She said. That\u2019s ok\u2026.. Because you\u2019re mine. You said. Your body slumps to the ground. What?! Argh!!! She said as your arm burst through her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGullible <br>\r\nMust be a common thing among you witches. You said. How\u2026..did you\u2026.? She said. You didn\u2019t find it weird why I came to a stop and sat down? I was looking to see if someone would take the bait. And you did. In fact, you help me a lot. When you touched my clone\u2019s head, you basically linked me to all your sisters. And with that, I sealed them in the shadows they hid in. You were such a big help. You said. Y\u2026.your plan was a gamble? What if I was just a voice? You said. Then I\u2019d just sense you out. I figured it out when your sisters taunted me. They hid in the shadows like rats, but when they talked, I could feel their magic source faintly. The second time I heard them is when I learned why I couldn\u2019t find them. They were projecting there magic force to random spots. You said. You\u2026..learned that from just listening? She said. No\u2026.. I had help from one of my fellow hunters. You said. H\u2026.Hiro\u2026. She said. Ding. But I\u2019ve talked long enough. It\u2019s time to cleanse your soul. And this building and the best way to do it is\u2026.. You said as she burst into black flames. Fire. Black fire. You said. You head back down as the black fire starts to intensify into a raging inferno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step out of the building as fire consumes the entire building. Cleansing by fire\u2026. Purify their doomed souls. He said. It\u2019s the only way, master Hiro. More than they deserved. You said. That is not for us to decided. He said. Yes, master. I suggest we leave before we\u2019re noticed. You said. You both vanish as the building crumbles.</span></div></div>",

I know the guys miss us. And Mira and Miley must be worried sick.) He said. (Well, our hunt is over.) You said. You head to Mira\u2019s house first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get through the door, you are hugged immediately by Miley. That was a record. I didn\u2019t even get my other leg in. You said. Brother\u2019s back! She said. As she said that, Mira comes running and joins Miley in hugging you. She kisses you on the cheek. I should go away more often. You said. We have you been? You have any idea how worried the two of us were? She said. Extremely? You said. You\u2019re gone for an entire month and we hear nothing from you. We started thinking you were\u2026. She said. Come on\u2026. You know me better than that. You said. You could have at least sent us a post card or something? Mira said. If I said, \u201cMira, I\u2019m going away for a month or so and there\u2019s a high chance you may never see me again.\u201d Would you have let me go? You said. No. They both said. And that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t tell either of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley, I think he needs to punished for making us worry about him. Mira said. I think so too. Miley said. Aw, come on. I didn\u2019t make you suffer THAT much? You said. The only way I could sleep was by crying myself to sleep. Mira said.  And I could do anything knowing my brother was out there somewhere. Miley said. Ok\u2026.. Maybe I can be a little more truthful. You said. A little!? They said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, ok! Can you just keep it within reason? You said. That device on your wrist\u2026. Does it take calls? She said. Yes\u2026. No. It\u2019s not for that kind of communication. You said. Well, we can also keep you here and have our way with you for an entire month. Mira said. You wouldn\u2019t\u2026. You said. I would. Having you do exactly as I say. At my beck and call. She said with a smile. Uh\u2026. I\u2019m sure Miley wouldn\u2019t like that. You said. I like it! She said. You know I hate that servitude shit Kyle enforced. You said. It\u2019s either that, or you get us one of those devices. Mira said. Ugh\u2026.. F\u2026.fine. Give me a day to get them. You said. (Wimp!) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re on your way back to the mansion when your hand glows and stop 3 shadow tendrils. You\u2019re going to need a lot more than basic shadows. You said. You see a shadow spot on the ground and out of it comes that witch you saw back in Russia. You jokers are more useful at night than during the day. Too easy to spot you. You said.  (She\u2019s not towering over us like the rest.) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t enough to spread misery here. You had to go to other places. She said. Misery? I didn\u2019t spread that. All I did hunt. You said. You\u2019re just like your father and other hunters. Blinded by your own selfish need. She said. Selfish? I haven\u2019t done anything selfish. You said. You\u2019ve thrown the entire economy of France upside down by killing there 1%. She said. Well maybe the 1% shouldn\u2019t have been witches. Besides, it\u2019s France. Revolutions happen there every week. You said. And Russia. You destroyed an entire city and basically took out 70% of their military. She said. 70%. Not 100%. And it\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s going to invade Russia anyway. You said. You don\u2019t have the clairvoyance to know that. She said. Actually, I do. And you\u2019re a stalker. You said. You think going around killing to sate your anger will sit well on your conscious? She said. It was never about anger, it\u2019s vengeance. You said. So how many of my sisters need to die until you\u2019re satisfied? She said. Well, I\u2019m not the only hunter out there, but for me personally, I\u2019d have to say\u2026\u2026all of them. Including you. You said. You toss your knife at her and she dodges it and binds you in place. She then feels a sharp pain in her back. Argh\u2026.. She said. Keep your eye on the ball. You said. She then disappears in a shadowy fog and the binds disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fake made of shadows. You said as she appears. Guess I shouldn\u2019t mess around then. You said. You will answer for your all your crimes one day. All you hunters will. She said disappearing in a cloud of darkness. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Well, she\u2019s something. And you saw the way she looked at you? It was like you killed her mother or something.) He said. (They\u2019d both be dead if I did.) You said. You pick up your knife and head to the mansion.</span></div></div>",

Cut a hole in the glass and jump down. Voluntis. You said. You land on the ground without making a sound. Your eyes change and you quickly disappear and look around. You see Dante tuning his sniper rifle. Easy. You said. You appear behind him and grab him. 5 seconds. You said. He twist your hand and elbows you to make it a bit easier to toss you over his shoulder. Good. Sleep. You said as he falls to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou disappear and find Tom and Cody with a skull in each hand. You appear behind them and grab there heads. 3 seconds. You said. They hit you with the back of their fist and twist your arm and kick out your knees. Sir! Tom said. Nice. Sleep. You said. They both collapse on the ground. You look and find Hank with some box in his hand. You pull out your knife and run up behind him. Never thought I\u2019d do this\u2026. He said. 3 seconds. You said with your knife to his throat. He stomps on your foot and head butts you and wrings the knife out of your hand as he toss you over his shoulder. And Tom calls me old. He said. Excellent. Sleep. You said. He hits the ground with a thud. You take his side pistol and your knife and disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find Bruce walking out of a room. 1 second. You said, appearing in front of him. He swats your hand away and tackles you to the ground and knocks the gun out of your hand. Sir! You\u2019re back. He said. And you\u2019ve been keeping up. Now, sleep. You said. He falls over to the side asleep. You disappear and go looking Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find him in his skull collection polishing his skulls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sneak up behind him and reach for him when he swings his arm back followed by a black mist. The mist makes you choke and you appear as Luke rams you through the door. I\u2019m almost insulted that you use something basic like that. He said. I prefer the word\u2026..bait. You said starting to glow. Luke quickly backs up. (Terror trap\u2026.. That\u2019s a new one. Hiro\u2019s been teaching him.) Terusha. He said. Luke\u2019s body starts to glow for a few seconds before it stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here I was thinking you weren\u2019t going to learn anything. He said. I was with other hunters. Veterans and experts. I was bound to learn something while out with them. You said. Especially with master Hiro. He said. Being the oldest among the remaining hunters, he has a lot of wisdom to spare. You said.  And the others? He said. Well, Heinz is still grieving, but I helped him find the people. Volenski is free from the gulag. Remi\u2019s art is finally in the Louvre. And Gavin is married. You said. Married? Gavin? I never thought that gigolo would find someone. Last time I saw him, he was seeing 4 women at once. He said. Oh he did. He did what my dad did. You said. A witch? Did he know? He said. He said he knew since day one. He was using her to find her sisters. You said. Did he at least sealed her powers? He said. Oh yeah. I made sure of that. Now all we have to do is find someone for you. You said. I told you I\u2019m not in the market for love. He said. There\u2019s someone out there for you. I think a lovely shadow might suit you. You said. The day I marry a witch is the day the sun turns to ice. He said. Icci-Don\u2019t. He interrupts. Hehehe. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear fast footsteps. Aw shit. Luke said. Coming at you full tilt was Em. She must have heard your voice. She moves Luke out the way and grabs you and hugs you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Master!! You\u2019re back!) She said. Ugh\u2026. Nice\u2026.to see you too, Em\u2026.. You said. Damn, Em. You\u2019re worst than his mother! Luke said. She looks at Luke then back you. (It\u2019s what she wanted. Someone has to look out for you.) She said. That\u2019s\u2026..why Luke is here. You said. (He\u2019d leave you dead in the streets if it meant getting a new skull) She said. I heard that! Luke shouted. You two still go at each other. Can you two get along? You said. (Not when he has a stick up his ass.) She said. Not when she\u2019s literally a demon spawn. She\u2019s lucky Orex doesn\u2019t rip her spine out. He said. If that\u2019s true, you have to let me see you in demon form. You said. (It\u2019s not\u2026.pleasant. And I don\u2019t want to scare or scar you.) She said. Em, I hunt witches. It can\u2019t get any worst then that. You said. (Alright\u2026. But not today. I need to make sure you\u2019re alright.) She said. EM! Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Those two need to just need to fuck and let that be that.) He said. (Disgusting\u2026..) You said.</span></div></div>",

You weren't the only one.... If you're not here to gloat, then why? You said. I want to hear it from you. She said. From me? So you can psycho evaluate me? To hear how everything came crashing for me? To make fun of me at my lowest? You said. I tole you i'm not petty. All i want is to heat the story from you. SHe said. You want to hear it, go to Luke. He was there as well. You said. No. I want to hear it from the horse's mouth. She said. You're lucky i don't bite your head off. You said. Just start talking. She said. Why? Why should i tell you anything? So you tell your sister to have a good laugh? You said. I'm not here for that, damnit!! She shouts as her voice echos. You know, for a shadow, you sure are loud. You said. My name is Kat. She said. She breathes in and out to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook..... All i want is to hear it from you. Help me understand your nature. She said. So that's why. Trying to understand my actions. Hmph. You said. Is that so wrong? No magic, no weapons, no affiliations. Just you and me. Two people have a conversation. She said. ......Fine. No laughing, side remarks, or snide comments. You said. Very well. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sigh* Where to start? You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7 years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the moon hangs high in the night sky and shines brightly, you are breaking out in a cold sweat. No.... I'm..... You said in your sleep. The voices of all the people you've killed for various reasons call you out. (Monster. Murderer. Killer. Devil.) They said. No..... Leave me alone....! You said. When there faces materialize, you snap awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pant* *Pant* *Pant* You said. You look at your hands to see blood on them for a second. (Olga was right.... It wasn't going to end well for me.) You thought. You push Mira's arm off you and walk down onto the edge of the bed and sit. You look out the window at the moon. Full one tonight...... You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour rustling had stirred awake Mira as her eyes opened. She sees your not in her arms and on the bed sitting. She reaches for you and you touch her hand. This had become a sign to her that you didn't want to be touched right now. She pulled her hand back and moved next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's wrong? She asked, worried. I can't sleep. I'm going out. You said. Just tell me. Maybe talking will help. You said. Mira.... What do you of when you see me? You said. What do you mean? She said. o you see a good person when you see me? A....killer? A monster? A fucking- Whoa, slow down. She interrupts and picks you up in her hands. Where is all this coming from? She said. I've.....been having these dreams. They make me question myself. You said. How? She said. I've never....done the right thing. Hell, i can't remember the last time i made an actual right choice. I've only done things that were good for me. Does....that make me horrible? You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. Look at me. She said. You look up at her. You've always done what was right by you. You know what i see when i look at you? Someone whose heart is in the right place. I know you try to do right, and how hard it is. I can vouch. I had my dark thoughts before. She said. You did? You're not just saying that? You said. Of course. You think i'm perfect? She said. Uh..... You said. Mira blushes a little. W-well, i'm not. I've had my dark thoughts before. I almost acted on them once. She said. You did? You said stunned. Yeah. I wanted to see why it was so exciting. All my friends were doing, so i wanted to see what it was like. I pressed him with my finger and i was enjoying it. I felt that power rush my friends all told me about. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what stopped you? You said. I was going to seal the deal until i heard a crack and a scream. It snapped me right out of it. I didn't think i'd cause that much suffering. I thought it was quick. It wasn't. I put him down where he wouldn't be found. I never went t back to m district again after that. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow.... You said. See? We all have our dark places. None of us are 100% good. We just have to balance it out and not let one override the other. She said. Hearing her say that is encouraging. Thanks, Mira. You said. She kisses you on the head. Now let's go back to sleep. She said. She lays back down with you and gently strokes your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, you wake up in another sweat. *Pant* *Pant* Damn.... You said. You push Mira's arm off you and get up. You head to Miley's room and see your dark half sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWake up. We're going out. You said. Ugh.... What's the occasion? He said. Get up. You said. I don't function well without my sleep. He said. You don't need sleep. And Miley will be here when we're back. He said. Fine.... He said. He goes inside you and you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(So after all these years, now being good is weighing on your mind?) He said. (You're not the one who's haunted by voices and visions.) You said. (It wouldn't happen if you just shut down your emotions.) He said. (Easier said than done.) You said. You get to the mansion and look around. This must symbol some good i've done. You said. You head inside and see Tom and Kris sleeping together on the couch. Heh..... He's not going to believe that. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk through the mansion to see everyone is out like a light. Even Luke. Which is a rare sight. (Feel like we're stalking and creeping on everyone.) He said. (We've just for a welfare check. And my piece of mind.) You said. (Those are usually done in the morning.) He said. (Right.....) You said. When you were done, you left and headed to.....</span></div></div>",

They went to town on this place. You said. (Without Sue and her band, they had a field day.) He said. (Guess they really were M district's last line of defense. No wonder Sue kept coming to me.) You said. (Regrets?) He said. (No. I just didn't know the how serious it was.) You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk the streets, you see a think purple mist. That's not normal... You said. It bigger and inches closer and out of it comes Ashley. (Sue....) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou!! She said. Sue. It's been a while. 2 years, i think? You said. 2 years, 5 months, 15 days, and 14 hours. She said. Kept time too. But i guess that's all you can do when in hell. You said. You should be there! After everything you've done, you should be burning! She said. Now, that's hurtful. Don't tell me you're still mad. You said. I have every right to be mad! Not only was it bad enough to turn your back, but you killed my friends as well! She said. I told you before. It's not my job to keep this place protected. That was yours. And if you didn't work with Kyle and locked me up, your friends would still be here. You said. I wanted to peace for everyone. I begged you to protect m district, but that was a mistake. I should have known better than rely on a hunter's humanity. She said. Now that's slander. You make it sound like we're all killers. You said. YOU ARE!!! ALL OF YOU HUNTERS ARE!!! She shouts. (Jesus Christ.... We are right here, you over sized sack of emotions.) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's a mistake i'm going to correct right now. She said. Really, Sue? Will your bleeding heart let you go that far? You said. It doesn't bleed for hunters. She said. ......Fine. I'll humor you. In fact, i'll stand still for you so you can brag that you got a hit on me to your friends in hell. You said. RGHHHHH!!! I'LL KILL YOU!!!! She shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appears in front of you and grabs you. She starts to squeeze you and places her other hand around to add more pressure until her hand opens and you slice her fingers off. Ahhhh! She said as you land on the ground. Come on, Sue. Could you try not to be basic? You said. She growls as her fingers regenerate. I'll show you basic. She said. She punches the ground and create a wave of purple energy. You disappear as it got close and reappear behind her. Got you! She said. She turns to punch you and you try to move, but can't. (Binding circle. Damn....) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fist goes into your chest and she rips out your heart. Surprised you even have one. She said. Not black like yours. You said. I'd watch what i'd say. Because i destroy this, and all your magic goes away. She said. You know that's not how you kill a hunter. You said. Oh, i know how to deal with your kind. She said, crushing the heart. Snuff the fire, destroy the heart. And i'm going to take my time snuffing that fire. She said. Heh..... Good luck with that, Sue. You said before collapsing on the ground. What!? She said. You appear behind her and grab her head. You bitches are so gullible. You said. You!!! She said. Let's see how you handle a little bit of terror. You said.Your hand glows and you let go of her. She starts to look around frantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo.... I just wanted to protect you. I always had the best interest at heart. She said. A protector's worst nightmare: The people you protect turning against you. You said. No.... I'd never.... She said. You punch her in the gut and in the back of the head. Can't stand being the bad guy, huh? You said. I....hate you.....!! She said. Get in line, Sue. Who summoned you? You said. She goes for you and you punch her a few times. I asked you a question. You said. Wouldn't you love to know? Come on.... Give me all you got. She said. You hold out your hand.....and point it at a building and blast it. The cascading blast leaves nothing in the area. NO!! She said. Your heart still bleeds for them. Even in death. You said. You.....monster! How many lives did you just take!? She said. You can see them again when you go back to hell. But not after you tell me who brought you back. You said. She lunges at you and you bind her with chains. GRRRRR! She growls. All this ends with you. You said. Fuck....you! She said. You fire another blast at a building. Seeing this, Ashley screams at you and try to get you. You snap your fingers and the chains become fiery chains. AHHHHHH!!! She screams in agony. Ready yet? You said. Screw....you! You said. You aim at another building when the chains vanish. What the? You said. You duck in time as she lunges at you and rolls to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What the hell happened? I didn't cancel the spell.) You said. (Look. The moon.) He said. You look up at the moon and see a curse symbol on it. (That's not suppose to be there.) You said. You look at Ashley and see her marking all over her body and glowing. (Something not right here. Sue's magic is through the roof. A lot higher than it should be for her.) You said. I'm going to kill you....! And dance in your blood!! She said. (More voodoo black magic shit.) He said. Ashley comes charging at you. .....Come on. You said.</span></div></div>",

He walks by the couch to see Tom and Kris asleep and rolls his eyes. He heads into his collection room. The room is lined with multiple shelves of skulls.Each with a story of their own. The only place i feel alive..... He said. He starts to dust and polish each and every one of the skulls until he was satisfied. He then walks out of the room to see the moon light coming through the window. Night already? I need to put a clock in there. He said. He walks back through to see Tom and Kris are still there. Lazy assholes.... He mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he's about to turn away, the front door creaks open. The fuck? He said. He sees a purple mist creep inside. Purple mist....? He said. The mist becomes thicker and bigger as it inches closer. (What's going on? Why is there purple mist here? No body does that kind of an entrance except.....) He said. Luke's eyes shoot wide. Oh no..... He said. He takes a step back as he sees the figure in the mist. Hello.... Luke. The person said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou block Ashley's arm and slam her into the ground. You jump back as she tries to sweep you off your feet. (Something's not right here. Sue's gotten faster and stronger. I almost can't keep up.) You said. Rghhh! She said, hitting the ground. Lines in the ground start to sprint towards you and out pops multiple energy tethers. Shit..... You said. You dodge and duck them as best you can until you disappear. That won't save you! She said. You reappear in front of Ashley and head butt her and move to the side as the tethers pierce through her stomach and wrap around her. All wrapped up like a present. I'd return you. You said. GRRR!! Joke while you can! When i get out of this......! She said. I wouldn't bet on it. Later. You said, pushing her over and disappearing. RHAAA! YOU COWARD!!! She shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear at the mansion and open the door. Luke. Luke! Where are you?! You said. No reply and he doesn't appear in front of you like normally. Damn.... Luke!! You shout. You look to see Kris and Tom are gone as well. Guys? Luke? You said. You start to  search for them until you come across Luke lying down on the ground. Luke!! You said. You run over to him and check his body. He still has a pulse. You said. (Who did this to him?) He said. (I don't know. But for Luke to be this badly hurt....) Luke. You said. He opens his mouth but nothing comes out. What is it? Who did this? You said. R....r.....r.....run.....Lilith..... He said. Lilith? You said. Did someone call my name? A voice said. You see a mist cloud come in and out of it you you see a woman in a red dress and black knee high boots, waist length red hair and piercing green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take it you're Lilith? You said. I am. I must say, Alex. This is a wonderful mansion. Who did you kill to get it? She said. My name's not Alex. You said. But you look just like him. Unless..... Oh my god..... Are you his son? She said. I am. What of it? You said. Do you know who your mother is? She said. Leah. You said. Oh all the people my daughter could have....and she went with a hunter. She said. I'm not gong ho about having a mother as a witch or a grandma. You said. Please. I'm not that old. Just because i'm 900 years old doesn't mean i'm a grandma. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough! Why are you here? You said. To take advantage of the Harmonious moon. She said. Harmonious....moon? You said. Luke never warned you? Always slacking off.... A tragic tale behind it, but i don't want to bore you with it. It's a whole night of hunters becoming the hunted. Their magic is cut off and they become vulnerable. She said. So you came back to settle a score? How did you even get out of hell? You said. I've long outgrown pettiness like that. And as for escaping..... There was this girl who was brimming with hatred. I mean the look on her face and body language..... It was like she was rage incarnate. She said something about some guy who was selfish and killed her and her friends. She said. (Sue....) You thought. In all my time of being alive and facing hunters, i learned something. Hate is the perfect supplement to magic. So i used her anger to summon her to living, and she did the same for me. And here i am. She said. But that's only temporary. You'll go back after the day is over. You said. That's where you're wrong. The Harmonious moon slows down time. And while it is temporary, it can become permanent. All i have to do is find someone to take my place. She said. You're going to let someone else take your place in hell? You said. It's not like i can choose some random person. I have to find someone who's life is  worth mine or greater. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you're trying to make this permanent. You said. Not only that, but make myself a little kingdom for myself. And this mansion is the perfect place for it. She said. You're going to take my mansion over and turn it into a castle? You said. A queen deserves only the finest things in life. And what's a queen without a few servants? She said. When she said that, you see your friends walk in with black expressions. What have you done to them!? You said. Just a little reassurance of who they now serve. Especially this one. She said, walking up to Kris. This one has a lot of violence in her just looking for an outlet. She said. One of your eyes turns red from your anger rising so high. All except this one.... She said, snapping her fingers and Em appears out of purple mist and bounded by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one right here won't bend the knee like the others. Even though she is a demon, she should know who her betters are. She said. (Master.....) She said. No matter. I have my castle, my bodyguards..... All i'm missing is a right hand. She said. You're won't be needing one. You're going back to hell! You said. Really? I think you should hear me out before doing something rash. She said. You want me as your right hand man. You said. I'm very rewarding to those who knell before me. You can be my second, and have anything you want in the world. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take my friends from me, and now you want me to bow to you!?! You said, as the other eye changes red and the ground starts to shake. Oh? She said. FORGET IT!!! You said. You charge at her full tilt. That's it..... She said, smiling.</span></div></div>",

You said. You quickly set her on her knees as you start to heal her. Such willing servants. I didn't even need to say anything. Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim! It's me. Remember? You said. C....c.....command.....commander..... She said. You see her trying to fight free. Yes! It's me! All of you! It's me! You said. Comman......commander......! The rest said. Impressive.... No one has ever been able to fight off my mind control. They must be extremely loyal to you. Which makes it even better. She said. You..... Stay away.....from my friends! Kris said, breaking free. She goes to attack Lilith, but is frozen in place. Such fire in those eyes..... I'll mold you into the perfect weapon. She said. You won't be molding anything! You said. You attack her, but she grabs your hand. Just like all the others. Prone to anger so quickly. Let grandma solve that. She said. Her eyes glow white and she grabs you by the throat and places her hand on your head. You then feel like your energy is being sucked out of you as your eyes change back to normal. She gives a cruel smile as this goes on for 5 more seconds until a moving shadow pushes you two apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat!? She said. She dodges multiple shadow spikes as the push her back. You fall on your side and the shadow quickly engulfs you and flees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh.... Only one person can use a shadow like that..... But she's done nothing but give him more borrowed time.

She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gasps* You said. You breathe heavy as you come too. Christ.... What happened? You said, getting up off a bed. What the hell? A bed? Where the hell am i? You said. My home. A voice you recognized. Heather.... You said. You reach for your knife to see it's gone. Looking for this? She said, appearing with your knife in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the people i have to deal with..... You said. Relax for once. I'm not here to for your head. She said. You expect me to believe that? For all i know, you could have brought me here to torture me. You said. One: I don't torture. If i'm going to kill, i kill. I'll take my time, but i'll kill in the end. Two: Look at my left eye. You've seen me when i loss myself. It would be glowing pink. She said. Rgh..... Fine. Where's the door? I have things to do? You said. You're not leaving. She said. And why is that? You said. Did you not see what that....devil was doing to you? She was snuffing your fire. You said. That's what she was doing? You said. Yes! What else would she being doing? She said. Magic isn't my only weapon. I have others. You said. You think that will work on Lilith? What does Luke do with you? Does he tell you anything? She said. What so special about her? Is she that bad? You said. The worst. She's manipulative, a liar, thief, killer everything! She caused three of history worst wars because she was bored! She enslaved multiple villages and towns to worship her as a god or wipe them out. She said. You fuckers still do that now. You said. No! We never threaten anyone with death. We don't do mindless slaughter. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genocide of the elves? The ethnic cleansing of the mermaids? The assimilation of the vampires? And need i bring up the pixies and fairies? All that was mindless slaughter just so you bitches can be number one in magic. I don't agree with the decisions that were made back then, but we come far since then. She said. Right..... Are done preaching? I've got people to save. You said. I said you're not going anywhere. She said. And you're going to stop me.....? You said. You can't use magic during the harmonious moon. She said. I don't need it to beat you. All i got to do is destroy your heart. You said. And with one word, i can have you frozen in a block of ice or put you in a coma. You'd be stuck like that until i say so. She said. If that was the case, you'd done it by now.. Move! You said, shoving past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't want to do this, but you won't listen! You owe me! She said. I owe you want? You said, stopping. For saving your life. Twice. By your code, you have to listen and do whatever i tell you as long as it has nothing against the hunters. She said. We had this conversation before. Freedom, and its choices. Something your kind doesn't understand. I'm not giving myself to you, a witch no less. You said. Which is why i have a backup plan. She said. What plan? I'll tell you mine. Getting the fuck out of here. You said. You go to the door only to see a seal pop up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally? You're putting me on lock down? You said. You won't listen to reason. I tried to be nice, but that didn't work. So i did this. She said. This isn't over, witch. I'll get out of here! You said, walking off. Not this time. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......There. That should make sure you all be obedient servants. Lilith said. She looks over everyone as there eyes glow yellow. All except you. Why do you fight me so hard, demon? You know how this works. Lilith said. Em snarls at her. (I'll never be mind controlled or dominated by you! I only serve my master! And when he comes back, i'll help him claw out your heart!!) She said. I wouldn't count on it. He smarter than other hunters, so he knows what will happen if he comes back. Lilith said. (That won't stop him. You don't know him like we do.) Em said. We'll see. Lilith said. Just then, the front doors are kicked open by an irate Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is he!? She shouts. You know, there is this thing called knocking. Lilith said. I'll knock hit head off his shoulders! Where is he!? Ashley said. You missed him by ten minutes. He escaped. Lilith said. Where? Where did he run off to? Ashley said. I don't know. He was whisked away by a shadow. She said. Argh! He could be anywhere in the world! Ashley said. Save you anger, Ashley. And think. Where would he go after something like this? Lilith said. .....He'd look for a way to turn this around. Which means he would go to other hunters. She said. Precisely. He'd go to his fellow hunters for support. Lilith said. It won't do him any good. I'll take him and any other hunter with him on the express trip to hell. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. Let's think about this. You want him dead. And i need a replacement. He's going to go to his fellow hunters...... Lilith said. What are you saying? Ashley said. You still want to protect m district and want peace, right? Lilith said. More than anything. But that can't happen with him around. Ashley said. What if i told you i found a way to bind a person to forever serve? Lilith said. What are you getting at? She said. You know the hunters would never do anything good or right by choice. Well, imagine this. All the hunters at your beck and call. Ready to protect M district or any person in the world. Finally using there powers for good and right instead of themselves. Lilith said. That.....does sound good. Wait. That won't last long. Once the moon's over, they'll get their magic back. Ashley said. Not if a seal is put on them. Once their magic is sealed off and under your control, you can give them there all their strength and speed back. Lilith said. .....It does stop them from using magic, but not being given it.... So let him go to the other hunters and capture them and bring them back to you? Ashley said. And he'll have to come running. If not for his friends here, then for his brothers. Then you come in, have your revenge however you like and you walk away with loyal subjects just waiting for your word. Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only would he be taken care of, but the hunters under her control and finally using their magic for good instead of themselves. It was too good not to take. Fine. I'll get the hunters. But once this is all said and done, and you get your kingdom and all, you leave m district alone. Ashley said. I know. I wouldn't cross you. She said. Ashley then disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet. Enjoy playing fetch and protector while you can, little girl. Soon, the entire world will have only one queen that they will bow to. Lilith said.

I can't bust down the seal unless i have the magical force behind it. And i have no magic. Wait.... You said. You try to get your siren marking to show, but they don't. Ok.... That's plan A. You said. Your eyes change optical, but you feel a painful surge. Ahhh!! What is this?! You said, grabbing your head. It's like.....somethings trying to gouge my eyes out! You said. You manage to change your eyes back. And.....there goes plan B. ......Fuck. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's got to be a way out. I refuse to be held captive! You said. As you brainstorm, you remember something while you were with Gavin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's a witch, Gavin. How does the idea of sex with her not repulse you? You said. I wasn't for it either. I throw up when I thought about it. But it's something a gentleman has to do. He said. Gentlemen don't get in bar fights. You said. One time. But anyway, it was something i had to do. She....is my wife after all. You said. So.... Is it any different that with a regular woman? You said. Much. It's a lot of feelings and passion. Her body tunes to yours. The magic becomes wild and your her only focus. Her job will be to satisfy you in anyway possible. As will you. That's the only downside. Plus, my abilities are 2x better post wise. He said. You mean your magic becomes stronger after sex with her? You said. Yeah. With all that emotion and passion running wild, it has nowhere to go but me or her. After having sex with a witch, you'll never go back to a regular girl. It wouldn't feel the same. He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of flashback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic becomes stronger with all that emotion and passion in the air. I can do that. Only downside is......sex......with Heather. You said in disgust. Your stomach turns and you puke on the spot. But if i want to get out of here, i got to do it. They do it all the time in those spy movies. I think i can handle it. You said. You pull yourself together and look for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow in the fuck can she afford a nice house like this? Her living has a living room. You said. You find her in what looks like a practice room as you see makeshift dummies that have been blasted multiple times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather.... You said. No. I'm not letting down the seal. You can threaten or beg me all you want, but i'm not changing my mind. She said. You walk up behind her and turn her around. She had her hands glowing to stop you, but you quickly pull her to you and kiss her. This shocked her and her hands stop glowing. You pulled her hood off and stroke her long hair. You then brake the kiss. What.....? She said stunned. Heather..... I didn't mean to come off as mean earlier. I was frighten. I still am. I need you, Heather. Now more than anything. You said. Her heart skipped a beat as you said that you need her, and was coming onto her. Finally..... She said. Heather kisses you back and wrapped her arms around you. You want to hurl again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust relax..... And let me make all your fears go away. She said. With you in her arms, you both disappear and reappear in her room and on the bed. She kisses your neck and bites gently on your ear. I'll take care of you. I promise. She whispers to you. She rubs your chest as her hand glows and your clothes disappear onto the floor. And so do hers. I've waited a long time for you to come around. She said. (Jesus forgive me.....) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow.... Let's indulge in each others fantasies. She said as her eyes glow purple. (God.....) You thought as she climbs on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what feel like hours, you sneak out of her bed and put your clothes on. Forgive me, father. For i have sinned. You said. You head to the door and the seal pops up. Please...... After all i've suffered.... Briktakos. You said. Your had starts to glow and you punch the seal and break it. Thank you..... You said. You open the door and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Lilith...... The other hunters must know something. If nothing else, i can help them. You said. You disappear and reappear in merry old England.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they are suffering like i am, they'd be in hiding. I know where Gavin would be. You said. You head to the local Pub. Empty. Lights out, but all the drinks are gone. Gavin..... You said. You head inside and pulled to the side. Get in here and stay down! Gavin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're taking this well. You said. Yeah..... The legendary stoicism of the British is all over my face. He said. Nice to see the moon hasn't stopped your need to drink. You said. Well, best to do what i do best. Drink. He said. Where's Isle? You said. Out there..... Stalking the damn streets for me. He said as you both hear footsteps. Christ..... He said. You peek out to Isabel walking the streets with a demented smile. Gavin~ Where are you? I just want to make sure you're ok. I'm your wife after all. And i don't want anything to happen to you. She said. Sweet words with malice intent. I barely escaped my house. He said. So i'm not the only one with problems. You said. We all suffer under that damn moon. He said. We all are going to suffer. You know a Lilith? He said. Gavin's face goes pale. L....l.....Lilith.... That devil is back?! And walking among us!?! He said. Yeah.... She beat up Luke and has my friends under some kind of mind control. You said. That's the least of our worries! The whole world is doomed! He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she that bad? You said. Yes! She enslaved countless people and towns. Not to mention she's methodical in torture. She picked a damn good day to come back. We're so fucked! He said. Pull yourself together. Nothing we haven't done before. We'll take it one step at a time. First, getting away from your wife. You said.How? She's been tracking me for a long time. He said. Just stay here. You said. You push the door open and sneak up behind Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHehehe.... Gavin~ Come on out, dear. All i want to do is keep you safe. I know your close. She said. You wait until she stops and stab her in the neck and slit her throat from ear to ear. You push her down and bind her to the ground. Let's go! You said. You both run to a safe distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have magic? How? He said. I had to commit a great sin. You said. You mean you.... Oh my! He said. It was the only way i could escape. I need an acid bath. You said. At least somethings are going our way. Soon they'll be going Lilith's way. He said. Not if we work together. We're hunters. We're good on our own. But together, we can do anything. Even kill Lilith. If she died before, she can die again.You said. Hunters back to back. That hasn't happen in so many years. He said. All we have to do is get the others and Lilith will run back to whatever circle of hell she was in. You said. All right then. Let's. He said. Then let's- You're interrupted by a beam that goes through your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh! You said. What the hell? Who's? Gavin said. Ashley appears right behind him and reaches for him. Come here, you! She said. She grabs him just as you recovered from the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin! Argh.... You said. Before you could attack, she disappears. Shit..... You said. You want to go after her, but with the little magic you have left, you'd need to use it wisely. I'll get the others. Then rescue Gavin. You said. You disappear.</span></div></div>",

You open the doors and see the lights are off. Remi? Remi. Where are you? It me. You said. You walk around and find him in the curator room. He jumps when he sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoa! It's just me, man. You said. Jesus.... I thought you were one of those possessed swine. I've been hiding out here ever  since the harmonious moon started. He said. Seen any witches? You said. Plenty. They swarmed this place because they know i spend most of my time here. Even the city police are hunting me. Could this night get any worst? He said. Actually, it can. Lilith's back. He said. The color on his face fades and his eyes go wide. L...Lilith's back!? Of all the things that could happen....! We are all going to die in eternal servitude! He said. Not if we stand together. We've rallied against people like her before. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not like Lilith! It's a good thing her daughter isn't with her. We'd be in great peril. He said. Remi. Did artist like Picasso or Leonardo despair when their backs were against the wall? No. The Mona Lisa. How long did that take? Leo could have thrown his hands up, but he didn't. He kept painting that picture until it was done. We've faced challenges before and come out on top. We'll do it again. You said. ......You're right. The great Leonardo didn't stop painting. I didn't give up until my art was finally admitted. I've stood against the tide, and i'll keep doing it. He said. That's the way. Now, we need to get out of here. Where's the nearest exit? You said. That'd be the side exit. Let's go. He said. You both step out and follow him to the side exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. Now we just need to get out of here. You said. I know a place we can-He's stop by purple tendrils that wrap around him and pins you to the wall. What the fuck? You said. As you hands glow to disspell them, you see Ashley behind Remi. She grabs him in a tight squeeze. Quit struggling! She said. She disappears just as you disspell the tendrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamnit! What is she trying to do? You said. You heal up the wounds and see multiple cop cars pull into the Louvre. Worn out my welcome here. You said. You disappear just as the first car comes to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear in Germany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's only one place Heinz would be. You said. You head to a graveyard to see him next to a grave. Heinz.... You said. I know. But i can't leave her. They'll desecrate her grave. He said. Her grave won't matter when Lilith gets us. You said. That she-devil is back!? At a time like this!? He said. Yeah. She's back. We have to stand together. You said. I'm in. He said. That was.....quick. You said. You don't know how powerful Lilith is. She makes all the evil people in the world saints. Everywhere she goes, she enslaves people. Those who don't bend the knee are put through a hellish torture. And do you know who will do the torture? The people you know. He said. She makes people you know torture you? Not even Kyle would go that far. You said. I won't have the memory of my beloved erased to serve a witch. He said. We serve no one. Now all we need are Hiro and...... Oh shit! You said. What? He said. Volenski! With this moon and the witches in Russia..... You said. Oh my God..... Heinz said. Stay low and out of sight. I'll be back for you! You said before disappearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis moon is the worst. I'll be back for you soon, mien buttercup. He said. But where are you going? A voice said that Heinz recognized. That voice..... It can be.... He said. He turned around to see his lover standing there in a white dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA....Annabelle? He said. Yes.... It's me. I've missed you, Heinz. She said. B....but..... You are... Were.... He said. It was a fake. They took me away from you and used a different body to fool you. I escaped, and been searching for you ever since. She said. My....buttercup..... Heinz said on the verge of tears. I'm here for you Heinz. Come to me. We've been away from each other for far too long. She said. She puts her hand on the ground and he walks onto. She presses him in a hug and smiles. I've.....grieved for for a long time over you. He said. No need for that anymore. I'm here now. We can be together again. She said. Together....again. He said through tears. Hehehe...... Anna said, smiling.</span></div></div>",

The detention center? Volenski!! You said. You rush over there to see it's a warzone. Bodies everywhere. Ammo casings. Explosion marks. Volenski, what are you thinking? You said. You head through the blown off doors and it's even worst on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the prisoners..... Volenski..... You said. You follow the trail of bodies deeper in. That's when the real horror show came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see witches bodies all with holes in there chest. Some ripped in half, others quartered, beheaded, limbs ripped of and shoved through them. My God..... It's a horror show in here. You said. As you walk, you hear the sound of coughing. Volenski? Volenski! You said. The coughing becomes fainter. Where are you!? You shout. You hear the coughing as you get closer until you see Volenski's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolenski!!! You said, running beside him. His body is riddled with bullet holes, burn marks, lacerations,bruises...... Even you are wondering how he lived through it, until you looked at his magical force. He..... He used his anger to supplement his magic. He went world war 3 on them, but why? You said. You put your hand on him and funnel the last bit of magic you had into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gaps!* *Cough* *Cough* He said. He looks over to you. He....hehehehe..... If i knew.....the carvery was coming, i'd brought more ammo. He said. Volenski..... What were you thinking? Doing this on at a time like this? You said. The harmonious moon..... I know. And i know the trouble that.....is brewing. Lilith.....the devil's favorite child is back. He said. Then you know why i'm here. Hold still. You said. No..... No..... It's too late for me. Even if.....i wanted to be saved, i can't be. My.....body is burnt out from using my anger. Not on the outside, but the inside as well. He said. Why.....? Why did you do this?! You said. *Violent coughing* They were coming for me anyway. Choose to beat them to it. It.....was a one way.....mission anyway. He said. We needed you, Volenski. Lilith wouldn't stand a chance against all of us! You said. With all our power, none of us can foresee the future. He said. You feel the magic stop. It's all on you and the others now. Stop her. Before......she enslaves the entire world. He said. His body then slumps over. You choke back tears and pick up his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carry him all the way to the entrance and see a murder of crows overhead. You put him down on the ground and place your hand on his head. Spirits of the old, guild our fallen brother's soul so that he can finally be at peace and free from our sworn enemy. You said. Black shadow arms then rise up and drag Volenski's body into the ground as the crows caw. Then one lands on your shoulder. We won't fail, your lordship. You said before the crow flies off.You disappear and reappear in Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro..... You said. You know where he would be at a time like this. You head outside of the city and into a forest clearing where you see a small bamboo cottage. You head inside and see Hiro on both knees in front of a sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's that time...... He said. Master Hiro...... You said. I know. This Harmonious moon isn't like the rest. I've lived through 4 of them. But this one.... I feel an omen is carried with this one. He said. The omen is real. The she-devil Lilith is back. You said. I knew it..... She has slaughtered and enslaved countless people. And hunters. You're plan is to rally us to take her down. He said. Yes, master. She was killed before, she can be killed again. You said. That is true..... Anyone can be killed. He said. I've already talked the others into it. With you as well, master Hiro, we can send her back to hell. You said. ......I can't remember the last time we rallied against someone. He said. Let's make history again, master. You said. Hiro stands up and grabs his sword. She can't just die this time. She needs to be sealed so she never comes back. He said. We already have to worry about this damn moon. We don't need to deal with Lilith again. You said. Preferably a- The roof starts shake violently. What the? You said. A fist comes through the roof and grabs Hiro. Hiro!! You said covering your head. The hand retracts and is gone. Shit....! You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk outside. Fuck..... What kind of game are you playing, Sue? You said. What the fuck am i going to do now? You said, siting down. This couldn't be just the end of the hunters, but of everything in the world. You sit contemplating until an idea struck you. ......I need to make a deal with another devil.

You kneel before it and it starts glowing and become a dark mist with red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHello, Devil. You said. A hunter? It's been centuries since i last talked to one like this. He said. Because you aren't part of our teachings. That's the witches. You said. Have they gotten to the point where the hunters need my help? He said. No. But to defeat one devil, i need the help of another. You said. You mean Lilith. Hahahaha! She escaped from my domain with the help of a very angry one. She must have died with a lot of hate. He said. I know who you're talking about. I need to speak with Sylvia. You said. And what are you going to do for me to grant this? He said. Nothing. I'm not here to deal with you. Let me speak to Sylvia. You said. Hahahahahaha! That's what i like about you hunters. Never afraid to pick a fight with anyone. Just remember, young hunter. Somethings have a terrible cost. He said, disappearing. A black mist surrounds you and clouds your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your sight returns, you see you a long braided blond haired woman in a beige robe and pants with green eyes and a moderate chest sitting down in front of you. Sylvia.... You said. What this? A visitor? I don't get those. She said. This isn't a formal call. It's your daughter. You said. Lilith? What has she done this time? She said.  She's enslaved my friends. And soon, she's going to do the same with the world. You said. That's her. I knew she'd be special when she was young. She said. This is serious! You said. I know. I know about your strategy of rallying the hunters against her. It won't work. She said. How do you..... You said. Child, do you think you're the first person to think of doing this? Others have and failed. My daughter knows how you hunters operate. She said. She was killed before. How do we do it again? You said. And why should i tell a hunter how to kill my daughter? She said. Because Lilith won't stop at the living. She wants to control the dead to. You'll be here slave like ever one else. You said. You're bluffing. She said. Do you think i am? You said. She takes a moment to consider your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's say i do believe you. Why should i tell you anyway? You said. Because i'm you're great grandson. You said. Grandson!? She said. She examines you as her eyes glow a dim blue. You.....are my great grandson. So.....my daughter had a child. She said. Focus Sylvia. How do i stop your daughter? Do you really want to be a slave again? You said. ......I have one condition. I want to be alive again. She said. What? You said. You heard me. I want to live again. My life was cut short at 300. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n......Fine, but i have one of my own. No games for a throne. You said. Just tell me to stop breathing. She said. I'm serious. That's why you're life was cut down. Poisoned because you were obsessed with that fucking gold throne. You said. You judge me because you don't know my actions. You have no idea what the Pantifs did. She said. They weren't the ones who waged a 30 year war so they can sit on a damn golden throne. You said. And yet, your lord sits on a golden throne. How many people did he killed to get his ass in one? She said. He didn't wage a senseless war. And only kept the kills to witches. You said. So if i only kept the deaths to the Pantifs, i'd be entitled to a throne? She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook, we can argue semantics until the moon becomes red, but the longer we wait, the more time Lilith has. You said. You didn't agree to my terms. She said. Neither did you. You said. .......Fine. No games. She said. Then we have a deal. Now, talk. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood. She said. What? You said. The hatred and anger you hunters have only fuel her. At the same time, you'll be exhausting yourself; making it easier for her to snuff out your fire. The only way to stop her is a pure heart not tainted by hatred. Not tainted by hatred..... That would explain why Argus wasn't the same after he fought Lilith. You said. You're right. She said. That was the victory that established him as lord, but he never had any significant reaction to witches anymore. You said. He knew he'd follow in hunters before him if he fought in anger. So he did what no other hunter at that time was able to do. Forgiveness. He forgave the one who curse him to forever wear his golden armor. And with nothing to fuel his anger, his hatred dried up. Lilith had nothing to feed off of. She was still a threat, but...... Well, he's not called lord Argus for a reason. She said. A heart....not tainted by hatred. .......I think i know what to do. You said. Remember our deal, grandson. You bring me back to life after my daughter is dealt with. She said. I know. You said before the mist clears and the symbol stops glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up. I know what i must do. You said.</span></div></div>",

There's enough evil in the world, and we don't need your kind spreading it even more. She said. You're going to kill them. I doubt it, bleeding heart. You said. I told you.

Should do it more often, but under better circumstances. Hiro said. Is Heinz here? He wasn't back in Germany. You said. Alexis moves her leg and you see Heinz sobbing in the corner. What.....happened? You said. He was tricked.....brutally. Ashley used the visage of his dead lover to capture him. He's been like this ever since he got here Gavin said. Heinz..... You said. Where's......Volenski? Hiro said. H......he's..... You said. It just gets worst for us. Remi said. Volenski..... Of all people i thought would live through anything. Alexis said.  I released his spirit. We'll mourn him later. Right now, I need to get you guys out. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a plan? Alexis said. I do. I need you guys to trust me. Ok. Let me- You're then tackled and slammed into the ground. You fucking coward! Ashley said. You manage to kick her off you, but she grabbed and tackled you back down. You remember what i promised to do to you? She said. She pulls out a silver locket. I always keep my promises. She said. Her eyes and marking start to glow brightly and you feel a tugging force on you. You see a a black ball coming out of your chest. You fight against her and pull it back until she punches you multiple times in the face. She keeps pulling until she sees it's only half black, not fully. Ashley looks surprised as she was expecting it to be fully black. She takes a moment to think before ripping your soul out of your body. She then says the incantation and locks your soul into the locket before putting it around her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the rest of you..... She said. Whatever plan he has, this better be part of it. Alexis mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 day later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley, you can't just leave him sealed. Susan said. Why not? You know how dangerous he is. And after everything he's done? She said. You know if he did that to me or anyone else, you'd be livid. Susan said. So he gets a pass because it's not fair to him? Ashley said. How long were you planning on keeping him sealed? Susan said. A few....years. Ashley said. Ashley. Susan said. No more than 10. Maybe 20.... She said. Ashley! Susan said. Why are you against me on this? You know how he is. He killed you, me, Kim, Kira, and countless others. What makes you think he doesn't deserve this? She said. Because you put a cleansing spell on the locket. Susan said. H-how did?! She said. As much as you want to, even you don't believe he's fully evil. If you did, you wouldn't put a cleansing spell over that locket. She said. O....Ok, so i don't think he's 100% bad, but he's been doing bad things. Which is why i did this. Ashley said. You can't force someone to be good. It has to come naturally. Like with you. She said. Hey! I wanted to do the right thing. I was tired of killing and enslaving people just because we can. I worked my ass off to earn the men's trust! He hasn't done a damn thing for anyone but himself! She said. It takes time. It can't be something that happens over night. It took you until you were 120 years before you decided enough was enough. Susan said. Before she could say something against that, Kim and Kira come busting through the door and brace against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell's going on? Ashley said. Before they could answer, the door is booted down by your soulless body. Susan sees your eyes are completely black. Did you account for his body coming back for it's soul? She said. Not so soon. Ashley said. As your body walk, Kim and Kira scurry back to Ashley. W....what does he want now? Why are his eyes black? Kira said. Calm down. He's not going to hurt you. He just want what was taken from him. Susan said, looking at Ashley. Ashley grimaces as she holds the locket. The cleansing was far from done, but she wasn't going to risk her friends lives. They've already died once.She wasn't going to lose them again. She takes the locket, unseals it and puts it in your body's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body opens the locket and your soul flies back into your body It takes a minute for your eyes to change back. Rgh...... You said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You shake your head as your senses come back to you. Ashley.... Kira said. It's fine. He's not going to do anything. Ashley said. What did you do to him? Kim said. I....took his soul from him. She said. You what!? Kira said. He's not going to hurt us. Or anyone. Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the energy in your body has gotten stronger and manifested, but you don't feel any dark thoughts. Or a need to kill. You got what you wanted. Just leave. Ashley said. You look at her. As angry as you are, you save it for someone more deserving. But you need to do one thing. You approach Ashley and grip the device on her wrist and snatch it off. Then you turn and leave <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe.... He just up and left? No threats or anything? Kim said. Or snide remarks? Kira said. Ashley. Susan said. I know. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see the curse mark is still on the moon. You thought it'd be over by now. Lilith must have done something to make it permanent. You head to the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked there, you noticed that the women you saw had glowing eyes and were talking about Lilith. She's been busy since you've been gone. You get to the mansion and see it's been turned into a castle. Really busy. You open the heavy set of doors and walk inside. You see it's like a 16th century in here. All that's missing are the torches on the wall. You make it up some stairs and into a throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n........admire your fortitude. 4 whole days of torture and none of your brains are mush. Lilith said. You.....won't break us. Gavin said. You hunters are the only people left who haven't submitted to me. Impressive, but also an annoyance. You will break and serve. Then the entire world will. She said. Twisted. As always. You won't have us! Alexis said. I can. And will. Having you hunters bend the knee to me will put an end to your ilk. The hunters will finally die. Lilith said. Maybe not..... Hiro said. As she wonders, a sharp wind blows past Lilith's cheek and a cut forms. What the?! She said. You then appear in front of her and kick her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout tim- Gavin gets elbowed in the gut by Remi. So is this your plan? Alexis said. You nod. Well..... My wayward grandson has returned. Lilith said, getting up. You like what i done with the place? A fitting place for a queen. Or empress. She said. You're far from a queen. Gavin said. And empress is out of the question. Alexis said. Such disrespect..... I'll have to put you all in your place. She said. The magic binding them starts to engulf them. You pull out your knife and throw it at them. As it flies, 4 shadow copies appear and they start to glow and hit the surrounding magic. The magic then dissipates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks.... Alexis said. Interesting. Guess you did more than run away. But can you do that against your former friends? She said. With a snap of her fingers, your friends rush in; weapons drawn. You look at them and can feel the rage boiling; which is good. You press a button on your device and a issue a sever shock to each of them, leaving them incapacitated. A fail safe in case something like this happen? You really are a hunter. She said. You take off the device and throw it away. But.... Let's see how you handle your former demon friend. She said. With a snap, Em comes barreling towards you with a murderous look. She pounces on you and starts to claw at your chest until your heart is exposed. Her hand lights up on fire and she stops before it touches your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(M....m.....master.....) She said. You smile a little. (I.... I...... I'm sorry...... I wasn't......strong enough. Please...... Forgive me.) She said. You place your hand on her cheek. (M...master.....) Em said with a tear in her right eye. The glowing in her eyes stop and she gets up off you. Still defiant. I thought we were making good progress. Lilith said. (You made me attack my master..... I'll rip out your heart! And eat your insides!) She said. Em charges at Lilith and she puts her hand on her forehead. Back to hell, demon. She said. In a puff of red smoke, Em is gone. You get up as your chest finished healing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell.... I guess it's just you and me. Oh wait. I still have one more servant. She said. In a blink, Luke appears with glowing,yellow eyes. No.... Luke. Alexis said. My crowning achievement. Even without magic, he fought. But like everyone, he soon gave in. Like the rest of you will. Luke..... Be a dear and subdue my future servants. Lilith said. Yes.... He said. As Luke appears in front of you, Gavin tackles him. Luke! It's us! He said. Luke shoves him off only to be restrained by Remi and Heinz. Snap out of it, mon amie! This is what the swine wants! Remi said. Don't fall for there tricks, Luke! Hienz said. Luke powers them off him and was about to attack until Alexis grabs him and lifts him. Luke, remember all that we did together. Alexis said. Luke pries open her fingers and throw her into the wall. He lands on the ground only to get tackled by Heinz, Remi, and Gavin. We'll handle Luke. You deal with her. Hiro said. You nod and Heinz goes flying by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach Lilith and grow to 100ft. Well, i guess it's just you.....and me now. She said. You pull out your knife. Hehehehe.....! So blunt. I'm almost impressed by it. Usually people run when they see me. But let's not thrash my throne room anymore than it needs to be. She said. You both are then transported to the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhh, blood sports. A queen has to entertained regularly. She said. You throw your knife and it stops in front of her. Guess you're ready. I'll go easy on you since you're my grandson. She said, smiling. She sends your knife back at you and you catch it. Come. Show me how far the hunters have come. She said. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're not wasting anytime. The longer this moon is up, the worst it going to get. So you appear right in front of her and attack her. She moves her head to the side and you try to take out her legs. She jumps up and you go for a kick to her midsection, but she vanishes and appears behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo basic..... I've been dead for centuries, and this is what my first fight is like? She said. You go for a high kick, but she bends back and cartwheels away. She's not taking this seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suggest you pick a new strategy, otherwise you'll be here forever. She said. You pull out and toss your knife. She stops it again. This trick again? Can't you- She see's you're not there and turns around to see your fist. She stops it just as your fist touches her nose. Heh. Keep your eye on the prize. She said. She then grabs your fist; stopping your attack from behind. The first attack is always a fake. She said. She throws you into the wall. When the dust clears, you walk right out. Come... She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside the mansion. Remi and Gavin manage to wrestle Luke to the ground. Snap out of it, man! We're not your enemy! Gavin said. Must.....serve.....queen Lilith.....! He said, breaking free. He gets up only to be grabbed by Alexis with both hands. Luke! It's us! We're not trying to hurt you! She said. Must.....serve....!! He said, breaking free of her grip. He punches her hard in the gut. Ugh.....!!! She said falling on her knees. You all will......bow before our queen! He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are sent flying back and roll to your feet. At least you're trying to entertain me. She said. She disappears and reappears on the over look and sits in the throne seat. Maybe you need to be in the right state of mind. Good thing i thought of this. She said. She waves her hand and the heavy doors open up. You hear a low growl and out come Mira and Miley; Eyes glowing yellow bright like the sun. Your eyes go wide. Maybe this will help you get into it. She said. You grit your teeth and clench your fist. I bet your wondering how i found out about these two. I'll gladly tell you. When it's over. Ladies. Whip our guess into shape. Yes, queen. They said. They both charge towards you. You sidestep them and they attack you again. You dodge them and stop yourself from hitting them when they were open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do this for longer than you want to. Such restraint..... Another hunter would have killed them by now. If you can't bring yourself to beat them, then you have no chance against me. She said. You aren't going to stoop to such level. Killing your friends and loved ones just to have a chance at her? She is demented as they said. This ends now. You deflected both of their punches and grab them by the throat. Yes..... Do it. It's the only way you're going to beat me. Lilith said. As they struggle and beat on your arm, you draw them in close and hug them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nB......b.....brother.....? Miley said. You whisper in their ears and their eyes stop glowing. They hug you back. Interesting..... Lilith said. I'm so sorry for attacking you! Mira said. Me too! I would never harm try to harm you! Miley said. You look at their arm to see their wrist devices are gone. That explains how Ashley got it from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou!! Get down here!! No one attacks my brother!! Miley said. Really? I haven't been called out like that in years. Especially by a non magic user. Lilith said. We don't need it! You're going to pay for what you did!! Mira said. They stand up and wait for her to come down. You stand up too. And hit them in the back of the neck, knocking them out cold. .......I'm sorry. You said. You bring in a clone and he takes them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are an interesting one..... I've never seen that much restraint in a hunter. Or someone who found such intense love in someone. Hunters have changed since my time. She said, jumping down. You clench your fist and your eyes turn red. Yes.... I can see the anger in you building. She said. You power skyrockets and the ground starts to shake. Yes. That's what i want to see from you, grandson. She said. You punch the ground and charge her with a full head of steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pant* It's not working. Our words aren't reaching him. Gavin said. They are, but it's having little effect. Hiro said. We've worked together for so long.... Why isn't he snapping out of it?! Alexis said. It has to be someone with a strong pull on him. Someone who knows him personally. Remi said. .......Alex!! Gavin said. Alex.....? You mean..... Heinz said. Besides Alexis, him and Luke have been friends for a long time. Plus, he's the only one who let's Alex talk about......her, without getting beating to death. Gavin said. How are we going to summon Alex? We have no magic? Heinz said. ......The old ways. With blood. Hiro said. But that takes a lot out of the person. They'll look like death. Heinz said. I'll do it. We've already lost one of ours; We're not losing anymore! Alexis said. Then we'll hold him back. You do the summoning. Gavin said. The others rush to keep Luke busy, while Alexis draws blood from herself. (Hold on,Luke.) She thought. She cuts herself on the palm and uses the blood to draw the hunter's symbol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke is pushed against the wall and shoves the others back with force and punches each of them in the gut.  Shit.... So that's what it feels like on the other end..... Gavin said. They get up and attack, but Luke stays one step ahead of them. Hurry up! We can't keep him busy forever! Remi said. Just a moment...... Done. Alexis said. She puts her hands together and says the incantation. The blood dripping from her hands move to the blood circle and starts glowing. Alexis immediately feels the effects of this as her body start to lose color and wrinkle like an old grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke spinning kicks everyone back as he looks Alexis' way. Out of the portal, A man with black, ruffled hair, army pants and a black shirt with two pistols on his legs. He opens his eyes and looks around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell..... What's going on here? He said.</span></div></div>",

Alex..... Alexis said. Alexis.....? Damn. You look like death itself. He said. Now's not the time to shoot the breeze, Alex. We're in major trouble. Gavin said. Would that explain the unconscious people here? He said. No. They didn't do anything. Lilith did. Hiro said. L....Lilith's back?! He said. And during the harmonious moon too. Remi said. Now it's a shitstorm. Leah would be panicking if she was here. He said. One problem at a time, Alex. Can you cure Luke? Heinz said. Luke? He said. He sees Gavin get thrown off of Luke as he gets up. Luke......brainwashed? Of all things..... He said. Alex! Gavin said. Alright, alright. He said. Alex walks up to Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke. Remember me? Alex? He said. A.....A.....Alex? He said. Luke puts his arms down and the glow dims in his eyes. That's right. It's me. We're all here Luke. Alexis, Gavin, all the hunters. He said. E....everyone? He said. Yes. You think Holly would want you fighting your friends? She said. H....h.....h.....Holly.... He said. The yellow glow in his eyes disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere. All done? Got the anger out? Alex said. I'd show you how angry i am right now...... If we didn't know each other well. He said. Awww. I missed you too. Alex said. Please tell me the creature of fright isn't here with you. He said. No, but she says hi. Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright. Save the reunion for later. We still have Lilith to deal with. Gavin said. Oh, right. Where is she? Alex said. Your son is fighting her. Hiro said. WHAT?! Alex and Luke said. It's a long story, but we have to hurry. Lilith doesn't play with her victims for long. Heinz said. But where did she take him? Gavin said. The arena. She spoke of using it for her entertainment. Alexis said. Then let's go! Luke said. Leah will kill me if she found out i let our son get killed. Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith dodges your rebound kick. Oh. Almost hit me that time. She said. You go for and uppercut and she bends back. You then quickly leg sweep her arms and go for a kick to her spine, but she vanishes and appear behind you. You changed your attack pattern. Nice.... But not enough. She said. You grit your teeth and calm down. Now.... What's next? She said, smiling. You put your hand on your knife hilt and quickly swing it as it glows. A bright flash cuts across her as you sheathe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeh..... Not bad. She said as her midsection slides off. You throw your knife at her and it phases through her chest and catch it as you appear behind her. Then multiple slashes appear on her body. Very......good. She said. After a few seconds, her body heals and reattaches itself. But useless. She said. You go to attack her, but she stops you in your tracks and throws you into the wall. No matter how hard you try..... She said. She snaps and you appear in front of her. You can't beat me without magic. She said. She puts her hand on your shoulder and forces you on your knees. I could make you go to sleep and never wake up again. She said as your eyes start to feel heavy. I could make your heart implode. She said. You feel an intense pain in your chest. Or anything i want. She said, letting go of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fight well without magic. But without it, you aren't going to defeat me. She said, smiling. And even if you did have magic, you wouldn't be able to kill me. I'm still dead. And you can't kill someone already dead. I'd just get right back up. She said. She's right. She'd just get right back up like nothing. Even if you destroyed her heart, she'd get up like nothing happened. Still..... I haven't found a good replacement for me. She said. Then her eyes land on you and her smile becomes evil. Grandson..... How about you do grandma a favor? She said. You snarl at her. I'll take that as a yes. Oh, thank you! I'll have a monument of you built. Right next to my monument of me. She said. You can't move for the stasis field she put over you. But first..... I can't resist anymore! She said. She puts both of her hands on your face and the glow white and so do her eyes. Ugh....! You said. Shhhh! It's alright. This will only take a minute. She said. You feel the anger you have being sucked right out of you. Your eyes change back to normal. Then your power spike goes down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....There. You had an almost empty pool of anger inside you. But I manage to take it all and snuff your fire. She said with a victorious smile. There's nothing you can do now except be my sacrifice. She said. Rgh..... That's......where your wrong. You said. She then feels a violent punch to her head; knocking her away from you. You stand up as she looks stunned. What the?! What did you do!? She said. Me? Nothing. You said. But I did! A voice said. Who the!? She said. She's then sent flying to the wall, then back into the air and sent crashing down into the ground. Who's there? Show yourself!! Lilith shouts. She then takes a blow to her nose and sent crashing into the wall. She appears back where she was and so does your dark half with a seething look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nW.....who are you!? She said. My darker self. And he's not happy. You said. A darker version of you? Impossible..... I took away your fire and drained your anger. A dark version of you shouldn't exist! She said. Ah, that's where your wrong. He's already manifested to the point of having his own body. He's still tied to my life, but as for everything else, he's his own person. You said. Impossible..... How did you hide him from me?! I would have felt him inside you! She said. When we first met. And when you first tried to suck my anger out. You said. .....!! Are you saying you..... Sent him inside your body to hide and wait until the right time? Oh yeah. You finish. It's something we've been working on, and i say it works well. Oh. And he's seen everything you've done. Not only to me, but to everyone. Including Miley. And like i said, he's not happy. You said. It doesn't matter..... I still have all the anger i drained from you. I can take you both out with only a finger! She said. Yeah..... About that. You said as your dark half appears in front of her. My anger and rage directly goes to him when I get mad. The angrier i am, the more powerful he is. She said. Her eyes goes wide. And since you took all my anger from me. Guess who got my near endless pool of it? You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brainwashed Miley..... I'll rip out every single organ in your body!!! He said. </span></div></div>",

Is that compassion i hear from you, Luke? How long was i gone for? Alex said. What? I can look out for someone? He said. Not really. You're an uncaring bastard. But that's why we love you. Alex said. Luke glares at him then sighs. I've missed you, Alex. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group gets to the arena and see the heavy doors are closed. Shit! That's not coming down easy. Gavin said. Come on. We have to get them down! Alex said. How!? Heinz said. They held blood sports here, right? If they have guns, they have explosives. Find some. Alex said. The hunters look around as Alexis takes a seat to recover. Take it easy, Alexis. Your body is very fragile right now. Luke said. Didn't know you cared this much about me, Luke. She said. Well..... S.....someone has to look after you. He said. Did i hear that right? Luke, your heart is showing. She said with a smile. Luke looks away as Alexis giggles. I think Leah's son has had a pro-founding effect on you. She said. Ugh! ......Hmph! Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith dodges your attack and almost gets blindsided by your darkhalf. Rgh....! She said. This'll be over a lot sooner if you hold still! Your dark half said. That's my line! Neither of you can put a hand on me. All you're doing is exhausting yourselves to make it easier for me. She said. You can't dodge forever. Then i'm going to- You put your hand on his shoulder. He looks at you and nod to him. It takes a second but he understands what you want to do, so he nods back. You breathe in and close your eyes. Giving up already? She said. You wish! He said. He charges at her and she dodges him. You'll never hit me with such obvious attacks. She said. He comes back and she moves out the way. What did i just- Ugh! She said as she's kicked in the face. She stumbles back from the force. H....How did you hit me!? She said. Wouldn't you like to know. He said. He disappears and reappears in front of her with his fist ready. She stops him in his tracks. You appear behind her and she sidesteps you,but gets clocked in the cheek. Ugh!! How did you respond so quickly?! She said. She looks to see your eyes are still closed. How did you even know where i was? She said. It took a moment for her to realized what you were doing. Can't be..... Are you.....? She said. Connected to the entire world? About time you figured it out. You said, appearing in front of her. She dodges you and moves out the way of your darkhalf's attack. You move to the side and grab his arm and throw him at her. She moves out the way and you hit her in the back with enough force to send her flying. Your dark half hits her back your way and she vanishes. You do the same and bring her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh....! How did-You punch her in the face and your dark half hits her back. You both repeatedly hit her back and forth and end it with a dual uppercut and punch into the gut that sends her crashing into the wall. You open your eyes as you see her come out from the wall. ENOUGH OF THIS!!! She shouts. She surrounds herself in a magical aura and grabs your dark half by the throat and slams him into the ground. She locks him in a magical stasis and forces you to the ground on your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's over! I've indulged you long enough. Now it's time to send you to hell. She said. Her hands start to glow and starts saying an incantation. Rgh..... Sorry..... But there's been.....a change of plans. You said. You struggle enough to reach for your knife and stab her in the gut. Ugh.... H....how did you.....break free? She said. I have you to thank..... You said. Me? She said. It's what you said. How you supplemented hatred for magic. Anger isn't the only thing that fuels magic. You said. W....what do you mean? She said as you delve the knife further. Love is a powerful thing. You said. Love? She said. Yes. It's a powerful thing. You attacked and enslaved the people i loved. And my powers come from the people i love. I won't see them harmed or anything. By anyone. You said. So you used that to break free? She said. The same way Argus beat you. Forgo his anger and used a new source. You said. A....Argus..... She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it's time. You said. Have you forgotten? I can't die. And if you send me back to hell, i'll drag you with me. She said. Well, you're in for a shock. You're going to be sealed. You said. Her eyes go wide in shocked. Sealed? She said. You're way too dangerous. The only mistake Argus made was just killing you. I'll seal you away so you never come back. You said. And you think i'll let you? She said. It's already happening. You said. WHAT!? She said. My knife.... While i still had magic, I put a sealing curse on it that activates when I stab the person. She said. I-I'm going to be sealed inside your knife!? She said. That's right. You said. N-NO!! She said. She tries to push it out, but you shove it all the way to the hilt. There's no stopping it. You said. Then..... I'll take you with me!!! She said. She grabs you with her glowing hands and says a final curse. When the seal is complete, you see the heavy doors blow off. ......Heh. You said as you both are engulfed in a bright light that consumes the arena.</span></div></div>",

I had a curse negate spell on me. I don't know what happened afterwards. Maybe they think i'm sealed up with her. You said. Why did you leave in the first place? She said. That's my business. Now you talk. Why did you seek me out? You said. .....We need your help. She said. I'm not killing someone for you. I'm done with that. And who's \"we\"? You said. My sisters. We need your help. She said. Oh God..... You said. We need you! The hunters will listen to you. She said. You sound like Sue. You said. This isn't a joking matter! She said. Then enlighten me. What did you bit- What did you do this time? You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree years after you left, your brothers have been killing us off by the thousands. She said. Really? Need to send them a fruit basket. You said. This isn't a joke!! She said. Why do you care anyway? You wanted nothing to do with them until your actual blood sister was killed. You said. Because your father killed her! She said. Because she used a forbidden spell out of anger that her crush got killed! She became obsessed with killing him and in the end, it got her killed. And you did the same thing, except you stopped last minute. Which is why you're alive right now. You said. Grrrr.....! *Sigh* Look.... We can argue until we're purple in the face. But that won't change the fact that we're being killed off. She said. That's just clicking for you? You said. Not at this rate. Our numbers have went down by 25%. She said. Fruit basket with wine. You said. It won't be long until we're all dead. She said. And that's my problem......? You said. Just because you hunters are at peace with death, doesn't mean we are. Some of us want to live past 100. She said. Aren't you 399? You said. 397, but that's irrelevant. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why should i care about the plight of witches? After all your kind has done? You said. Really? Are we really going to go there? She said. Yes. What have you done for us except nothing but pain and misery? You said. Why do you think i'm here!? We want to make things right. She said. To get the hunts stopped. You said. And? Is that wrong? She said. Yes. Because it isn't out of kindness. Do you even know why we kill your kind. It's for more reasons than one. You said.  That's the same thing that was said at the parley. She said. Parley? They actually met with you? You said. Me, Ashley, Susan and a few others. She said. Of course Sue had to be there. Let me guess, it broke down? You said. We offered to make amends anyway possible. In return the hunts stop? You said. Yes. She said. And it didn't take. You're suppose to negotiate from a position of power. You have nothing to offer them. You said. Actually, we do. You have your friends to thank for that. You said. Who? Bruce and the others? You said. They didn't believe you were sealed inside your knife. They've scoured almost all the world to look for you. Even Mira and Miley went with them. She said. How do you know them? You said. Know your enemy. Is that what you said before? She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happened at the next meeting? You said. We offered to find you in exchange that the hunts were suspend while we do this. And they took that? You said. Your friends were insistent. So they agreed. She said. So i'm suppose to waltz back with you next to me and everything is peachy? You said. I knew this wasn't going to be easy. What do you want? She said. Jesus. Gave in so quickly. Want to get me the clothes off your back? She said. She starts to take off her dress. Whoa, whoa! It's a joke. No need to scar either of us for life. You said. Then what is it? You said. It's not me you need to appease. It's the other hunters. You said. We said we'd give them anything they want. Kat said. And did you? You said. They won't hear us out. They said we're just saying that. She said. Can't blame them. A witch's word isn't worth dirt. You said. We always keep our end of any deal. She said. No, you don't. And I don't have the time to point out each time. .....But if you want my help. Then you must do something for me. You said. And that is? She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......If you're serious about burying the hatchet between us, then form a council. You said. A council? Made up of witches and hunters? She said. Yep. Get each and every hunter to agree to it, and I'll come back. You said. Fine. But i need proof that i actually spoke with you. She said. You rip off your growth armband. Here. That'll convince them. ANd i'll be wanting it back too. You said. She takes it and disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHrm.... Alice said no one was suppose to find you when you wall yourself off from the rest of the world. You said. </span></div></div>",

Jokers done well for themselves. You said. You keep your head down and walk around. Army no longer patrolling the streets. Life's almost normal here. You said. You walk around until you hear a siren sound. Memory serves correct, that sounds means an impending attack. Which also means Sue is going to come bolting. You said. Through all the commotion, you manage to leave m district unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill know how to get in and out unseen. You said. You then sense someone. I take it you had something to do with that siren? You said. You were taking your time. Had to get you moving. A voice said. You see your dark half appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a long time. He said. That's the point of leaving. A bomber jacket? And is that a rifle on your back? You said. I had a life of my own to live. I didn't know what to do at first. So i decided to experiment. He said. Heh.... So how does it feel to kill with a gun? You said. It's a whole lot different than with your fist. Less personal. You don't get to see the anguish and pain in their face. Which is half the fun. You said. Still a sadist. After all these years. You said. I'm not even started. Follow me. He said. You follow him to a building in m district that is vacant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright. You liked my alarm trick. You love this. I call it. Anger of Sue. He said. Sue? You've been pissing her off? You sai. Favorite pass time. She has no idea it's me. Or you. Here she comes now. He said. You see Ashley looking around. Shit..... Sue hasn't changed a bit. Same hair, clothes, everything. You said. Got that right. She's still working out her witch ways; trying to be calm and all that. let's see how angry we can get her. He said. He loads the rifle. Actual bullets? You said. You bet. Sue's not going to let anyone die. Watch. He said. He lines up a shot on a random guy and hits him in the gut. He's going to be drinking his food. He said. He fires at another. Ohh. A little high. He said. His lung is going to collapse. You said. He fires again. Right in the leg. Wheelchair for you. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Ashley hears the screaming and sees the littered body. She kneels down to look at them and is shocked. Ok. Part 2. Sue's not that good at telling where the shots are coming from. It gets interesting here. He said. He fires at a guy who was breaking cover to run to Ashley. He's not going to be pissing right. He said. Ashley looks over to see the guy screaming in pain. Lightning round. I need your eyes to spot. He said. Your eyes change optical. There. By her foot. You said. He quickly fires. Ohh. Let's see if she notices. He said. Behind that bush. You said. He fires into the bush. That's....a head shot. You said. Nice. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs She sees more people drop, Ashley starts to look around frantically for the shots. She's looking.... You said. One more. He said. He fires another shot. Dead center in the chest. You said. When she sees the person drop, Ashley looks at the building  you're in. She knows. You said. Time to go. Only three seconds. You said. You both disappear before the building is surrounded in protective magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both reappear in o district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn...... This place is still shit. You said. I think that's the appeal of it. Nothing of value out here, so no one comes here. He said. When did you start thinking? You said. Seven years by myself gave me the time. I don't have a home to go to. He said. I miss you too. It took a while, but i got used to having you there. You said. Is there really no way to reverse the cleanse? He said. No. Sue's cleansing seal worked better and quicker than she thought. It won't allow any dark possession to take me. Top all that off with i can't get angry anymore, I've been cut down. You said. I guess....in a way, she helped you. You haven't been talking to people who aren't there. And you've finally come to terms with all the deaths in your life. He said. I guess.... But all that's suppose to come with time. Sue was trying to force me to be good. You can't force someone to be something they aren't. You said. Even with all we've done, the killing and mercenary work, Sue still believed there was a chance for us. Even if she tried to force it. He said. You can't force people to your way of thinking. It's why we never got along. You said. I thought it was because she was a Mary Sue and a witch? He said. A whole bunch of reason, but those were the prominent ones. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking  of being, you found yourself yet? He said. .......Seven years I've been out there. All that time alone with no one but my thoughts. You said. That would drive a person insane. He said. I think it's what i needed. No outside interference or voice in my head. Just me and my thoughts. It took seven years for me to realize that I am who i am. There's good in me. And evil. I don't have to be overly good or bad. As long as i'm myself and true to it. I've got nothing to prove to no one. You said. I told you. So does that mean your coming back? The guys miss you. And everyone else. He said. .......No. They don't need me anymore. I'm only here to make sure a process goes smoothly. And get something. You said. Playing the long game again? He said. No. Short. I just have to make sure everything goes as i hope they will. You said. That's why i hate 4D chess. Better to just do or say whatever. He said. This is a delicate situation. Have to handle this right. Just stay low. You said, disappearing. Always thinking ahead..... Kept us alive this entire time. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear at Jessica's house and head inside. Bet she's in her lab. You said. You head to her lab to see her looking over some notes. But she's not that interested in them. Still working while naked. Nothing's changed. You said. Jessica. You said, appearing on her counter. Huh? She said with surprise. You see the shock in her eye. Then it turns to joy. Hey.... You said. She picks you up and smothers you in a tight hug. Where have you been?! Do you have any idea what you put me through? She said. S....sorry. I just.....needed some time to myself. You said. Seven years? When i need some time to myself, i just go find some men and hug them like this. She said. I thought you only did that for me. You said. Of course, but you're special. You get to be smothered by these and a whole lot more. The other guys don't get that. She said. Guess i do. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let's go of you. Jessica. You still have those wrist devices? I need another. You said. Yep. I have plenty. But..... You remember the price to get one, right? She said. Yes..... You said. She brings you to her face and starts kissing you. *Kiss* *Kiss* Hehe! She said. She kept this up for a few minutes and lets go of you. There we go. She said. She gets one of the devices and hands it to you. You take it and put it on. Thank you. You said. You can thank me by not leaving again for long periods. She said. I won't. Later. You said, disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......Sorry, Jess. One promise i can't keep. You said. You head back to m district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk.... That should be everyone's life restored. Ashley said. She looks to see all the men who were dead or dying getting back up. You guys ok? She said. Y....yeah. One guy said. Like a new born baby. You're a lifesaver, Ashley! Another said. Just doing what i do best. She said with a small smile. Now, get somewhere safe. I've got a shooter to deal with. You said. R-right. A guy said. The men around here leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright. Who ever's in there, come out! She said, dropping the protective shield. She waits a minute but no one comes out. Try to be diplomatic..... No, no. Remember, they're not slaves. They wouldn't give up diplomatically anyway. Still give them the option. She said. She then stands up at full height. Maybe a scare tactic..... Come out of there or i'll crush this building with you in it! She said. She waits to see until she gets turned around and punched in the face. She stumbles and brought back to get punched again. Then a sharp stab in the gut and chest. Then her knees get taken out from under her and hit 4 more times in the face. Ugh...... Who....? She said. Her head is turned to meet the person holding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nY.....You.... You're.....! She said. She looks you right in the soulless black eyes before you stand her back up and head butt her. Her eyes roll back as she falls on the buildings beneath her. You look at her for a second and your eyes change back to normal and you leave.</span></div></div>",

If this is going to work, you\u2019re going to have to trust us. Kat said. Right\u2026.. Because witches honor their word and are very trustful. Let\u2019s ask the elves and fairies about it. Gavin said. Unlike our ancestors, we intend to keep our word. We have nothing to gain from betraying you. She said. Actions speak louder than words. Orex said. I find it hard to believe you found our brother and harder that he wants us to form a council with you. Alexis said. I did. And he did. Kat said. You could just be saying that so you can get us all in one place and do us in. Gavin said. Are any of us attacking you right now? Susan said. No, but this meeting is still going. So anything is still possible. Heinz said. With Luke, Hiro, and Alex here, you think we\u2019d be able to say spell? They\u2019d be on us before we finished. Kat said. Wouldn\u2019t get the chance. I\u2019m still waiting on the proof of my son. Alex said. Kat puts down the armband. If I didn\u2019t find him, how\u2019d I get this? It\u2019s his. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all we know, you could have stole that or made a replica. Maybe even take it from his body that\u2019s not even cold yet. Alexis said. And have Leah on my ass? No, he gave that to me. Kat said. Your distrust doesn\u2019t do you any favors here. We\u2019ll never get anywhere if this is how you act. Sylvia said. Like you\u2019re the symbol of trust. You killed your own father and husband. Not to mention the lands you conquer. Orex said. Don\u2019t forget the people she had killed who wouldn\u2019t acknowledge her claim to a throne. Still have the blood on your boots? Gavin said. My father was a tyrant and my husband was no better. I removed two threats from the world and yet I wasn\u2019t named queen. So I just used what I learned from them. Sylvia said. By conquering lands and other kingdoms? Assassinating kings and queens? The public execution of those who didn\u2019t agree with you? Orex said. Nothing more than what Argus did. Sylvia said. Argus didn\u2019t kill innocents or conquer anyone! Or silence anyone who had something against him! Luke said. And yet, he sat on a golden throne. If he didn\u2019t kill or conquer for it, what did he do then? She said. Enough of this! We didn\u2019t come here to bring up old grudges or who did what for something. Kat said. Luke\u2026. Alex said. \u2026\u2026It\u2019s his. While they don\u2019t have no respect for the dead, she didn\u2019t take it from him. He said. So\u2026. He really did give it to her? Alexis said. And he\u2019s not sealed. So that means\u2026. Alex said. He\u2019s alive. Where is he? Alexis said. Hold on. I gave everything up like I promised. You need to agree on this council idea. Kat said. Are you seriously holding his location hostage?! Alexis said. No. We said we\u2019d listen and agree if there was evidence. And she did present it. Heinz said. Fine. If that what it takes, fine. I agree to a council. Alexis said. Alright\u2026.. Gavin said. Oui. Remi said. \u2026\u2026.Ja. Heinz said. Yeah, yeah. Luke said. If it means finding my son, fine. Alex said. Hai\u2026.. Hiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it\u2019s official. From this point on, we\u2019re allies. Kat said. Great\u2026\u2026 We can pop the champagne later. Now talk. Alexis said. Before Kat could talk, the door is open and Ashley stumbles in. Ashley! Susan said. Susan moves to Ashley\u2019s side. Seems like her \u201cdiplomatic\u201d side didn\u2019t win out this time. Gavin mutters. What happened?! Susan said. H\u2026\u2026he\u2026..*Cough* He\u2019s\u2026..back. Ashley said. He is? Alex said. Where is he? Alexis said. I don\u2019t know. Somewhere in M district. She said. Where you \u201cnice\u201d this time around? Heinz said. I didn\u2019t even have time to say anything. He just up and attacked me. She said. With your cherry attitude, could you blame anyone? Gavin said. Rgh\u2026..!! Ashley said. Luke, if what she said is true, then\u2026.. Alex said. I can\u2019t sense him out. But I know someone who can. Luke said. You mean Em? Alex said. Em? You still have that demon with you? Remi said. Yeah. And she\u2019s still off limits, Orex. Luke said. Orex grumble to himself.<br>\r\nDon\u2019t worry, Em can find him even if he was at the north pole. Luke said as he and the others left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..I hate them so much. Ashley said. Leave us. I need to speak with Ashley alone. Susan said. Of course. Kat said. The witches vanish. Ashley\u2026.. Susan said. I don\u2019t want to hear it. She said. You need to. Susan said. Why me? Why do I need to change? I didn\u2019t say a single word to them. She said. Not this time. The last meeting however\u2026\u2026 Susan said. What was I suppose to do? Sit back and let them slander us while they make themselves out to be paragons of virtue? She said. We didn\u2019t call them to measure who was worst than the other. You want the hunts to stop? Susan said.  I do, but I\u2019m not going to let them think they are better than anyone else. She said. They know they aren\u2019t better than anyone else, but for this to work, we need everyone to be on the same page. Susan said. \u2026\u2026.Fine. I\u2019ll be nicer next time. Ashley said. Actually be nice, not your version of nice. Susan said. I am nice! Why does everyone think I\u2019m an asshole? Ashley said. You\u2019re only nice to people who listen to you the first time. Remember the ex-soldier who ran from you? Susan said. I told him to stop, he didn\u2019t listen to me, so I caught him. Ashley said. Only after you removed your foot off him and stopped making threats. Susan said. Alright, alright. I\u2019ll roll out the red-carpet next time. Ashley said. That\u2019s all I ask. Now, hold still. These are some nasty looking stabs. Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mansion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid they say where he is?! Bruce said. Ashley said he was somewhere in m district. Not going to take a witches\u2019 word for it. Em. Can you find him? Luke said.  Em concentrates for a second. Well? Tom said. She says she has a faint feel for where he is. Luke said. It takes another minute before Em runs out like crazy. She\u2019s got his location\u2026.. Follow that demon! Luke said. Luke and the guys run after Em.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm runs all the way to O district. (Master? Master!) Em said. Em followed her sensing. When she was getting closer, she gets thrown to the ground. She looks at the person who did it and sees a person cloaked in darkness with red eyes. She gets grabbed by the neck and lifted up. She starts to flail and hit the person\u2019s arm and claw at their face. The shadow figure slams her into the ground and throws her to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm grits her teeth and charges at the person. The figure sidesteps her and in a blink, is cut in half. Her upper half and lower half hit the ground. The figure bent down next to her as she breathes heavily. She looks at the figure\u2019s red eyes and reaches out to them. The figure stands up and backs away as Em\u2019s upper and lower half start to reconnect together. She growls as she stands up. She runs at you and ducks under the person\u2019s swing. She then thrusts her arm forward into the figures chest, but it doesn\u2019t go through and hurts her own arm. She has a look of surprise on her face as she get stabbed in the gut with a purple blade on the figure\u2019s hands. The figure lifts her up and looks her dead in the eyes. They grab her hand as she tried to claw at it. EM!! A voice said. She turns her head to see Luke and everyone else. The blade is pulled out and she\u2019s thrown to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus\u2026.. Who is this guy? Dante said. He makes Luke look nice. Tom said. It\u2019s like a shadow being. But I feel hate and malice. Shadow beings don\u2019t have emotions. Alex said. Can we discuss it later? It\u2019s heading towards us. Bruce said. The shadow figure tarts to walk towards them and makes multiple copies of itself. Shit\u2026.. Why can\u2019t things ever be simple? Tom said.</span></div></div>",

History is written by the victors. He said. As he sips from his wine glass, a purple blade goes through hit chest. Ohhh\u2026. Now\u2026.that\u2019s not nice, mon amie. He said. The blade is pulled out and his vanishes as he hits the ground. The shadow figure starts to look around as the paintings start to glow. A shadow spirit\u2026.. It\u2019s been a while since one of were around. They said with Remi\u2019s voice. Purple blades form on the figure\u2019s hands. Let\u2019s see if I still remember how to do this\u2026.. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the UK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s been 5+ years, Gavin. Can\u2019t you get rid of this mark on my forehead. Isabel said. After what you did to me during the moon, and not to mention all the years we\u2019ve been together? He said. How many times can I say I\u2019m sorry? You know what that moon does to us. She said. And yet, you proclaim to be stronger than its influence. He said. I thought I was. Come on, Gavin! There\u2019s supposes to be peace between us now! She said. Doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s trust. You still have a long way to go on that. He said. We\u2019ve been married for years now. You think I would let you put a ring on my finger if I didn\u2019t trust you? And you\u2019re a hunter, no less. She said. You said you knew I was a hunter. You could have said no. I didn\u2019t force you to do anything. He said. Blame your charm for that. Haven\u2019t I proven myself yet? Besides the moon, I\u2019ve been busting my ass to make you trust me. She said. I\u2019ll let you know when you get there. He said as he left. Bollocks\u2026.. Isabel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin when to the local Pub and sat down. He starts to put down countless bottles; not knowing someone behind him. The figure readies to attack but stops when the blade touches Gavin\u2019s back. You\u2019re not as subtle as you think, shadow. He said, getting up. He looks at the shadow spirit. Oh my\u2026.. Such anger and malice in you. Whoever brought you into the world gave you a lot of anger to deal with. He said. Gavin goes to touch the shadow, but his hand is almost grabbed by it. I really hate to do this here of all places. One of the good pub\u2019s left in the country\u2026.. He said as a blade forms on the shadow\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Germany<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeinz was over watching the building of a memorial to his dead lover. \u2026..No. White flowers on the left side. Roses on the top step. He said. Heinz watched as it was built to his specific standards. After a while, it was done. Good. Now leave. He said. The witches vanish and Heinz walks up to the memorial. Buttercup\u2026.. He said. He holds back tears. You can sleep easier now. He said. As he plants his flowers, he deflects an attacks from behind. He sees it was a shadow being. This\u2026.is a private party, Schattend\u00e4mon! He said as he tackles the figure and they both go tumbling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro walked into the palace that was taken from him and his family. Guess their intentions are true\u2026.. He said. He walked up to the pictures of his family lineage. Mother\u2026\u2026 Father\u2026.. It finally happened. Our family lineage has been restored. He said. He takes off his mask. I\u2019ll restore the honor of our family. He said. He walks to the throne room. As he gets closer to the two seats, he remembers how he lost everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is madness! All these accusations are false!! His dad said. We\u2019ve done nothing but brought prosperity to the land! We\u2019d never slaughter our own people! His mom said. There were eye witness reports of your personal bodyguards going into homes in the dead of night and walking out with bloody knives. We have the knights in custody. You all will stand trial! The commanding knight general said. Where is your proof of this!? His father said. The general pulls out two bloody knives. Curved. The same kind like you bodyguards. Arrest them! He said. His father and mother were both put in chains. What about the child? One of them said. \u2026..Find his next of kin. The general said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro remembers the trial and it was a complete farce of one. The witnesses lied under oath, couldn\u2019t remember the clothing the bodyguards wear, his parents weren\u2019t allowed to speak in their defense, no legal counseling. It all lead to them being found guilty and executed. On the day of execution, he remembers his father\u2019s word. Hiro! Remember what our family stands for. Find those who stained our name, and return honor to it! He said. Father\u2026.. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve done it. Our name has been cleansed. We can rebuild again. He said. As he touches the chair, he hears heavy footsteps. Opening the door to the throne, he sees a shadow being. A shadow being\u2026\u2026? He said. The being walks towards Hiro with a purple blade in the form of a sword. Such anger\u2026.. Shadow beings don\u2019t have emotions. He said. It points its sword at Hiro. You challenge me in the home of my ancestors? He said drawing his sword. You will take me to your master when this is over. He said. The two circle each other for a minute and clash blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in America<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the other hunters, Alexis just wanted her hunter brother found. If that meant being at peace with the same people who wouldn\u2019t release her family from servitude, so be it. She learn to stop holding grudges, but that doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t forget the years of torment her family suffered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to be with Luke when he found where her missing brother was, but Luke wanted her to make sure the witches wouldn\u2019t betray them. She stayed in m district to make sure. These bitches better not have been lying to our faces. She said. Out of all the hunters, she was the most caring among them. She would visit the others from time to time to see how they were doing. She cared deeply for her brothers; nearly crying her eyes out when she mourned Volenski.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was looking for any witch moving to a gathering, when she deflected a blade from behind. (A shadow being?!) She thought. She then grab its other arm and to stop its attack, but it knees her in the gut and stabs her in the side. Ugh\u2026..! She said. She pushes its arm away and gives it a spinning kick to the face. It stumbles a little back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026What are you doing here? Who sent you? She said. The figure just charges at her with it\u2019s blades.</span></div></div>",

Argh\u2026.. No kidding. I almost got stabbed twice. He said. Get off me, Alex! Luke said. Ohhh. He said. He gets off of Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamnit! These things can\u2019t be hurt. Dante said. Bullets and knives just bounce off them. Tom said. And they pack quite a punch\u2026. Bruce said. And they just counter everything we do. Even Luke. Cody said. Luke\u2026.. We can\u2019t touch them. Magic or otherwise. Plus, we these guys won\u2019t be able to go on much longer\u2026. Alex said. Rgh\u2026.. Alright. We\u2019re not winning here. Let\u2019s get out of here! Luke said. The guys and everyone else run off and the shadows don\u2019t follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group makes it back to the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026Ok. I\u2019ll say it. We might have a serious problem. Tom said. Luke, you know anything about those things? Bruce said. Shadow beings. They\u2019re like mindless slaves. No emotions or anything. Just mindless drones. They range from weak to strong. Usually, they only serve those who are in tuned with the dark elements. He said. Like those shadows witches you told us about? Hank said. Yes, but they rarely use them. They uses the darkness better than they do. He said. Having the commander here would make things a lot easier. Kris said. Em\u2026. Where you able to find him? Luke said. (No\u2026. I was attacked before I could get a pinpoint location.) She said. Shit\u2026.. Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke\u2026.. A voice said. Gavin? Luke said. Gavin appears with multiple stab wounds on his body. Jesus, Gavin\u2026. What the hell? Alex said. A shadow being\u2026.. Really strong\u2026.. Good thing I had so many drinks in me that I couldn\u2019t feel anything. At first\u2026.. He said. Then Remi and the others appear with the same treatment. You guys too\u2026.. Gavin said. Shadow beings? Tom said. They just\u2026..came out of nowhere. Really powerful\u2026\u2026 Heinz said. I knew we shouldn\u2019t trust those bitches! Saying our brother was not sealed only to send their denizens after us. Alexis said. Wouldn\u2019t have made since to do it at the meeting? Bruce said. This is just how sick they are. They love to see their victims squirm. Alexis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Dante\u2019s scanner goes off. Really? Hank said. That\u2019s not for here. That\u2019s for M district. He said. But that\u2019s just to monitor. You didn\u2019t put an alarm for it. Luke said. I didn\u2019t, but I did for if one of our bugs get destroyed. He said. So one of them got destroyed. Which means it either got found, or destroyed. Cody said. Only one way to find out. \u2026\u2026Anyone knows how to pilot a UAV? Dante said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk\u2026.. Hovering over m district now. Alex said. When did you learn to do this? Luke said. I was in the army before. He said. But they don\u2019t have drones. Luke said. Never said it was the M district army. Alex said. Ok. We planted our bugs in their army HQ. Fly it there. Dante said. Alex moves the drone over the army HQ and it\u2019s completely in ruins. Jesus\u2026.. I forgot what those preteen monsters could do. Tom said. Don\u2019t think it was them. No blood stains on the ground. Or footprints. Alex said. Alex circles the area with the drone. I got someone on the ground. She\u2019s beaten badly and unresponsive. Alex said. That\u2019s Ashley. The one we saw at the council meeting. Luke said. The one with the bleeding heart? Alex said. She\u2019s the one. Alexis said. She\u2019s messed up badly. Wait. Who\u2019s that beside her? Tom said. Alex moves the camera to see Susan and the rest of them lying unconscious as well. That\u2019s her friends. Whatever did this was mad as hell. Alex said. As he moves the drone, it shot out of the sky. I\u2019ve lost control! The drone is going down! Alex said. The drone crashes into the ground and the feed is lost for a few seconds. Shit, hang on. Dante said. He gets the feed back to see the camera getting pulled out and a shadow being doing it before it goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess we found out who did it\u2026.. Bruce said. At least we know it\u2019s not only us that\u2019s under attack. Gavin said. It wouldn\u2019t be all bad if it was doing our job for us. Alexis said. Outsourcing our hunts to a shadow being\u2026. Alex said. We\u2019d grow complacent. Hiro said. Well what do we do? This isn\u2019t a regular shadow being we\u2019re dealing with. It came after us and had no problem. I doubt we\u2019d have much success if we stood together. Luke said. \u2026..Maybe we need to reach out. Alex said. No! We don\u2019t need their help! Alexis said. I don\u2019t like it anymore than you\u2026. But this thing not only stands toe to toe with us, and the witches. But maybe if we stand with them, we might have a shot. Alex said. Hunters and witches\u2026\u2026 Shoulder to shoulder\u2026.. Hiro said. I thought I\u2019d be dead by then. Heinz said. We all did\u2026. Luke said. I think you should find a new meeting spot. And neutral grounds, so neither side feels like they are walking into a trap. Kim said. \u2026\u2026I know a place. The outskirts of O district. A building an old friend won\u2019t mind us using. Luke said. I\u2019ll send out the invites. Alex said. Bruce. You\u2019re second in command. Get another UAV up and keep tabs on that shadow if you can. Luke said. Right. He said. Come on. It\u2019s a long walk there. And Alexis, keep your temper in check. We\u2019re coming to them this time. Luke said. \u2026\u2026Alright. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Sinclair\u2019s building, Luke and the hunters wait for the witches\u2019 emissary. They should be here by now. Remi said. Probably coming with more shadow beings. Alexis said. Then the door opens and Kat, Susan, Sylvia and a few others take a seat. I take it you\u2019ve told them? Kat said. \u2026..Put away your weapons. Luke said. Remi puts away his paintbrush, Alex his guns, and Hiro\u2019s sword and double daggers. There\u2026. I trust you to do the same. Luke said. No magic, ladies. Kat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s not beat around the bush. We both know we have a common problem. Luke said. That\u2019s putting it mildly. That shadow being. Kat said. It attacked all of us and you. And I know you tried to deal with it and failed. Luke said. Certainly you didn\u2019t bring us here to mock, Luke. Sylvia said. No. We don\u2019t gloat like you- Alexis! Alex said. It just appeared. No warning or anything. It attacked everything in it\u2019s path. No one was safe. There was so much death. Ashley went after it, but she was beaten down. I faired no better. Susan said. I think one of you hunters brought that thing. Only your kind are filled with such hatred. Sylvia said. We can\u2019t summon shadow beings. Only someone tuned with darkness and shadows can. Gavin said. I didn\u2019t bring it. If I have a problem, I deal with it myself. Alex will vouch for me. Kat said. Yeah. She does things herself. He said. Who or however it got here doesn\u2019t matter. What does is that it has something against us both. We tried and failed. And you tried and failed Luke said. Are you proposing we work together. One of them said. \u2026\u2026Yes. Luke said. Killed you to say that. Sylvia said. This thing wants us all. And it\u2019s only a matter of time. It\u2019s not unstoppable. I think if we work together\u2026..we can stop it. Luke said. Kat\u2026. Susan said. He\u2019s right. I tried to speak with it and it just attacked. We need solutions. She said. Can you hunters do it? Stand with the same people you hunted for eons? Sylvia said. We agreed to the council, so we can stomach fighting by your side. Alexis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it\u2019s settled. We work together. Kat said. This just can\u2019t get any worst for us\u2026..Gavin said.</span></div></div>",

It took all of us out and is terrorizing witches everywhere. Not to mention our allies. Susan said. A little quick there to call them that? Ashley said. It\u2019s what we are. And I need you not to bring up any past grief out there. She said. \u2026..Fine. Where is this all happening? Ashley said. O district. We meet it there. She said. Then let\u2019s go. Ashley said. Ashley and Susan head to O district where the rest of the hunters and a few of the best witches stand ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone here? Luke said.  Yeah. Gavin said. Luke, what\u2019s ROE on\u2026..them. Alex said. \u2026..I know this treaty shit is hard to swallow. I know everybody here would rather rip out there hearts than shake their hands. Luke said. Is that a go ahead? Alexis said. No. We need this to work. But don\u2019t risk your lives on their account. \u2026\u2026And if push come to shove, make sure no one sees you doing it. Luke said. You mean\u2026. Gavin said. No. A punch or two at most. Don\u2019t kill them. Alexis\u2026.. That\u2019s double for you. Luke said. I\u2019ll try to keep it in check. But if one of those bitches makes a move against anyone of us, I\u2019m showing her heart to her. Alexis said. We know you would. Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they finalize their plans, the shadow being appears. At least it\u2019s not dramatic. Remi said. The shadow creates multiple clones of itself. Here we go again\u2026.. Alex said. Only three of them\u2026. Hiro said. Don\u2019t drop your guard, master Hiro. Your family palace still needs a ruler. Alex said. And it will. Right after this. Hiro said. The three clones charges at the group with their purple blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters dodge the one coming their way and the witches do the same. All while the real shadow being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe can\u2019t be reckless here. Or waste a lot of energy. Luke said. Alex, Hiro, and Alexis meet the shadow being in close combat. Hiro with his blades and Alex and Alexis with their fists. The other hunters stay back and wait until they see an opening. Now! Spikturious! Luke, Remi, and Gavin said. Three giant black spikes come out of their hands and merge to create one huge spike. The shadow clone parries and counters every attack until it sees the spike. It disappears and reappears behind them. Luke, Remi and Gavin duck its attack and engage in close combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemi! Luke said. Oui! He said. Remi takes his paintbrush and shoves it into the ground as it glows. Out of the ground, the straw bursts through the ground as they make their way towards the clone. The shadow jumps into the air to avoid it. Hi there! Gavin said. The clone looks to see Gavin behind him, but before he could do anything, a wave of magical beam grazes them both. Tch\u2026..! He said as the beam made him lose his balance and fall to the ground. He expected to hit the ground hard when a purple bubble eases his fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks, Alex\u2026.. Gavin said. He looks over with a scowl at the witches fighting another clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamnit\u2026..! Ashley said. She rushes the shadow only for it to block her attacks and kick her hard in the gut. She drags her feet and the clone follows it with a punch to the face. Ashley is sent flying back. Before it could move, it jumps back as a circle appears under it and a beam comes out. When it touches the ground, Susan appears behind it with her hand glowing. The clone deflects her arm and grabs her and slam her into the ground. As it goes for the stab, Susan kicks it back and Kat attacks with her blacks  blades; getting a grazes on it\u2019s face. Solumos. Susan said. A circle appears under the clone and its movement is hindered. I got you now! Kat said. She leaps at the clone and plunges the blades into its neck. Now! Holiones! Kat said. The circle starts to glow brightly and a bright, yellow light engulfs them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid that work? Susan said. When the beam stops, only Kat is there and she\u2019s severely hurt. Kat! Susan said. She is pushed down by the clone who is unharmed in anyway. No way\u2026.. Susan said. Just then, Ashley appears right in front of the clone and it blocks her attack slams her into the ground as well. Before she could get up, the clone starts to brutally kick and punch her. Ashley protected her face until a heavy hit to her stomach  made her gasp. As she kept getting hit, her marking started to glow and she shoved it away. First you, then the others!! She said. Ashley\u2019s starting to lose it\u2026.. If her markings go to the rest of her body and her anger gets any higher, she\u2019ll just start attacking anything around her. Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Alexis, she got paired with the few randoms and things weren\u2019t going well. Damnit! Are you 3 fresh from academy or something? Alexis said. At least we\u2019re not running in blind and getting nowhere. One of them said. At least I\u2019m doing something and not standing there with my thumbs in my ass! Alexis said. It\u2019s called planning! Try it sometimes. The other said. I am. I\u2019m planning on knocking you three out if you don\u2019t do something other than basic! Alexis said. The only thing basic here is you. They said. Why you!! Alexis said. Before she could attack the clone appears and tosses Alexis into all three of them. Before it went any further, it retreated back to the original shadow being. As did the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat it doing? Alex said. The clones were a diversion\u2026.. Hiro said. Meaning? Gavin said. As they fought, the real one sat back and observed. Now it has a good feel of what we can do. Luke said. The clones return to the original shadow being and it draws it blades. Now it really begins\u2026.. Luke said.</span></div></div>",

Bruce said. We still didn\u2019t give my idea any thought. Tom said. No. We aren\u2019t using magic. Hank said. Why not? Tom said. Remember when you tried it? Your entire arm was blown clean off because you said the wrong spell. Dante said. Plus, the commander said for us not to. The price is too high. Cody said. And that kind of power corrupts a person. Someone has to be strong to resist that kind of influence. Could you imagine Kyle or one of his preteen monsters having that? Bruce said. The guys turn towards Kris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..What? She said. You\u2019re right. That would be bad. Cody said. I still think we should try it. Nobody\u2019s good at anything on their first go. We might be better than Luke at it. He said. I don\u2019t know\u2026.. That kind of power has to have a terrible price. What if we change in someway? Hank said. Like Tom not doing something stupid? You trying to deter or convince me? Dante said. It can\u2019t be that bad. I\u2019m pretty sure Luke was a hard ass even before he had magic. Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think it was a good idea to let Luke go without us? Sam said. He wouldn\u2019t want us in the way. The hunters I have no problem with, but the witches are another thing. Luke said they have a tendency to be dishonest and breaking deals. And then there\u2019s Devil Dog. Kim said. Who? She said. That man named Alex\u2026. That\u2019s Devil Dog. Kim said. THE Devil Dog? I thought he was just an urban legend. A myth you tell kids or scare people. Kim said. No. He\u2019s real. And that was him. A man with no morals and would do anything for money. And if you didn\u2019t have cash, he\u2019d take things like your house or other possessions. It\u2019s also rumored that he takes people as payment too. Kim said. And we just let him go with them? Sam said. Not like we had a choice. He\u2019d gone regardless of what we said. Kim said. I really wish the commander was here. Luke would only listen to him. Sam said. Don\u2019t we all. Em\u2019s taking this the hardest. Kris said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, everyone stopped moving. Frozen in place. Like time came to a still. Then the front door opens. It\u2019s\u2026.good to see you guys again. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow being  throws away Susan and slams Ashley into the ground. Man. This shadow is something else. Alex said as he heals from being stabbed multiple times. At least you\u2019re doing better than Ashley. That thing has it out for her. Alexis said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRgh!! Hold still! Ashley said. She attacks the shadow blindly and it grabs and twist her hand back. Ack! She said. The shadow starts to punch her repeatedly in the face until she\u2019s on the ground. And then starts to violently stomp and kick her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeating her like an abusive lover. Should we? Alex said. \u2026\u2026I see no reason to interrupt a good beating. Gavin said. The shadow only stops when Susan appears in front of it and force palm it back. Ashley\u2026.. She said. I\u2019m fine! Damnit, nothing is working! And those damn hunters are dragging their feet! Ashley said. Not like we immediately rush to their side when they take there turn. Susan said. So we\u2019re just watching each other get nowhere. I bet that shadow is laughing at as. Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back for seconds? That was a through beating. Gavin said. No thanks to you fuckers! We\u2019re suppose to be on the same side! She said. You were the one who rushed it with a full head of steam. What\u2019d you expect? Alexis said. Some damn backup! Ashley said. You had it from your sisters\u2026\u2026 Mediocre at best. Remi said. At least we\u2019re trying! And not watching others get beaten down! A witch said. Fools rush in. And I\u2019m seeing a whole bunch of fools right now. Luke said. Enough! We\u2019re not doing anyone any favors by arguing amongst ourselves. If we\u2019re going to stop this thing, we need to work together. Not as hunters. Not as witches. As a team of people who are fighting to protect what we care about. Kat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..Fine. Luke said. Put aside your petty difference and I\u2019ll put away mine. Gavin said. Master Hiro? Alex said. \u2026\u2026Help them anyway you can. Hiro said. Same goes to you. All of you. Kat said addressing the witches. \u2026..Alright. Fine. If they are willing, then I\u2019ll help. Ashley said. Same here. Susan said. The others nod in agreement. Then we\u2019re a cohesive unit. Kat said. Let\u2019s do this. Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026I know you guys have a lot of questions you want to ask, and I\u2019d love to answer them, but at a different time. You said. You finish drawing the hunter\u2019s symbol onto Dante\u2019s hand and hug him like you did the rest. I know I told each of you not to use magic, but rules were meant to be broken. Each one of you has the hunter\u2019s symbol on your hands. It will let you use magic, but only if your live are in peril. SO don\u2019t get any idea\u2019s, Tom. Since this is only a protection clause, it shouldn\u2019t rend the flesh from your bones. Take care of each other. You said before stopping the recording on your wrist device. You take it off and place it next to Bruce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo is that it? No heartfelt goodbye for me? Your darkhalf said. You aren\u2019t one for goodbyes. You said. You\u2019re right. So you\u2019re going for good? He said. Not for good. I\u2019ll be back. Someday. I just have to leave a message for one more person and see Mira and Miley. You\u2019re going to leave one for Sue? He said. As much as she annoyed me, Sue never gave up on me. Even after I killed her twice and her friends, she still thought I was worth saving. You said. Even if she did trap your soul in a locket for 4 days. He said. Heart in the right place, just not the way to do it. Still\u2026. As hard as it is to believe, she somewhat kept me grounded. She deserves that much. You said. Even if she has that my way or the highway attitude. He said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The shadow being took a step back as it felt the pressure from Luke, Kat, Hiro, and Ashley, The shadow being holds out its arm and multiple tendrils at them. They try to move, but find out there feet are bound by more tendrils in the ground. W-when did it do this!? Ashley said. As the tendrils get closer, they come to a sudden stop by Alexis, Alex, and Susan. They redirect them back towards it. When it tried to move, it was held in a stasis field by the other three witches. The tendrils go right through its chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid that work? Alexis said as she freed the four of them. No. But it should be hurting. Luke said. As the shadow pulls out the tendrils, it lets out a unearthly moan. Shit. And I thought you\u2019re snoring was a nightmare, Luke. Alex said. The shadow then looks at the united front and slam both arms into the ground. I don\u2019t like what it\u2019s doing. Ashley said. The ground starts to shake violently and multiple rows of shadow spikes rush them. Heinz, Luke, and Susan hit the ground and send out spikes of their own; which stops them both. The shadow disappears and weaves through the spikes and appears in front of them and slams the ground; sending a violent shockwave through the ground and sending most of the group into the air. The shadow then raises spikes that shoot towards them. I don\u2019t think- Before Luke could finish, his body is encased in a protective barrier just as the spike hits him. Instead, he bounces off it and lands on his feet. As do the others. How\u2026.? Who? Luke said. You\u2019re welcome. Ashley said. \u2026\u2026Hmph. Luke said. His way of saying thanks. Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Hiro? Remi said. Right. Alex. He said. Alex pulls out his two pistols and starts firing non stop. The shadow puts up a shield as the magic infused bullets get lodged into the shield. When the firing stops and the shield is gone, Remi\u2019s brush strings entangles the shadow. Hiro appears in front of the shadow then behind it and sheathe his sword. Then a bright blue flash cuts across the shadow. Then another. And another. And another until they stop. Now! Hiro said. Alexis and Susan say the spell to bind the shadow in place. When it tries to summon more spikes, it\u2019s body is also bounded in a stasis by Kat and the three other witches. Still remember? Alex said. Never forgot. Luke said. Both of them cut the hunter\u2019s symbol on their hands and they start to glow purple. They both rush towards the shadow and hit it and their arms go through it. The shadow lets out a whail as the circle glows. Got to move! Alex said. The both get pulled back by Susan and Ashley as a beam of magic shoot upward into the sky as it engulfs the shadow. Whoo! Been too long since we did that! Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the beam dies down, a figure is seen. No way\u2026.. None of that worked!? Ashley said. Ohhh\u2026\u2026.. The figure said. Wait! That voice\u2026.. Alexis said. All the hunter knew who that voice belongs too. Volenski! Alexis said. As the shadow armor fades from his body, he starts to fall until Hiro grabs him and appears next to the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot\u2026..bad. For the coalitions first enemy. Volenski said. First enemy? You mean all this time? Ashley said. Heh\u2026.. Who else? Who else knew all the counters to the hunters? Only\u2026.another hunter. He said. Why? Kat said. Alex\u2019s son told me all about this unity between the\u2026..hunters and witches. He said. He did? Remi said. I told you. Kat said. I was\u2026.skeptical at first, and he didn\u2019t trust the peace to last no more that a week. So\u2026..he thought to give them a big enough problem where both sides had to work together or be extinguished. He said. My son thought of all this? Alex said. It was all his idea from the beginning. He was the one who disguised me as himself and attack miss short temper here. He said. T-that was you!? Ashley said. Yes. He needed a messenger and who else but you. He said. So\u2026..Kat was right this entire time? Alexis said. I told you it was all him from the start. She said. Volenski\u2019s body starts to disappear. Ugh\u2026. You guys really did a number. Seems\u2026..like you hunters and witches can work together. He said. Wait! Volenski, where is my son at? Alex said. He said he went to a mansion. He said he had to meet a few people. He said before vanishing into particles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was already gone and so was Alexis. Damn\u2026.. They moved faster than I thought they can. Heinz said. \u2026\u2026Finish things up here. Alex said before vanishing. So\u2026.I guess we just depart? Remi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke bust through the door with Alexis\u2019 behind him. You just missed him. Bruce said. He\u2019s gone\u2026.. Dante said. Did he say anything?! Like where he was going?! Alexis said. No\u2026. He left as a message. And a parting gift. Tom said. Luke sees the wrist device and plays the message. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm\u2019s not taking it well. I didn\u2019t think it was possible for a demon to cry. Tom said. What\u2019s this parting gift he left? Alexis said. He carved a symbol on our hands. Said it was to protect us. Cody said. Luke sees the symbol. The hunter\u2019s symbol\u2026.. There\u2019s magic within it too. He said. He\u2026.gave us magic to use as protection. Hank said. How did he even do this without us knowing? Sam said. He stopped time. Luke said. Luke! Is he here?! Alex said, appearing. No\u2026. He\u2019s long gone. Luke said. (A\u2026. Alex?) Em said. Em? Alex said. The two stare at each other for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn\u2026.. I forgot what you looked like. Has it been that long? He said. (It has\u2026.. Leah would be surprised as well\u2026..) She said. She would\u2026\u2026 Even she didn\u2019t think this whole demon thing would turn out well. He said. (It wasn\u2019t a good start.) She said. That\u2019s him? Kim whispered. Yeah. Don\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s here for money. Sam said. I\u2019m not\u2026.. Alex said. Sam and Kim both looked surprised. I\u2019ve seen looks like that and whispers. I\u2019ve stopped being a bounty hunter years ago. It\u2019s not worth the sleepless nights\u2026.. All I want is to see my son. He said. He\u2019s gone. He left us with these marks. Tom said. The message he left us said he\u2019d be back one day. Cody said. But\u2026.. Why would he leave in the first place? Kris said. \u2026\u2026I think he thinks we\u2019d be better off without him. Dante said. What? Why? Bruce said. Ok\u2026.. Nobody rip me apart for this, but\u2026.. Things tend to get out of control with him around. Dante said. Out of control? Cody said. Em looks at Dante with a furious expression. Em! Calm down. Luke said. It\u2019s in no disrespect to him, but he\u2019s always at the center of all the problems. We all remember Kyle and her reign of terror. Who stopped it? Dante said. The commander\u2026. Tom said. And when he left to go take out that\u2026..? What\u2019s it called again? Dante said. Coven. Luke said. Right. No danger to us, but he went off on his own. And let\u2019s not forget we were all mind controlled by Lilith. He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut those things were out of his control. He told us he had no problem with Kyle\u2019s rule. And the coven was an act of revenge. And he didn\u2019t have anything to do with Lilith. He came to save us in the end. Tom said. And that\u2019s the thing. They always end with him. One way or another, and whether he wants to or not. Dante said. EM! I said no! Let him finish! Luke said. What I\u2019m trying to get at is that maybe he thinks things will be better off for us with him gone. If he\u2019s not here, then there\u2019s no problem. Dante said. There\u2019s always going to be a problem. We\u2019ve only recently found out about witch hunters and witches. And this whole thing about magic. Hank said. Right. But we only had to worry about those preteen Godzilla Wanna-be\u2019s either killing or enslaving us. We didn\u2019t think anything else would exist outside of that. Dante said. \u2026\u2026.Have things really gotten that bad? Tom said. He used protocol black on us. Sam said. We were mind controlled! All of us were! It was plan he never thought he\u2019d use. I mean, would we really turn our backs on him?! Bruce said. No\u2026. Dante said. We wouldn\u2019t even get the chance. Not with Em and Luke here. Tom said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve been where his head is. You think the world and the people you love would be better off without you. I made so many enemies that I thought leaving would be the only way for my family to be safe. Alex said. I had them too. If my ties with my family weren\u2019t strong, I\u2019d done it. Alexis said. The room fills with silence. So\u2026. Does that mean we just\u2026..stop looking? Cody said. \u2026\u2026If he wanted to come back, he would have stayed when he gave us these. Kris said. So we\u2026. Hank said. Yeah\u2026. Stop searching. If he said he\u2019ll come back, then we have to trust him on it. Bruce said. Em nearly broke down, which almost made Alex do the same.</span></div></div>",

Usually, she\u2019d stay in M district until the moon was high in the sky, but after what happened, she needed some rest. She still can\u2019t believe that peace between the hunters and witches had finally been reached. She thought pigs would fly before that happened. She flops onto her bed and sighs. She was going to milk this as long as she could because she knew it was only a matter of time before she has to deal with a certain someone. She knew those seven years of peace would have to come to an end. I already know what he\u2019s going to say. \u201cI did what you couldn\u2019t, Sue. That\u2019s twice I had to show you up at your own game.\u201d She said in a mocking tone. She sighs heavily. If I could just brand my name on him, I\u2019d ask for nothing else. She said. When she sits up and sees a device on her dresser. What the\u2026.. She said, getting up. She looks at the device. This\u2026.is the same device I stole from that girl. But he broke it. She said. She cautiously picks it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s a message here address for me. She said. She pushes the play button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHello Su- No\u2026. Ashley. Bet you enjoyed all that time you didn\u2019t have to deal with me. Finally stopped ripping out your hair. You said. One time\u2026.. She said. I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush here. You and me never saw eye to eye on anything. Kyle, life philosophy, choices. Hell, we\u2019d argue about everything like an old married couple. You said. Oh god\u2026.. You both said. But I\u2019m getting sidetracked here. What I wanted to say was\u2026\u2026 Even though we butt heads on everything, you were the one of two people who kept me grounded. You said. Ashley has a surprised look. I know, shocking. But you know it yourself. No matter what I did, you still saw good in a person whose done nothing but shit for himself. Even when you ripped out my soul, you still had hope for me. Others would have just thrown there hands up. I guess that stubbornness of yours is good for something. You said. \u2026..Heh. More like trouble. She said with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook\u2026. It\u2019s not easy for me to do this. Live life with no regrets. But\u2026.. I\u2019m sorry for the trouble I\u2019ve caused you. She said. Ashley went wide eyed. Yeah, you heard me. I said I\u2019m sorry. I never meant for things to get like this between us. I wasn\u2019t out to make enemies of anyone. I wanted to be left alone. But a guy who can knockout someone 10x his size isn\u2019t incline to a solitary life, I guess. You said. He only wanted to be alone? She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t want this message to drag out longer than needed. The world needs more good people like you. Just work on not being a Mary Sue. You said. Just couldn\u2019t help yourself, could you? She said. I couldn\u2019t help myself. But this has gone on long enough. Goodbye Ashley\u2026\u2026 And good luck. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time, he just wanted to be left alone. And there is a person inside him. I knew it\u2026...  \u2026\u2026Godspeed. Wherever you are. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk\u2026.. Everything\u2019s taken care of. Time to go. You said. Not so fast. A voice said. You see a black mist rise into the air and red eyes in them. Oh. Devil What do I owe the displeasure? You said. I come to collect. He said. Collect what? I didn\u2019t make a deal with you. You said. Ah, but remember when you wanted to talk with Sylvia? I told you, everything has a price. He said. Course you remember that. \u2026..Fine. On one condition. My dad and mom get their lives back as well. You said. Hahahahahaha! You really think yours is worth not one, but two witches and a hunter\u2019s? He said. You know what I\u2019ve done. Plus, you know when hunter\u2019s die, our souls go to the hunter\u2019s cabin. You said. I know. You hunters really don\u2019t like following the rules. He said. And you know a hunter\u2019s soul has a lot more value than a witches. And I heard the stories of my mother, but I heard my father\u2019s as well. You tell me who seems like a prime candidate you want. You said. \u2026\u2026Ha\u2026. HAHAHAHAHAHA! You really are devil dog\u2019s son! Both of you have the gift of the gab. Very well. For your mother, father, and Sylvia, you take their place. Fine by-No deal. A voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to see Heather coming out of a shadow. Heather\u2026.. You said. You\u2026.. I don\u2019t know if I should be happy or mad at you. You played with my feelings when I was trying to keep you safe. She said. I didn\u2019t\u2026.mean to. It\u2019s just something I had to do. You said. You used me! If I didn\u2019t care about you, I\u2019d make you a mindless slave and torture you without end! She said as her right eye starts to faintly glow. But\u2026.. I do care about you. Which is why I\u2019m here. No deal, devil. Go find another person with nothing to lose. She said. Hold on. I already agreed to it. You said. Well, I don\u2019t. Find another hunter or witch to sink your teeth into. She said. This is between me and him. I made a deal with Sylvia to bring her back. This is my mess. You said. I don\u2019t care! I\u2019m not letting you do this because kingdom obsessed Sylvia wants to be back with the living! She said. It\u2019s not just Sylvia, Heather. His life for Alex and Leah as well. The devil said. Like hell you are! You\u2019re not taking him anywhere! She said. Don\u2019t you want to see her again, Heather? You two were the best of friends. Attached to the hip and everything. Surely you want to relive those days. He said. Heather\u2019s relationship with your mom sounds like\u2026.. Chijinda\u2026.. You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026I miss her everyday. But I made her a promise to look after her child! And I don\u2019t break- Forlumus. You interrupt. A dark circle appears under Heather and dark tethers bind her. What?! Sec- You grab her by the throat to stop her. Silncos. You said. You let go to see of her and see a black ring on her neck. When she tries to speak, nothing comes out. \u2026\u2026Let\u2019s get this over with. You said. A black fog circles around you as Heather\u2019s eyes go wide. \u2026\u2026.Oktar volumus liftus.

She shouts as tears run down her cheek. As she sobs, a symbol appears on the ground and out of it comes Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Yawn* Time to work already? She said rubbing her head. She hears crying and looks to see who it is. Heather? Leah said. L\u2026. Leah\u2026.. Heather said as she hugged her. Jesus, Heather. What\u2019s the occasion? Are you crying? She said. A\u2026.and? I can show emotions like other people\u2026. Heather said, trying to act normal. Not like this. You\u2019re acting like your child was killed right in front of you. Leah said. Is that coming from the same girl who cried for an hour and a half at the end of Old Yellow? Heather said. Ok. You know I\u2019m close to bloodhound. That ending is torturous to any dog lover. Leah said. Right\u2026.. Heather said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what did you summon me for? I know it wasn\u2019t just to bring up old memories. She said. A\u2026. A lot has happened. Heather said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather tells Leah everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally not surprised mom tried to live like it was the 15th century again. And mind control too. Hell, not even grandma went that far. She wanted a kingdom but was subtle about it. Although she got poisoned in the end. So the hunters finally put aside their differences with us? She said. Yeah\u2026.. Your son not only stopped your mother\u2026. But he put the idea out there. She said. My baby did? Leah said. Yeah\u2026.. He\u2019s turned into a fine person. Heather said. I\u2026. Haven\u2019t seen him since he was a toddler. She said. You don\u2019t remember seeing him back in the coven? Heather said. You know people who are summoned don\u2019t keep their memories of each time they are summoned. She said. Right\u2026.. You remember Alex? She said. Of course I do. We\u2019re married. She said. Well, he\u2019s back too. Heather said. He is? That means I can have my family back! Wait. Is Luke still around? Leah said. You know he is. Heather said. Oh god\u2026.. I better find him before Luke gets him wrapped up in trouble again. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah?! A voice said. A\u2026.Alex? Leah said. Alex appears right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah\u2026. He said. Alex\u2026 She said as she cupped him in her hands. It\u2019s been so long\u2026.. I forgot what you looked like. He said. And what kind of husband forgets what his wife looks like? She said. Like I said, been so long. You know hunters don\u2019t go to hell. We go straight to the Hunter\u2019s cabin. Alex said. You guys really hate doing things that aren\u2019t your way. Heather said. Heather? You\u2019re still kicking? Alex said. Why wouldn\u2019t I? Leah told me to look me to look after her child. She said. That you flirt with nonstop. He said. Really, Heather? My baby? Leah said. He\u2019s cute with that serious look he has. She said. I said look after him, not flirt with him. She said. Heather gives a nervous laugh as Leah rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this is quite the reunion. All that\u2019s missing is my baby boy. Leah said. Both Alex and Heather look away. What? My baby is alive, right? She said. About that\u2026\u2026 Alex and Heather both said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in m district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dark half was heading back to Mira\u2019s house. The things I do for you\u2026.. I\u2019d laughed if someone told me this was going to happen. He said. Before he could open the door, his body starts to fade. What the?! Oh shit\u2026. Never thought this day would come. He said. As his body starts to fade away, a bight stasis field surround him and his body starts to become solid again. Huh? He said. The field stays on him for a minute then it disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat bastard\u2026.. I don\u2019t know if I should be angry or overjoyed. He said. (Heh\u2026. Leaving me behind with your mess\u2026.. Fine. The one time you save me. I\u2019ll remember this. Try not to cause too much trouble down there without me.) He thought. When he reached for the door, it flung open and Miley grabs hugs him. Brother! She said. Miley, you\u2019re getting too old for this\u2026.. You\u2019re going to tackle me to the ground one day. He said. She lets go of him. Whoa\u2026. Someone\u2019s getting bigger. How many growth spurts did you have since last time? You said. I\u2019m 23 now. You expected me to stay the same height forever? She said. A little. He said. By the way, you said I could start coming with you when I get older. She said. I did? He said. Yeah. When I was 16, you said \u201cI\u2019ll let you come with me when you\u2019re older.\u201d Well, I\u2019m older now. She said. (This time, the mess is mine to clean.) He thought. Is Mira going to be ok with this? She\u2019s your sister. He said. Mira! Miley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing out of her room, Mira sees your dark half and mistakes it for you. Hey Mira\u2026.. You\u2019ve been letting your hair grow out. He said. She says nothing at she walks up to him and hugs him tightly. I\u2019ve missed you. She said. I know\u2026.. Sorry for the sudden departure.
