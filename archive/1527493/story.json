This first chapter is simply meant to set things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReminder of the rules<br>\r\n=================<br>\r\n1.) Sex, homosexuality, weight gain, and the like are allowed.  Just remember that the focus on the story has to be women being eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) No men as food.  Sorry, but there's dozens of other Interactives like that on Writing.com.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Vore and Cannibalism/Dolcett is allowed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) No girls under 16 being eaten or having sex.  If a character in the anime/game/etc. is that young and you insist on her being eaten, then age her up.  Any prey characters under 16 will result in immediate chapter deletion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.) Male preds and female preds are allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, here's some stuff to start you off.  Enjoy.  </span></div></div>",

She coughed, looked at Artemis for encouragement, the white cat nodding to her and smiling.  She sighed, and turned back to the gathered heroes and continued.  \"I have good news, better news, bad news, worse news, and utterly strange news. Which would you like to hear first?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Senshi all looked at each other worriedly for several moments before Tuxedo Mask said, \"Why don't you give the news to us in the order you said it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLuna sighed, and nodded.  \"Very well.  First, the good news: I have found out a way for all of you to come back from the dead that's guaranteed to work every single time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Senshi all began to talk amongst themselves, pleased looks coming to their faces.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well... A bit depressing, but considering how many times we've died, that's good to know,\" Sailor Mars said after a few moments.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLuna, encouraged, decided to continue.  \"The better news is that with this new method, which is actually a spell formula that I encoded into your drinks that will restore your bodies completely after death, will make you more powerful each time you resurrect, which should be a fairly quick process.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone looked down at their drinks in surprise.  Liking the idea, they all eagerly drank their respective drinks in a single gulp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMercury licked her lips curiously.  \"Taste was off.  And I feel a slight tingle in my stomach.  Is that the formula?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLuna nodded.  \"Artemis, Diana and I have already consumed the formula.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTuxedo Mask chuckled.  \"Well, might as well get with the bad news.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLuna grimaced.  \"The bad news is that there's a demonic force heading for Earth that will be here in three years.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone froze, staring at Luna with alarmed expressions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLuna shook her head sadly.  \"The worse news is that we won't be strong enough to defeat him by then.  Creating enhancements for everyone's powers would take too long, and we've eliminated every threat strong enough to force enough resurrections to enhance our powers enough.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"There has to be something we can do!\" Sailor Moon almost wailed, \"We can't just sit here and let this thing kill us!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"There is... one possibility,\" Luna said, \"But it's rather... bizarre...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Tell us!\" Mars said, \"At this point we'll take anything!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLuna looked to Artemis and then sighed, shaking her head and saying, \"Kill each other.  Repeatedly.  Several dozen times over.  Tuxedo Mask could conceivably be excused from this, since his powers are connected to Sailor Moon's and he grows stronger with her, and it would be prudent to have someone around to make sure nothing goes wrong...  Plus all of you are more powerful than he is anyway...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone stared at Luna incredulously.  \"Um...\" Sailor Moon said, \"As much as Rei and I would like to blast each other into moondust at times... I really don't think I'd like getting blasted or gutted or poisoned so many times...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Which brings us to the bizarre news,\" Artemis said, \"We've found something that might make this a bit easier.  But it's just as bizarre.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It can't be more bizarre than having to kill each other repeatedly to get stronger.  It's messy, it's hard to cover up, it's...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It can be solved by cooking and eating each other instead of using your powers on each other,\" Luna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone stared at Luna in numb shock.  Luna sighed.  \"I only wish I was kidding...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone just stared at her, unable to speak for a long moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're suggesting...\" Mercury stated, \"That we get stronger through the multi-ressurect method...  By eating each other...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLuna sighed again.  \"I know it's strange, but after looking through several alternate realities we've found methods to make it not only painless but pleasurable.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMoon blinked.  \"Luna, how many times will we have to die to get strong enough?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLuna and Artemis traded pained looks and gave them the abnormally large number.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone in the room promptly facefaulted and pratfell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Merciful Buddah...\" Mars said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Indeed,\" Mercury said, \"Barring the utter strangeness of it, if we eat each other that many times, we'll be incredibly FAT by the time that the menace gets here!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm open to better suggestions...\" Luna sighed, \"Believe me, I'm open to better suggestions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo one said anything for a long time, each one slowly admitting they had nothing better to think of and coming to terms with the idea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So...\" Jupiter said, \"I guess we officially become cannibals, then...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMoon nodded, sighing and cuddling up to Tuxedo Mask. \"I guess so,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUranus, after a moment, chuckled and hugged Neptune.  \"Well, I've always enjoyed eating pussy.  I guess this is just a natural extension of it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNeptune blushed and buried her head in her lover's chest, both to hide her embarrassment and stifle her laughter.  Saturn and Chibi-Moon both looked pained, while most of the others gave Uranus looks ranging from amused to annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So how shall we go about this?\" Venus asked, wanting to change the subject.</span></div></div>",

Aside from the lamia tail wrapped around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Miia... MIIA!\" he groaned, trying to dislodge the lustful lamia's crushing grip on his body. She merely shifted in her sleep, letting out a soft sigh as she brought her human half up against her darling's body. Her buxom breasts, squishy and supple, squished against his face, while her chin rested atop his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't a new situation by any means, though it was something Kimihito had explicitly warned her against. Any <i>lewd</i> contact with the girls was forbidden, after all, under the threat of deportation- and possibly jailtime for the unlucky guy at that! He had to admit he wasn't entirely sure of the extent of the consequences, as Ms. Smith's explanation had been rather half-assed (as were most of her job duties, at that), but both he and the rest of the girls knew that sleeping in the same bed was not an acceptable situation. \"Dammit, Miia...\" he sighed, working a hand free from her coils. She never was one to respect little rules like that. Or rules like 'personal space'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensitive tip of her tail flitted nearby, happily swishing back and forth as its owner slumbered happily. If he could get his hands on that, he'd be home-free... And with a little bit of effort he was able to grab it, causing an involuntary shudder to flow through the snake-girl's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Darling...\" she moaned, her grip loosening. Touching her weak spot had afforded him enough movement to get his other hand free, but to slip out entirely he knew it would require a little more working. He grasped her tail with both hands and took a deep breath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... and placed the tip of Miia's tail in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe action surprised even himself. He didn't quite even realize what he was doing, working off what felt like instinct. Slowly he began to suckle on her scales, bringing more and more of her into his mouth. It was like slurping up a big, long noodle- one that quivered with pleasure as he worked his way along the several-meters long tail. Miia's eyes remained closed, but her mouth had fallen open into a wide, goofy smile, some drool dripping from her jaws as she blissfully dozed, unaware that she was being swallowed whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Darling... That feels so... so...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grip had slackened enough that Kimihito was free, now. He could stop, now, with his mission complete- but for some reason he carried onward, continuing to take in more and more of the lamia with long, hungry swallows. Most of her tail was curled up in his belly, now, which bulged unnaturally to accommodate the massive meal. He was so close now, relatively, that he had no other choice than to finish the job. Driven by some strange desire, he began eating her human half as well. Her hips squeezed between his lips, leaving him at her slim, firm belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... And that's when Miia's eyes finally fluttered open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling... A-Ah, you're finally...\" she murmured, still half-asleep. When she looked down, however, she quickly shot awake. Her Darling was eating her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Darling! No!\" she squealed, beginning to thrash and struggle. Her tail was firmly squeezed into place within Kimihito's stomach, however, leaving her much weaker human half to try to break free. Making matters worse, the hungry human was already up to her breasts, swallowing those massive mounds like big, meaty dumplings- and her arms were pinned to her sides, as her hands had descended down his ravenous gullet. There was nothing the lamia could do but watch as her Darling finished her off, working his way over her head and ending with one last, resounding <i>gulp</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimihito let out a long, satisfied <i>sigh</i>, his lamia-filled belly resting on the bed alongside him. It gurgled and groaned, his human body unused to eating so much in one sitting, while the lamia's imprint very clearly showed the identity of its occupant.</span></div></div>",

The hot, cramped confines of Kimihito's stomach were beginning to tingle, making her squirm about what little she could. \"Darling, you're digesting me! Darling!

His stomach had returned to its usual, average size, save for a little bit of fat around it center. He looked over at the clock, which read well-past noon. \"I must've really been tired...\" he thought to himself, stretching his arms as he yawned loudly. \"I haven't slept in this late since-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe interrupted himself with a loud <i>belch</i>, loosing a pair of D-shaped hair decorations from his mouth that fell to the floor with two, quiet <i>tinks</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, I ate Miia,\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world was silent for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <b><i>ate</i></b> Miia?!\" he repeated, covering his mouth in shock. He ripped away his blankets to look down at his stomach, but it showed nothing of his gluttonous morning action. Aside from her hair decorations that lay abandoned at his bedside, there was absolutely nothing left of the cheery, lovestruck liminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's gone...\" he said to himself, remembering the events of that morning. How did he even do that? <i>Why</i> did he do that? He couldn't help himself, almost like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed. It was too late for Miia, he supposed- she was digested.

She looked nervous, clearly flustered just by entering the most sacred space of her master's bedroom, but she still moved to Kimihito's side, standing tall and proud as if she were his bodyguard despite still being in her casual clothes.<br>\r\n\"You don't seem to be ill...\" She muttered, gently placing her hand on the young man's forehead to check his temperature. Up close like this, Kimihito could <i>feel</i> the heat of her body, to say nothing about how her immense chest was lowered down to mere inches away from his face and caused his stomach to rumble loudly.

The cooking and eating of women.  Named for an artist known for making several cannibalism pics of that type.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito, frowning a little, found the source of the voice.  A oldish-looking man with a long beard, a robe, and a staff, looking very much the stereotypical wizard, was staring at him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Um, can I help you...\" Kimihito started to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Dolcett.  A sexual fetish,\" the man said, pointing directly at Kimihito.  \"A fetish which you have.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito blinked, blushing.  \"What?  I don't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You have forty gigabytes of cannibalism porn on your computer, triple-sealed beneath passwords and in files,\" the old man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNow Kimihito was angry.  \"Did you hack my computer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yes,\" the old man admitted, unashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito blinked, taken aback.  He sneered.  \"Awfully high tech for a wizard,\" he teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You'd be surprised how often science and magic intersect,\" the old man said, smirking at him.  \"You also tend to view this porn late at night, when you're alone, in your bedroom, after locking every possible entranceway to keep the seven monstergirls you are living with out of your room.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito was becoming very uneasy.  His browsing history was one thing, and he'd been seen around town with his seven monstergirl friends, but knowing what he did at night?  \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe man's staff began to glow, surrounding both he and Kimihito in a bright white light.  Kimihito tried to back away, but he bumped into an invisible wall.  After frantically patting at the wall to find an exit, he worriedly turned back to the wizard.  The old man smiled, and intoned, \"I am, as you so mockingly stated, a wizard.  My name is not important.  Just know that I come bringing you a gift.  The restrictions on your life are now removed.  You can have sex with any female you want, be it your seven potential brides, Ms. Smith or her group, or any other monstergirl you've ever met, even those already in a relationship.  You will instincitvely know how to please them without getting injured accidentally.  In addition, you will be able to live out your fantasy of cooking and eating women.  If you are worried about losing them, do not fear, for after consumption they will simply respawn in a new body, ready and willing to be eaten again.  Your own body can now gain as much weight as you want without any negative health effects.  Because you are kind, because you are virtuous, I am giving you the power to get away with anything, Kimihito Kurusu.  Because you are the only type of person who will not abuse this power.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe glow of the staff became even more intense, and Kimihito, strangely, felt the world starting to shift around him.  He staggered, a tingling feeling erupting throughout his body.  After a minute of this, the glow faded, leaving only Kimihito and an old man in an alley.  The old man bowed, and floated into the sky, disappearing in a swirl of darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito just stared.  \"...Honestly, I'm surprised I'm surprised by this, considering the life I've lead,\" he said, mainly to himself.  He went home, thinking about what the man said...  As he passed a fruit stand, he quickly grabbed an apple from it and left without paying for it, as a test, right in front of the shop owner's face.  Feeling guilty, he turned around after a moment, pulling out some money.  He was surprised, though, to see that the shopkeeper wasn't glaring at him.  Didn't even seem to notice him.  He'd just gotten away with theft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Huh...\" Kimihito said, wondering even more about what the old man (wizard?) said.  Still, he felt he should pay for the apple, so he went back and did so.  The transaction passed normally, as if Kimihito hadn't just walked away with the apple at first.  He went home, eating the apple, lost in thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I can get away with anything now...\" he said to himself.  \"At least, that's what the wizard claimed...  Plus the sex restriction is gone...\" That, honestly, he was somewhat grateful for.  You'd think having Miia practically throw herself at him for so long, plus Papi shoving his face in her crotch so much while trying to carry him through the air, plus getting smushed so much by Cerea's massive boobs, plus Suu's casual nudity, plus Mero's clothing having trouble staying on her body, plus Rachnee's constant cockteasing... after all of that, you'd think he'd be desensitized to beautiful women at this point.  But no, he's still a healthy young man, a beautiful body more than capable of turning him on.  This way, he wouldn't have to be blueballed so much.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPlus... He blushed brightly thinking of it.  He had so many fantasies involving cooking and eating the girls.  Come up with so many recipes in his head, half of them made as a way of venting frustration.  And now he'd get to try some of them... If the wizard was right, of course.  Although more and more it was looking like he was.</span></div></div>",

Miia immediately glomped him, the beautiful, buxom, red-headed lamia deliberately rubbing her gorgeous body up against him.  Cerea, the busty centaur, pulled her away, the blonde beauty arguing with her for a moment before greeting him in a more reserved manner.  (He could tell she wanted to glomp him too, though.)  Papi, the adorable, child-like, blue-haired harpy and Suu, the lovely blue slime girl, were watching cartoons, the two waving to him from the couch.  Rachnee, the buxom arachne, looked out from the lounge, where she was weaving her silk into clothing., and nodded to Kimihito in greeting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMero, the beautiful, wheelchair-bound-when-on-land mermaid princess, and Lala, the mysterious, utter ham of a Dullahan, were, surprisingly, talking rather animatedly off to one side of the lounge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you all,\u201d he said, so very appreciative of all his girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd of course, we are glad to see you, master,\u201d Cerea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow was your day, darling?\u201d Miia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWeird,\u201d Kimihito said honestly, going into the kitchen to get some water.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh?  How so?\u201d Miia asked, slithering over to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not sure how to explain it,\u201d Kimihito said.  \u201cBut things should improve.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh,\u201d Miia said.  \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d  She smiled warmly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnyway\u2026\u201d Kimihito said.  \u201cI think we should just order out for dinner.  I don\u2019t feel like cooking right now.\u201d  I\u2019m going to be doing a lot of cooking fairly soon, though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCerea nodded.  \u201cOh!  Before I forget, master,\u201d she said, \u201ca strange old man came buy with a crew and installed a new room.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering about that,\u201d Rachnee said.  \u201cIt\u2019s weird, compared to the other rooms.  Like a kitchen/torture chamber.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito blinked.  \u201cShow me,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMiia, Rachnee, Mero, and Cerea all led him to the new room in the center of the house.  It was huge, covered in what Kimihito recognized as stain resistant material.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBloodstains, he thought absently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a large drain in the center, and a large set of ovens on one side, each one large enough to contain even Rachnee or Cerea\u2026  if they were tied down and put in a pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito gulped, feeling himself become both hungry and aroused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking over the room some more, he saw several large knives and cutting devices.  All of them clearly designed for chopping up meat.  There was even a tanning rack on the side opposite the ovens.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWow\u2026\u201d Kimihito said huskily.  He\u2019d envisioned kitchens like this for his fantasies.  It was as if this old man who gave him such a wondrous gift was deliberately trying to cater to his lustful desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMiia blinked.  \u201cAh, that\u2019s right.  He gave me a note to give to you, said you\u2019d understand.  I don\u2019t know the language\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d Rachnee said as Miia pulled the note out of her shirt pocket.  \u201cIt\u2019s suspicious\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito read the note.  It was in a language he didn\u2019t know, but he could tell what it said nevertheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo one can read this but you,\u201d the note said.  \u201cI was cursed long ago by an enemy who said that to free myself from this curse, I must help a truly virtuous man live out their repressed dark desires in a way that will result in no negative consequences for them.  To repeat what I said earlier, you can now get away with anything thanks to my spell.  Your girls can come back from being killed, for food or otherwise, over and over again.  No law will ever be used against you.  You are free of health consequences.  Fuck anyone, whether they want it or not, you\u2019re now immune to all diseases (including zombification)!  Get as fat as you want, you\u2019ll never have a heart attack!  Plus, I put spellbooks in your room that will let you slim down again anytime.  You are FREE.  And it is because you are a virtuous soul that I know you will never exploit this.  This room is a bonus, a place to butcher anyone you want to consume.  And in case you doubt that you are worthy of such a gift, then consider this: my curse was immortality.  I would only be allowed to die if I gave this gift to the pure of heart.  And the moment I freed you from consequences, I felt myself start to die.  I am free now\u2026 and so are you.  I finally rest in peace.  Thank you.  And have fun.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito found himself smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what\u2019s it say?\u201d Rachnee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s my own private butcher shop,\u201d Kimihito said, the four relaxing a little.  After a moment\u2019s thought, he decided to just rephrase.  \u201cI\u2019m going to be eating a lot of meat in the future.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMiia grinned.  \u201cSounds delicious, darling,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito just smirked.  He closed the door to his new meat factory, and led everyone back into the main living room.  He sat down, and began looking everyone over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll seven of his monstergirl companions were incredibly attractive.  Even after everything he had experienced, they still aroused him.  But now, he found himself admiring them in other ways.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMiia\u2019s long tail, so thick and meaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCerea\u2019s heavy flanks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRachnee\u2019s massive spider-abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMero\u2019s fish tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPapi\u2019s legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLala\u2019s firm gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuu\u2019s entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe found his mouth watering as he looked his companions over.  He briefly had an urge to lunge and start chomping, but he suppressed it.  No reason to rush things\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGirls?\u201d he said, catching the attention of all seven.  \u201cI\u2019ve decided to step things up a little.  To help me figure out who should I marry, I\u2019m going to add a new category of consideration.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis definitely got their attention.  Lala had stated she was willing to wait for Kimihito\u2019s death, putting herself out of the competition, but the others, despite their friendship, all greatly desired Kimihito.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito smiled.  \u201cI\u2019m going to be evaluating all seven of you as sexual partners.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCerea squeaked, both embarrassed and excited.  All seven blushed,  their reactions varied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPapi and Suu traded excited grins.  Miia was clearly fighting the urge to go \u201cYESYEYSYESYESYES!\u201d  Cerea had turned redder than Miia\u2019s scales.  Mero was giggling, going \u201cOh my\u201d over and over again.  Lala looked flustered, her head literally falling off her shoulders.  And Rachnee was grinning slowly, looking rather pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito grinned.  \u201cI am going to be sexually accosting all of you near constantly from now on, molesting you whenever I want.  Are you all okay with this?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a chorus of approval.  Kimihito chuckled, unable to believe how well this was going despite the assurances from the old wizard.  \u201cOne thing, though\u2026\u201d Kimihito felt compelled to add.  \u201cWhatever happens\u2026 Stay friends.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe others paused, and looked at each other.  As Kimihito watched, they all smiled warmly.  \u201cI think we can manage that, darling,\u201d Miia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito grinned.  \u201cOh, and if I decided to have sex with another woman other than you seven, that\u2019s just me playing around.  You seven are the ones I\u2019m considering for marriage,\u201d he said, deciding to try something.  \u201cOkay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNormally, the girls would protest.  They felt they should protest.  But the world worked in Kimihito\u2019s favor now.  They thought about it, and each found themselves to be fine with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure thing, darling,\u201d Miia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m okay with that, husband!\u201d Papi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt is your choice, Master,\u201d Cerea said, bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhatever you wish, dear,\u201d Mero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSuu is okay with that,\u201d Suu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMan\u2019s gotta sow his oats while he can.  Right, honey?\u201d Rachnee said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe pleasures of one as noble as you cannot be constrainted to a mere seven women.  This one will not interfere with you satisfying the desires of your loins,\u201d Lala said in her usual melodramatic fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito grinned.  That gives me an excuse to have fun with Mrs. Smith and MON when they inevitably come over to freeload, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThings were going quite well.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He served everyone and, as was his wont, began doing some light cleaning throughout the movie they were watching, turning his attention to it whenever an excited exclaimation was said.  As he did, he licked his lips, looking over his friends.  He loved them all, to be sure, but truthfully, he really wanted to eat them just as much as he loved them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe knew that he had the freedom to do what he wanted with them now.  That they wouldn't resist.  And as he watched, they all start to make gestures towards open flirting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMiia and Mero both had pulled their skirts up.  Suu had chugged a bottle of water, her breasts visibly swelling before Kimihito's eyes.  Papi unbuttoned and unzipped her shorts, giving a brief view of her blue pubic hair.  Lala had abandoned her jacket, while Rachnee had pulled up her shirt a little, exposing enough underboob to show a bit of nipple.  Cerea was the last to do something enticing, blushing as she unbuttoned part of her shirt, showing her expansive cleavage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito giggled.  This was several dreams coming true at once.  But he noticed that Cerea was still blushing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You okay?\" Kimihito asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"S'undignified...\" Cerea said, twiddling her fingers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito smiled.  \"You have nothing to be ashamed of.  You, like everyone here, are exceptionally beautiful,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCerea smiled, but she was still blushing.  \"It's not shame, Master,\" she said.  \"It's just... propriety...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito sighed.  \"Cerea... It's me.  You have my PERMISSION to flaunt yourself.  Certainly not having it hasn't stopped Miia.  Or Rachnera when she's feeling frisky.  Or Suu accidentally absorbing me with her hugs.  Or Mero nearly drowning me whenever she gets in her tragedy-freak moods.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSaid slime and mermaid immediately looked sheepish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito unbuttoned Cerea's shirt the rest of the way, the centaur squeaking as everyone else in the room watched with interest.  Kimihito grabbed her breasts, Cerea stammering as he massaged them.  \"You have a beautiful body,\" Kimihito said.  \"Every inch of you is pure sex.  And yeah, I admit, the chest pillows are part of what attracts me to you.  But I find every inch of you attractive.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCerea, blushing brightly, stopped resisting, simply let Kimihito fondle her breasts.  He smiled at everyone.  \"The same for all of you.  No matter how unusual you may think you are to humans, I want all of you to know that I find you all incredibly attractive,\" he said.  He chuckled, and added, \"It's part of the reason it's been so hard to choose all this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girls all chuckled appreciatively.  Cerea left her top unbuttoned the rest of the night, everyone going to bed happy after the movie.  Kimihito, meanwhile, was looking through the spellbooks he had been provided.  He learned that the respawn spell was one that he could control, meaning he could eat all the girls one by one and then respawn them all at once.  It was tempting to have them all gone for a while to have some quiet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAmong the spellbooks were also some cookbooks, one for each body type among his girls and other girls he knew, with prep times and cooking times as well.  He eventually decided on whole roasts for his first meals.  He'd go for fancier things later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kimihito grabbed some prepared vegetables and fruits and putted them around Cerea's unconscious form.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kimihito Kurusu was, by all accounts, a completely normal person - his childhood and teenage years had been perfectly uneventful (save for a brief edgy phase that he did his best to think about as little as possible), and he owned a medium-sized house given to him by his parents as they enjoyed retirement, working a perfectly average job as a cook in a local cafe. In terms of appearance, he was quite normal-looking, but still fairly attractive, with a head of black hair, soft brown eyes, and a kind welcoming face. His figure was a rather average six feet tall with a decent amount of muscle on him, and his wardrobe was simple shirts and pants, nothing too fancy. He was a perfectly pleasant person to talk to, always kind and willing to lend an ear to people for them to talk about their problems, but he didn't go out of his way to be actively social. He was content with his lot in life and the friends he had, and he had a job that he enjoyed. The only really noteworthy thing about the guy that most people ever noticed was his metabolism - every once in a while, he would abruptly pack on the pounds, his clothes straining to fit him until he managed to work off the weight in a frenzy of intense physical activity. But beyond that, there really wasn't anything particularly extraordinary about Mr. Kurusu, and that was exactly how he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what nobody else knew about the raven-haired young man was <i>how </i>he suddenly jumped up in weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLurking beneath Kimihito's charming personality was the cunning mind of a predator, and a particularly gluttonous one at that. While he could keep his appetite under control for the most part, there would come a time every couple of months or so that the charming predator slipped out into the night, prowling the streets of his city for a very specific kind of prey - human women. Years' worth of experience allowed him to charm and seduce with barely any effort at all, easily leading even the coldest of hearts to share a bed with him... and once he had his prey alone, he struck like a serpent, rapidly gulping down his victims whole to digest away into fat on his thighs. Rich or poor, big or small, the background of Kurusu's prey mattered little to him - there was simply nothing on the planet that could hope to compare to the fine flavor of the fairer sex, of savoring their struggles within his gut as they desperately pleaded to be released or even put up a futile struggle to escape their digestive tomb even as the life left their curvy forms and their bodies became nothing more than <i>more</i> of <i>him.</i> His hunger left no trace behind of his hapless prey, their belongings discreetly disposed of and the fat that they left behind quickly being worked off - much as he would have loved to indulge in becoming truly huge and gluttonous, he had an image to maintain and he was an absolute master at keeping up that image. And so he was content to exist, quietly indulging his dark desires in secret without anybody being the wiser...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And then a tall leggy lady clad in a business suit and dark glasses showed up at his door with several pieces of paperwork; a voluptuous red-haired young woman clutched a suitcase in her hands and stood shyly behind her, with snake-like pupils and smooth red scales along her cheeks, over her pointed ears, and covering the 20-foot-long serpent's tail that she had in the place of her legs. From the sounds of it, the woman, who went by the name of Ms. Smith, was looking for volunteers to take part in an exchange program for the recently-made public liminal species, and he had been found to be an ideal candidate for the position. Kimihito had taken quite an interest in the reveal of these extraspecies races when their existence was first revealed to the world, curious about the taste of their women... but having a lovely Lamia woman literally brought to his doorstep, and the opportunity to have even <i>more</i> homestays brought in to form a literal larder of gorgeous exotic treats, all paid for by the government?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man hardly could have signed the necessary paperwork faster; and just like that, he became the official homestay of Miia the Lamia, with his home being rapidly modified to better accommodate his guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Kurusu may have been a gluttonous cannibal who got his rocks off to feeling women expire in his burning furnace of a belly, but he certainly wasn't rude - the next few weeks were spent simply getting to know his guest and making sure that she felt at home. If the serpent woman vanished just a few days after she had arrived at his home, trouble would be soon to follow and the facade that Kimihito had spent years building up would be gone in an instant... not to mention avoiding making any potentially dangerous mistakes as he learned about Lamia anatomy and culture, all the better to use in future hunts. Besides, the red-haired serpent was admittedly quite the lovely girl, soon opening up to her human host and relaxing completely around him even as she readily put on quite a bit of weight from indulging as frequently in his cooking as she possibly could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became apparent in what felt like no time at all that she was developing feelings for him, thanks in no small part to Kimihito's charm both learned and natural... although even he was surprised when she jumped from just blushing and looking away whenever she met his eyes to using him as a heat source in the cool mornings. Of course, all that meant was that Miia wouldn't realize that he intended to eat her until it was far too late... but there was also the option of Ms. Smith herself. The woman was a slacker to the extreme, likely a result of the sheer scale of her job pushing her to her limits, and she gleefully mooched off of others as much as she could. However, what little work she actually did, she did very well, far too well for her slacking nature to be genuine. There was more to Smith than met the eye, almost like Kimihito himself, and he hadn't been this successful at what he did by not being very careful about his methods. Buttering her up with offerings of coffee and his cooking (And discreetly hacking into her emails) yielded quite the treasure trove of information on the exchange program itself - he filed away Smith's many ignored suggestions for improving potential problems with the organization's current state as well as the legal framework, but her idea for an all-liminal defense team particularly held his attention. Regardless, though, the young man slipped into playing the long game, occasionally flirting with Smith and with Miia and further spoiling them both with food as he decided on a course of action...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while, his hunger for feminine flesh was slowly growing once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, things would come to a head...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For all of his planning, however, the final decision for which of these two lovely ladies should become Kimihito's dinner wouldn't be decided by Kurusu himself: instead, it was Miia's amorous nature that inadvertently bought her a one-way ticket to staying with her beloved as fat on his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the poor girl had no idea what she was dealing with - on a particularly chilly morning, Kimihito would wake up to find over a dozen feet of strawberry-red coils wrapped around his lean frame with the lovely Lamia herself snuggled up close, her arms around his shoulders and her face nestled in the crook of his neck. Her amber eyes were already open; she had been just watching him peacefully sleep, a pink blush dusting her cheeks. When she saw his own brown eyes blink awake, her smile widened, and she nuzzled in a bit closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Darling...\" She cooed softly. \"I'm sorry for waking you, but I just need five more minutes to get nice and warm... unless, of course, you'd like me to stay for longer.~\"<br>\r\nShe leaned up a little bit to whisper in his ear, her voice dropping into a husky purr; the soft rumble of the young man's stomach went unnoticed as Miia continued, unaware of how she was slithering into the lion's den.<br>\r\n<i>\"I've seen the way you look at me, you know~\"</i> She murmured. \"And... and I feel the same to you, Darling. You've been so kind to me since I arrived her, so gentle and understanding. If you wanted me, all you have to do is ask, and I'm all <i>yours~\"</i><br>\r\nThe mask of the seductress faltered for a moment as Miia swallowed softly, hoping to herself that Kimihito wouldn't notice her nervousness (he did). <br>\r\n\"I-I understand if you don't feel the same way; I know that I'm not exactly like what most men would want in a woman...\" She muttered apologetically, self-consciously eyeing her tail and the chubby muffintop that had rapidly accumulated on her middle after just a few weeks of indulging in Kimihito's delicious cooking. \"I-I'm sorry if this is all so sudden... o-oh god, this was a mis-<i>mmph!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Miia's second thoughts would be swiftly cut short as her beloved slipped his arms free and pulled the Lamia just a little bit closer into an embrace of his own, his lips meeting hers in a soft, gentle kiss. Her reptilian eyes went wide and her meters of coils went limp with surprise for a few brief moments, and then she absolutely melted to the human's advances as her brain finally processed what was happening. One of her Darling's strong hands found the sensitive tip of her tail and began to tease it with the tip of his thumb, making her mewl and squirm as pleasure rippled through her long body. Th-this was real... this was really happening! The amorous Lamia was putty in Kimihito's hands, her eyes closed in bliss as she surrendered herself completely to the man who had stolen her heart; finally, after what felt like hours, he broke away from her first real kiss, still teasing and stroking her tailtip and leaving her in half-delirious pleasure. The poor girl never saw it coming; with her eyes closed, all she felt was Kimihito's other hand sliding down from between her shoulder blades down to her hips and her plump rump, a low guttural gurgle from the hungry human's middle... and then warm, moist tightness as he lunged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late in the morning when Smith finally arrived at the Kurusu household; she had slept in to treat herself as a reward for staying up late to get through another mountain of paperwork, but thankfully her coworkers knew her well enough to cover her ass. Now, though, she was on the job - it was time for the scheduled checkup on Kimihito and Miia. Not that they would know that it was scheduled, of course.<br>\r\nPicking the lock to the Kurusu house was trivially easy for the curvy Coordinator - just a few seconds of fiddling, and she was in, padding down the halls in search of the man of the house... for professional reasons, of course, not just because there was something about him that sent a shiver down her spine and lit a fire in her core!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking herself out of her lewd thoughts, Kuroko returned to focus on the task at hand; as she walked through the house, however, she would quickly find something amiss... specifically, the <i>lack</i> of something around. Usually at this time of day Kimihito would be cooking breakfast while Miia warmed up in the custom-made shower, but she didn't hear the sound of running water or smell eggs sizzling on the frying pan. The house was just... silent, even for a building this size with just two people living in it - something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazy as she was by her own admission, Smith was still a professional; drawing the tranq pistol she kept in her suit's inner pocket, she began to silently and methodically scan the rooms one by one. The shower had definitely been used recently - there was water still on the floor and the towels were damp, but besides that there was no sign of either Miia or Kimihito. It would only be when the lovely agent was halfway through searching the Lamia's bedroom, clearly used last night but empty now, that she finally found something... or rather, <i>heard </i>something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>GLRRRRRRRN....*Glrk!*</b><br>\r\nIt was like the gurgling and churning of a witch's cauldron, coming from the next room over and rumbling into Smith's very bones; no sooner had the rumbling slowed to a stop than it was immediately followed up by a <i><b>\"BWUURP!\"</b></i>, barely muffled by the wall between herself and the source of the noise. With no other lead to go on, Smith quickly made her way to the other room - Kimihito's room, she noted in the back of her head - and kicked the door open with a loud bang, pistol drawn and an order to get down on the ground on her lips... only for it to die in her throat as she stared wide-eyed at the scene before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying out on his back atop his bed like an ancient emperor reclined on his seat was Kimihito Kurusu... or rather, Kimihito Kurusu and an absolutely massive distended belly that spilled over his entire lap and surged past his knees, rising up above his head like a great creamy-pale dome and gurgling contentedly as it continued to work away at its massive meal. <br>\r\nMiia had been an interesting challenge to swallow down with her long, muscular coils, but the element of surprise and his continued teasing of her tailtip until she climaxed had worked well in the hungry human's favor. In almost no time at all, every inch of the seductive serpent was sealed away in his stomach, her sweet-and-savory flavor still tingling on the boy's tongue as his stomach bloated larger than it ever had before with his extraspecies feast. Of course, it hadn't taken long for the Lamia girl to start to thrash and struggle as she realized where she was, but tougher women than she had tried and failed to escape Kimihito's belly - all that her squirming did was get the young man aroused beyond belief. He shamelessly humped and ground his throbbing cock against the bulges and outlines of Miia's curled-up form, until he had splattered much of the underside of his gut with seed, then calmly cleaned up and waddled into the shower - the hot water only further stimulated his churning gut, acids rising higher around the unlucky Lamia as her thrashing became more and more frantic. By the time he had stepped out and toweled off, her vigorous thrashing had simmered down to weak squirms, and in less than an hour the struggles stopped completely as Miia finally expired. It had been nearly two hours since then, and most of the Lamia's lovely form had been successfully crushed and churned into a thick slurry, but there were still a few big chunks of meat and bone remaining, although they weren't long for this world. Already, the hungry young man could feel his limbs getting thicker and his ass swelling as the first of thousands of calories of girlmeat were processed into even <i>more</i> of <i>him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmh... morning, Kuroko.\" Kimihito lazily greeted his surprise guest, giving her a smile and a little wave with his free hand as the other attended to his great gut. \"Sorry about my current state - as you can see, I treated myself to a nice big meal.~\"<br>\r\n<b>*Glurnk!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you... you killed Miia...\" Smith murmured in shock; her pistol clattered to the ground as she just stared in disbelief at the immense rotund gut before her that rose and fell slightly with every breath Kimihito took. \"You just... <i>ate</i> her like it was nothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly nothing.\" The young man casually shrugged, giving his gurgling gut a light smack. \"She's definitely the biggest meal I've ever had, but I think she's already adding well to me, don't you think?\"<br>\r\nHe merely grinned at the surprised look on Smith's face, slowly swinging his legs over to the floor and lumbering over with heavy footfalls - before she knew it, the coordinator was pinned against the wall by that great gut, like the world's biggest water balloon. She tried to shout and protest, but her throat was dry as dust, her face a crimson red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.~\" The girl-eater chuckled. \"I knew that you would enjoy this, but your flushed little face is still nice to see.\"<br>\r\nHe had done much more than just take a peek at Smith's emails - hacking into her computer had been trivially easy for him, and in doing so he had found quite a pleasant surprise. <br>\r\nSmith, it seemed, was quite the chubby-chaser, her search history full of images of plus-sized men, guys with huge round guts, and most of all artwork and stories of men devouring and digesting women, reducing girls from all walks of life into jiggling fat on their expanding asses. To have a gluttonous stud out of her wildest dreams standing right in front of her, pinning her with a belly full of the melting remnants of a real person... it was turning Smith on beyond belief, and they both knew it. Terror and pleasure wrestled for control in her mind, until finally...</span></div></div>",

Now, though, Tootski was an all-girl school, with him as the only male resident.  Sex was listed as perfectly fine, with both students and faculty, and Shokugekis now had fatal consequences, the losers having to become the meal of the winner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe red-headed chef shook his head, not sure what to think of it.

He was almost completely invisible as he scoped out his prey, feeling like he was in his natural element as a wild hunter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many things about hunting that frustrated him. After all, if everything the light touches belongs to them, why don\u2019t the gazelle and the wildebeest and all those just offer themselves up to be eaten? But no, his father always says, that would disrupt the natural way of things. That would be tyranny! If they were going to devour that prey, they were going to have to capture that prey fair and square, the way their ancestors did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis second frustration about hunting; he never got to do it! The lionesses seem to go out and catch the prey for the pride, and by the time he actually sees the meat they bring back, it\u2019s already been cut up and cooked. His father tells him that male lions shouldn\u2019t worry about hunting, they should worry about running the kingdom, improving their relationship with the other animals, and defending the pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he\u2019s tired of that! He\u2019s bored of lounging around the pride rock all day, and he wants to try something new and exciting. He\u2019s big and strong enough now that he feels confident he could take down the average herbivore. Indeed, today, he\u2019s decided he\u2019s going to find out what raw meat tastes like for the first time, and prove to himself that he\u2019s capable of hunting just as well as the lionesses can. After all, if he can\u2019t hunt a measly antelope, what good will he be as king?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, just down the hill from him, there\u2019s a petite impala woman sitting beneath one of those big, weird trees, enjoying some baobab fruit. She looked like she\u2019d be easy to catch. On the other hand, there was a tall, curvaceous zebra woman wandering a nearby field, who looked like she had some more meat on her bones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to scan the field, he noticed something odd\u2026 a hyena woman? What is she doing out here? He\u2019s immediately outraged that the hyena would have to gal to set foot on the pride lands! He ought to teach her a lesson! On the other hand, she would probably be the most difficult to catch, and her sharp fangs sort of scared him...</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s finally going to see what it\u2019s like to hunt for prey, just like lions are meant to do! He felt like the most clever predator in the world as he snuck up on the completely oblivious impala, completely evading her sight. This is going to be perfect! She\u2019s going to be delicious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, though, his heart sunk. That hyena woman who seems to be trespassing on the lands also seems to have her eyes locked on the oblivious impala! They were both creeping towards the impala from opposite sides, while the young woman enjoyed her fruit, completely oblivious to the two predators approaching him. Simba was starting to panic. If the hyena got to her first, it would completely ruin everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grit his teeth, trying to move faster while still not getting seen\u2026 but the hyena was a more experienced predator. Just as the Simba was about to make it, the hyena leaped out of the bushes, trying to pounce on the impala woman! Only by some miracle did the impala barely dodge the hyena\u2019s pounce. She let out a frantic squeal as she sprinted away from the hyena\u2026 and ended up running straight towards Simba!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to get trampled, he stood up, raising his hands out in front of him\u2026 but it was too late. The impala was sprinting at full speed in a blind fit of fear, and she wasn\u2019t going to let anything stop her, not even a lion! She tried to push him aside\u2026 but instead, she accidentally ran right into him at full speed, the lion getting flown backwards like a ragdoll by the sheer force that slammed into him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head slammed against the ground when he landed, further disorienting him. His vision was blurry, and his entire body felt\u2026 weird. Like, on the inside. Like there was something\u2026 filling him. He tried to let out a groan, but he realized his mouth was completely blocked by something. As his eyes adjusted and his confusion faded away, he quickly realized what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pair of kicking legs dangling from his mouth! Apparently, the impala had accidentally launched herself headlong down his throat, and now only her butt and legs were sticking out from his maw. He could feel her torso stretching his esophagus to the limit, and he head and shoulders entering into the warm, acidic chamber of his stomach. He was immediately stunned, wondering just what on Earth was happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could this be possible? He\u2019d never heard of a lion\u2019s mouth or stomach stretching out like this before! Heck, lions like to CHEW their food, thank you very much! Maybe a hippo had a mouth big enough to swallow somebody, but he didn\u2019t! For crying out loud, the impala woman was TALLER than he was! He let out a whimper as her hips stretched out his jaws to their absolute limit, making his mouth incredibly sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the impala woman\u2019s legs, trying to pull them out\u2026 but no good. His powerful esophagus seemed to have a mind of its own, the muscles undulating rhythmically around as it very slowly pulled her deeper and deeper into his throat. Whenever he tries to pull her out, they just stubbornly clamp down, forbidding it. He could go get help\u2026 but he didn\u2019t want to walk around with her legs hanging out of his mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, it was obvious that the only option he had was to finish swallowing her. After all, this was sort of her fault anyway\u2026 she DID run into him, which is what sent her partway down his throat in the first place. Besides, her body was blocking his throat at his point, which was making it difficult to breathe. With a sigh, he reluctantly took the biggest gulp he could, pulling the impala\u2019s thighs and butt into his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis throat muscles were pulling her deeper all on their own, but each gulp he took sped up the process dramatically. Feeling his body stretch out so much like this\u2026 well, it was weirdest thing he\u2019s ever felt, but it wasn\u2019t entirely unpleasant. It was like stuffing yourself full of the biggest meal in the world, all at once. And, indeed, he couldn\u2019t help but notice; she was absolutely delicious! After all, you can\u2019t get meat that\u2019s more fresh than this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each gulp, her legs were pulled a few more inches into his throat. When he reached her knees, she couldn\u2019t even kick anymore\u2026 and soon, all she could do was wriggle her toes as her feet dangling from his lips. Soon, he just slurped her feet up into his maw, sending her entire body down into the tight confines of his throat. He gasped for fresh air now that his throat wasn\u2019t being blocked anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOooohhhh\u2026\u201d</b> He let out a loud groan, as the impala woman was forcibly pressed into his belly. Her body was curled up incredibly tight inside his stomach, and he can clearly see the outline of her body bulging out the front of his fluffy belly. His belly was now almost bigger than the rest of his entire body! He\u2019s never felt so full before in his life! He let out a content sigh as he rubbed his hands over the sensitive, distended skin, the sense of fullness almost overpowering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the impala is more confused than even the lion himself! She was running from some hyena, when all of a sudden, she found herself someplace so incredibly dark, warm, and tight. She tried her best to struggle, but it quickly become obvious that she wasn\u2019t going to be able to move a single muscle in here. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cW-what the\u2026?\u201d</span> Her muffled voice can faintly be heard from his belly. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhere am I? What is this?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned, straining his head up to look at his giant gut. To think that there\u2019s somebody actually alive, all curled up in there\u2026 it was crazy! He never knew any animal was capable of such a thing! Still, when he really thought about it, this was probably the best meal he\u2019s had in years\u2026 and he can at least call himself a \u2018hunter\u2019 now. <b>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d</b> He sheepishly admitted. <b>\u201cYou\u2019re in my\u2026 stomach\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause as she realized he was telling the truth. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cN-no!\u201d</span> At this, the impala started to panic, doing her best to struggle despite just how tightly his belly was squeezing around her body. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cPlease! Let me out! I-I don\u2019t want to be\u2026 digested!\u201d</span> Simba let out another groan. Every single little movement the impala managed to make was like getting a belly rub from the inside. At this point, he was getting used to it, and it actually felt pretty great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhoa. I didn\u2019t know you lions could do that!\u201d</span> Suddenly, he tensed up when he\u2019s startled by a voice nearby! He looks up to see that hyena looking at him, her eyes wide, her jaw practically dropping the floor! <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cThat was, like, the coolest thing I\u2019ve seen all year!\u201d</span> Apparently, she had been watching the entire spectacle in awe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHey, you!\u201d</b> He tried to reach up and grab the intruder\u2026 but he quickly ran into a problem. He couldn\u2019t even sit up! The weight in his belly was far too immense for him to anything other than lie here. All he could do was lie there and yell at her. <b>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed on the pride lands! Get out of here!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled, walking up, and he let out a grunt as she planted a paw on his huge, round, fluffy gut. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhat are you gonna do about it?\u201d</span> She laughs, looking down at his face with a toothy grin. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cLooks to me like you\u2019re sorta stuck here!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYou KNOW what I can do about it!\u201d</b> He growled, pointing to his gut. <b>\u201cWhen I see you again, I can just\u2026 swallow you whole!\u201d</b> She did look a little frightened as she considered this. The thought of being digested wasn\u2019t particularly pleasant\u2026 still, she was smart. She could figure out some sort of\u2026 compromise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWell... what if I start bringing you more snacks like this?\u201d</span> The hyena offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba paused, confused. <b>\u201cWhat do ya mean?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWell, doesn\u2019t she feel good in there? And wasn\u2019t she tasty?\u201d</span> The hyena asked. To butter him up, she got on her knees in front of him, and started gently massaging her belly. Simba had to admit, it did feel pretty great... <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI know you male lions are too lazy to hunt\u2026 and you can\u2019t leave the pride lands, either\u2026 so\u2026 what if, from now on, you just name a species - any species - and I\u2019ll lure a tasty snack right to your door, help you swallow \u2018em, and even give you a big belly massage afterwards\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounds\u2026 amazing! But he knew he shouldn\u2019t trust a hyena. <b>\u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d</b> He asked. As they talked, the impala could still faintly be heard begging for mercy, but her cries fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWell, I like it on the Pride Lands. I just need you to promise not to eat me\u2026 and to help hide the fact that I\u2019m here..\u201d</span> She got a big, smug grin on her face. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cSounds reasonable, right? Interested?\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

Oh, he made the healthy food, but he hated every moment of it.  He wanted to plump people up and eat them.  He was just savvy enough to know that he was about to lose, and cover his bases so he wouldn't be punished.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe worst part?  There was so much delicious unhealthy food to eat, especially after that Tiana woman showed up and gave added own exquisite cooking to the mix.  It was so frustrating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe found out that nearly all the Disney females, hero and villain, would be going on a mountain retreat, something that would be a perfect opportunity for him to get some food in... the problem was, Lilo and Nani were going as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey'd never let him get away with it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFrench Fry sighed, leaning up against the nearest object, a black oil lamp.  He looked up at the night sky, and wished that no one knew what he was capable of, so he could fatten and eat them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Wish granted,\" Jafar said, smirking down at French Fry.  \"Even Jumba has forgotten your particular abilities, old boy.  Go on that retreat, and have fun.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFrench Fry blinked, and looked at the lamp.  A slow smile formed on French Fry's face as he remembered that Jafar was a genie.  He touched the lamp, and wished that he had been brought on the trip with the other Disney villains.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a puff of smoke, French Fry found himself sitting in Nani's lap, on one of the buses that the Disney women were riding to the mountain retreat.  French Fry grinned wickedly, and began to plan.  He felt the lamp underneath his hat, but he didn't need it now.  Soon, he would begin fattening up all these beauties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSoon, he would eat.  </span></div></div>",

So he cooked, and happily served his ultra-fattening treats.  He vaguely noted that Madam Mim, Madame Medusa, Cruella De Vil, and Yzma weren't among the female villains there, but that was fine.  He didn't like his meat aged THAT much... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo he cooked and he served.  Burgers, fries, spaghetti, pizza, hot dogs, any ultra-fattening food he could think of he fed to the beautiful Disney ladies.  And to his delight (and hunger), they began to fatten quickly.  Breasts began to swell, bulging out shirts and blouses.  Bellies grew larger, pushing out over belts.  Asses began bulging out of dresses and pants, growing wider and wider.  Legs and arms grew thicker as the number of chins in the area began to multiply.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTo French Fry's eyes, it was glorious.  It was mouth-watering.  He made one final wish, that everyone would keep eating and that no one would figure out his plan until it was far too late.  He felt the familiar tingle of Jafar's magic, and grinned, looking over the field of steadily fattening beauties.  Three caught his attention the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tElisa Maza, not caring about the stereotype, eagerly gorged herself on donuts.  Her jeans were tightly stretched around her steadily fattening legs, her belt, button, and zipper undone to allow the soft mound of her belly to swell out uimpeded.  Her ass was steadily pushing her pants down as it swelled, the jiggly cheeks getting softer with each bite she took.  Her shirt was pushed up to reveal her bulging get, and her breasts had swollen out until they were larger than her double-chinned head.  Frosting and glaze covered her mouth as she uncaringly devoured the delicious treats, deciding to hell with her diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPrincess Jasmine eagerly devoured sausage and honeyed biscuits, relaxing on one of the provided couches.  (This mountain resort was designed for maximum comfort, after all.)  Her normally slender, muscular legs fill out her puffy pants, her now ample ass starting to pull them down, revealing great amounts of ass cleavage.  Her belly had swollen out to a rounded bulge, her breasts filling out her skimpy top to the point of near bursting.  Her thick arms strained against the tight-fitting sleeve bands attatched to her top, her plump, cherubic content as she stuffed herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Rescue Ranger girls, Gadget, Foxglove, and a bunch of other one-shot girls, were all massive due to how small they were.  Each one of them a blobular beauty, those that wore clothes now naked because of how huge they were.  Limbs were immobile, Gadget having hastily invented a feeding machine before they became immobile, bellies huge globs of fat (for their bodies, at least), breasts so thick that they drooped to the floor, asses so massive they rose up above the heads of their owners...  Perfect bite-size treats to French Fry's carnivorous, fat-loving eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe couldn't wait anymore.  He needed to eat.  But who?</span></div></div>",

She let out a whimper of fear, but was unable to resist as she was swallowed down into French Fry's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFrench Fry positively groaned in pleasure.  It felt so wonderful to have fat and meat inside of his stomach again.  He smacked his lips, savoring the leftover taste, and patted his slightly bulging gut.  Already, it was gurgling away, digesting Bink into fat for his body.  He turned his attention to Tammy, picking up the older sister with one hand.  She was even larger than her sister, French Fry slurping at her bulging gut as she lowered her into his mouth.  He loved the way her soft, furry flesh filled his mouth completely, the greedy squirrel so fat she was unable to struggle.  He held her in his jaws for a moment, slurping over and savoring the nutty taste of her body, and sent her down to join her sister with a single, mighty swallow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFrench Fry let out a belch, rubbing his swollen stomach happily.  It felt so good to eat a proper, fatty meal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe picked up Lahwhinie next, the evil mousegirl protesting between belches as she was drawn away from her milkshake.  French Fry sniffed lovingly at her massive belly, savoring her heavy fruity scent.  He designed each meal for his victims so their fat and meat would be inundated in flavor.  In this instance, Lahwhinie smelled and tasted like pineapple.  As he gulped her down, she whined continually, caring only about her pineapple milkshake.  And as she was pressed in against Tammy and Bink, she complained about the lack of space.  Some people didn't have their priorities straight.  Didn't matter to French Fry, though, as he was just here for the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe went for the mousey seductress, Desiree.  Somehow, despite being an immobile blob of fat, she had managed to pose sensually, idly caressing one of her fat breasts even as she sat back from her latest feast, red wine milkshake.  French Fry had been rather proud of that concoction.  The little alien picked up the blobular mouse, his fingers squishing into her furry flesh.  The French seductress giggled, cooing at him from her half-buried face.  French Fry took his time with her, running his tongue over her body again and again... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe blinked when he felt an extra burst of flavor, a squeal of pleasure coming from Desiree.  He chuckled, realizing that she had cum from French Fry's tonguework. A powerful gulp, and the blobular mouse joined the other three already in his heavily bulging gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFoxglove was next, the bat's wings thick and immobile.  Her feeding tube, feeding her ground fruit slurry, had come loose.  She was sucking at it, trying to get it back into her mouth.  French Fry instead put her in his mouth, letting her droop down into his gullet.  Foxglove, her face mostly buried in her fat, let out a moan of fright as she was lowered into French Fry's drooling, hungry maw.  She tried to flap her flabby wings, but she was too thick to move.  All she could do was whine as she became another bulge in French Fry's growing, gurgling gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFrench Fry let out a belch, smacking his lips delightfully.  \"Excuse-moi,\" he said shamelessly, looking over at Gadget, who had continued eating even while her comrades were being devoured.  Her face was literally buried in her fat, the only sign that it was there being the tube feeding her a constant flow of cheese.  She was so huge by now, French Fry had to pick her up with both hands.  He lovingly cradled her soft, globular form, caressing it, stroking it, Gadget letting out a dull groan of confusion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd then he stuffed Gadget into his mouth, ass-first.  Her butt had become so big that his jaw's elasticity had to trigger.  Gadget didn't even whimper, she was just too far gone in her food coma, as she slip completely into French Fry's jaws.  Her navel was the last to disappear, the alien chef tongueing it teasingly before taking the final swallow.  His gut surged out as Gadget, far larger than the others, was forced down into it.  Already his stomach was churning and gurgling away at the rodent women, turning them into fat and energy for French Fry.  He smacked his lips, looking for his next meal...</span></div></div>",

I owe you for rescuing my son's husband from the KKK,\" the grizzled old man piloting the chopper said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No big,\" Kim said.  \"It was the right thing to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I wish more people were like you two,\" the general chuckled.  \"Just call me when you're ready to come back!  You sure you don't need equipment?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRon smiled, holding up a pair of backpacks as he got out of the helicopter.  \"Got everything right hereaWHUP!\" he said, slipping on a cable and falling out onto his face.  Kim giggled, helping her lover up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Seriously, General, we came prepared,\" Kim said.  \"Thanks muchly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe general sighed wistfully.  \"Ah, if only my own daughter could be as respectful as you,\" he said, saluting her.  \"Call me on that nifty comm of yours when you need me.  You have our frequency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe general took off, leaving the two adventurers behind.  Ron's pet molerat, Rufus, appeared out of a pocket.  \"Stinky,\" he commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRon nodded, snorting at the air.  \"With you on that, buddy.  Like the men's restroom at Bueno Nacho after Taquito Supremo night...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKim rolled her eyes. \"I don't like the smell either, but we need to be here.  Adrena Lynn's supposedly looking for a dangerous ancient artifact here, one that could make her nearly unstoppable.  We obviously don't want her to get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRon nodded.  \"Yeah, yeah.  Weird how she resurfaced after so long.  I thought after the first time you beat her she got the hint,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKim shrugged.  \"Guess she finally found a new thrill,\" she said.  \"C'mon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRon grabbed her by the shoulder.  \"Wait.  Should we take that thing that Wade insisted we bring with us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKim blinked.  \"What, the acid protection thing?\"  Wade Load, their tech expert, had insisted that they take it.  On their last mission, Drakken and Shego had come FRIGHTENINGLY close to killing them, dunking them in a pool of acid.  Drakken had started to listen to Shego's advice, and was abandoning old villain cliches.  The two baddies had removed all their equipment and put Rufus in a cage, ready to watch them melt.  If Shego's heroic brothers hadn't been following Kim and Ron, they would have been killed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRufus shivered at the memory and went into the backpacks, pulling out the two vials.  Kim took hers and looked at it.  \"I admit it's a good idea, but how likely are we gonna face acid on this adventure?\" Kim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRon frowned.  \"Kim... You know I love you, and how courageous you are, but we came so close last time... I don't wanna chance it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKim sighed.  \"Yeah... Yeah, we did...\" she said softly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBoth Ron and Kim opened the syringes and injected themselves in the neck.  They felt a brief tingle as the nanotechs inside the formula went to work, making their bodies completely resistant to any and all form of acid, inside and out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Besides,\" Ron quipped.  \"We're in the jungle.  You never know when something might eat us.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKim giggled.  \"C'mon, let's go.\"  The two set off again, Rufus complaining under his breath that there was no formula for him...</span></div></div>",

We can just go around it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I don't think that's possible, Kim...\" Ron said, suddenly sounding tense.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why's that, Ron?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...\" Ron said, giggling nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKim sighed.  \"How many?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Too many,\" Ron said.  \"Pretty sure the biggest of them could bench press Warmonga...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKim turned slowly, frowning.  The two of them had been surrounded by beautiful, powerfully muscled women with ample breasts and dark skin, their bodies nude save for green paint to help them blend in with the jungle.  The tallest one, indeed as large as Warmonga as Ron had said, was wielding swords and glaring at Ron, Rufus, and Kim.  Kim grinned nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n///////////<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n///////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I am sorry for earlier,\" the shaman of the tribe, a fat, older woman who was still very beautiful said.  \"We thought you were with that wretched Adrena Lynn person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So not the drama,\" Kim said, smiling, she and Ron eagerly eating the pulled pork dishes they had been given.  \"Not a lot of white people come out this way, I suspect.  It's natural to think they may be together.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I wish you luck on defeating her,\" the shaman said.  \"She disrupts the natural order of the place simply by being here.  Our nameless god does not approve.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Nameless god?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe shaman nodded.  \"We are a people without names.  Our tribe has existed for centuries, although sadly we are dying out.  You saw that we have no men in our village?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKim nodded, glancing over to Ron, who was still eating.  Rufus sat on Ron's lap, eating cheese provided by the villagers.  Several of the village women, young and old, were looking at Ron with intense interest, although to Kim's relief he was oblivious.  She took a bite of her pork, and said, \"I have.  What happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"White man came, tried to civilize us.  We learned their language, and sent them on their way.  But lately, the men had been thinking about joining the world at large, taking names.  Our nameless god disapproved, and struck all the men down with disease...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKim didn't really believe in gods, but she could understand losing people to plague.  \"I'm sorry...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRon looked tense.  \"I'm sorry to seem insensitive, but am I in any danger from said disease?\" he asked, Rufus looking at the shaman nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe shaman chuckled.  \"You, especially you, have nothing to fear, child,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKim frowned at the way that was phrased.  Ron was mollified by it, though.  \"Still...\" Kim said, finishing her meal.  \"Thank you for hosting us.  This was really good.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRon finished off his meal, the three bowls of meat he had eaten set aside.  Kim had eaten two bowls, which surprised herself.  \"Great stuff,\" Ron said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe shaman smiled.  \"The one who gave of herself for that would be glad to hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRon, Rufus, and Kim froze.  \"Um... say again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The warrior, the large one, who brought you in,\" the shaman said.  \"She was your meal.  The cheese your small friend ate?  Was made from breast milk of our women.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRon whimpered, clutching his stomach.  Rufus looked ill.  Kim gulped hard.  \"You told me... that it was pork...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe shaman grinned wickedly.  \"I did not lie.  It was pork.  Fresh longpork.  And you both ate so heartily...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh my god...\" Kim groaned, feeling nauseous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRon laughed madly.  \"OKAY THEN.  Time to go.  Thanks for the hospitality!  May we never meet again!\" Scooping up Rufus into a pocket, he and Kim prepared to flee the village.  Before they could, the shaman grabbed them both by the arm, forcing them to look her in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Here me, children!  Our nameless god has CHOSEN YOU!  Ron Stoppable, you will be his avatar!  Our death will come at your hands!  Kim Possible, you will be his high priestess!  You shall choose four more to serve Ron as he consumes for our god!\" the shaman crowed.  \"The end of all things begins when you call us to your side!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRufus leaped out and bit the shaman's hand, making her let go of Kim and Ron.  The three took the time to flee the village, the shaman's laughter following them as they ran back into the jungle.  They didn't stop until they couldn't see the village at all anymore, both of them stopping to retch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Can't believe... we ate human meat...\" Kim groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Does this make us cannibals?\" Ron asked, grimacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKim shook her head.  \"No.  No, we didn't know what we were eating, and we have no plans to eat any more, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Right,\" Ron said, nodding.  Rufus nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKim nodded.  \"So let's find Adrena Lynn, take out our frustrations on her, and then get the hell out of this jungle...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm all for that,\" Ron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Amen...\" Rufus added.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe three of them trudged on.  \"...You're thinking about how good the meat was, aren't you?\" Ron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKim whimpered.  \"Please drop it,\" she said.</span></div></div>",

Shego?\" Kim Possible asked as she battled her nemesis.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hm?\" Shego said, firing a green laser blast at Kim, forcing to dodge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...What the hell are you wearing?\" Kim asked, launching a kick at Shego's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I don't understand the question,\" Shego said, attempting to grapple with Kim and getting shoved away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Don't give me that!\" Kim shouted.  \"All right, time out, time out!\" she said, making the time out gesture.  Shego hesitated, and stopped.  Kim frowned, folding her arms.  \"Why are you wearing something that looks like it's straight out of the 90s?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShego flinched.  Instead of her normal full-body costume, Shego was wearing something that could charitably be described as 'revealing.'  If you wanted to use a more appropriate word, it could be described as slutty.  The costume was still green and black, but it was now more of a swimsuit than anything.  It revealed her back, rode up her butt, and just barely covered her breasts, nipple clearly visible on the sides.  She wore gloves that went up to her elbows, boots that went up to her knees... the only practical thing about the costume is that the boots didn't have high heels.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd come to think of it, Shego's breasts and ass looked bigger as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Shego...\" Kim said.  \"Is something going on with Drakken?  Why has he been kidnapping women?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShego fidgeted, adjusting her costume slightly.  \"I... I can't... If I tell, I'm at risk... If I do what he wants, then I'm okay...\" She smiled forcefully.  \"I do what he wants.  I make myself his slutty minion, and I'm okay.  He just... teases...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKim and Ron traded worried looks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I can't... I can't tell you anything.  Just know, Kim, that you and your mother are safe for now.  He doesn't WANT you yet,\" Shego said, her fists glowing.  She clapped her hands, creating a blinding explosion that also sent Kim and Ron flying away, stunning them long enough for her to escape, leaving no trace of where they went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce their vision cleared, Kim frowned.  \"Something's up... Drakken's never gone for kidnapping before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And Shego's NEVER been afraid of disobeying Drakken...\" Ron agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was a great, fat thing, with a heavy gut that hung over the belt of his loincloth.  Greenish-skinned, with weblike ears and a ridged forehead.  He somewhat resembled his father, Hudson, but neither knew they were directly related, nor would either have cared, having grown up in the clan where every male is father to every child, and every female is mother to every child.  Because all eggs looked the same, clans agreed that all should have a hand in raising the younglings so no one would feel left out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was different for his lover, Angela, who grew up among humans and held human values.  Because she was technically the only youngling, Goliath, the clan's leader and her father, decided to suspend tradition for her.  (Although Angela had eventually come to accept that particular tradition's logic, she still valued being recognized as Goliath's daughter.)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBroadway and his two companions, Brooklyn and Lexington, had all courted Angela, with Broadway eventually winning her affection.  The two were intimate lovers, and after the last mating time, Angela was now carrying his egg.  (Bizarrely, Elisa, the clan's human friend and Goliath's lover, was pregnant as well.  No one was sure how that was possible, although since Elisa had been fired for her friendship with the clan and gone to work for Xanatos, no one was unhappy about it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t(Well, except for Angela's psychotic mother Demona, and the racist Quarrymen, but fuck them.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEventually, through a convoluted time-travel plot, Brooklyn gained a family of his own.  Lexington was also starting to come into himself, realizing he was gay.  Broadway was content, although sometimes, when he gave Angela oral sex, he would wonder what it would be like to eat her.  Eat other people, too.  Just an idle fantasy, one he dismissed.  He shared it with Angela after some prodding, and she would work it into their lovemaking sessions, letting him bite and gnaw at her, which pleasured both of them.  She would tease him, referring to herself as meat to be eaten, arousing him greatly.  Broadway truly adored this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOne day, Broadway was on solo patrol.  He saw Demona leaving a warehouse, and flew down into it to check it out.  Demona hiding things made him nervous.  Technological security was lackluster there, although there were some obvious spell traps that Broadway had learned how to detect and avoid.  He went inside through the front door, avoiding the trap spells on the ceiling and windows.  Inside, he gaped in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMagical artifacts lined the halls.  Each one was sorted into sections marked 'useful,' 'impractical, use only if desperate,' 'effects unknown,' and 'useless.'  Each artifact had a tag attached to it describing its effects.  Demona liked to have references, apparently, and was smart enough to research first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSeveral caught his eye.  One was the 'Underclock,' a pocketwatch, which would allow him to reset time to a certain point, even if he died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnother was the 'Serpent's Charm,' a ring that which would allow him to swallow anything whole and digest it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe third was the 'Not My Problem Stone,' another ring, which supposedly would make everyone around him ignore what he was doing, no matter what it was.  Effectively, he could get away with anything.  Broadway briefly wondered why this item was in the 'Useless' section, until he noticed the tag also read 'Too Good To Be True.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis place was amazing, Broadway decided.  And he seemed to have free reign of it.  Those three alone would allow him to fulfill his fantasies and just restart  from the beginning once he was satisfied.  He debated on just grabbing the artifacts and calling it a night, but he could look around some more...</span></div></div>",

Now he was a mutate, a powerful, muscular panther man with black fur, golden eyes, and massive bat wings for flight.  He could also generate massive amounts of electricity.  He went by the name of Talon now.  He was changed, but he was still loved.

He didn't remember any of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGroaning, he woke up in an alley, unsure of how he got there.  His head was killing him, and it was hard to think.  Plus, he was nude, only a few flecks of his clothing remaining on his body, which fell off as he stood up.  To make matters worse, he couldn't remember anything except the fact that he was named Talon.  He sniffed the air, sensing people all around him.  Something told him to avoid being seen, that it was important not to be noticed.  He backed into the alley, contemplating what to do next, when he noticed her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJudging by her clothes, and the way she seemed to pose to try and get a man's attention whenever they walked by, Talon guessed she was a hooker.  He didn't know what the word meant, he just knew that it applied to her.  She was curvaceous, large-breasted, with the way they were shaped telling Talon that they were real breasts, no implants.  She was Asian, with long black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTalon felt his stomach gurgle, and he hmmed thoughtfully.  He was rather hungry...  He could also feel a stirring in his loins as he stared at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUnseen, a floating camera watched Talon closely, recording his every movement...</span></div></div>",

The blue-skinned, red-headed gargoyle was blushing brightly, glaring at the naked human woman laying on the bed nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tElisa Maza smirked.  \"You wanted this truce, Demona,\" she said.  \"You have to follow the terms of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Being the sexual pet of the two of you... It's embarassing,\" Demona muttered, removing her armband and tiara.  \"Plus, you two have weird kinks.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tElisa chuckled.  \"What, you didn't notice it back in the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Back in the day, human, food was a struggle for survival,\" Demona growled, her eyes glowing red.  \"We didn't have the time to research bizarre magical sex spells.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You didn't notice Goliath occasionally swallowing rodents he caught whole?\" Elisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"A lot of us did that...\" Demona muttered, trying not to think about the implications.  \"Even me.  It was just a quick way of eating...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tElisa giggled.  \"An entire clan of voraphiles, who didn't even know they were voraphiles,\" she said.  \"Well, for all your protests, you're still going along with it.  Is it just because of the truce?  Or because you secretly want this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDemona growled.  \"WANT to be EATEN!?\" she snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tElisa nodded.  \"Because you want to have Goliath treat you as a piece of meat.  You want that huge, handsome beast of a gargoyle to degrade you, to use you as if you were his toy.  You want to feel the warmth of his insides as they crush you, reduce you to nothing...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDemona blushed brightly, visibly cursing herself for how easily the detective's words were arousing her.  \"Damn you,\" she said, pressing her legs together in a vain attempt to hide how wet she was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a thump from behind the two, as a massive form landed on the balcony of Elisa's apartment.  Both women turned, seeing the handsome, lavender form of Goliath entering the room.  \"Ah, good.  You haven't killed each other yet,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I swore the fighting between us was over, Goliath,\" Demona muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tElisa giggled.  \"It's true.  I have been teasing her for the past three hours about what she's agreed to and the only swipes she's taken at me have been verbal.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGoliath sighed, chuckling.  \"Still, it is good that you've let go of your vendetta.  With the Hunters either reformed or in prison, and the Quarrymen broken up after Angela and Broadway saved the city from that nuclear bomb...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I know, I know...\" Demona said, smiling proudly at the memory.  In a desperate attempt to destroy the gargoyles, Jon Castaway, formerly the Hunter Jon Canmore and founder of the Quarrymen, had set a nuclear bomb in the Eyrie Building.  Angela and Broadway stayed behind to disarm the bomb, the press covering the whole thing as a bomb disposal expert that had been injured by Castaway read off instructions to them via radio.  It was the beginning of the end for the Quarrymen, who broke up soon after.  With gargoyles becoming impossibly popular, Elisa had 'conveniently volunteered' to be the official liason to the clan.  And Demona found the reasons for her hatred suddenly seeming petty in her eyes...  \"Let's just do this before I come to my senses,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d rather not go into your stomach head first,\u201d Demona said, still not believing what she was saying. Crawling onto Elisa\u2019s bed, she lifted her taloned feet to Goliath to devour. She wondered how long it would take him to eat her entire body, she was already uncomfortable doing this and if it took too long she was definitely going to back out. Let Goliath eat his perverted human and leave her out of it. As she thought that, Goliath leaned forward and opened wider then Demona thought was possible. Grabbing her legs, he crammed both feet into his mouth and swallowed, taking her up to the calves in one gulp. His clawed hands reached for her hips, holding them tightly as he swallowed again. Demona shivered as she went up to her thighs in her former love\u2019s mouth. She could feel his throat around her legs, hugging them tightly as he consumed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at him go. He\u2019s really taking his time with you. Usually, he has me down in his belly in five seconds but tonight he really wants to enjoy this. Then again, maybe he wants you to enjoy it too?\u201d Elisa noted as she removed her shirt, revealing she had gone braless tonight. Stroking her full, dark breasts, she crawled onto the large bed beside Demona to watch her get eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m enjoying it?\u201d Demona hissed even as her face heated up. Her pussy was dripping wet as Goliath was sure to discover, as his next swallow would bring her crotch into his mouth. She nearly let out a moan at the mere thought of her pussy inside the gargoyle's mouth. Closing her eyes, she tried to keep from humiliating herself in front of the human, but failed miserably as Goliath swallowed hard and her waist slipped into his maw. Her round buttocks slipped over his bottom teeth, pressing into his tongue which went to work. Demona was moaning mindlessly as his tongue slipped up over her pussy, dragging along her lips before plunging in. Elisa smiled as her former enemy cried out like a whore. She knew how flexible Goliath\u2019s tongue could be and all the places it could reach. Demona was one lucky bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooo Gooood!\u201d Demona panted, not only from the tongue action, but the throbbing flesh wrapped around her legs. The tightness, the sheer powerlessness, it was driving her to new heights of pleasure. As Goliath was tasting her pussy and squeezing her wide hips inside his wet, hot mouth, Demona came hard, filling his mouth with her clear, thick juices. Goliath murmured in enjoyment at the new taste and then swallowed, taking Demona\u2019s still sensitive pussy into his throat. Demona continued to moan, as her cunt was ground into the narrow tunnel, her pleasure not ending even after the oral ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re enjoying this,\u201d Elisa teased as she leaned in and started playing with Demona\u2019s breasts. As her nipples were pinched and pulled, Demona stopped pretending and enjoyed this newfound ecstasy. She could feel Goliath making his way up her stomach, his tongue licking at her as he sucked on her blue, scaly flesh. She pulled her wings in, letting them go down his throat with the rest of her. She could feel her legs entering somewhere less tight, she had reached the stomach and that fact made her bite her lip in renewed excitement. Elisa continued to play with her breasts until Goliath swallowed those up too. A loud, long moan burst from her mouth as she felt her chest compress and squish around the confines of the gargoyle's mouth. She could feel his breath on her neck now, her shoulders sinking into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, she shook her head to get her red locks out of her eyes as she stared at the ceiling as she was fully consumed. Goliath\u2019s jaws slipped over her head, her eyes filling with the sight of his pallet before her skull was sucked down his throat. She moaned as she traveled down, overcome with all these new sensations as she was forced into the round, slimy belly. Her head was pushed through the sphincter separating the esophagus from the stomach. She had to curl up to fit but it didn\u2019t feel claustrophobic, it felt nice. Purring with delight, she silently hoped never to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was she?\u201d Elisa asked eagerly, staring at her big, tall lover\u2019s stomach. His midsection was as muscular as ever, but under all those muscles was a large bulge that was shifting around. Elisa stroked the belly, excited and a little jealous. She hoped Demona knew that belly was her home, not hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery tasty, a little better than Fox, but not as sweet as Maggie,\u201d Goliath rumbled. It wasn\u2019t just the women that had gotten excited, he was rock hard and could barely keep from taking Elisa into his arms and pounding the life out of her. Noticing her looking careful at him, he quickly added. \u201cOf course none of them are as tasty as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn right,\u201d Elisa grinned, her title as best dish preserved.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Similarly to the Spike path, the magic of the Elements of Harmony has filtered into pretty much all of Equestria, causing mares everywhere but particularly the Mane Six to get taller, thicker, and curvier while also boosting their libidos. Needless to say, so much maremeat proudly on display would get anybody's appetite going...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The severe overpopulation issue in Equestria needs to be addressed, and who better than Big Macintosh to repurpose mares into fat and fuel for his massive body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today, Big Mac had to do something he\u2019s never done before in recent memory; take an unscheduled break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just couldn\u2019t take it anymore! His muscles were sore and he was panting from exhaustion as he took a seat on a nearby tree stump. It was so hot out today, he had been working completely shirtless, his muscular, toned chest and slightly plump belly exposed to the cool air, and yet the warmth had still left him dizzy and dazed. The towering stallion had been working on the farm all his life, but with the recent growth in the size of every harvest, he was starting to reach his limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed when, eventually, his sister Applejack noticed him sitting there. She was dripping with sweat as well, though she didn\u2019t have the same luxury of stripping down that him, a stallion, did; even just leaving her shirt unbuttoned showed off the mare\u2019s impressive cleavage. Every mare around here seemed to be at least a little busty, and even fit, athletic mares like Applejack were no exception. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Big Mac, but ya just can\u2019t afford to take any breaks! We need to have this harvest done by tomorrow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhm sorry, Applejack\u2026\u201d Big Mac whimpered. \u201cBut\u2026 yuh\u2019ve really been workin\u2019 me to the bone\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned at that, taking a seat across from him and handing him some water, letting him eagerly chug it down and wet his dry throat. \u201cOooh. I\u2019m sorry, Big Mac. If it was up to me, none of us would be havin\u2019 to work nearly this hard,\u201d she apologized, \u201cbut we\u2019ve got to find a way to feed all the new folks in Ponyville! We\u2019re the biggest farm around here, and if we start falterin\u2019, I don\u2019t even want to imagine what\u2019ll happen to this town!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiped the wetness from his lips as he had finished the water in a single big, messy gulp. \u201cAren\u2019t\u2026 even more Ponies coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack averted her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 afraid so,\u201d she confessed. \u201cAt this rate, we may end up having to double our operation just to keep up with the population! I know that the farm is supposed to be Apple family property through-and-through, but if this keeps up, we ma have to hire some outside help\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuddered at that. They had worked so hard to make sure that the acres are owned and worked on by members of the apple family only\u2026 if they started hiring outsiders, it\u2019d make all that work for nought! \u201cIsn\u2019t there\u2026 anything else we could do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was quiet for a long while, then, but Big Mac could tell she was brewing something up in that noggin of her\u2019s. He always looked to her for guidance on these sorts of things; she might not have much book smarts, but she does have that good ol down-home country common sense. \u201c... well\u2026 I have been formulating a sorta plan,\u201d she eventually speaks up, \u201cbut ya ain\u2019t gonna like it, so it ain\u2019t even worth mentionin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, jack\u2026\u201d He begs. \u201cAnything but this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitates for a while, but eventually relents. \u201cAlright, alright. But promise ya won\u2019t freak out, okay?\u201d Her voice lowered to a furtive half-whisper, as she leaned in. \u201cOkay, picture this; what if instead of more apples\u2026 there was less ponies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked, uncomprehending. \u201cWut?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean exactly what it sounds like I mean!\u201d She repeated. \u201cInstead of turning production up, we gotta bring the population down! What we gotta do is get rid o\u2019 some of these mares that have come to Ponyville!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac wasn\u2019t liking the sound of this. Getting rid of mares? \u201cBuh\u2026 how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack grimaced. \u201cWell, there\u2019s a few ways we could\u2026 but I\u2019ve done some thinkin\u2019, and I think I\u2019ve thought o\u2019 the best one,\u201d she explained, before patting that slightly chubby gut the shirtless stallion had on display. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve seen ya eat, Big Mac. I\u2019ve seen what you cram in yer gut each apple family reunion. Ya might be a pony, but ya got the appetite o\u2019 a horse! And it\u2019s got me thinking\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 you could probably fit a whole mare in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac was stunned! He scanned her expression for any sign that she might just be joking, but if she was, she betrayed not a single hint of it. It seemed like she was dead serious! Her proposal, though, only left the big guy stuttering and confused. \u201cWhuh\u2026 huh\u2026 aah\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly keeps talking, hoping to calm things down before he gets too shocked. \u201cNow, now. It don\u2019t gotta be any locals, and it definitely doesn\u2019t gotta be anypony ya know! Just, every once in a while, find yerself one of these new mares fresh in town, slide em down yer gullet, and, err\u2026 let your stomach do its thing.\u201d She gestured down to his belly, with a disturbing sense of nonchalance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac was shocked! She actually wanted him to\u2026 digest ponies? Usually, she had far better ideas than this! \u201cApplejack, ah\u2019m sorry, but\u2026 ah can\u2019t believe yah\u2019d even say such a thing!\u201d He balked. \u201cAh don\u2019t want to hurt any mares or nothin\u2019! Ah just-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned back, pouting a bit at his outright rejection of her idea. \u201cYa promised ya wouldn\u2019t freak out, Big Mac. This is just a\u2026 a hypothetical!\u201d She said. \u201cI mean, would ya rather give up the apple family tradition, and start hirin\u2019 outside help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused at that. She had a point there. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack raised a brow. \u201cAnd would ye rather there be a big famine in Ponyville that leaves everypony starvin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac sighed. \u201cNooo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I think ya should consider it, Big Mac. Ya don\u2019t gotta worry about anypony ever findin\u2019 out; your belly here will take care of alll the evidence,\u201d she said, pushing her hand against his warm, toned, but slightly squishy gut, as if to emphasize her point. \u201cBesides, after ya\u2019ve cleared out all these new mares, ponies\u2019ll start to notice the disappearances and stop comin\u2019. Problem solved!\u201d With that little chat, it seemed that their break was over, and Applejack hurried back to keep on working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac tried to focus on his work, too\u2026 but he was left with a lot of conflicting emotions fluttering about in his mind....</span></div></div>",

He had no idea why he was so hungry, and why nothing he ate seemed to satisfy him.  He ate all his usual food with gusto, but none of it seemed to fill him up, no matter how large his belly grew.  Giving up on solving this problem himself, he went to see Twilight.  He paused as he found her, though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe rest of the girls were there.  But they were a bit different than he remembered.  For one thing, all of them now sported impossibly huge breasts, and more curvaceous bodies.  Rarity had hastily constructed tops for them, Starlight Glimmer looking sheepish.  Apparently, a spell she had cast that she meant to cast on just herself had expanded to most of the world, giving every female an extra curvy body and huge breasts.  Rainbow Dash was the angriest, citing the wind resistance her new curves generated.  Rarity seemed the most at peace with it, Spike feeling himself get extra-turned on by her buxom new frame.  He felt himself drooling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere, he felt something inside him say.

Not much for Sterling Archer, son of the founder of ISIS, to him he always finds a way to entertain himself. He walked into Dr. Krieger's laboratory to see him. \"Dammit Archer, what do you want now?\" Dr. Krieger said. \"What, you don't need me here, since you make the best equipment you German perv.\" Archer said. \"Y-you know what I hate you so much I need coffee or sex to calm myself down\" Kreiger said as he left the room. \"Hmph, whoosh, can't even stand to my words, less that others.\" Archer said as he picked up a glowing green vial from a vial stand labeled <b>DO NOT TOUCH</b>. \"Hmm, oh I am Dr Krieger. I make all the fancy tech in ISIS. I am the result of Nazi-Bio-Engineering. I have weird fetishes and I have constant sex with a freaking Hologram ANIME girl.\" Archer said mimicking Kriegers personality, until Archer drops the vial on the floor causing a massive cloud explosion. \"*Cough,cough* What the hell was in that thing, tastes like wet mud and boiled sperm.\" Archer said getting up.<br>\r\n\"*Stomach grumble* Great now I am hungry, where did Krieger hide that sandwich stash?\" Archer says as Mitsuko Miyazumi(Krieger's holographic fiancee) materializes. \"(Whoa, I thought you couldn't com back after Kreiger turns you off.)Fuwai, kurieig\u0101 ga kimi o shitsub\u014d sa sete kaettekonai to omotta.\" Archer says *Why am I speaking Japanese?*. \"(Mr. Archer, I only materialized to see my darling Krieger.

A moment later Archer pulled out his gun and shot Mitsuko only to see her fall down tasered. \"Dare ga watashi no dangan o tez\u0101 no mono ni okikaeta no ka?(What the hell, who replaced my bullets with tasered ones!?)\" Archer said.<br>\r\n*Stomach grumble*\"Fine, I'll feed you but there is no food.\" Archer says, then looks at the downed Mitsuko \"Unless...?\"</span></div></div>",

It loved a good clean battle, especially with all its friends.  He didn't even mind fighting his enemies, 'cause fighting was fun and everyone here was tasty.  He loved eating much more than fighting, which was why he incorporated his favorite thing to do into his fighting style.  Besides, he was fighting Krystal today!  And she tasted like mint to Kirby's tongue, a flavor he loved.  (Granted, he loved all flavors except for anything that tasted like bodily functions, but that's another story entirely.)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKrystal twirled her staff and sighed, silently grateful that getting digested by Kirby was quick and even without the Restore magic Master Hand set up, she would come back anyway...  Oh, she had defeated Kirby before, sometimes with great ease, but getting eaten by a marshmellow half her size was just unnerving...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========================<br>\r\nShadow Moses Island...<br>\r\n========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYoshi churred softly, looking curiously at his new opponent.  He tried to ignore the scary rumblings of the Metal Gear tanks in the background, and watched as the sexy, dark-skinned racer, Kate Alen, prepared to fight him.  She adjusted the red bikini-bottoms of her outfit and did a few practice kicks.  Yoshi supposed that she was sexy, what with her long legs, ample bosom and rear, as well as her skintight, revealing outfit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut his standards of appealing were yoshisaurus, not human.  So he couldn't really tell one way or another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAt any rate, this was just a sparring match, with no real stakes involved, so the two of them could take their time.  Yoshi even thought about holding her in his stomach for a while, letting her wriggle around, before digesting her and putting her in an egg.  He never got to do that in the official matches...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========================<br>\r\nBowser's Castle...<br>\r\n========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBowser grumbled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe hated this place.  He hated the fact that the Princesses were becoming stronger each day, that despite all his gains in powers and allies, he could never get ahead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe wanted revenge.  He wanted to sulk and eat something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBowser looked at the monitor, watching Peach, Daisy, Zelda, and Samus battle with each other.  He grinned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Maybe I can get both done...\"  </span></div></div>",

He had to be, otherwise he'd crash into things and die horribly and in great pain.  So he was very observent when dashing along at the speed of sound.  He used his observational powers to do his amazing stunts, bouncing and flying off of everything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHowever, not even Sonic could account for everything.  So it can be excused that he didn't notice the stone falling from the sky and landing right in his path.  He tripped over it, bouncing into a shallow pool.  Frantic, he scrambled out of the water, glaring back at it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Freakin' hate water... Any water that's not in a drinking glass can go to hell...\" he muttered.  He looked around for what tripped him, spotting the meteorite in a crater.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Huh...\" he said, walking over to it.  Cautiously, he reached out to touch it.  Surprisingly, despite the re-entry, it was cool to the touch.  \"Weird...\"  He picked it up, and looked at it.  It was glowing slightly, with a rune in the shape of a double-sphere, the smaller sphere with a hole in it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe stone flashed, disappearing.  Sonic blinked, confused.  \"The fuck...?\" he said, looking around.  \"That's odd...  Where'd it go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat he didn't know was that the artifact he touched had merged with him.  He was now an engine of destruction.  All the artifact, now a permanent part of Sonic's body, was waiting for, was for him to choose how he would destroy the world.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well, whatever,\" Sonic said.  \"I'm hungry anyway.\"  He smirked.  \"Maybe see how Amy's doin.'  I'm in a good mood, might as well actually encourage her a little.\"  He dashed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe artifact's limited intelligence pondered this.  Food... and women?  Food women?  ...It could work with that.  It had created devourers before.  Sonic would devour the women of the world... But there were men as well.  Men that could interfere with Sonic in his consumption of femalekind.  ...Easy solution, turn the men into actual food items to fatten up the women.  Give Sonic bigger meals.  Yes, he could work with that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSonic dashed off to find a meal.  As he passed through the town, he didn't notice as any man he came near was turned into a random foodstuff.  Cakes, chilidogs, pizza slices, every male of any species he passed became a food item.  The women he passed didn't notice the men's disappearance, having a sudden compulsion to eat the foodstuffs that appeared.  Sonic didn't know it, but soon he would realize his new destiny as the devourer of the world...</span></div></div>",

Trust me, this whole \u2018rogue mount\u2019 business is nothin\u2019 to worry about.\u201d The woman leading the little party boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, most people reacted to the strange news with a general air of incredulity. After all, what kind of curse could possibly sabotage the deep bond formed between mount and rider? And while they\u2019ve heard vague rumors of people getting attacked by their own mounts, they figure that even if the worst comes to worst, they could just fight off their own mounts themselves. And so, a small adventuring party of women of all species rode gently through the forest, preferring their beast metal over those rickety goblin hunks of junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the women, a human warrior named Gescha, lagged behind. She was sat on the back of her own mount, a lumbering mountain horse named Quentin. She was a beautiful, curvy woman, though at the moment, she was currently scowling at the slime covering her hair and body from some monster they\u2019d fought earlier. \u201cUrgh\u2026 I need a bath,\u201d she sighed. Unable to take it anymore, the moment she heard running water, she started to veer off of their path. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up with you all later!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the sound of running water soon led her to a small pond in the middle of the forest, with a waterfall keeping it supplied. She smiled, hopping off of Quentin. \u201cWait here while I wash over, okay, big guy?\u201d She pats the massive stallion on the side and gives him a playful little kiss on the cheek, getting only a casual whinny in response. With that, she slipped her boots off as she approached the pond, testing the water with her bare foot and being pleasantly surprised at how warm it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Gescha started to strip down. Her armor was the first to go, leaving her in a leather tunic and pants; but soon, she started pulling that off, too! Revealing her soft, flawless skin as she pulled that tunic off, her large, perky breasts sliding free from the confines of her clothing, sighing in relaxation at the feeling of the cool air travelling over her more bare form. She soon slid off her pants as well, revealing her rounded hips and perfectly heart-shaped rump to the open world, her curvy figure on full display, though luckily hidden by the dense bushes surrounding the pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin saw everything, though. As the big stallion\u2019s eyes travelled along the woman\u2019s perfect, voluptuous, soft body\u2026 a strange feeling filled him. His belly growled, just quietly enough for her not to hear. As she tossed her clothes aside and waded into the water, she didn\u2019t notice Quentin staring at her, looking uncharacteristically excited for a usually very calm stallion. Little did she realize that the curse inflicted upon him was making him see her as more of a meal than a companion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious, Gescha relaxed as she sat down in the shallow end of the pond, feeling the water settle around her curves as she just meditated there for a bit. As she sat there, though, she heard something behind her; the gentle splashing of heavy hooves trotting through the water. Was Quentin walking up behind her? She thought he hated water! \u201cHmm? Quentin?\u201d She raised a brow, looking over her shoulder\u2026 only to find herself gazing right into the drooling, hungry maw of the stallion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the-\u201d Before she could even react, the stallion plopped his maw down hungrily around her head, completely covering it in warm slobber! She let out a panicked, muffled scream, trying to punch against the sides of his snout with her hands, only to accomplish nothing. He had none of his usual gentleness, instead being very aggressive in how he restrained her. This must\u2019ve been one of the attacks she\u2019s heard of! She could easily take him on if she had her weapon and armor\u2026 but without them, she was powerless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head was quickly forced into that unbelievably tight throat, his disgusting and warm breath washing over her as his maw accepted more of her into him. Soon, he came upon some of the yummiest parts of her; those pert, pillowy breasts. Quentin neighed in delight, excitedly sending his tongue all along and inbetween those soft orbs, squishing down into that flesh and savoring her flavor, sending that slick tongue along her sensitive nipples as the woman screamed and fought futilely against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to play with and taste those breasts forever\u2026 but he wanted to swallow her even more. And so, with one more gulp, the struggling woman was pulled deeper into his maw, his throat painfully squishing down her breasts with its tightness as she cried and wriggled. \u201cP-please, Quentin\u2026 d-don\u2019t eat me! I thought we were\u2026 the closest of companions!\u201d She begged, as his throat restrained her arms against her sides, tightly, making it impossible to try and punch or push her way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat disgusting, warm slobber covered more of her naked form as those drooling jaws slid down over her perfect, photogenic midriff, those teeth brushing up against the small of her back uncomfortably as she was pressed deeper into him. Soon, he lifted his head, easily lifting her up into the air without only her waist and legs dangling from his maw, kicking futilely as she tried her best to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for him, this was another of the tastier parts of her. She let out another yelp as those teeth nibbled on the squishy soft flesh of her curvy rump, the stallion\u2019s tongue travelling up inbetween her legs, teasing along her inner thighs before starting to slide up along her sex! She started kicking harder than ever as the huge stallion\u2019s tongue relentlessly played with her pussy, savoring her sweet flavor and loving how she tensed up and wriggled as he played with her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been fun, but soon it was time for her to go. With one last delighted whinny, Quentin tilted his head back, letting gravity guide the rest of the woman down his throat. Soon, the light and coolness of the outside world was completely gone, condemning every inch of the woman\u2019s body to the unbearable darkness and warmth of his body, as that throat squeezed around her painfully tight as it dragged her deeper towards his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was only worse! Nothing in there was designed to be comfortable for the woman; she was only food, and it was going to treat her like food. Gescha let out another choked sob as she was pressed into that gut, realizing exactly where she was, and knowing exactly what Quentin was trying to do to her. Those walls made it difficult to even move, forcing her to curl up into a tight ball, the naked woman not even making a bulge as she was hidden away in the thick paunch of the satisfied stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hotter than any sauna inside of his stomach, and her naked skin was being covered in layers of sizzling gastric juices, making her start to feel a little tingly all over. Was she going to be digested alive by her own mount? This can\u2019t be how it ended! \u201cQuentin! Please! Let me out! I-I\u2019ll do anything! I\u2019ll give you a million carrots! Just, please\u2026 you can\u2019t digest me!\u201d She cried out, wriggling around as much as she could; which wasn\u2019t much, considering how that stomach forced her to curl up so tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Quentin didn\u2019t care about any of her beginning. He was just a horse, after all, and could only think about how yummy she was and how good she feels struggling inside of him. Her protests would go completely unheard, and since the horse\u2019s body was attuned to eating meat, she had a looong digestive process ahead of her. Meanwhile, as Quentin waded out of the water, leaving her clothing and armor behind, all he could think about was how many more women he wanted to eat...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tHis name was Asriel Dreemur.  Although lately he went by Flowey, due to the fact that a failed attempt at ressurecting him had trapped him in the body of a flower.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe was soulless, and as such held little in the way of actual emotion.  He could feel amusement, disgust, fear... and anger.  Anger at his family for seemingly abandoning each other.  Anger at humanity for killing him and his friend/brother Chara.  Anger at his fellow monsters for being so weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was another thing he could feel - the desire to kill.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd DETERMINATION.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDetermination was a mysterious thing.  The vast majority of monsters lacked it, a monster with Determination only showing up in a once in a zillion chance.  Mostly it was humans who had the power of Determination, the ability and will to control their own lives.  For Flowey, this manifested in the ability to reset time to a certain point.  And oh, did he abuse it.  Over and over again, he would reset time, doing something different each time.  Sometimes he would befriend, be the benevolent flower everyone liked.  Sometimes he would butcher everyone just for fun, and bathe in their dust, for monsters turned to dust when slain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe could never completely finish off every monster, though.  Always, he would be defeated by Sans the Skeleton.  The short, chubby-aura'd skeleton was quick with the puns (much to his younger, taller brother's dismay) and had a love of ketchup.  He was also pathetically weak, only capable of taking a single strong hit before dying.  Even his attacks were weak, only capable of inflicting a single health point of damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSans was also the FASTEST monster in the underground, capable of attacking a million times a minute with bone weapons or the deadly Gaster Blasters, demonic skeletal heads that fired beams of light.  Plus, he knew the magic of Karma, a poisonous aura who's intensity grew depending on what someone's Level Of ViolencE was.  Each single strike would cause the poison.  And because Sans could attack so fast, and Flowey's LOVE was so high whenever the two fought, the flower died to him each and every time.  No matter what Flowey did, no matter how many resets he made, Sans would always adapt, dodge, and attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo many times Flowey had encountered Sans, that Sans was starting to not trust Flowey upon seeing him.  He never knew why, he just had a feeling that Flowey wasn't to be trusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFlowey, realizing that the constant battling with Sans was starting to resonate with the skeleton and make him start to be aware of the time loops, backed off from genocide attempts for now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOne day, after a reset, something different happened. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\tHe woke up as Asriel Dreemur instead of Flowey.  And in the handsome adult body he gained from absorbing Chara's freely given soul.  He went to a mirror, staring at himself.  He was a handsome goatman, with long, curving horns and glowing black eyes.  He was buff, as physically fit as a royal guard.  And more than that... he had his own soul back.  He was himself again.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tHe laughed.  He couldn't help it.  He could FEEL, truly FEEL again.  And he felt wonderful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut wait... \"Chara?\" he said, reaching out with his powerful magical senses.  He couldn't sense his adopted brother anywhere, not even in himself.  So why did he have the power gained from absorbing Chara?  Had his constant tweaking with the timeline started to warp things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe blinked, and checked something.  He could feel that he still had the power to reset, but that it had changed somehow.  Curious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked around, noticing that he was in what looked like his old bedroom, albeit sized up to his current proportions.  And there was a crown on his bedside table.  His father's crown.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUh oh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Not a good sign,\" he said.  He could remember the times he fought Asgore as the soulless Flowey and regretted all of them.  Quickly dressing in robes similar to the ones his mother usually wore, hesitating for a moment and putting on the crown as well, he went outside... and noticed how things had changed.  The castle was much more opulent, more regal... and it was on the surface.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stared, stunned as the sun poured through the marble columns.  He could feel the heat of the sun, something he thought he'd never see again, and for a moment was lost... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked down over the crowd, seeing monsters walking freely through what looked like a human village.  The monsters waved to him happily when they saw him, Asriel numbly waving back.  A few humans were there, but they wore collars and didn't look any monster in the eye.  Some were on leashes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Whoa...\" Asriel said.  \"Did... did we conquer the humans in this timeline?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe turned at the sound of cheering, and saw a male catman, one Asriel recognized as the rather overworked, underpaid Burgerpants, gulping down a female human whole and alive.  Her legs were kicking wildly as she descended down Burgerpants throat, his stomach bulging out heavily as he ate her.  Around him, a crowd of other monsters was cheering him, egging him on as if he were chugging a keg.  Once the human's legs completely vanished down his throat, her feet the last thing to enter him, he let out a belching, making a mic drop motion.  The crowd cheered, patting him on the back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsriel grinned.  \"So we own humans now... Cool.  Never liked them.  Except for Chara...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd then he noticed the statue in the center of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was Asgore Dreemur, his father, posing heroically with his trident.  Asriel enhanced his vision with a magic spell, and read the inscription on the farway statue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"In Loving Memory of King Asgore Dreemur, who sacrificed his life to free monsters from human oppression.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsriel staggered, dispelling the vision spell.  Somehow, a timeline had been born where his father and monsterkind had won the war, at the cost of Asgore's life.  Which meant he was king now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe went inside and sat down on his bed, thinking about the number of timelines where he, as Flowey, had slain his father, had mocked him... and he wept.  For what felt like hours but was in fact only one, he mourned his lost opportunities to be a good son.  Finally, he resolved to be a good king in this timeline in his father's memory, to make that his apology.  He would never reset again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBesides, eating that human had looked like fun.\t</span></div></div>",

One that Sly felt he had to win.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNeyla, who had somehow survived the death of Clock-La, wanted the artifact for the resale value.  With the rumors and mythology behind, she felt she could make a fortune off of it by selling it to the right buyers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCarmelita, ever the policewoman, had been tricked by a man claiming to be the last descendant of the the people who made the artifact, was going after it to retrieve it for him.  Little did she know that the man was actually a corrupt businessman who wanted the power of the artifact for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSly Cooper, greatest thief in the world (although he'd give equal shares of the credit to his gang), wanted it because he knew the creator was his old nemesis Clockwerk.  His team's resident genius had verified that the mythology behind the artifact was true.  And Sly knew that the only safe place for it was locked away in the deepest, darkest corner of the Cooper Vault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ladies, really, if you'll just back off, I'll happily put the artifact in a safe place,\" Sly said as the three of them raced through the ruins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCarmelita responded with a shot from her shock pistol.  \"Cooper, the Amulet of Glor belongs to its current family descendant,\" she insisted.  \"I'm not letting either of you get it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Gotta stop us first, Ironsides,\" Neyla cackled.  The three of them were running almost side by side, dodging and rolling through the ruins, avoiding columns, cracked floors, and the like.  Sly's agility was such that he was almost running along the ceiling, Carmelita's powerful jumps making it seem like she was flying.  Neyla's whipwork got her through more than one obstacle.  \"What do you say, Cooper?  If you get it first, we split the profits?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That thing's going to be locked away in the Cooper Vault.  Preferably under a rock.  Surrounded by claymores,\" Sly said fiercely.  \"It's too dangerous to be outside.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm sure the proper owner will...\" Carmelita started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Carm, I love you, but think.  Couldn't your boy be lying?\" Sly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe uncharacteristic seriousness was making both Carmelita and Neyla hesitate.  \"His references checked out...\" Carmelita said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Bentley would whip up enough evidence to prove that I'm the king of Thailand.  Doesn't mean I actually am,\" Sly said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCarmelita, new possibilities starting to occur to her, began to slow down, doubt filling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You'd really give up a profit like this?\" Neyla asked him curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I've always stole for the challenge, mostly,\" Sly said.  \"But yeah.  Getting that thing someplace where no one can use it is more important than a cash haul this time.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNow Neyla was starting to hesitate.  \"You don't really believe the myths behind that thing, do you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"This is my serious face, Neyla,\" Sly growled.  \"The only place that Amulet is going is in the Vault.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe three ran on, heading for the chamber where the Amulet awaited them.</span></div></div>",

Carmelita, Sly, and Neyla stared at the amulet, an obsidian mouth roughly the size of an Olympic medal.  Staring at it, Neyla and Carmelita felt a chill go down their spines.  And while Sly didn't feel the same sudden fear, he could feel the evil coming off of the Amulet. Sly and Carmelita both tried to contact their backup, but couldn't raise them this deep into the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ladies, last chance,\" he said.  \"This thing is TOO DANGEROUS, and the Vault is the safest place in the world.  Especially after Bentley upgraded the hell out of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCarmelita frowned.  \"...What's the story behind this thing, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Glor was a legendary criminal, but one who did his best to avoid noteriety.  A wolf, he was responsible for the disappearances of hundreds of women over the years.  Some reappeared as part of his personal harem, brainwashed beyond recovery.  Most vanished, never to be found again.  The general theory is that he sold them into slavery,\" Neyla said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Soul slavery, maybe,\" Sly muttered.  \"My team did some research on this guy.  He was a magician, as powerful in magic as Clockwerk was in technology.  And that amulet is the key to his power.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Can't believe you believe in that stuff,\" Neyla said, although she had doubts.  Something about this place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"We've all seen magic,\" Sly insisted.  \"Neyla, you were possessed by the goddamn Clockwerk shell!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That's different,\" Neyla said.  \"And please don't remind me of that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"This... this is bad...\" Carmelita said.  \"Something about this place...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The Amulet has to be contained, if not outright destroyed,\" Sly said.  \"It can't be trusted in ANYONE'S hands, and this temple isn't protection enough.  We got here through freakin' parkour only, WHILE FIGHTING EACH OTHER.\"  The master thief shook his head.  \"I'm sorry, ladies.  But I'm gonna have to insist this time.  The amulet is mine, and I'm gonna lock it away in the Cooper Vault.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"A MAN OF AMBITION HAS APPEARED,\" said a thundering voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What... who said that?!\" Carmelita said, aiming her shock pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It was the Amulet...\" Neyla said, staring fearfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What?!\" Sly said, confused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"LOOK!\" Neyla shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Amulet of Glor was glowing.  \"A MAN OF AMBITION HAS APPEARED, AND LAY CLAIM TO MY POWER.  AND THE HATED OWL IS NO LONGER IN THIS WORLD TO CHALLENGE ME.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh shit...\" Sly said, realizing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"MAN OF AMBITION.  I GRANT YOU MY POWER.  THE WORLD BELONGS TO YOU NOW.  USE IT AS YOU WILL,\" the voice from the Amulet said.  Before any of the three could react, it flew off of its platform and slammed into Sly's chest, knocking him over.  He screamed, clawing at his chest as his shirt vaporized from the impact of the amulet, which was now fusing itself into his skin and bone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"SLY!\" Carmelita and Neyla shouted, rushing to his side.  They were rivals, but that didn't mean they couldn't care about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe magic faded after a long moment, Sly collapsing, gasping in pain.  \"Aaagh...\" he moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Sly,\" Carmelita said.  \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I don't...\" Sly said, wincing as he slowly tried to stand up.  \"I don't know...\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It began quietly, far beyond the reach of the ears of Mortal Hylians, in the realm of the Gods. It was the home of the Three Goddesses, Din, Nayru, and Farore; the Golden Goddesses who forged Hyrule and left the Triforce as a token of their labors. And ever since, they had watched Hyrule from afar, silently observing the dealings of the mortals they created, in their efforts to gain control over the Triforce and the Sacred Realm they created. And for several generations, the three sisters quietly observed as those chosen by fate gained their respective pieces and waged war over the lands they'd created. And as this conflict continued for several generations, the Goddesses were quite amused. In a lot of ways, Hyrule was their favorite source of entertainment. But over the centuries as the various Legends that spawned from that land came and went, and how it seemed the same story repeated itself over and over...there was one thing all three of the goddesses could agree on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for the love of ME, I'm bored,\" Din exclaimed laying back on her cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Bored, I'm Farore; nice to meet you,\" her bubbly Sister said now leaning against her cloud, playfully pointing her tongue at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go back to sleep, Moss-for-Brains,\" Din said pushing Farore away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw she's just trying to cheer you up, Hot-Head,\" Nayru said as she put her harp to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be cheered up,\" Din complained. \"I want to be entertained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you could always watch reruns of what's been going on down in Hyrule, if you're so bored,\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't do any good,\" Din said. \"It's actually the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it a problem?\" Farore asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be quite frank, my dear sisters, the goings-on in Hyrule over the past few millennia have gotten stale and bland. I've encountered unsalted crackers with more flavor and variety than what Hyrule has been doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Nayru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every single time, it's the same exact story,\" Din says. \"Ganondorf shows up, causes some havoc and Link and Zelda team up to inevitably stop him. Sure there's subtle variations between each story, but those variations aren't enough to satisfy my tastes. I mean, you realize that in ONE timeline alone down there, the same story played itself out no less than THREE times!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I recall, sister, the Imprisoning War Trifecta-Paradox was actually your fault,\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you wanted to have at least ONE timeline where my Linkie-kins died, because you couldn't stand watching your Gan-Gan lose,\" Farore chimed in, before giggling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I didn't expect the humans to be THAT incompetent without Link. I thought that the Sages would still be able to lock him away in the Sacred Realm even without the boy's help. I mean, he was standing RIGHT THERE, on the ruins of his castle, surrounded by a ring of fire. You're telling me that your Princess couldn't have blasted him with her magic right then and there?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelly was a little distressed after she watched her beloved champion get killed,\" Nayru said rather smugly taking a sip of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like that girl keeps ruining everything,\" Din said. \"If it wasn't for her, we wouldn't even have this whole timeline problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, didn't we just establish that at least 1/3rd of this timeline problem is on you?\" Farore said. \"And besides, you actually preferred the timeline split, because it 'made things more interesting' as you put it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because I enjoyed the outcome doesn't mean I don't recognize that it's a problem,\" Din said getting defensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph, well Excuuuuuuuse-\" BONK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarore was cut-off mid-sentence by suddenly being struck in the face by a large frying pan, wielded by Din. The green haired Goddess fell to the ground in an unconscious heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, we NEVER speak of that, again,\" Din hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me thinks you're a bit over stressed, Sister,\" Nayru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course I'm over stressed; I'm bored out of my mind, desperate for some variety, and I keep watching this crystal ball, observing every minute detail of Hyrule just waiting for something to go back and liven things up a bit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNayru finally stood up off her cloud and walked over to Din as she paced around the Viewing Globe in the center of their chamber.<br>\r\n\"So what exactly do you propose we do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I've had an idea that I wanted to run past you guys,\" Din said. \"I think it's time that we interfered again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snort-Interfered?!\" Farore said suddenly rising back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not again, sister,\" Nayru said. \"Hasn't our interference already done enough to these people? If anything, that little gift that we left down there for them turned out to be a major curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon girls...we're Goddesses here; they're mortals...They're temporary; we're eternal. I'm not going to sit around being bored for the rest of eternity. They should be honored that the Goddesses are using them for our amusement,\" Din reasoned. \"Besides, think about all the other times we've interfered with them. We've always tipped the scales of balance in favor of either good or evil; I mean think about it - why did we allow Ganondorf to get the Triforce of Power, despite never having opened the Sacred Realm in the events of Twilight Princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, all three of the sisters uniformly said, \"Boredom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, and how about in the aftermath of Ocarina of Time in the Adult-Timeline,\" Din continued. \"Why did we flood all of Hyrule when with a snap of our fingers, we could've just willed another Link into existence to stop Ganondorf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, all three Goddesses said, \"-for Kicks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? We've had fun messing with them before,\" Din said. \"Let's do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you have the weirdest method of coming up with names for these little episodes our chosen ones find themselves in,\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, kind of cooky; I wanna name the next one,\" Farore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright; if you're so smart, what would you name one?\" Din asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about...Breath of the Wild?\" she asked. Din immediately smacked her on the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That name is stupid, you're stupid and you should feel stupid,\" Din said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come I can't name any of them?\" Nayru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't you start, Little-Girl-Blue,\" Din said. \"We already let you name the collection of these stories after that Princess of yours. The ironic thing is, her importance to the story is that she keeps messing things up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does not!\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, can we focus on the topic at hand?\" Din asked raising a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right; you wanna screw around with people's free-will, again,\" Farore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not in so many words, but...I just want to set it on a course and see what happens. And if it doesn't work out, we'll just isolate the events from the rest of the timeline, snap our fingers, and everything goes back to normal. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNayru thought a moment. \"Alright, what exactly do you want us to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought up some ideas while I was browsing the internet the other day,\" Din said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait - the Internet? That thing that won't be invented for another few thousand years, by a completely different species, on a different planet, in another dimension?\" Nayru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you manage that?\" Farore asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls; we're beyond Space and Time - literally everything that will happen has already happened for us. Now -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, I just had a thought,\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, Rue,\" Din said rolling her eyes. At this rate, it would never happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we're beyond Space and Time, how can we possibly exist? I mean, space is the plane in which matter can exist, and time is the plane in which action can take place. So if we're beyond Space and Time, it effectively means that we're made of nothing and can do nothing. So logically speaking how is that any different than - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERD!!!\" Farore suddenly yelled pointing a finger at Nayru, stopping her in her tracks. It seemed to be the only way to stop her from going on an hour long existential tirade regarding their existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Bush-Hair,\" Din said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Sand-n-Salty,\" Farore chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So after a bit of browsing, I found some interesting concepts that mankind comes up with,\" Din said. \"One of them is called 'Vore'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the fascination or interest in one life-form eating another; usually whole and alive?\" Nayru asked. \"You want to expose OUR creation to the depravity of a fetish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, tell me that you haven't been curious about what would happen,\" Din said. \"I think we should chose someone down in Hyrule to go on an eating spree - give them some BS morally simplistic reason - and order that they eat everyone they can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds yucky,\" Farore said. \"You're weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everybody,\" Nayru said, now seemingly into the idea. \"Maybe just...one specific type of people. There are quite a few notable women down there. Maybe it would be kind of interesting to see if our potential predator would be willing to eat them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, so you're on board,\" Din said. \"I agree - only women shall be eaten. That way Ganondorf can remain out of the proceedings. Sides; those Gerudos have really had it coming as of late. So who is going to be our potential predator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linkie-kins of course,\" Farore said. \"I don't want anyone eating him; so let's let him get in on the fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right; so Link,\" Nayru said. \"Which one though? We need someone of the appropriate age; so Child and Toony are out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need one that's handsome; so anything post A Link to the Past,\" Farore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which to choose,\" Din asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThe Battle Royale!  The contestants loved it.  All the violence they wanted, and none of the death and pain.  The contestants would lay in VR chambers that would broadcast holographic avatars of their bodies onto the island, anyone with superpowers losing said powers due to all the bodies having the same limitations, and they would fight to the last person (or team) standing to gain that victory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe person running the battles, Dr. Vinderman (a business tycoon who controlled every global business and replaced all national currency with his Vbucks), noted the dichotomy.  In the contest, the contestants were vicious, cruel, and unrelentingly violent in their attempts for victory.  Use of guns was commonplace, but there would also be trends for kills.  The hologram bodies felt only the slightest bit of pain and every bit of pleasure, so people would experiment in how to destroy each other.  Choking, melee duels with pickaxes, drowning... one might worry for the mental health and well-being of each contestant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tExcept for the fact that every contestant knew full well the games were just that.  Games.  Someone who brutally, savagely murdered someone with a pickaxe in the game would be casually chatting with them over breakfast.  When questioned, the contestants all said the same thing - it was stress relief.  Their own personal Purge, except not run by psychotic government officials and rich people wanting to kill off the poor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd indeed, even the most vicious competitors were casual and friendly.  The most that happened is that some contestants were having sex.  So Dr. Vinderman, while still keeping an eye on his contestants, decided not to worry about it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd then a rather surprising new trend came, one that all the female contestants supported.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt had started with Ramirez, one of the oldest contestants.  The Battle Royale island was constantly shifting and warping due to the mystical, evil Storm and other elements.  Locations would shift or be added, landscape would change... and occasionally there were invasions.  Twice the alien warlord Thanos had attacked the island, looking for cosmic artifacts that Dr. Vinderman kept locked away in a vault.  The second time he brought an alien army.  And there had also been multiple attacks by zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRamirez, the first time she had been killed by those zombies (well, more zombie-like creatures than actual undead), had been eaten by them, pinned down and devoured.  Because she only felt slight pain in her holographic body and all of her body's normal levels of pleasure, she had enjoyed it.  She had deliberately fed herself to the zombies several times, enjoying it more and more every time.  She had then tricked the werewolf Dire into swallowing her whole and digesting her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was bliss.  She did research on it, learning about vore, Dolcett, and other fetishes involving someone getting eaten, and shared her experiences with the other female contestants, who got more and more into the idea.  It would just be their holographic bodies getting eaten, and honestly, it was something new.  So they convinced the male contestants to go along with it, and got Dr. Vinderman to make modifications to their holographic bodies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMen could get fat now, at least in their hologram bodies, and swallow women whole.  Women could be eaten, either cooked and cut up or gulped down whole.  And a new contest variant was made.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Hunt - Men on one team, women on another.  Men won by eating all the women.  Women won by eliminating all the men.  While men would simply be eliminated once their health ran out, women would be put into a 'knocked down' state, like in team modes.  This meant the woman was vulnerable to being captured and turned into food.  Once captured, the woman was to be considered just 'meat,' meaning the men could do what they want with her.  (Surprisingly, the female contestants had insisted on this, wanting to add to the thrill.)  If the men were killed mid-meal, the woman could eat the 'meat' of her fellow contestant to get healed.  Grills, ovens, and cooking tools had been added all over the island, and the Storm would come in extremely slow compared to other battles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe game was made, and everything was ready.  And while the contestants assured Dr. Vinderman they'd keep it in the game, as always, he still added security around the residential island.  Just in case.</span></div></div>",

So when the girls of her class and another class were suddenly put together in the same class, she put her plans to brainwash her fellow students and cause the apocalypse on hold.  She glanced around, seeing who all was there.  Each one was an expert in their field, and in their own way as talented as Junko herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSayaka Maizono, the Ultimate Pop Idol<br>\r\n\tKyoko Kirigiri, the Ultimate Detective<br>\r\n\tAoi Asahina, the Ultimate Swimming Pro<br>\r\n\tToko Fukawa, the Ultimate Writing Prodigy<br>\r\n\tSakura Ogami, the Ultimate Martial Artist<br>\r\n\tThe girl who called herself Celestia Ludenberg, the Ultimate Gambler<br>\r\n\tChiaki Nanami, the Ultimate Gamer<br>\r\n\tAkane Owari, the Ultimate Gymnast<br>\r\n\tSonia Nevermind, the Ultimate Princess<br>\r\n\tHiyoko Saionji, the Ultimate Traditional Dancer<br>\r\n\tMahiru Koizumi, the Ultimate Photographer<br>\r\n\tMikan Tsumiki, the Ultimate Nurse<br>\r\n\tIbuki Mioda, the Ultimate Musician<br>\r\n\tPeko Pekoyama, the Ultimate Swordsman<br>\r\n\tJunko's sister, Mukuro Ikusaba, the Ultimate Soldier<br>\r\n\tAnd of course, Junko herself, the Ultimate Fashionista.  (Although personally, she wanted to be known as the Ultimate Despair.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe fluffy-haired pinkette looked around, assessing everyone.  Junko was a brilliant psychoanalyst, having used her abilities to manipulate so many people in the past.  Even now, as class began, she could sense things establishing themselves.  Peko was clearly unhappy about being away from the man she was supposed to guard.  Aoi and Sakura had forged a bond rather quickly, while a friendly rivalry was forming between Akane and Sakura.  Hiyoko was proving to be a troll, enjoying the chaos developing around her, while Mikan was meekly hiding in a corner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCelestia was glaring at Junko, Junko having slipped the Ultimate Gambler a note with Celestia's real name on it.  Junko smirked at her, holding her hand over her phone, ready to text the name to everyone.  Celestia flinched and looked away, Junko knowing that she had a minion now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMukuro leaned over to Junko.  \"Sis?  What do you think happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Like, I don't know,\" Junko muttered.  \"Let's just play it cool for now.  Go with the flow until I get a feel for things.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMukuro nodded, sitting back in her chair.  As if on cue, the door opened, the girls who were standing quickly sitting back down.  To their surprise, though, a heavily fat man waddled in, his great, fat gut spilling out of his shirt.  He smelled lightly of roses, but looked, quite frankly, like a slob.  He wore a jacket that barely fit his fat arms, and his shirt rode up to reveal his gut, which hung down over his waist.  His moobs were as big as the breasts of some of the smaller-chested girls, and he had a massive rump that jiggled in the sweatpants he wore.  His face was heavily bearded, the man's complexion revealing him as an American.  He smiled, adjusting his glasses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"BWWOAAARRRP!  Excuse me,\" the man said.  \"Just making some staff adjustments.  Anyway, I'm Mr. Bluto, and I'll be your teacher from now on.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJunko snickered softly, her nose twitching as she took in his scent.  What a slob, she thought.  Although she found herself unable to look away from him feeling oddly fascinated with the huge, fat oaf...</span></div></div>",

By all measures, you were a regular adventurer, exploring ruins and helping those in need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only quirk \u2014 and it was quite a strange one \u2014 was just how you liked to deal with your fallen foes. Instead of slaying them all, you always liked to capture a few of their women, tying them up and taking them with you, all to serve a single purpose; <b>food</b>. Indeed, women were no doubt your favorite meals; their pillowy breasts, their curvy, smooth bodies, nothing could really compare to the feeling of them sliding down your throat, or struggling inside your stomach! And the fertile lands of Skyrim sure did have quite a selection of tasty women to choose from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans were no doubt your favorites; but you were a bit biased, since you were a human yourself, and got a special thrill out of devouring one of your own kind. Elves are like truly fine dining, especially those altmer; nothing like condemning an egotistical high elf woman to the stomach of one of those \u2018lowly\u2019 nords they\u2019re always complaining about. Meanwhile, orcs and khajiit girls are good if you\u2019re interested in a more exotic dining experience; argonians, though, were a little <i>too</i> exotic for your tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you weren\u2019t some villain who just ate women indiscriminately \u2014 although you couldn\u2019t help but be a tad tempted by all the busty farm girls in this little town, you must admit! But really, you tried to focus on gobbling up bandits, thieves, and generally, women that nobody would miss. And you didn\u2019t <i>just</i> consider women food, either \u2014 in fact, one was your closest companion! Sitting by your side was a cute redguard girl named Sioilia; she was much younger than you, about 20, and you found her as a charmingly eager newbie adventurer, who had been looking for a more experienced mentor to help teach her the ropes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Of course, you, ahem, <i>did</i> think she looked absolutely delicious \u2014 especially those perfectly plump breasts \u2014 but she was perfectly aware of this fact, and seemed confident that you would never betray her. It\u2019s fun to tease her with, though.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, her brow was furrowed, soberly reading over some scroll detailing recent skirmishes in the civil war. \u201dAll this warring in Skyrim has just been getting worse and worse,\u201d she said, looking to you. \u201dThink we should, I don\u2019t know\u2026 try and help resolve it? If the people of Skyrim keep fighting eachother, at this rate, they\u2019ll just end up as easy pickings for the Aldmeri Dominion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed curtly at the notion! \u201dHah! If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019ll kill you faster than any wolf or dragon in Skyrim, it\u2019s <i>politics</i>,\u201d you reply, with an insistent shake of your head. \u201cNo point in trying to pick sides. Either path will end in you lying dead on some battlefield, and that\u2019s a terribly undignified way to go for such a bright young lass like yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, seeing some wisdom in your words. \u201dHmm\u2026 I suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d She nodded, rolling the scroll up. \u201dI suppose one of the perks of the adventurer life is, if we don\u2019t like the way Skyrim is going, we can just leave, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dExactly! Now you\u2019re getting it,\u201d you smile, holding up your cup of gin with another laugh. She couldn\u2019t help but chuckle a bit, always finding you to be a fun sort of drunk, although one that can sometimes get a little\u2026 <i>hungry</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, while we\u2019re looking out for us and our own\u2026 our coin purses are feeling a little light,\u201d she noted, jingling the few septims left in a little purse. \u201cJust enough for a night of food and boarding here. We really should see if there\u2019s not any quick jobs on offer, here in Riverwood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds like a plan to you! Hopefully getting to go out and complete a quest or two, maybe even battle some bandits\u2026 maybe capture a tasty one for dinner tonight! You couldn\u2019t help but lick your lips at the thought...</span></div></div>",

Despite that, it was surprising how secretive he was being.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Clown Prince of Crime had heard about a cache of magical treasures.  He was in a mischevous state of mind recently instead of a murderous one, and he couldn't resist the idea of using some magical tricks on the Bat.  So he had tracked down the treasures, going by hints and rumors, along with the occasional torture, and found where the treasures were buried, in an Aztec temple in Nepal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe went to the temple, stealing a single-person plane after killing the pilot, cosplaying as Nathan Drake.  (He had debated cosplaying as Lara Croft, but decided he didn't have the tush for booty shorts.)  Arriving there and making his way through the jungle, he got there unmolested.  (Animals took one look at him, one whiff of the madman's scent, and left him alone.)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGiggling like a loon, he made his way through the temple, avoiding the traps he found and stepping carefully into the temple.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"HUZZAH!\" he shouted when he got in.  Gold, jewels, staves, swords, rings, it all was there.  Even if the rumors of magic weren't true, he was making out like a bandit.  He reached down, and picked up a single gold coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe door slammed shut.  \"...Less funny that I prefer,\" he said.  \"Has the devil finally come to collect?  Those WERE some fine cigars I got from him...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"BEHOLD,\" thundered a voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Behold?  Behold what?\" Joker asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"BEHOLD, FOR YOU ARE NOW THE ONE TO BEAR MY POWER,\" said the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Power's good.  Is it a funny power?\" Joker asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"YOU SHALL CARRY THE MESSAGE OF MY KINGDOM,\" said the voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Blah blah blah, skip to the good part!\" Joker snapped, already bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"WITH THESE TREASURES, YOU SHALL SHOW TO ALL THE WOMEN OF THE WORLD THAT IT IS MEN THAT ARE TRULY SUPERIOR.  THAT IT IS MEN WHO BELONG IN POSITIONS OF POWER!\" the voice roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJoker snickered.  \"So basically, he's a Republican,\" he quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"WITH THESE TREASURES, WOMEN WILL BE YOUR PLAYTHINGS.  THEY WILL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH.  EVEN BE YOUR FOOD,\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Starting to see the comedy value here,\" Joker said, turning thoughtful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"WITH EACH TREASURE, JUST TOUCHING IT WILL LET YOU KNOW HOW TO WORK ITS MIGHT.  GO, MAN.  AND RULE OVER ALL WOMEN,\" the voice thundered, the doors opening back up again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJoker cracked up laughing.  \"Oh my God!  This dope is the CLASSIC misogynist.  And he's so stupid it's FUNNY!\" he chortled.  \"Ah well.  First off, fuck your scheme, I'm doing what I want.  That being said, I do have some lovely toys to play with.  And there was a native village nearby...\" </span></div></div>",

Didn't notice circumstances arranging themselves to the benefit of his wish.  He didn't notice anything at all... until he woke up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What the...\" he said.  His room had been replaced by the guest bedroom at a Japanese household.  He looked around curiously, wondering what in the world happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd then he noticed the note.  It was a small sticky-note, attached to his pillow.  It said four words.  \"Wish granted.  Love, Mom.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe blinked.  \"Wish gran...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So what's the deal with our new houseguest, Ayeka?\" said a voice Aaron recognized.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well, Ryoko,\" said another voice Aaron recognized, \"he is an associate of Master Tenchi's and Master Seina's.  He's going to be staying with us while the men are away.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Great...\" Ryoko muttered.  \"Tenchi goes off with Seina, his dad, and Yosho, and we're stuck with some new guy from the States.  Maybe I should just give it up to him instead of Tenchi...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAaron could almost see Ayeka's pout.  \"Now, see here, Ryoko...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh, come off it!\" Ryoko snapped.  \"You're just as frustrated by Tenchi not responding to practically throwing ourselves at him as I am.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Y-Yes, but that's beside the point!\" Ayeka stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Whatever,\" Ryoko grunted.  \"I'm gonna go get a drink...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a sound of Ryoko floating off, and Ayeka poked her head in the guest room.  \"I'm terribly sorry if we woke you up, sir,\" she said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAaron stared at her.  She looked exactly like she did in the anime, but with the exception that she didn't look like a cartoon.  She looked like the world's most accurate cosplay.  'Of course,' Aaron thought. 'Toons wouldn't look like toons in real life...'  Somehow, seeing her real and not just a cartoon made her even sexier...  After a moment, he found his voice.  \"N-no, I actually woke up just before you started talking,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAyeka smiled.  \"Excellent!\" she said.  \"Anyway, we welcome you to our humble abode.  Breakfast will be served shortly.  It will be a bit crowded here, considering we're going to be having many guests soon.  I hope you don't mind sharing a house with a bunch of women, good sir.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAaron smiled.  He couldn't help it, he had to say the joke.  \"If they're as deliciously sexy as you are, ma'am, then I won't mind at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAyeka blushed cutely, giggling.  \"Ohohoho!  Flatterer,\" she said.  \"Well, I don't know if they're AS gorgeous as I, but they do have their merits.  And please, just call me Ayeka.\"  She nodded to him.  \"Please come down whenever you're ready.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe left, leaving a stunned Aaron to himself, a grin slowly coming over his face as he realized what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe was going to get the chance to live out his fantasies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Crowded?\" he said, mainly to himself.  \"I don't think that will be a problem once I'm done...\"</span></div></div>",

He carefully made his way through the house, admiring the rolling hills of the Japanese mountains.  So beautiful... and the house was a wonder as well.  A true mansion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe went outside, and spotted Ryo-Ohki in her cabbit form noshing on a carrot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh my god you're even more adorable in person,\" Aaron said, admiring how cute she was.  Ryo-Ohki looked up, startled.  Aaron leaned down, holding out his hand.  She cautiously stepped forward, sniffing his hand, Aaron making sure to keep calm and friendly.  Deciding she liked him, she nuzzled Aaron's hand, the young man picking her up and scratching her ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe really was the cutest thing.  Shame he was gonna eat her later, he thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter a few moments of scritching, she hopped down, grabbed her carrot, and ran off, waving to Aaron as she left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So cute,\" Aaron said, leaning up against a wall... accidentally triggering a device that send him sliding down a tunnel and into a lush oasis.  He wasn't as surprised as he would be, as he knew from the show that Washu had installed these hot springs throughout the house.  But goodness, was it beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Who the...\" said a voice.  \"Oh.  It's you, that buddy of Tenchi's.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAaron looked, and then blushed brightly.  Sitting in one of the pools, gloriously nude, was Ryoko.  Her long, fluffy white hair was tied back in a tail, a towel on her head.  She was gloriously, shamelessly nude, Aaron getting a good look at her toned body and ample breasts.  She was sipping sake, obviously very drunk.  She gestured behind him.  \"You wanna get in, your clothes gotta come off.  There's lockers behind you.  Plus, you're American, right?  Ever been in a Japanese bathhouse?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAaron turned, and indeed there were lockers, made from rocks and designed to blend in, behind him.  \"No, I haven't.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You gotta wash off, first,\" she said.  \"There's a cleaning area behind the lockers.  Soap and stuff's there, plus towels.  You're not supposed to put the towels in the water once you get in, but no one really pays attention to that.  Water here's always clean anyway.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAaron nodded, and did as he was told.  Once washed up, he took a risk and came out with the towel over his shoulder instead of around his waist.  \"You don't mind if I join you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRyoko shrugged.  \"Sure, why not?\" she said.  \"It's not like Tenchi ever wants to see this...\" she muttered bitterly, sipping her sake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAaron slid down into the water next to her.  He took the sake she offered, and relaxed.  This really was nice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It's just...\" Ryoko said, turning.  Aaron could see that she had been crying.  \"I wish Tenchi would do SOMETHING!  I love him so much, and yet no matter what I do he won't DO anything!  Christ, I'd accept sharing him with the others at this point!\"  She stood up, Aaron blushing as he admired her shapely form.  His eyes went to her pussy, at the shaved white bush there.  \"I mean... Look at me!  There is clearly something there to arouse a guy, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAaron nodded vigorously, his cock erect just from being near her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRyoko noticed, smirking a little.  \"Right!  Even without you nodding, your broadsword there would prove my point!  So why the fuck won't he make a decision?!\" she said, splashing down into the water.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAaron thought carefully on how to play this.  \"...Some guys just don't want to offend anyone.  He's maybe afraid of losing all the friendships he's made if he does something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That's stupid,\" Ryoko said, chugging from her sake bottle.  \"That's... fuck offense, I just want to know one way or another.  It's been years now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe slumped over, and to Aaron's delight, leaned against his shoulder.

Take you out for dinner, dancing, movies... and at night, I'd fuck you so hard that you couldn't move until ten o'clock in the morning.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRyoko grinned widely, the blush coloring her cheeks no longer just from the booze.  \"You'd keep me well fucked?\" she teased, squishing her breasts against your chest.  \"Nice and rough?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAaron grinned, running his hands through her hair.  \"I'd use this big fluffy mane of yours to force my dick down your throat, make you guzzle so much cum you get fat off of it.  I'd fuck your ass so hard you wouldn't be able to sit down.  And I'd keep pumping that pussy of yours with so much cum you'd be guaranteed to get pregnant,\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRyoko kissed Aaron passionately, her lips locking with his.  \"I need you,\" she said softly.  \"I need you to make love to me.  Please, fuck me...  I'm yours, my body is yours, do whatever you want to me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAaron grinned.  \"Well, if you're offering...\" </span></div></div>",

The skinny, under-muscled, glasses-wearing, black-haired and brown-eyed teen was an otaku with a large collection of anime, video games, and cartoons and a collection of body pillows featuring his favorite girls from said games, cartoons, and animes.  His favorite animes were harem comedies, and he was generally a nice, intelligent kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe just had absolutely no luck with girls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEvery time he tried to talk to one, he ended up stammering in fear and running away.  This happened even with female teachers.  The crueler girls in school had picked up on this and teased him ruthlessly, insulting his tastes.  He had a couple friends (including, surprisingly, the college's alpha male jock) that he could talk about his interests with, but for the most part, he barely talked to anyone.  His interaction with women was limited to just fantasy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLouis's fantasies, however, tended towards the strange.  For example, he was a voraphile, with a particular kink of enjoying pics and stories of women being eaten.  By humans, by creatures, by abominations, if it involved a beautiful female getting turned into food, then he loved it.  He had developed a fursona, that of af handsome, predatory wolfman, and had bought several commissions of him eating his favorite fictional characters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was frustrating.  He just wanted to talk to women, to share something intimate with them.  But he knew that his deviant kinks wouldn't net him any friends.  He couldn't even talk to his two buddies about it.  College was a pain, his parents didn't understand his interests, his younger sisters were brats... he knew he didn't have it as bad as some, but he was frustrated nevertheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Sometimes,\" he said to himself while walking home one day, \"I just wish life could be more fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well if you insist,\" said a voice from behind him.  Louis turned, and for the weirdest moment he thought he saw someone that looked like the Tom Hiddleston version of Loki.  The man snapped his fingers, Louis blinded by a sudden white light.  The man was gone.  Staggering, Louis went home, wondering what happened.  The rest of the day passed without incident, and he went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe had no idea how his life was about to change...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tLouis went to bed, thinking that he had just imagined encountering a figure that looked like Loki.  When he woke up, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"WHAT THE?!\" he shouted before he could stop himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe had become... well, handsome, for lack of a better term.  He was now a buff young wolfman, with grayish white fur and a long, whippy tail.  He flexed, feeling his toned muscles bulge, and ran his fingers through his long, white, anime-ish hair.  He looked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t...like his fursona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe ran over to his bathroom mirror.  He was a STUD.  A handsome, pretty wolf who was in great shape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Whoa...\" he said softly.  A thought occurred to him, and he went to his computer desk.  His wallet was there, and he opened it up.  In addition to his driver's license (which had his new face), there was also something called a 'Predator License.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"'The holder of this license is allowed to eat any living person with or without a restorative 'Prey License' at any place or time.  So long as the end result is ingestion and digestion, the holder of this license is allowed to...'  Oh wow... 'Is allowed to do whatever they want to their intended meal.'\" He felt a tugging at his back, and realized his tail was wagging happily.  He blushed, and looked at the license again.  \"'The holder is certified in oral ingestion, cock ingestion...'  Eep.  'Anal ingestion and astral ingestion.'\"  He giggled to himself.  This was so awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWondering if anything else had changed, he went online.  Half the world had become furs of varying species, including several celebrities.  The movie Zootopia didn't exist because the actors were all their animals from the movie.  Predation was commonplace.  Several of the students on Facebook posted pics of themselves with prey-filled bellies.  Sometimes guys would post pics of themselves with prey-bloated balls, women posting pics of prey-filled breasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLouis couldn't believe how freaking hard he was right now.  He checked around, and saw that people with 'prey licenses' could regenerate from being eaten at a specially chosen location.  Louis did a quick check in his wallet again, and saw that he had a prey license as well, his 'respawn point' set for his bedroom.  \"Which means I'm not safe... somehow, though, that just makes it more thrilling.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain, his tail was wagging.  He didn't get embarassed about it this time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking on the internet again, he saw that EVERY show he liked had vore in it now.  Harem comedies such as Daily Life with Monster Girls, Eiken, or Tenchi Muyo always ended each episode with the protagonist filling his belly with all the girls (not counting multi-parters), all them fine the next episode barring the protagonist being a bit fatter.  Sex was MUCH more commonplace, even in shows meant for younger kids.  Eating people was a way of life here, a well accepted one at that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t'I wish my life was more fun,' he had said.  Oh boy had he gotten his wish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe decided to go downstairs to see what else had changed.  He could hear his family, father, mother, three younger sisters, one older sister, and mother already eating breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe blushed brightly when he saw how they had changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll of them were sexy furs now, all of them nude.  His father was a wolf like him, fat from years of prey but still buff and handsome.  His younger sisters were three wolf puppy girls, the young teens happily chatting away.  His older sister was a slinky jaguar.  His mother was now a buxom, ultra-sexy fox woman.  All of the women sported absurdly large breasts.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tAnd Louis found himself thinking of a story he wrote about an incestuous, vorish family... \"Ho boy...\" he said, wagging his tail and licking his lips.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tLouis sat down at the table, blushing a little as he looked over his family.  His father, Maxwell, nodded to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Looking forward to today, son?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLouis nodded.  \"Oh, you have no idea...\" he replied, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMaxwell chuckled.  \"Well, just be sure to get your assignments done before you eat someone.  Gluttony parties are fun, but work has to come first,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis mother, Nadia, scoffed.  \"Oh, he's still young yet,\" she said, her chest bobbing.  \"Let him sow his wild outs while he can.  Get a few dozen girls pregnant, stuff himself until he can't move, that sort of thing!\"  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tLouis blushed brightly as his mother served him pancakes, leaning over to give him a good view of her ample cleavage.  \"You just enjoy yourself, sweetie,\" she said.  \"Life's too short to be bogged down too much.  Now eat your breakfast and mommy will give you a blowjob before classes today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMaxwell shook his head, but he was smiling.  \"I swear, you spoil the boy,\" he said.  \"It's a wonder he's not as fat as me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Keep talking like that and I won't let your dick eat me tonight,\" Nadia said.  When Maxwell just stared at her, amused, she giggled.  \"Oh, who am I kidding?  It's so hot when you shoot me into another girl so they can rebirth me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Speaking of birth,\" said Louis's sister, Maddy, \"I just got a text from the clinic with the results.\"  She purred happily.  \"It's a girl.  Which means you'll have another pussy to fuck when she gets old enough.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLouis blushed, grinning.  Maddy was his half-sister from Nadia's previous marriage, but he had always fantasized about her.  And now, it seems, he was going to have a baby with her.  His younger sisters, Lia, Tia, and Mia, all giggled at him, chatting amongst themselves, talking about getting their prey licenses today.  He ate the pancakes... and nearly died from pleasure.  His mother was a decent cook before, but now she was amazing!  Her pancakes never tasted this good before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You like?\" Nadia asked, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Love 'em!\" Louis said around a mouthful of pancake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNadia beamed.  \"Anyway.  Once you've eaten, be sure to shower and get dressed,\" she said.  When the triplets complained, Nadia rolled her eyes.  \"Yes, yes, I know that clothes are hot and uncomfortable, but the 'public decency' laws require them.\"  You could almost hear the air quotes when she said public decency.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLouis just grinned.  Today was going to be an interesting day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t</span></div></div>",

Which makes it all the more surprising a business such as Adiphaga Gynoph Accounting and Finance seemed to practically spring up overnight in the sprawling Canadian metropolitan area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was thanks in no small part to, of course, one of its top executives; William Arturo. Half Canadian and Half Japanese, but all around as cunning and sinister as he was borderline androgynous. He wasn't the company CEO or CFO or President and in truth, only did about as little work as his job required of him. But, if you asked anyone, he was, for all intents and purposes, the mastermind and effective leader of the firm. This was thanks in no small part to his lack of morals, cutthroat business practices and deep-seated, borderline obsessive desire to consume women. Whenever a female representative or employee of a rival company seemed to resist his offers or his demands, the effeminate looking man wouldn't waste any time shoving her head-first into his rubber-like gullet and swallowing her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat habit had, of course, rapidly caught up to him. While Will had earned no shortage of comments and insults about his feminine looks thanks to his long, curly hair like a 1980s fashion model and his once slender frame, lacking any noticeable body hair, his figure billowed out nigh comically. Nowadays, his massive gut hung over his thick knees, propping up a pair of moobs stuffed into a finely-woven, black and brass double-breasted suit. His face only became more feminine looking as he gained weight, swelling into a cherubic profile with soft, creamy cheeks framing his thick double chin. Indeed, it seemed the only thing that could give him away for a woman was buried under that gut and usually all too readily revealed to any woman he could charm, something he readily used and abused to hell and back. Especially when it was a free meal ticket, his current lover tired and helpless in bed after...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, those who were higher up than him in the corporate pecking order didn't question this. They either didn't know or were too fixated on profits to even care, if they had found out. To them, he was an ace in the hole, an assurance to bigger and better things. And if you asked the misogynistic, nigh villainous fat man himself, he'd agree emphatically...albeit for a different reason entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese businessman hummed coyly to himself as his swollen body into the lobby's elevator, humming as his thick, tubby fingers rapped against his fleshy middle. He slowly licked his lips, humming idly as he daydreamed of seeing his middle swell fatter and fatter as he sent women right inside of it...and of course, his superiors in the company made sure to keep him appeased, as he looked over at rows and rows of cubicles. New hires, all women, feverishly filling out forms and typing on computers to meet their deadlines, not knowing of the impending \" corporate downsizing\" to come today...</span></div></div>",

The win condition - survive to the end of the episode.  The lose condition?  Get eaten.  The catch?  Any supernatural abilities the women have are removed, along with any gear that could give them an advantage.  High tech armor wearers would be given a bodysuit similar to their armor, but beyond that, the only thing they could fight back with was their own natural training, intelligence, and skill.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo far, the survival rate of the women was zero.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was an unfair contest that favored the predators.  And to make matters worse for the women, rape was encouraged.  The show was in its fifteenth season and the ratings were still going strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMax was one of the only full humans in the predator stable.  A six foot tall man with short, almost white hair, a muscular build save for a small potbelly, and scars criss-crossing his body.

But they were apparently 100% the women from the games, shows, etc.  He didn't care, they were delicious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis shift was starting, so he got ready to go into the hunting environment.

The young man looked down at himself, realizing he was trim and slim once more, showing no signs of fat on his muscular, six foot tall body.

He nodded, realizing he was entering a planet's atmospshere.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt would be time to eat, soon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlex (he had no family name, for he had eaten his family long ago) was unique.  He had the ability to absolutely command anything female of any species, as well as the ability to ingest anything whole and digest it into his fat.  In addition, he didn't need to breathe in this space, could fly, and was nearly invincible, as well as ageless and immortal.  So he decided to use these gifts in a way that benefited him - he ate the females of every species on his planet, including his own species, into extinction.  All females obeyed him without question, even far away, and willingly fed themselves to him.  He would then launch himself into space and devour all the females from another planet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe had done this for years, traveling from planet to planet, universe to universe, devouring the females and letting the males war themselves into extinction.  Nothing could stop him.  Sometimes he ended up on a world from a show or game he liked back on his old world.  They were especially fun to devour, as he made sex slaves out of the ones who's names he knew.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe wouldn't know where he was until he crashed on the planet.  But that's okay.

Gynox himself did everything he could to stay out of the media, making sure that nobody ever took interest in his prison.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt helped keep the heavily obese Gynox's diet of women a secret, the trillionare having paid to have his body modified to be capable of swallowing women whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd as for his prison, it was filled with like-minded men and women, all of whom had the same ability Gynox had.  The prison itself did contain real criminals, but many were just women that those loyal to Gynox took interest in and framed.

Women of all ages and beauty types heaped abuse on him, blaming him for incidents that he wasn't even near, framing him for things they did, and generally treating him like crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe worst part?  Every girl here was hot.  And if the multitude of pregnancies was any indication, most of them were sluts too.  Not that John got anything.  He didn't dare masturbate, because the girls would check his underwear and accuse him of being a pervert, threatening to report him to the all-female staff.

She had short blonde hair and was a little plump, but in the thicc sense rather than the unpleasantly fat sense.  \"He has almost fallen completely into despair.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Good,\" the male voice said.  \"The hypnotic artifact I gave you to turn everywoman on campus against him is working?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe headmistress snickered.  \"It's almost funny how well its working, really.  The delinquents captured him last week and spanked him publically.  Everyone laughed, even the ones that are normally kindhearted.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The corruption you've put into everyone is glorious,\" the male voice said.  \"Kind souls turned cruel.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe headmistress spoke again, sounding supplicant.  \"And once the sacrifice is ready, I will use the serpent artifact to devour him and absorb his body and soul into mine.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And you will be immortal, as I promised,\" the male voice said.  \"Just be careful.  One mistake and you will be the one preyed upon.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Please. He's just a human male,\" the headmistress said.  \"What could he do to hurt me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"One never knows,\" the male voice said.

He knew what to do, what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"John Wilcox is the true headmaster of this school.  Each and every one of you want to obey his will without question.  All of you find John Wilcox to be the sexiest man alive, and his lovemaking skills can't compare to any other man you've had.  All of you want to have his babies, and the idea of being his food makes you all wet.  When you see John, you'll try to seduce him into bed or into eating you, obeying his every whim as if it was the most normal thing in the world to do.  Most importantly, you will keep you loyalty to this school, your love for John, a secret.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJohn felt the magic reach out of the music box, touching the minds of every woman on campus.  He bit his lip, wondering how he could test to see if it worked...</span></div></div>",

The woman was THAT ridiculously overconfident.   \"Well, no wonder the spirit that talked to me was upset with her,\" he said.  And sure enough, he heard a demonic chuckling in the back of his mind.  Looking around, closing the door to the shrine, he eventually found a locked drawer.  Testing the key, he put the music box inside the drawer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Now I'll just keep the key with me at all times,\" he said, putting it on the lanyard he wore that had all his keys around it.  \"Probably should lock my door at nights, too...\" He blinked, realizing that he'd probably been hypnotized not to do that, since he distinctly remembered doing that before coming to this campus.  He scowled.  Another reason to hate Morgaine...</span></div></div>",

Who'd have thunk it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe recognized her.  Her name was Karen Matthis, the daughter of a pair of rich old money donators, and she was one of his worst tormentors.  She would frame him for stealing panties, and deliberately grind his balls under her heels.  It was a wonder they never ruptured.  To make matters even more annoying, she was gorgeous.  Wide, curvy hips, an ample ass, long legs with thick, juicy thighs, breasts naturally as big as her head, and long blond hair.  She never wore panties underneath her uniform skirt, and always kept her shirt unbuttoned to show off her ample chest and the fact that she wore no bra.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Karen,\" John said stiffly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKaren giggled, twirling a lock of blonde hair around her finger as she pressed herself up against her.  \"C'mon,\" she said.  \"You can't really hold all that I did against me, can you?\" She purred, adding, \"Or maybe you can, and you want to punish me for it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe demon (for John was sure that is what was powering the artifact and music box now) whispered to him.  <i>You've given the command. She belongs to you in body and soul.  Literally, if you consume her.  Your body now has the Aspect of the Serpent in it, and can stretch to swallow her and digest her both body and soul, adding her life force to yours.  Alternatively, you can turn her into your whore.  Beat her, break her, breed her, she'll come back for more.  It's your choice.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJohn slowly smiled at Karen, an idea coming to her.</span></div></div>",

A tall, skinny young man with brown hair thick facial hair that his mother insisted he keep shaved, leaving him with permanent stubble, he tended to wish for something better than what he had.  Looking at him, though, you'd think he had a fairly good life.  The Daniels family, aside from Murray, were all incredibly beautiful women.  The mother, Clarissa, embodied the word MILF, with thick curves, heavy breasts, ample ass, and a slight potbelly.  He also had fifteen equally curvy aunts, as well as a grandmother who, despite being 80, looked twenty years younger.  Clarissa had thirty adult and teenage daughters in addition to Murray, her only son, and was pregnant with another child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy Murray.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMurray made love to all the female members of his family.  He'd fathered children on all of the women on his family several times, and while he did enjoy it, he had little control over his life.  He knew what happened to his father.  He'd been eaten by his mother.  And now the girls in his family decided his fate for him, what he could and could not do.  He thought he'd gained a bit of control when he met a girlfriend, a beautiful black woman... but he found out that his girlfriend's family was just like his own.  MILFy fat mother, younger-looking grandmother, sixteen Aunts, thirty adult and teenage sisters, and tons of children.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMurray was well-fed, cared for, clean, and got lots of sex.
