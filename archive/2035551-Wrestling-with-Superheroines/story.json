So you take off in your car towards the studios where the matches are being held looking at the dozens of other nerds dressed up in ridiculous and dumb wrestling outfits some even as fellow superhero wannabes themselves you can't help but think \"I'm going to be champ of this arena not these losers!\" Finally the moment arrives as the promoter brings you up to speed what's going to occur \"Okay kid these are the rules you will be pitted against several superpowered and even a few non powered heroines from both comic book universes if you can defeat each one in a wrestling match you'll move on to the next set and believe me it's not going to be easy at all several guys already got their necks broken literally by fighting gals like Wonder Woman or She-Hulk if you want to back off now I understand(you stated firmly you had no desire in chickenimg out)fine have it your way now being this is a wrestling arena you're free to use whatever moves you can perform even if they're illegal these are superheroines you're fighting after all not ordinary wrestlers if you get banged up too bad we got a medical staff standing by so no worries okay think you got it?

Couldn't I have started with someone else more simpler and less powerful?\" You whined loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the little man is terrified to fight me.\" Wonder Woman teases,her blue eyes flashing with excitement.  \"Makes it all the worthwhile to further humiliate you boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell she is pumped up to begin the way she stands and the look on her face is murder but you swallow most of your fear.\"Maybe if I'm quick and manage to somehow take her by surprise I can lick this and she's down for the count!\" You thought to yourself the odds weren't going to be in your favor though due to the filled stands almost everyone was making bets that the Amazon Princess would be the victor and you didn't doubt that all of them were right, finally the moment begun as the mike was let down and the referee let out his introduction speech as you and Wonder Woman took your opposite sides of the ring \"And in this corner standing at 5'8,weighting at...wait how much do you weigh again kid?\" He paused turning to you, you mutter a low response hoping the crowd doesn't hear as you didn't really weigh that much but was far from a average weakling he nods. \"Okay introducing the Skull-Crusher(.it was the only name you could think of offhand since getting into the ring) and in the other corner a superheroine I'm sure you all know and love, the ultra powerful princess of Amazons Wonder Woman(she waved to the cheering crowds of thousands)okay get ready to rumble!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell went off and the ref backed away not a moment too soon as the superheroine came right at you at blinding speed, you didn't even have time to think of a combat plan before you were plowed into the ground you tried with all your might to break her grip as she pinned you down your muscles aching like crazy and all the while Wonder Woman was grinning menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thought I was going to make it easy for you did you? Thought just because you're a mere human without any powers I'd just let you-hey!\"   Her prattling gave you the chance to flip her over onto her back with both legs, she let out a surprise as you were the one now pinning her to the ground and tried to keep her pinned but you knew this was plum impossible as she threw you off without little effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Superpowers should be illegal!\" You thought rubbing your aching shoulders but again she grabbed hold of you with one hand and Wham! You were hurled into the ground the wind knocked out of you as she stood over you smirking. \"Told you you wouldn't last long against me boy, time to finish this I got Justice League duty!\"   As you tried to muster up whatever little strength you had left, the Amazon grabbed you again in both hands thinking hard to herself. \"How could I end this match I wonder?\" </span></div></div>",

Clenching and unclenching your fists.<br>\r\nThe referee called you and your adversery to him in the middle of the ring. You knew the fight was gonna begin soon and it was too late to back down. The referee started rambling up rules but you were too nervous to listen. You kept thinking about regrets of your life and if this was gonna be your last moment, you wouldn't get a chance to rebribute everything you have done wrong so far. You tought about your dad, mother who raised you, and your older sister, who had been your stronghold during your childhood. What were she gonna think of you after the match?<br>\r\n\"Do you understand?\" You were interrupted in your thoughts. The referee looked impatient. It was probably the 2nd time he asked the question already<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" You answered. The referee sent the fighters back to their ends of the ring and prepared to start the match.<br>\r\nYou got a moment to spectate Catwoman's looks more precisely. She was wearing her black dominatrix outfit and in her right hand she was holding her dark whip. And thats when you hear the words:<br>\r\n\"Fight!\"</span></div></div>",

Wow I'm actually shocked no one else really wanted to pick me well here's hope that you will succeed!\" As she shook your hand you pretend to play along with a charming smile of your own \"Yeah you too Mary Marvel shall we get started then?\" The announcer shook his head \"Not just yet Wonder Woman's in the ring right now beating the crap outta of some poor guy who trash talked her Amazon background and legacy he'll be the fifth person she has sent to the hospital today but until I call your name you two can head into our small training room just down the hall...\" He pointed out the way the two of you walked towards it as Mary engaged you in a light conversation asking all about your life you did your best to answer her with a false smile though you kind of found her cute if weren't for her ever cheery personality you would have asked her on a date once you reached the small sparring room the two of you decided one quick sparring match would be good enough until you got ready for the real thing \"You any good at wrestling?\" She asked you curiously as she removed her shining white cape hanging it on a coatrack  leaving only her in her red skirt you could see as she stretched she was wearing flurry hideous pink panties \"Sheesh she really is a girly-girl isn't she?\" You thought but answered truthfully \"Yes I'm one of the best at my school how about you?\" She blushed a bit \"A little well not in my regular form but as my superpowered self well look at me you think any human wrestler would stand a chance against me?

As you were about to fly onto her and takedown her, she simply stepped sideways and you ran past her, \u201cHaha, try again\u201d, you heard her giggling childishly at your failed attack.<br>\r\nLuckily for you, you were able to rebound from the nearby matted wall and, using this opportunity, you quickly dashed behind her and attempted to take her down. For a moment you felt that you could not take her down, but second later, she successfully fell on the ground. \u201cOh, you got me\u201d, she said. You were too concentrated on taking her down that you didn\u2019t notice a sarcasm in her words and childish grin on her face. You rapidly wrapped your hands around her in order to pin her. Being overwhelmed with adrenaline and emotions and completely forgetting that this is only a practice and that she told you that she won\u2019t be fighting seriously, you laughed in her face, \u201dHahaha, how does it feel to taste the ground? Now listen, how I count. One\u2026 Tw\u2026 wwwhat?!\u201d , your count was interrupted as she easily broke your pin.<br>\r\n\u201cI think that you should learn how to behave with girls\u201d, she laughed while getting up and shaking off dust from her skirt.<br>\r\n\u201cBb\u2026but that\u2019s not fair, you promised\u2026\u201d, you started complaining, but she quickly cut your words off, \u201cYes, I promised you one pin chance, but you weren\u2019t trying hard enough and I broke it. Now when you lost your chance, we can start fighting, not playing\u201d.<br>\r\nYou could not add any word as Mary quickly rushed towards you and easily took you down just by pushing you in the chest. You fell on the ground and didn\u2019t even had a chance to get up as she easily pinned you by pressing her knee on your chest. \u201cYou are not going to taste the ground\u201d, she giggled, \u201cyou are going to taste SOMETHING different\u201d. You looked at her with fear, because you didn\u2019t know what this girl had in mind.<br>\r\nMoment later, she took off her knee out from your chest and quickly dropped her bottom right on your face. In a second all what you can see around becomes pink right above you and fleshy from every side. In complete fear you realized that you are trapped between her massive thighs.<br>\r\n\u201cHow does it taste?\u201d , she asked, childishly mocking you, \u201cOr should I ask, how it smells down there, I doubt that you are enjoying THIS, but you were just asking for it with your bad attitude towards me\u201d.<br>\r\nShe gave a little squeeze with her thighs, which was not so little for you, considering that she has a superpowers and has not so small thighs. You tried to protest, but your mouth was pressed firmly against her big backside. \u201cI think that I am not going to bother counting, unlike you\u201d, she said with a childish smile and innocent face, \u201cThis is a practice after all, so when you surrender, just say it, ok\u201d.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were losing oxygen, which was squeezed out of you with the help of Mary\u2019s powerful thighs. \u201cI cannot say anything nor even try to lift her, why she is so goddamn heavy?\u201d, you asked yourself, \u201chow come she is so strong?

I...I...I can't do that I signed up for this wrestling tournament and.....\" But you were at a loss for words as she tenderly put her hand on your face \"And you barely got through a simple practice course you aren't in the best of shape to continue on Willy and even if by some chance you manage to beat me out in the ring how are you going to survive a dozen other superpowered women all of them way more tougher and powerful than I am? They'll massacre you and I certainly don't want to see you any more hurt or bruised than you already are...\" You open your mouth to further protest but she shakes her head \"There's no shame in admitting you forfeit the match Willy I'm sure the announcer and everyone else will understand I just don't want to see you get hurt so you just head on over to that spare locker room in the back there's a spare bed in there and get some rest.\" As she helps you up and gently escorts you to the spare empty room \"You can rest in here and as a act of good faith I'll stand guard watching over you until your leg gets better okay? Then if you're feeling up to it we can prepare for the actual match when our name is called.\"  As she carefully closes the door and you're stuck in this tomb with a injured leg and one teenaged superheroine blocking your exit already you could hear the roars and screams of the crowds as another normal nonpowered guy defeated his superpowered female opponent and you thought grumpily \"That should be me out there......growl!\" You could hear Mary breathing in slight annoyance as she waited outside and thought \"Man I need to get out of here I'm not letting a simple bummed leg injury deprive me of dong what I came to.......OOOOOOWWWWWWWW!\" On second thought maybe staying here for a hour wasn't such a bad idea after all as you lied down on the bed </span></div></div>",

Your vision starts to become blurry and darkens, \u201cIs this the way I am going to lose- suffocated under young girl\u2019s powerful legs and looking at her childish underwear?\u201d<br>\r\nThen suddenly, as you were losing your consciousness, you felt that pressure of her thighs disappeared and oxygen started to fill your lungs. \u201dI am saved\u201d, you thought. But that was only a brief pause before something much worse then you already experienced.<br>\r\nAs you were ready to get up, her butt pined your head back to the ground, however this time it was different. First thing what you noticed is that your face was completely stuck under her panties and right between her butt cheeks. Second thing was the smell. You almost immediately passed out just because of smell. Did she just got up for a little bit only to position herself on you so your nose would be right under her asshole!? You started to panic at this moment. Then this happened\u2026 Extremely powerful and loud, just like an explosion, hot and disgustingly putrid gust of ass wind came out from her anus right onto your face. Her gas got in your nose and mouth. You felt an extreme heat coming together with unbelievable stink. The worst thing is that when she farted, you were just gasping for air because of being nearly suffocated previously, so you got full blast of her noxious air right into your lungs. Your eye immediately started to water and you were as close to passing out like never before.<br>\r\nHalf of the minute before that, right before this fatal fart blast, Mary, feeling pressure inside her building up more and more, smiled at her plan to teach you a lesson thought, \u201cI should give him just a sip of fresh air before starting. I am not that evil overall, plus I doubt that he could survive that without some fresh air inside\u201d. Then she relaxed her thighs so they were not strangling you anymore and got up a little bit, aimed with her butt to drop right on your face and put her bottom right on you. Then she giggled and with a childish look on her face, let her asshole discharge right in your face..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon you're the size of a ant and leapt into the massive rump of the superheroine just as Mary stood up puzzled looking around \"Huh? Where did he go?\" Not wanting her to see where you were you began climbing up like a cockroach on the wall into her flurry pink panties and straight into her enormous ass itself Mary is still looking around the training room scratching her head in bewilderment as you silently laugh to yourself \"Ha see if the Wisdom of Solomon can help you find where I am now Ms. goody-two shoes!\"  As you thought you were perfectly safe no way she would find you where the sun didn't shine but you were in for a new shock as you realized...</span></div></div>",

Yes, see you soon, baby. Bye bye!\" She hung up and moved with light feet towards you. You could tell she was completly sparkling and having the time of her life. She was so in love and enjoying every second. Glad that someone is feeling good, you thought, while reflecting on your own situation. Feeling pain on every inch of your body from toe to neck despite the pressure was already lifted a moment ago. She dropped you to the floor and were kind of suprised that your legs didnt support you. You were sitting miserably and looking up at Jean, what would she do to you now? She came closer and looked back down at you.<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm completely done with you yet.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm gonna take you with me.\" Jean said excitedly(you have never known her either in the comics nor the cartoon series or films to be this inhumanly slap happy!) and found a collar and put it around your neck. It was a black leather collar with metal decorations on it. Its tightened around your neck and soon after you feel jerks from it. 'What is going to happen to me?' you wondered miserably. Jean persistantly pulled you along from a long metal chain, forcing you out of the ring. The referee didn't bother to declare the victory and the crowd understood what had happened and cheered. You were pulled further and further away by the stunning mutant ginger woman until you found yourself in a corridor. The voice of the crowd got smaller until you couldn't hear them anymore. You had hoped this torture would end as soon as the match was over but now she has taken you with her. Would this ever end? You hadn't been able to stand up and struggled to keep up with her long strives while crawling on the floor. She really looked amazing, you thought. Long red hair which reached down to her lower back. And her butt which was well shaped and switching positions while she was walking. Overall she had trained her body for fighting and she looked nice and fit no wonder both Cyclops and Wolverine pined and lusted after her! Anyone would at this point you yourself were developing a crush on the sexy mutant.<br>\r\n\"I'm soooooooo thrilled to meet Scott later\" She declared happily \"But what  will make this evening even more fun is that playing with you cutie which by the way  is turning me on even more!\" She lusted as heat was starting to radiate from her body and light fixtures were going haywire.<br>\r\nYou and her exit the building and you found yourself on the sidewalk of New York. It was late and the darkness of the day had landed. The streetlights were already glowing. You struggled to get up while having the pull from the chain. You stumbled but you had to keep trying. One foot forward and you put all your effort into it. You got up with the last of your power and tripped over her landing on all places right into her rear end! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh youuuuuu......\" She was suprised but wasn't that upset \"Clumsy!\" She giggled as she mentally pulled you back up \"Sorry I did that on accident are you alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah couldn't be better.... But.....\" <br>\r\nBypassers looked and you heard their whispers: \"Does she need help?\" Several thought You knew you had to act fast and seize this oppertunity to break free. As you struggled to overpower her, you noticed that your arms weren't working as they normally would. The muscles had been torn and damaged by the treatment in the ring. It hurt to use them and you weren't sure if you had enough strength to do anything. She noticed your dismay in your face and knew she had already won. At one moment you were watching her beautiful smile and the other she had flung herself on your arm and grappled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're making this worse you know! If I were you I would just stop struggling and go with it kid I don't want to have to do this....hey!\" Jean screamed in shock \"Okay if that's what you want but I warned you......\"  You only saw her big awesome ass in front of your face until you felt her legs crossing your body. When that happened your arm was stretched backwards in a painful manner. She had executed an armbar on you and you found yourself on the paving stones. And you could hear new whispers.<br>\r\n\"Or does he need help? How hilarious!\" Your arm was pulled harder and harder, until you screamed.</span></div></div>",

She got up and brushed the dust from her clothes. You needed a moment to recover but felt a pull from the collar, you were not given that moment. She pulled as hard as she could you were dragged a short distance. Before you could turn around get on to your feet and even then, the phase was so high, you could only stumble after her.<br>\r\nThe collar and the chain reflected the light from everywhere, the light poles, the stores and even the cars. It made it very eye catching. People who walked by couldn't help but stare at it. You felt humiliated of being chained like her pet. Was there anyway to escape this? She jerked on the chain softly  and interrupted your thoughts.<br>\r\n\"Come now, we got so much to do before the night ends.\" Jean thought what she could do to her new pet while she was walking. \"Should I get a dog hut?\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I need a soda! Let me go buy one just wait here for a minute okay?\" She bound you to a pole and rummaged your pockets. And found what she was looking for. She pulled up the wallet and counted the money. \"Oh, we have enough money to make this evening worth it for a big ole soda that is and a little bit more!\" The red haired beauty said with a small smile<br>\r\n\"Wait, I need that money!\" <br>\r\n\"Shhhhh, pets don't talk.\" Jean giggling like crazy replied and went into the store and left you alone attached to a pole. You wondered what would become of you and would she really spend all your money? It started to feel chilling outside. There were clouds in the sky, would it start raining soon?<br>\r\nShe came back out soon with a bunch of sodas dangling in midair and opened one she quickly began gulping it down  and stared at you with her green eyes. What was she thinking? You could feel the first rain drops on your head but you were powerless to avoid it. She kept drinking the soda then finished it and ignored the sudden change in the weather. The rain accelerated, she went and stood under a cover and kept herself dry. You could feel the water landing on your head and pouring down through your neck and down on your body. The weather had joined Jean's team to harass you but you could only patiently wait for your mistress to finish her second drink.. <br>\r\nAt last she came closer with her Pepsi between her fingers.<br>\r\n\"You are a good boy.\" She poured the rest of her soda playfully on your forehead. It was incredibly sticky  but you didn't scream and nor complaint  For a long time after this, you would smell like sticky Pepsi soda for at least the next few weeks.<br>\r\n\"You are a very good boy\". She added.\"Now let's hurry, before we get drenched.\" She untied you from the pole and pulled you to the next destination.</span></div></div>",

Ring the bell already!\" She snapped to the announcer who complied as the gong like sound was in your ears and the referee left the ring the superheroine made a bull charge straight at you but quickly you dodged out of the way trying to grab a hold of something that wasn't part of her flesh which was pretty simple as she was wearing her traditional X-Men uniform the dark blue one with the red X symbol in the middle and most fortunately she was wearing gloves so you at least had a 50/50 chance of getting out of this with your memory intact after a half hour of carefully dodging her(you actually did a Scooby Doo  routine of running around the ring dodging her at every turn and the audience was getting bored watching this sone booed loudly) Rogue not being at all dimwitted caught on immediately what you were attempting to do as she smirked \"So you're trying to pull off the oldest trick in the book eh? Thinking if ya can avoid touching any part of my flesh you got a winning chance? Sorry to disappoint ya hun but it ain't going to work eventually ya will run low on steam and then I got ya!\" Realizing she was right as all this wasted energy by running around like a idiot was draining you like mad and </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to challenge Black Widow. She's the first one you can think of who doesn't have any superpowers to use against you. She wouldn't be bringing any of her stun gadgets either, if she wanted to gain any respect from the audience. This way it will just be you against her, with only your hand to hand combat to rely on. Sure, you'll still be squaring off against a trained government super spy, but it's better than fighting an actual hero that can summon lightning or can lift buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other benefit of your choice was that it was simply Black Widow. Even if she clobbers the living crap out of you, it still means you have a chance to get up close and personal with the elite super-hottie. You grinned at the idea of pressing up against her toned sweaty body all the way to the ring. When you were getting prepared in your corner you saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stark red hair fell to her shoulders and framed her determined, yet calm, face. She was clad in her trademark skin-tight black jumpsuit. It clung to her curves perfectly and accentuated her amazing breasts and perfect ass. In the front her zipper was pulled down just enough that you could see a generous amount of cleavage. As the two of you walked to the center of the ring you could see her breasts bounce up and down, almost to the point of spilling out her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, eyes up here.\" were the first words she said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her face, which had an eyebrow cocked. The announcer was hyping up the crowd with loud booming words, giving the two of you a moment to talk privately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me use these against you, got it?\" she taunted, puffing out her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't dream of it.\" you threw back, trying to fake a confident smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer finished his speech and the hot lights centered on the two of you. You watched Black Widow get into a battle-ready pose and you did the same. The bell gave a loud DING and the fight was underway. You made a lunge as fast as you could towards her, trying to catch her by surprise. She relaxed her fighting pose and just stood waiting, wide open for attack. She might have been baiting you in for a trap but you decided to go for it anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to grab her, she made a quick sidestep. You barely even saw her afterimage before she struck a swift elbow into your back and you were on the ground. You staggered and stood yourself back on your feet only to find Black Widow still waiting, looking almost bored. She was playing with you! You felt angry and embarrassed, this girl was trying to humiliate you before she beat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just gonna stand there?!\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Until you actually touch me.\" she calmly shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of dashing this time, you slowly walked up to her, arms out and ready to go. She stepped back from your advances a little bit at a time and you cautiously pressed further. Soon enough you had her backed up against the corner. Now she had nowhere to run! This was the perfect moment to get her! You made for a grab at her waist and heard her say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith expert control of her movements Black Widow jumped and wrapped her powerful legs around you as your arms grabbed her torso. With her lower body securing yours, she pushed with her arms off the corner and sent the two of you flying toward the center of the ring. As you flew she twisted her body and spun her legs, sending you in a dizzying 720 before slamming you down on the mat. You impacted hard and were winded for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience roared and Black Widow smiled. She had bested you, and so easily. Soon however it was apparent that what the audience was shouting were not cheers, but gasps and hooting. Black Widow looked around confused until she realized. Her front zipper had been pulled all the way down, past her navel. Her sexy bra was exposed almost completely and the whole crowd could see. Shocked and flushed red with embarrassment she then looked at you, slowly getting back up with the world's cheekiest grin on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your grapple you used your close moment with Black Widow to pull down her zipper. Maybe you couldn't beat her in a fight but at least you could humiliate her just like she humiliated you. Your smile slowly faded as you saw her reaction. She was double red with embarrassment and anger, breathing hard through gritted teeth, making her perky chest rise and fall repeatedly. You opened your mouth to say something but before you could get the words out she was on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Widow leapt backwards into the ropes and use their elastic momentum to fling herself at you. She flew at your head and caught you in her deadly spider legs, pinning your face in her crotch. You couldn't even enjoy the soft feeling of her nethers or the warm scent if gave off because before you knew it she was slamming your hips to the floor. Next, she picked your body back up and used the ropes to collide into you again, this time putting you in a headlock. You face was mashed into her sweaty armpit filling your nose with her womanly odor. Pressed against your ear was her soft boob, but again before you had a chance to enjoy the feeling you had been knocked down, nearly unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked you up and used her martial arts skills to strike your shoulder, ribs, and finally your stomach. Sparks went off and your body seized up and collapsed on the ground. The last fist she punched you with had released an electric shock from her glove, stunning you. Your assumption was wrong, she did bring her gadgets into the fight! You laid on the ground, curled up and unable to move. You could hear the audience booing at Black Widow, not happy with her cheap tactic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I care!\" she yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled to get back up but it was useless. Black Widow knelt a leg on your arm and pressed another hard boot into your chest. From your point of view all you could she was her big ass hovering right above your face. Her skin-tight outfit gave it a nice outline, you could clearly see the shape of her butt and the crease of her pussy. It was so close to your face that you could feel her stuffy warmth radiating of it. The view was nice, but you were also in a lot of pain. Black Widow held up her gloves and clenched letting them spark again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one's for incapacitating little jerks like you\" she said gesturing with the one she struck you with moments earlier. \"This one however, is for something much more humiliating.\" and she punched you in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big burst of electricity and light went off when she hit you with the mystery glove. You felt you body changing. What happened?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You felt a wave of nausea course through your body. Thank to Black Widow's weird shock attack your whole body felt like it was changing. She still had you held down by her strong legs and your view was dominated by her ass. An ass that was, oddly enough, seemingly growing in size. It looked like the Avenger's perfect booty was getting bigger and bigger by the second, her bulging cheeks that seemed tight enough to burst out of her suit were becoming gigantic. But it wasn't just them, the whole world was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, am I shrinking? What did you do to me?!\" you barked at Black Widow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this thing?\" she coyly replied, holding up the fist that punched you. \"It's just one of my newest weapons. Ant Man helped me fine tune the details. Now I can stand tall against just about any enemy threat, but right now I think I'd rather use it to teach you a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fair! You can't jus-MMMPHMRRRGH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish she let her ass drop, right on top of your mouth, muffling your protests. Her ass was heavy, and slowly getting heavier. Underneath her oppressive weight, the butt was musky and warm. Through the tight fabric you could smell faint wafts of her sweaty ass stench. With your nose and mouth pressed hard against her rear it was all you could breath too. As you slowly shrank her ass continued to grow around your head. Soon it had enveloped your whole face, and her butt cheeks had reached past your ears and to the floor. The mountainous ass halves spread around your face, swallowing you up in the blackness of Black Window's booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every second you became smaller, and it allowed Black Widow's massive behind to smother you more and more. She smiled as she watched you disappear under her. Before long the ass had taken claim to your chest, then your waist, and finally your legs. You were only a few inches tall when her ass had completely eclipsed your body and hid you from the shouting audience. Some were angry at the poor display of sportsmanship, some were loving the crazy action, and a few were jealous. The referee didn't quite know what to make of the spectacle but when you were fully underneath Black Widow's butt he decided to start the count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One.. Two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Widow smirked \"Not yet. I'm not done with your punishment yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up straight, bringing you along with her. Your body was so far up her butt crack that when she stood her cheeks clenched and held your tiny form in place. You struggled to break free but to no avail, she had purposefully squeezed her glutes too tight for you to move. The pressure in-between her toned butt cheeks was unbelievable. It felt like in a few more seconds your head would pop like a grape. Luckily Black Widow released her asses' grip on you and let your pathetic body fall down to the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up, dizzy and hurt, only to see the giantess and her deadly powerful rump looming above. Past her delicious thighs, her twin butt cheeks stuck out like a giant shelf. They cast two big round shadows over you, under the harsh light. As sexy as her ass was, from here it looked terrifying. You barely had a moment to appreciate how tight and round it looked, or how hot it was when her cheeks spread apart before the enormous ass came crashing down on you like a meteor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Widow dropped her ass to the mat hard, and square on her opponents body. The audience erupted with cheers and yells, she loved how good it felt. Under her sweaty butt she could feel your weak struggles. The sense of power was nice. After she had joined the Avengers she had become accustomed to feeling overpowered by  both those around her and the evil foes that they fought. When you were on a team with super-strong green monsters and literal gods, these things happened. A lot of times she would be up against enemies much, much stronger than her. But not today. Today was her day to be a mega-powerful goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of being smothered in her dark heavy warm place you were released. Gasping for air, you watched in horror and Black Widow stood back up and let her ass drop on top of you again. It hurt like being hit like a truck. There was no time to recollect yourself however because soon Black Widow was back on her feet and plunging her butt into you a third time. Again and again she pounded your shrunk body with her huge ass, giving you not breaks or respite. You yelled and screamed for mercy but your tortured shouts were lost to the booming crowd and the plump globes of Black Widow's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she stopped beating you with ass drops and simply sat on your face. With both hands she grabbed her meaty cheeks and began to spread them apart, letting you sink further inside. Gyrating her hips, she worked her huge ass, letting it claim you as its own. The pressure drove you deeper within, as the two cheek jiggled and danced their movements brought you closer to the core of her crack. The audience hooted at Black Widow's sexy display but for now she was focused on getting you far up her butt. She wasn't going to let you go until she was feeling satisfied with her victory and knew you were completely humiliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hit it. Deep within the crack, on the other side of her tight jumpsuit was a hardened ring of flesh. It could feel your body through the fabric and twitched eagerly. It was Black Widow's anus, and it was happy to meet you. Black Widow blushed when she felt you touch it, her pucker was sensitive, even through the material. The referee was beginning the count again and now she had a choice to make. Did she finish the match and finally pin you? Was she feeling satisfied already? Or did she not want to stop? With one simple lift of her butt she could unpin you and keep this torture going much longer, while still trapping you against her anus. What did she do?</span></div></div>",
