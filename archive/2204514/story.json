Now, that\u2019s not you had a bad time growing up it was quite the contrary. You were raised by two very loving parents, lived in a house that always had food, went to a good school in a good neighborhood and even managed to make some friends along the way. The problem was, however, that you were a human. And whenever you felt yourself having too much fun with your after-school pals, or forgot what was decided for you long before you were even conceived, you could simply look up into the sky and remember how utterly small you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lived in a world where the most dominant lifeform was Pokemon, utterly gigantic Pokemon capable of crushing mountains into pancakes under their paws should they choose to ever grow so big. Many don\u2019t, but some of them do, and one of those some, a Dragonite, came past your village one day when you were around twelve. Before that day, you had it in your mind that you would go outside your little home, eventually. It was nice enough, but it was very staid, and in your childlike curiosity you didn't see anything wrong about wanting to see more. And then the Dragonite came. You didn't know how tall he was. Ten thousand feet? Twenty thousand? Whatever measurement of height he was, if he could be measured, all you knew was that the clouds above didn't even reach his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost died that day, you and everyone else in the village. You felt the earthquakes half an hour before he even arrived, you would later find out he was taking a nice, relaxing stroll. He was monumentally ripped with muscle, from his neck to his calves, wearing nothing but a pair of workout shorts that covered his private areas. His paw came down just next to your hometown, flattening the forest you always dreamed about playing in, burying rivers and creeks under untold tons of mud and earth, and turned the nearby plateau into mere flatland. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted the little village by his feet. He apologized and swore quietly under his breath for his clumsiness, but other than that you don\u2019t think he was so beat up about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used to dream about leaving your little village. You still do, but they're more akin to nightmares than anything else. Of course, in a funny-really not so funny twist of irony, it was at this stage of life when you were forced to do exactly what you feared the mos. Leave. Pokemon could legally adopt humans as pets, as servants, or as toys if they please, and one Pokemon from the nearby city was in the 'market for one', so to speak. The Pokemon wasn't as big as that Dragonite so long ago, you were told, but still big enough to turn your childhood home into splinters with ease. You, along with all the other humans that met the Pokemon's stringent requirements, were escorted as calmly as possible to the town square, where he would make his selection. You could see his hulking form from miles away, he was a...</span></div></div>",

It was none other then the famous anthro Pokemon wrestler Zapp, who stood 50 feet tall, but was still heavily muscled and never gave up in a fight no matter what. Though you certainly wasn't expecting him to be the type to want a human as a pet. Especially since you had heard that his father who was a anthro Raichu was trying to get rid of that kind of thing completely. Which now that you think back on it he had for most of the Kanto area, with only a few small cities or towns still not wanting ot give that kind of thing up. But you do remember hearing on the news that both human mayors and anthro ones were in meetings to get rid of either anthros or humans to be pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, these thoughts were quickly pushed to the side when you saw the giant anthro Pikachu was only a few fet away from you. Once this happened you looked up at him and saw that he had a big and warm smile on his face as he said, 'Hey there, little guy. I hope you're ready to have a great ime with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh y-yes, of ocurse Mr Zapp. My name's Ryan by the way...\" You let out, as you did your best to remain calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had said this though you saw the smile leave Zapp's face for a moment as he laid his hand down for you to get onto. And while you did he told you, \"Hey little guy, no need to be nervous. And there's certainly no need to be formal with me at all. Just call me Zapp. And also for the record Ryan, you'll be living with me as a friend and from what I'm assuming a fan too. You will not be treating like a pet or whatever at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright. And yes, I am a fan of yours since I've seen your matches and you're amazing.\" You explained, as you felt the giant Piakchu carefully get up onto his feet after he made sure your things where in the same hand you were in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after he did this you saw him continue to look down at you with a big smile on his face again when he told you, \"Alright Ryan, so I think the best way for us to start our new lives together is by having you....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Raichu, a rodent looking Pokemon covered in dark orange fur with a creamy white belly, had to be around a hundred feet tall at the least, you gauged. You had to admit, in spite of the fear you generally had for Pokemon, the Raichu was pretty darn attractive. He had bifurcated ears that ended in wispy curls, a triangular, dark brown nose that twitched occasionally, and two circular electric sacks on his cheek that shot out soft, almost beautiful arcs of lightning from time to time. He had this great big smile plastered onto his visage and was carrying a laid-back happy aura, which managed to slightly calm your flustered state. If those were his only distinctive characteristics, you would only sum him up as being cute. But as you near the square in the middle of your hometown, you got a better look at his body, and his cuteness was drowned out by all the raw masculinity he exuded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, the Raichu was only dressed in a green, latex speedo that left absolutely nothing to the imagination as to what was underneath and left the rest of his body on full view for everyone to see. A thick neck between large traps, massive round shoulders that could ram walls even without the massive size difference he had over you, thick arms with biceps that bulged constantly with every small motion, topped off with gigantic pectorals that could put every woman you knew to shame. You tried to keep your focus on these features, but naturally, your eyes kept moving back to below his waist, to his speedo. That bouncing bulge, even at its most placid state, jutted out from the rest of his body by a substantial amount, you couldn't even begin to imagine how to describe how utterly big it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were near the edge of the square when the police who were escorting you suddenly and quietly departed. You looked around, and to your confusion, you were the only other human in the square. They told you that there would be others, that you had a chance of not getting selected. Was that...just a lie? It made sense when you thought about it, you wouldn't have been as cooperative if you had known that. Before you could contemplate your escape back to your normal life, the giant Raichu finally took notice of your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, little guy!\u201d The monumental rodent\u2019s smile grew even further as his eyes lied on your relatively small frame. Suddenly, you found yourself unable to move or breath. You were just too strict with shock to do anything. The massive Pokemon and noticed your dumbfounded expression and simply giggled a tad smugly. \"What, am I too much Pokemon for you to handle?\" He gave you a wink before he decided to sit down on the ground to get a better look at you. His massive junk crashed heavily onto the ground, accidentally leaving a decent-sized crater in the flagstone beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-Uh...no, sir, not at all!\u201d You quickly stammer out a reply as to not earn the ire of this monumental rodent. You couldn't help but notice his beaming smile wavered for just a split second when you addressed him as \u2018sir\u2019. \u201cIn f-fact, you\u2019re, like...tiny. In comparison to other Pokemon, I mean. Did you see that pawprint outside of town?\u201d The Raichu\u2019s eyes flashed conflicting emotions of both pride and guilt. This first meeting wasn't going as smoothly as you wanted it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...you want me to get bigger, is that it? Interesting, I\u2019ll remember that~\u201d He gave your minuscule form a wink that forced warm red blood up to your face in embarrassment. Arceus, this guy was cute. His tone took on a more serious mood as his smile dropped again. \u201cAnd...my name\u2019s Photon, so you don\u2019t have to call me \u2018sir\u2019 or \u2018master\u2019 or anything like that, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al...alright, Photon...\" You slowly answered, not expecting this kind of treatment from your new master. You came into the town square thinking that this Raichu would treat you nothing more than a cute looking toy, or a novel collectible, you were completely taken aback by how...well, nice he was. \"My name's Scott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you, Scott!\" Photon reached down his massive paw towards you in what you thought was a handshake at first, but it soon came apparent he wanted you to climb up onto his palm. Hesitantly, you take one last look at the town you knew, convinced it would be the last time you would set your two feet on its ground, and clambered up Photon's fuzzy paw. Very slowly, he raised his hand back up while he stepped away from his kneeling position until you were around a hundred feet in the air next to his grinning mug. \"I, uh...know you didn't have so much choice in the matter, but I hope the two of us can be great friends.\" You couldn't help but smile, maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all. You still carried a bit of anxiety, you probably should have told him you had a fear of heights, but besides that, you felt generally safe in his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...where are we going now, si-...Photon?\" You cringed internally as you almost said 'sir', your new master walking away from the town square and easily walking over the walls that surrounded your village. He tilts his head to the side before responding, as if mulling it over...</span></div></div>",

He was currently on his fifth year of holding the tile and to make things interesting the anthro Pokemon had decided to hold a contest of sorts to give one lucky fan the chance to spend a whole month with him leading up to next title defense. And thankfully you were lucky fan, after you found the winning code that was inside the cap for a soda drink that you enjoyed to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was about a three days ago as you broke out of your thoughts when you heard the door to the anthro Pokemon's locker room being opened. And once this happened you saw Blaze in all of his 150 foot heavily muscled glory while his muscles sweat form his latest fight and he still had his fighting clothes on. Though this made you recall a rumor you had heard about him starting ot train a anthro Pikachu named Zapp. Though when asked about it the heavily muscled fire dog would jsut laugh off the question or not give a comment about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough this thought was taken out of your mind when you saw the canine's eyes fall onto you as a big smile spread across his face as he walked towards you and said, \"So you're the winner of that contest eh?\" You then saw one o fhis fingers move down to you before it was in front of you. He then added, \"I honestly wasn't expecting a human winner. But I know hat I have fans of many sizes whether they're anthro or human. So it's nice to meet you, kid. As you know the name's Blaze. So what's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself blushing as you took a hold of the hand and shook it with boht of your own while you rpelied, \"It's nice to meet you too, Blaze. My name's Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Sam, I hope you're ready for a month of fun while hanging out with the champ!\" Blaze told you, folowed by giving a wink which only made you blush a bit more. Though your blush went away upon seeing the anthro dog stand up again before he continued with, \"So just let me get cleaned up from my match. And once I'm done with that I think you and I should start our month together by going to....\"</span></div></div>",

And once you had gotten up from your bed and had gotten your morning routine done, which consist of you making your bed, taking a shower and then getting dressed for the day you were your phone go off. And when you went to go check your cellphone you saw that you had gotten a text from your friend Sparky. Though he was a very special friend considering the fact that he was a anthro Jolteon, who was heavily muscled and stood at a height of 200 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this wasn't always the case since he didn't evolve into that form utnil the two of you were in high school. Though after that happened you soon realized why an anthro Eevee was named Sparky since you did think it was a bit odd. However, that did prove a rumor you heard about anthro versions of that specific Pokemon needed to be nicknamed in some way with one of the nine evolve forms they had and then hold onto the right stone to evolve. Well excluding Leafeon and Glaceon who needed to live in a certain area. And Slyveon, who needed a strong bond with someone to evolve. Which was a different from the normal way that the normal four legged Eevees evolved. But who were you to judge the anthros since they were like humans, but they were Pokemon who stood on two legs and talked like any other person. Which was very true since your anthro friend became a fitness model about eight years after you two had graduated from high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it though you heard your phone go off again since you hadn't checked the message yet. And so you opened your phone and went to text messages. And upon doing so you saw this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tristan, I know you're just getting up right now.

After highschool you wanted to get a nice place to start the new chapter of your life, luckily Kanto had a good number of houses by the coast for a reasonable price. You always loved the ocean and water Pokemon so it was a perfect home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now you were going to chill at the beach, enjoy the morning winds carry the lovely seaside air. You got a job not only providing good pay but also putting your interest to use. Your job was writing articles on the latest Pokemon anthro athletes in the news. This was great as not only did you get to write your passion but you also got to meet the giants, interviewing them for your articles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater you would be preparing a new article, this one about a anthro named Aqua. He was a Vaporeon and champion swimmer who's held the title 3 years now. You felt your face heat up as you remembered his photoshoot in the magazine. Despite being a swift swimmer Aqua had a large and buff body, with huge pecs and a eight pack ab set along with his jacked arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe i could get an interview, take some below shots.\", you patted your cheeks as you could imagine the giant swoll Vaporeon looming over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after walking along the trail for a few minutes you arrived at the wide and bright beach. You smiled as a breeze blasted you and the waves crashed on the shore. However your attention was drawn to another site. On the sand from the east side were large prints in the sand, the markings seem to be like that of a sandal sole. Finally they lead to a pair of building sized black sandals, alongside them was a blimp size pair of white trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, is an anthro here? This beach is almost always vacant.\", you curiously said making your way over to the giant wardrobe. Anthros did go to human beaches at times, gladly posing for photographers and letting people lay on them like boats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a loud splashing soon coming from a distance. Looking out into the sea you saw a blue and yellow fin wave in the water before a large head popped out of the water. Surprise filled you as the giant swimming was Aqua the Vaporeon! The Pokemon sighed as he stretched his large muscular arms over his head, the eyes of the giant soon landed on you and a smile grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey amazing day huh?\", the deep and sexy voice boomed vibrating the waves. Soon Aqua stood up, water cascades down his large body with ocean droplets going between his firm pecs and splashing like buckets in the water. Additionally the Vaporeon was dressed in a dark blue speedo. The buff drenched body was nearly on full display safe for the round bulge and firm butt being wrapped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqua began to walk over to you, the ground shook and large splashes occured with each small step of the giant. You looked up as the blue muscular Pokemon loomed over, placing you between his large feet. The blush returned as not only were his big pecs blocking his face, but Aqua's package was resting between his toned thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Vaporeon had a playful smile as he saw you standing between his paws. Causally Aqua rubbed his thick thigh while putting his other hand on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqua soon spoke saying..  </span></div></div>",

Though as you did this you  couldn't help but to let out a sigh of relaxation while you said out loud to yourself, \"Whelp once I get to my hotel I'll be able to start my vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was true as you had just came to one of the big cities in the Kanto region after flying to them from a small town you lived in. And from the reviews you had read online about this specific hotel you were staying at you were really looking forward it. Though you knew the hotel had somewhat mixed reviews, though none were bad per say. But even though most gave the hotel a very good rating there were a few that weren't a fan of the setup of the hotel, but that seemed to be the only real issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you had looked up the hotel it just said that it was a place where humans or anthro Pokemon could relax without any kind of worries. So you weren't sure what those comments were for. But you were about to find out as you entered the hotel from the human entrance. And upon doing so you looked around in awe at the large lobby for the anthro Pokemon. And while you walked down the human side of the hotel which mostly consisted of a balcony you saw a button that said, \"Press For Assistance\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this caused you to shrug your shoulders as you pressed the button. And after a few seconds of doing so you heard some large footsteps like thuds heading your way. This caused you to look and upon doing so you found yourself looking up in awe when you saw a heavily muscled Flareon in a nice looking suit walk up to the railing. This caused you to blush as you realized that he was about 120 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while you stared at his heavily muscled body which was still visible through his suit you heard the buff anthro Pokemon let out a soft chuckle before you saw him bow and then said to you, \"Welcome to The Burning Bright Hotel, sir.

I hope that's alright?\" Akahi told you, before you saw one his massive hands was now in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes, that's totally fine.\" You reassured the heavily muscled Pokemon, while you got onto his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once you did this you saw him smile down at you befor ehe brought up to his massive pecs and start to make his way towards the elevator.

Not really to buy pre say, but you were hoping maybe there'd be something that you'd like and thus would want to save up for so you could get it in the future. And thus far you had gone to a show store, a clothing store, and even a electronic store to see what they had. And even though all of them had very nice things the prices weren't cheap. And even with if you saved up you weren't how long those things would be around. Though when you asked the clerks they assured that nothing would be geting replaced anytime soon. So was reassuring to hear for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you were passing by a gradening sotre that had a entrance for both giant anthro Pokemon and humans (which all every build had) you found yoursel going inside of it due to seeing the giant sized flowers that were in the window. And so once you had entered inside of it you wre quite surprised when you saw those exact same flowers, but they were the normal size as anhy flowers a human might grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you stared at them you thought to yourself, \"Wow, whoever grew both versions of these flowers must of been very careful and took a lot of care to grow them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you young man. It's always nice to hear such kind words from a possible customer.\" A deep but gentle voice replied, before you found yourself being engulfed by a giant shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused you to look up in awe as you were greeted by a 170 foot tall heavily muscled anthro Ninetales in a orange robe of sorts which even though it was closed still gave you a very good view of his massive pecs and rock hard abs and arms. This cuased you to blush as you shook your head to stop staring at him before....</span></div></div>",

Strange thoughts of contemplation hit you as you recounted your position right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Thud Thud</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light yet audible tapping came from the front of your house, far larger then a simple knock. A booming deep voice resounded from outside seeming to cover the whole building. \"Hey buddy you up yet?\", despite the deep tone and strength, the asker had a gentle kindness to the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling your covers off you decided to not spend all say in bed and actually accomplish something today. Making your way downstairs the room temperature increased as you made your way to the front, feeling the heat of the occupant outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the door you took a breath and opened the door to be faced with a looming, manly shadow.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<i>It was a cold night, you huddled closely to a giant vent in an effort to recieve warmth. The ground shook as one of the giant pokemon walked outside the alley you were in. This was the third day in this giant city of anthro pokemon, you were too scared to approach one and ask for directions to the nearest human city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last week had been a blur as you found yourself without much memory. You had a basic understanding of the world and your name but that was it. There were many different cities for humans and Pokemon, the one you woke up in was filled with 200ft tall anthro pokemon. Many worries came to mind, what if humans aren't allowed in the city? How would one react to seein you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing you leaned your head back and closed your eyes, feeling a sense of hopelessness. The ground began to shake again but you ignored it as it would cease like the rest. However the shaking grew more and you could hear the steps coming closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human...are you alright?\", a deep surpised voice grew concerned as it boomed above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes, you looked up in awe at the figure looming into the sky. From a pair of large orange paws you saw a pair of toned legs clothed in skinny jeans. Above that was a muscular torso clothed in a black jacket, the zipper down enough to show large buff creme scaled pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange dragon like pokemon had concern in his blue eyes as he squatted down making his large muscled thighs clench. You blushed as the Charizard's handsome face looked over his huge pecs at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly scooted back in panic as the giant started reaching for you. A nearby trashcan prevented you from escape and you widened your eyes in fear. The Charizard softened his snout as he withdrew his large hand and instead set his large orange palm down before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry i didn't mean to scare you, but i promise i don't want to hurt you.\", the giant softy spoke as he lightly waved his flamed tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a strange.....comfort come from the giant's voice. Slowly you stood up and walked to the large hand, taking note how it had five appendages and had the clawed tips. Climbing on the warmth of the soft scaley skin immediately combated the cold you been staying in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard slowly stood up bringing you past his jacket hugging his large muscles. The giant smiled as he looked directly onto your small form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you may be scared but i promise I'll help you. My name is Hu\u01d2y\u00e0n can you tell me yours?\", Hu\u01d2y\u00e0n asked kindly as he protectively curled his fingers a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm Claude.\", you shyly said as the muscular Charizard held you in his large palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHu\u00f5y\u00e0n ended up being your sort of guardian on that night. There weren't any other humans in the city so the clues of your lost memory layed elsewhere. Untill then you were offered a place at Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n's apartment, he even brought you a dollhouse to live in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese acts of kindness put a certain warmness in your heart. Like a budding of love you feel towards someone you care about, but you were afraid to act on these feelings. How could a strong Charizard such Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n love a tiny human like you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nLooking up from the shadow casting over you, a blush grew as you saw your giant guardian. Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n's waist was leveled with the nightstand your home rested on, you could briefly see the large bulge wrapped up in a pair of black boxers. Unlike a normal Charizard, Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n's stomach had a firm six pack of firm abs to accompany his large creme pecs. He had his biceped arms flexing as he placed his hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHu\u00f5y\u00e0n had an amused look as he spotted you before his hulking body. \"So your not planning on sleeping all day?\", your buff guardian boomed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at the joking tone as you rubbed your head. \"Yeah..just stayed up a bit late last night.\", you heard Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n chuckle before setting his warm palm before you. Quickly climbing on you were slowly brought up getting a good look at the buff physique of the Charizard's orange and creme body. You were soon held before the large pecs firm and bouncing with the Charizard's chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHu\u00f5y\u00e0n smiled as he started walking out of the bathroom his muscles lightly flexing with each step. \"Well I'm glad your well rested, i have some plans today and i was thinking you could tag along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and relaxed on the palm as you heard of Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n's errands for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard needed to....</span></div></div>",

But first...\" Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n sat you down near the edge of the nightstand next to his bed, where you discovered a veritable feast of breakfast that the monumental Charizard went through the trouble of making. \"Most important meal of the day~\" It was very small in a normal situation; half of a half of an apple slice, a little sliver of egg white, a strip of bacon as big as your leg, topped off with orange juice placed delicately in a thimble. You didn\u2019t care that it was the crumbs of his own earlier meal, you still felt humbled he went through the trouble of putting it all together for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n, sorry I left it sitting in the cold\u2026\u201d You rub the back of your neck in a bout of embarrassment, realizing that breakfast time was probably hours ago, and turn to face your Pokemon guardian, finding him in the middle of changing into his work-out clothes. \u201cGah...s-sorry, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d You promptly turn away to give Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n his privacy while warn blood rushed to your face, but the Charizard merely bobbed his head to the side in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Claude, we\u2019ve been over this.\u201d Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n frowned and walked over to the nightstand, his enormous bulge now in the open and brushing up against the edge where you stood. The air around you immediately grew warm and heavy with his natural scent, making your blush only intensify, something your guardian did not fail to notice. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid of me, whether I\u2019m in clothes or not. This is my natural state, I\u2019m not embarrassed if you want to stare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n, I didn\u2019t mean any disrespect\u2026\u201d You force yourself to turn your head and face the Charizard you were talking to, but the moment you did your eyes wandered to his member. It was more than twice your height in length and almost as wide in girth, even in its flaccid state. It emanated a potent musk that sent your senses in a whirl, it was just so overwhelming and invading. From what you could glimpse of his balls, they were easily large enough to smother ten of you at the least. \u201cIt\u2019s just very surreal, and it hammers in just how small I am...with how big it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHu\u00f5y\u00e0n couldn't help but smile a little at that last remark, his already massive member twitching to life and grow before your eyes ever so slightly. You forced your jaw not to go limp and fall like some fool. \u201cYou flatter me, Claude, it\u2019s nothing so special...though yes, to you it does seem rather sizeable.\u201d You could see just the tiniest bit of ego rise up in his eyes as he tried to brush off your unintentional compliment, but it was then drowned out with worry as the main situation got back to him. \u201cBut I want you to be comfortable with me, Claude. Even if I was five times bigger I wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to you, let anything scare you.\u201d You suddenly were confronted with a mental image of Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n a thousand feet tall, his genitalia big enough for you to be an insignificant speck on before you shook it out of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave your Charizard guardian a reassuring smile before turning to tend to your breakfast. Satisfied with your condition, for now, Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n went back to his changing, quickly putting on a white tank top that hugged his torso like a glove and a faded pair of sweatpants that had shrunk in the wash. You blushed as you bit into your apple slice, watching with a little less hesitation the Dragon Pokemon's tail swish against his globular, padded rear. It wasn't even ten o'clock, but he had managed to work up a thin film of sweat, the soft watery substance making his half-exposed backside glisten in the light from the window. He sat on his bed and pulled out his phone, waiting patiently for you to finish your breakfast. His bulge was even more pronounced now from when he was in his boxers, the snug wool hugging his shapely junk with no room for imagination. Soon, finally finished your meal, and Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n deposited you in his back pocket for safekeeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shimmied down to the bottom of the pocket lining as Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n began his jog to the gym. You felt strangely comfortable in your temporary 'prison', soft woolen material keeping you suspended next to the Charizard's intimidating but soft left cheek. Your only complaint would have to be the intoxicating musk that made you dizzy from the exposure. You could have limped up and hung over the rim of the lining to get a glimpse of the city, but you were afraid of falling out with how you were. Thankfully, the ride was short, and as Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n slowed his pace you let his palm grasp you carefully as it lifted you out into fresh air. You shivered in the morning's cold air, suddenly missing the warmth that Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n's rear end provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Herv\u00e9's 24-Hour Health Club' proclaimed the dingy neon sign in the alleyway. The same sign as had caught your eye a week ago when you had first woke up in this new world. Was this...the same alley that your Charizard found you in. He must have been coming back from a workout late at night. Although it was only a short walk to the entrance, the cold cut right through your thin T-shirt, while Hu\u00f5y\u00e0n was unphased to the cold as he reached the door. It squeaked loudly as the Charizard struggled to push it open, the rusted hinges resisting his efforts. His watch beeped 10 AM as the difficult door finally gave way and you and your guardian stumbled through it. Your eyes began to adjust to the bright light within the room. It was...</span></div></div>",

Traveling around the world, going to celebrity parties, dealing with drama and petty customers, or meeting a deadline. However your position was different then other human photographers, for one you specialized in taking photos of anthro Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed strange, you a tiny human taking photos of the giants that walked alongside humans. However, rather then trying to take normal photos you rather take below shots truly emphasizing the size and power of the anthros. This surprisingly was a hit, the worm eye view shots were an instant success with multiple magazines and model agencies wanting to hire you as a photographer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was overwhelming being the only human in a room of looming handsome studs. But you enjoyed your work and your career grew within the past year. Multiple people now talked of Akio the photographer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was another job, however this time you would be snapping pictures on a private beach. Spring was ending soon so summer photoshoots were underway. You were a bit nervous as today you would be taking pictures of the anthro Persian Klahan. This Persian was known for his sophisticated appearance to complement his rather buff body. Klahan was a popular model and taking his pictures is bound to be amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you must be Akio!\", a deep and friendly voice boomed at the entrance to the beach. You shook your head from the thoughts and stood up on the giant beach chair. Thumps in the sand were heard and a shadow soon was cast over you as you turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming over was Klahan, his toned legs were being hugged by a pair of skinny jeans which let up to a rounded bulge front. Above the waistband was a peak of the cream furred abs, the rest of the six pack was painted on by a black shirt with a neckline low enough to see the top of his large pecs. Resting on his hip were his large paws connected to his huge buff biceps being hugged by his sleeves. Finally on his thick neck was Klahan's handsome face, chin resting on his pecs as he looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up the shades covering his eyes, Klahan smiled a sexy grin as he saw you below. \"Hey there cameraman, ready to snap some shots?\", the Persian said in a playful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at the smooth voice coming from above, quickly you took out your camera and nodded. \"U-uh yeah! Thank you for the opportunity Mr.Klahan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlahan chuckled as he squatted down making his jeans pull around his large rear. His tail swished as he gave a sly look. \"Hey no need for formalities, you take some really good shots. Of course I'd let a cutie like you take my pics.\", Klahan winked as he stood back up to his looming height. \"Now then Akio, have any ideas for the photoshoot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming as your face heated up, an idea popped up. \"Well....</span></div></div>",

Gazing back up the 150 ft of the buff anthro, you gulped before asking. \"Um Klahan could you pose in the swimwear? I think it would go well with the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlahan hummed as he wiggled his fingers to the waistband of his jeans, the Persian smiled as he began to pull down his pants. \"Good thinking, these new designs sure got some spunk.\", swaying his hips as he pulled the jeans down had Klahan's bulge and rear lightly bouncing and the jeans went past his large thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blush returned, the black speedo with gold accents was rather snug on the Persian's large manhood. You could see a faint outline of the rod and large testicles, accompanied by a peak of darker fur just out of the speedo. Klahan sighed at the ocean breeze against his long toned legs as he rubbed his now exposed furred legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPivoting his buff body, Klahan's backside now faced you. Above his large rear being hugged by the speedo was his tail and vast and muscled back. Klahan chuckled as he bend over slightly and grabbed his shirt, the action of doing so had the glorious butt stretching against the speedo, the fabric running up between his cheeks leaving most of the creme rear uncovered. Pulling off the shirt had the biceps briefly flexing as they stretched the whole body, you almost whimpered at the end of the slight flex. Turning back around Klahan now had his nude pecs, abs, and pink nipples on display. Bouncing his huge pecs Klahan grinned as he lifted up an arm and flexed the muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selection ain't that bad this year, always appreciated a suit that shows off the goods.\", Klahan grinned as he put his hands on his hips and swayed his hips to move his round features around. The buff anthro then bounced his pecs once more before looking at you from above the muscles. \"Now then Akio, where shall we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to stare at the huge muscles for long, you cleared your throat. \"Well i usually start out by taking photos between the feet.\", Klahan nodded and slowly reached down and laid a paw down, you were surprised but seeing Klahan kindly smiling you felt the nervousness vanish and climbed onto the soft paw. The Persian then squatted down, making his speedo ride furthur up his butt before gently placing you on the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in between the large feet of Klahan you truly were in a different perspective as he stretched into the sky. His broad shoulders along with his whole buff torso blocked the sun but gave a nice glowing effect. Klahan then placed his arms behind his head getting his biceps to pulse additionally he began to bounce his pecs more sly before giving a sexy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am i photo ready?\", Klahan playfully asked. You nodded and brought up your camera. You took multiple high quality shots each showing the pecs in a different position, with Klahan's face going from a sexy grin to a close eyed relaxed look. After you nodded signalling for a new pose, Klahan squatted down and placed his paws on his toned thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward, you took photos of the sky full of furred pecs and abs. Klahan's beautiful smile was relaxing against his broad shoulder as he made perfect shot after shot. A good ten minutes past with you taking pictures of the partially nude Persian flexing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more shots.....</span></div></div>",

It's said that experiments where conducted in a laboratory using the cells of the legendary Pokemon Mew. The results of the experiment were successful...for a time, the lifeform known as Mewtwo was stated to have anger that was ginormous. The fabled area where the experiments were conducted is bare with the faintest trace of buildings and what looks to be large foot shaped craters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were one of the madlads who decided to see if this urban legend was true. Well you were a nomad of sorts, traveling around and enjoying the new regions and pokemon. The unknown was just something that intrigued you, you why not your next endeavor be finding out if the tale of the giant Mewtwo is real?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up the large mountains was pleasant as is, feeling the cold air send a strange noise around the large structures. The feeling of isolation was strong though. Other climbers didn't go as deep into the mountains as you were and the last Zubat you encountered was around an hour ago. Being alone was a chilling experience and fueled your desire to meet someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about that feeling, being alone. Mewtwo was a creation with no others like it. Living out in these mountains in solitude with no other companionship can't be nice. As strange as it sounded, you thought if you could find Mewtwo maybe you could befriend the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you staked your axe into the mountain you gasped as the rock you stepped on crumpled away! You looked down in terror as you only had your pickaxe keeping you from the vast canyon bottem below. The axe began to slowly slip out from the mountain, you felt dread fill you as soon the axe dislodged and you felt yourself falling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-someone help!\", you desperately screamed out as you fell to your doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your free falling was paused and replaced with a weightless feeling. A strange blue light surrounded you as you floating in the air. Relief and shock filled you as your doomful descend was halted. Your questioning thoughts were pulled as a shaking series of booms resounded throughout the canyon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom around the mountain at the end of the canyon a large figure emerged. You widened your eyes at the giant white and purple Pokemon shaking the ground beneath his feet. His body was ripped like that of a athlete with his large pecs and eight pack abs, his thighs were thick along with his buff arms. You blushed as you saw the only clothing on the giant was a tight black speedo wrapped around his round bulge. This giant...must be Mewtwo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"A human? No one has every traveled out this far.\"</i>, a deep voice spoke within your head as Mewtwo walked closer. The buff Pokemon crossed his large arms over his firm chest as you were brought up to his purple eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked into the large eyes, you saw Mewtwo...</span></div></div>",

The reason was because you had just got done going to a bodybuilding contest that the anthro Pokemon of all sizes took part in. Though to be honest you wre more so there to cheer on one who you had become a fan of ever since he had gotten into the competition. That being the 200 foot tall heavily muscled Houndoom Shadow. Though to be fair you more so became a fan of his not only because of his amazing body and how he carried himself while on stage. But whenever you saw him do interviews or sign autographs from videos people had put online. The massive dark and fire type dog seemed pretty down to earth and pretty fun to be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised you to be honest considering he hadn't just won a lot of competitions in the Johto region, but he had also won a lot of co-regional competitions as well. However, you quickly stopped your thoughts on the past as you let out a heavy sigh and told yourself, \"Come Justin, there's no way you'd end up meeting a famous anthro Pokemon like him....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself trailing however when you passed by a nearby window as you let out a gasp of surprise. The reason for this was because standing inside of the clothing store was none other Shadow himself. And by the looks of it he was currently walking around in something to see how it fit him. This caused you to blush as you noticed that he was wearing a very tight fitting.....</span></div></div>",

You gave a greeting to everyone you passed both human and giant Pokemon anthro, getting a friendly reply in return. Living in a city of gigantic pokemon who could easily stomp normal sized structures flat was definitely a scary thought but in the Johto region more living areas have been constructed for the coexistence of both species. It was a little strange getting use to the casual appearance of these giants but you settled in well to your new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople always called you hyper and a optimist for your happy demeanor and urge to never give up. You pulled yourself together after moving to the city and now could live your life here no problem. Looking into different hobbies also helped you stay upbeat, since arriving here you began to get into working out and watching other's methods of muscle work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA favorite source of Inspiration was the bodybuilding competitions often held at the gym and on the sports channel. Seeing the giant Pokemon lifting weights or flexing their huge muscular physiques. One in particular was the Umbreon Lune, standing at a height of 150 feet tall. The black furred anthro had toned legs leading to his large thighs and round package along with his firm butt usually wrapped in a red speedo. His six abs were a trail leading to his huge pecs that flexed alongside his large biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he had a serious and dark look most of the time, Lune was shown to be friendly to many people. He was known for his friendship to Shadow a fellow bodybuilder and work out buddy. Also he was one of the most accepting anthros to humans often giving portion of his prize money to the development of human faculties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a recap of Lune's latest victory gave you an urge to work out so you were on your way to the gym now. Walking in front of a building were two entrances, the large door for Pokemon and the doll sized door for humans. However you looked confused as the door was had a closed sign and was boarded up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Alex.\", the manager of the human gym said walking around from the back. You jogged up and smiled. \"Good morning Sir! What's going on i thought the gym was open today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manger rubbed his head. \"Geez I'm sorry kid i just sent out the email to all members, the gym is under renovation. One of the big guys accidentally tripped over and broke a good number of equipment. Gonna need to buy new work out tools not to mention make a railing to block the two gyms. I'll call you when we're done k?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded still smiling, after a pat on the back, the manager walked off and your smile dropped. The gym you enjoyed visiting was closed and for who knows how long? There was an other option, Humans could go in the Pokemon gym and work out however most stayed away due to the risks they faced. Still gotta be optimistic, taking a breath you smiled and jogged up to the giant door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell obstacle one, the door wasn't budging no matter how hard you pulled. You definitely needed to work out, there was little to none muscle working in your favor now. Letting out a tired breath you blinked as suddenly a large shadow covered you and the ground thoomed similar to when a anthro walks by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh are you having trouble getting in little one?\", a deep and sincere voice boomed from above. Looking behind you was a large pair of black foot paws, above them were long toned legs dressed in a pair of jeans. You looked in awe as looming high above was Lune the Umbreon! The muscular torso of the Pokemon was being hugged by a maroon muscle shirt letting his firm abs be visible. The kind crimson eyes of the Umbreon were looking over his huge pecs at your speck like body before his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in wonder as your Inspiration was looming before you his buff body like a moutain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name was Akira, previously you had lived a calm peaceful life in the north of Johto. However, it was all soon tarnished due to your \"gift\". Since you could remember, the voices of Pokemon spoke to you like a human's and you in turn to them. This gift allowed you to understand a Pokemon's cries and seem to come from Arceus itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving in Ecruteak City your family was supportive of you and said that the gift was a blessing. Many asked for your help in finding out what pain their Pokemon was in or what they wished. You even would occasionally do shows with the Kimono Girls and perform in sync dance with pokemon as you could directly talk and learn with them. Life was peaceful as you had these creative opportunities and would spend your free time practicing or praying at the bell and burned tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill this gift led to strive in your life as at the age of 20 you and your family were nearly kidnapped by Team Rocket. Most likely to use your gift and have your family as leverage. Thankfully the champion Lance had saved you all in time, still the fear of this happening again was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided it was best to leave home, so that you wouldn't risk involving your family if another attempt was made. Thus began a life in the woods...<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nIt was a pleasant evening, the sun began to set as the pidgey returned to the forest trees. You sighed as you took a final bite of the Oran berry a Buneary had generously offered you. It was quiet no other human in sight for miles, it had been three months since you left Ecruteak City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to think of something to combat this lonely feeling. The tale of the three legendary beasts came to mind, three Pokemon resurrected by Ho-oh. It's said not only were they more powerful but also more human like. They stood on two feet and had muscles larger then a warrior's, and said to loom higher than Mt.Mortar before vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of your thoughts a sudden shake hit the ground, you blinked as the shakes created thooms and rattled the trees. Looking up, the sky had suddenly become cloudy as bolts of lightning danced across them. Slowly getting up from another thoom you hesitantly began to walk in the direction of the...footstep like shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the trees you came to the entrance of the clearing, what greeted you was a large yellow foot like paw. Gazing up in shock you saw a massive furry figure looming into the sky. A toned pair of legs with black marks were holding a beastly giant, his white furred front had a wall of eight pack abs. Above that was a pair of huge round pecs to go along with the ball sized biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head on top revealed that the giant was in fact the legendary beast Raikou. Like the myth he was anthropomorphic and jacked with muscles bigger then any man could dream. The only clothing was a dark purple speedo to hold his large manhood, balls, and what appeared to be a thick round butt from the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seemingly 200 ft tall Pokemon had lightning flash around him as if to show his power. You gasped as the giant suddenly turned his head down at your speck like for before his paw. A deep hum rang out as Raikou crossed his large muscular arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human? My my it seems I've been caught.\", the giant chuckled in a smooth teasing way as he stood in all his buff glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

Bracing yourself against the strong winter wind that blew down its banks. Other humans waddled past, bundled up In jackets and scarves. A few made small greetings or nods, but most were just trying to get home before the imminent storm that was brewing began. For humans in this part of the world, blizzards and rain were lethal to get caught up in, as infrastructure in this city was designed more for the titans that inhabited it. A shadow passed over and a relaxed Typhlosion walked by your spot on the bridge, he himself crossing the river, which was more of a creek for his 200 foot form, he was already walking away and fading from sight and you had hardly made it halfway across the bridge. Most of the beings here averaged about 200 feet, fluctuating between 150-250 on average with some exceptions being taller, like legendaries....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were coming up on a hole in the human part of the bridge caused by a fight between anthros the other day when suddenly a cry from behind you yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYo it\u2019s freakin\u2019 Lugia!\u201d People flocked to the railing even though it wasn\u2019t necessary to observe the Titan. His smooth white hide glistened even the overcast day, with the blue keratinous brow ridges accentuating his sleek design. He wore a grey jacket with an undershirt and dark grey sweatpants. He looked ahead, unperturbed by the flicks of humans Cat calling and trying to be acknowledged by the great legendary guardian of the seas. His biceps bulged under the tight jacket material and he huffed a steamy breath from his nostrils, ignoring the comments from people wanting to do all kind of things with him. You just stared in awe behind the crowd, and as you did his eyes drifted lazily down from its forward gaze as he continued to pass by. The ocean blue eyes locked onto you and your entire body filled with warmth, you never got much attention from any anthro, yet here was an essential god of this world acknowledging you. The corners of his beaked draconian face curved into some semblance of a smile. And people began their roar of cries again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe looked at me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c No me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The crowd began pushing and shoving, trying to prove they are in fact the one who earned a second of the Guardians attention. The brawl made its way to you when someone shoved a man a bit larger than you into you and sent you tumbling backwards... right where that hole in the bridge was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A gasp is all you let out as you plummet to the river some 500 feet below. The impact alone was going to kill you. You close your eyes and count yourself lucky though, your insignificant self had been noted by one of the most powerful creatures on this planet. Something warm wrapped around you and you opened your eyes to  be in a room of white, with ridges and grooves galor. Wind still whistled out side and tiny holes told you that you were still falling. A horrible crash of water filled your ears and water seeped in between what you only could guess to be fingers. The water flowed over you and a current formed within the hands, you quickly lost consciousness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your senses came back slowly, first your body letting you know that you were sore everywhere. You groaned and sat up, finding yourself wrapped in some fine furred blanket. A roaring fire sat in an enormous fireplace nearby, warming the monolithic room you were in. It was decorated with statues and books lining shelves. A shadow passed by you and you almost passed back out as Lugia rounded a sister chair to the one you were in the seat of. He threw what looked like his original attire over a cloth rack and turned it to the fire, leaving him standing in just red boxer briefs. His body was everything that legends were made of. His chest down into his boxed briefs was blue, while the rest of him was almost reflective white, it glowing orangish yellow in the firelight. His chest swelled with powerful pectorals and his belly was riveted with a six pack that contorted and looked good from any angle. His arms bulged as he hung the clothes, and his thighs flexed and twitched, wanting to unleash their strength again like they did probably with him hopping off the bridge. His tail lashed lazily around, coming out of his lower back above a very round butt, one cheek easily the size of your own home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His eye drifted to you and gave you that feeling again when you were on the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re awake, good, and how do we feel.\u201d His voice was calm and musical, and under it lay eons of wisdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm fine I think, thank you, the fact that you took time out of your busy schedule to save someone like me-\u201c before you could finished he got an annoyed expression and closed his eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dPlease, please, don\u2019t be like that. I saved you because it\u2019s what I do, not because I expect praise or worship.

The reason for this was because you about to visit your friend Fang who was a heavily muscled Mightyena. He worked at this gym as a aerobics instructor. Though whenever he was done teaching various water exercises for the day the heavily muscled dark type canine always did a very long workout to keep his own body in the sahpe that it was in. Though thinking of this made you remember how the two of you became friends in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened when you about 10 and he was a Poochyena. In fact the two of you met back in grade school and it all started when you sat down at the table he was sitting at since it seemed like no one else was going to sit with him. Though there a few expects here and there, but other then a few other anthro Pokemon, you noticed that no humans seemed insterested in sitting next to him. So one day at lunch you decided to go over to his table and sit next to him. And even though the giant dog was mostly quiet and didn't say much, you could tell that he was happy that a human finally came up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough your friendship did come with it issues as after this happened you did get picked on from time to time. However, whenever that happened FAng would be there to stick up for you. In fact he kept this up not only through school, but also still a bit every and now again even though you were both adults. Though it didn't really bother you since you couldn't blame him with the vast size difference that some anthros had compared to humans or even among other anthros. This is also made you come to conclusion as to why he started to workout so often after he had evolved into a Mightyena. Again though you had no issues with it since it was his life after all and he could live it however he choice to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you broke free from your memories once you had entered the gym. And once you had entered the pool area to say hi to your 200 foot dark type friend you saw.......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Long ago in the Kalos region there was a big and terrible war. Human against human, anthro against human, it was a war that brought nothing but destruction and pain. After a human king lost his beloved Pokemon he used a powerful machine to try and bring them back. He succeeded, but only after sacrificing many Pokemon to fuel this destructive device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe war had ended but conflict didn't seem to cease. Humans and giant anthro Pokemon were separated from each other after coexisting seem to only more fighting. Humans saw the anthros as destructive beasts and the anthros saw the humans as selfish little creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the present peace seem to come, only after humans were forced out of the cities just in a petty attempt to quelch the tensions. In a forest was a anthro separated from this ethical drama. A Pangoro named Tanjiro spent his days as a bamboo cutter, selling the stocks to small businesses and even teaching wandering youths some skill in the fighting arts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanjiro's family had held not favorable views of humans, they saw them as creatures that should stay below them like insects. The Pangoro refused to accept these beliefs and he went into self exile, wanting to carve out his own path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could have been a noble swordsman in his family's clan, but he'd sooner bite his tongue then treat a human as lesser than him. It had been 20 years now he was in his thirties, despite a few lines on his face Tanjiro was still attractive. He had very buff biceps from his daily training and hauling stacks of bamboo. He wore a loose white kimeno top that let his huge white furred pecs mostly hang out, dark blue hakama pants that wrapped around his thick thighs and toned calves. Unlike a normal Pangoro his stomach was that of a six pack, ripped with muscle from his numerous sit ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was a peaceful life, Tanjiro couldn't help but desire company. While he enjoyed teaching his skills to others, they were merely his students. Having a close bond to share with someone in love would be all he could ask for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you walked into the forest, the trees towering higher then a skyscraper. It was hitting you just how rash this decision might have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name was Kou, a 25 year old human from a small village. Before you were born, your parents moved to the village after the anthros expelled them and the human populace from their city. Your family while loving, struggled to maintain their farming and food. Wanting them  to be happy and healthy you decided to leave to not have them stuggle preparing your food with the minimal money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis of course meant you living on the road as you had no set path in mind. It went from a trip on the road to a dangerous journey, you had crossed into anthro Pokemon territory and now needed to find a way out. If you were found trespassing you very well could be arrested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, being in the countryside was slightly reassuring, the anthros here are notably more calm and wishing for coexistence with humans. But it was still a dangerous territory so you trekked on, soon entering a large bamboo forest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the atmosphere was definitely peaceful, the air was clear and carried the wind ruffling the leaves. It helped calm you a little taking in the tranquil environment you never appreciated. You knew these woods weren't empty however, there had been signs for a bamboo shop up and occasionally spare carts next to gatherings of plants. While it was risky you should find this bamboo seller, even if he was an anthro you needed directions or something. You just hoped he didn't hate humans....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking down the path directed by the signs, you soon found a cozy looking Minka sitting in the clearing made. You looked in awe as you walked up, having never seen such a house of this design. Stopping in front of the large sliding door, you began to wonder how you would be able knock loud enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the ground thumped as it did whenever a giant pokemon walked and the door slid open, a shadow casting over. Looking up, you found yourself in awe as past a pair of loose pants was a towering figure. His creme furred abs led up to the large pecs that partially covered the face of an anthro Pangoro. The Pokemon sighed as the fresh air hit his large muscular body, making it instinctively flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon\u2026.</span></div></div>",

Looking out into the distance among the bright ocean a large and more...titanus island stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like everything is still a huge surprise, and it just happened last week. Well you guess it all started when you moved to Alola ten years ago. It certainly was exciting to live in a new area, filled with not only new Pokemon but anthro ones as well! All working alongside humans and living in harmony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started on your journey here by befriending a Litten named Ahi. He was a bit of a hothead and originally against teaming up with you, wanting to complete the island trials on his own. But over the course of your journey the two of you grew closer and developed a strong bond of friendship. Now with the both of you at 20 years old Ahi was a Incineroar and definitely trained his body in terms of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your journey you and Ahi enjoyed a calm yet exciting life together. Most days you'd relax in the beach while the fire cat worked out. You blushed as you remember his huge pecs and biceps flexing and his ripped body covered only by the speedos he'd enjoyed wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever last year a strange phenomenon began happening with the anthro Pokemon of Alola. The Z crystals given to anthro partners began to react differently then normal, the result was Pokemon growing to a huge height of 200 ft. While the phenomenon shocked the residents of the Alola region, the Aether foundation quickly gave assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new artificial island was constructed, a place where the giants could comfortably live without fear of accidentally smashing any buildings. Of course the island was opened for the humans to visit their partners anytime. The island was luckily completely by the time Ahi ended up going through his growth phase. You had been napping on the beach when suddenly the ground shook and you were greeted by the sight of Ahi now looming into the sky like a mountain of red and black furred muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki sweetie your visiting Ahi today right? You should start heading down to the marina!\", your mom called from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I'll be out in a minute!\", you called out checking your phone. Ahi had messaged you asking to hang out, which you eagerly agreed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giants were given many things they would have at normal size such as clothes, phones, etc. It truly normalized this phenomenon, though it was a bit sad you couldn't spend the days like you used to. You and Ahi sleeping in one bed, him wrapping his buff arms around you while you rested your head on his grey pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook off a blush as you went inside from the side patio. Saying goodbye to your mom and Meowth, you started jogging to Hau'oli City to reach the marina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as the wind blasted you, giving the fresh sea breeze as the boat sailed towards the massive island. Excitement filled you as Ahi messaged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seems to...</span></div></div>",

Thankfully the snow fall hadn't turned into a blizzard of any sort. But it centered didn't change the fact that you were getting colder by the minute and you still had a quite a ways to go before you got to your cabin that you were staying at. But with how things were going you weren't sure how further you were going to get before exhaustion took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused you to try nad bundle yourself up as best as you could while you thought out lodu to yourself, \"Darn, if this snow keeps up I don't think I'll be able to make back to the cabin. If I could only find a cave to stay in funtil this snow stopped falling. That certainly be better then nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but do you need some help young man?\" A deep and concerned voice asked, before you saw the snow come to a stop which caused you to stop dead in your tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was because walking towards you was a 150 foot tall anthro Alolan Ninetales who was wearing a light blue robe of some kind. However, along with this you could easily see his heavily muscled body underneath the robe. You then found yourself blushing once the anthro Pokemon was only a little away from you. You then saw him set down a paw in front of it. And when you looked up at his face you saw a soft and comforting smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you carefully got onto his palm and instantly felt yourself getting warmer. You were then brought up to the light blue furred fox's massive pecs while he said, \"So now please allow me to take you back to where your staying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure, thank you very much.\" You replied, before the Ninetales began to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while he did this he told you, \"You're welcome. And my name is K\u014dri. It's very nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes it's nice to meet you, K\u014dri.

Though this didn't last long as soon found yourself in the open palm of the anthro police officer. Once that happened you then realized that you in the open plam of a heavily msucled anthro Bolthund.

Are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you try to get your bearings together, you look up to see a Cinderace bending down over you with a concerned look on his face  He wore a small white jersey that put his sizable pecs on display as well as a pair of red gym shorts  Overall, you could tell the pokemon worked out often, especially with his toned thighs and wide hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to get distracted by the Cinderace\u2019s buff body, you eventually get out an answer to his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah I\u2019m fine, it just missed me so it could\u2019ve been way worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and checked your clothes for any tears as the cinderace let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good, I feel really bad though. I gotta make it up to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, you don\u2019t have to-\u201c<br>\r\nBefore you can get your reply out, you find yourself wrapped in the soft but firm embrace of the bunny\u2019s paw as he lifts you up closer to his face, leaving you sitting in his palm, 50 feet in the air. You try to stay calm as the hulking giant looks you over. From this close, you could easily see the sweat that permeated through his whole body as well as his chiseled pecs in more detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it! The cinderace yelled out, his face lit up.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be your workout partner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised by the sudden offer but looking at his body...<br>\r\n\u201cYou do seem like you know what you\u2019re doing...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hotheaded Cinderace smiled proudly, his cheery grin causing you to blush a bit at how cute it is<br>\r\n\u201cWell I am a personal trainer after all! The name\u2019s Eli, by the way, nice to meet you!\u201d<br>\r\nEli extended a furry finger for you to shake, which you did hesitantly, still a bit shaken up by this quick turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, workout partner! What should we start with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From music to political positions, young adults could pursue their careers much easier. Even more it was opened to both humans and macro anthros, as chairman Rose had seen it as important that the two beings coexist peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name was Chiaki, a 19 year old boy who recently started your lessons at Cheren. You were learning on using your voice as you wished to become a singer. Growing up in the countryside was very different from the city where the academy was, not only was it more busy but you had never been this close the giant anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne in particular had caught your interest, he was a Rillaboom named Matt, your upperclassmen at 25. He was in the music department and played very loud yet amazing drums. Matt also was super friendly to everyone both Pokemon and Humans, you had actually developed a crush on him day 1 after he helped you find your dorm. You still remember sitting in his warm palm and being held to his large buff chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you were too shy to confess your feelings. Not only were you scared of holding Matt back by distracting him but also, you were insecure he wouldn't feel the same since you're a human, small enough to fit like a pea in his palm.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nRight now it was gym class, as every course regardless of its lessons needed one P.E class. Humans typically stayed in the left side of the locker room while anthros took the other. There are however many cases of macros accidentally taking humans by stepping on them or holding them in their clothes. Luckily humans are surprisingly durable to macros somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat on the giant bench changing, you couldn't help but glance over to Matt who stood across at his locker changing. You blushed as he changed his shirt exposing the black furred abs which had cream fur on the sides of his midsection which went up and bloomed over his pecs that had being squeezed in the article of clothing. Sliding down his gymshorts showed his large thighs and round bulge being squeezed by his black boxers. Matt hummed as he casually flexed his large biceps making the muscles flex. Turning to look into his locker not only but his toned back on display but also his large and firm looking butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and shook your head, trying to cool off. Of course you knew of Matt's muscular physique, whenever he said hi to you in the hallway from his looming height you saw his clothes painted on his buff body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark shadow soon casted over you, looking up you widened your eyes as....</span></div></div>",

For you, love brought you and your boyfriend together despite the obvious differences. You were a scholarly type of person who wanted to become a teacher after college, your boyfriend was the lead guitarist in a band and paved a career of playing rock music. Your body was thin and lean while your boyfriend was nothing short of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest difference however was that you were a human and your boyfriend was a giant anthro Toxtricity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few years ago the dynamax phenomenon began to take a strange turn. Anthro pokemon began to increase in size up to 200 ft tall, still innovation came quick and new accommodations were made for the permanent giants. It all became another part of Galar's culture, seeing giant anthros walking around was now a norm.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nYou smiled as you button up your shirt, looking quite presentable in the white shirt and brown trousers. Today was special as you had a train scheduled for Wyndon to see your boyfriend Alfie. After a summer of working you finally were now finished and could focus on school and life. Immediately you felt longing to be with Alfie after only calls for the past two months, both of you were preoccupied with work and finally had the chance to spend time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gathering the last of your supplies you set off to the train station. As you sat in the train car and made your way to Wyndon, you made to sure to admire the scenery and giants casually stomping alongside the train. Some even smiled and waved as the train past. Soon you arrived in Wyndon and happily trodded to the home of Alfie deep in the now even bigger city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked down the street, waving to cyclist and giant alike excitement began to fill your stomach as you remembered your last moment with your Toxtricity boyfriend. He gave you a tender kiss and said he would always wait for you, Arceus you were blessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon walking up to a familiar apartment with an open garage, you began to hear rock music softly blasting from inside. Standing at the looming garage entrance you soon saw the familiar giant figure of your boyfriend. Alfie was facing away as he polished his guitar, this gave of a full display of his large backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp from his yellow soled feet, Alfie's toned legs and firm thighs were hugged by a pair of grey jeans. The large firm butt with yellow slightly peaking out of the crack was briefly shown as the top stuck out of his pants. Alfie's back was toned and broadened by his shoulders, the scaly purple arms flexed their huge biceps unintentionally as he moved them to clean the guitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um hey Alfie!\", you called out hoping he would hear you. Luckily he appeared to as his head perked up and he turned around, showing his yellow underbelly which included his huge pecs and six packs being squeezed by his black tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfie's eyes lit up and he grinned as he spotted you. \"Arthur! It's been too long baby!\", walking over Alfie shook the ground beneath his large feet as he soon towered his buff body into the sky before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down, Alfie gently scooped you ip into his warm palm. You of course had no problem, you held trust with Alfie and knew he'd never hurt you. Bringing you up to his pecs, Alfie then walked over to a couch he had set up in his music studio (aka the garage). Laying down, the Toxtricity set you on his warm right pec before putting his buff arms behind his head. Alfie smiled at you as he longed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So babe you doing good, getting closer to the dream of yours?\", you smiled and laid down on the firm and warm clothed pec. \"I guess, all that's left is to take my final courses and I'll get my degree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfie grinned toothily as he reached down and rubbed your head using one of his five fingers. \"Ah great work, you'll be a teach in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as you thanked the buff lizard Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon....</span></div></div>",

So with that said you are a human (insert name here) who lives in a world with giant anthro and normal Pokemon. And since the giant male anthro Pokemon are heavily muscled hunks, who know you might be able to get one of them to be interested in you and not only start a relationship, but something more. Anyway here are the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. This story only has M/M interactions. So any Pokemon that are more so viewed as females (this goes for some of the legendary Pokemon as well) should not be interacted with at all. But of course this does not mean that the female anthro Pokemon aren't there. They just aren't the main focus and should only be mentioned if need be. The same is applied for both genders of normal Pokemon as well. Also only final forms are allowed in this story. (Pikachu is excluded from that rule because well he is the mascot of Pokemon after all) And also not all Pokemon will be anthros since certain ones just wouldn't make any sense as anthros if I'm being honest. (like steel types, and other certain Pokemon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. You can find an odd berry that can cause the male anthro Pokemon to grow even bigger then he might already be. (optional)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No gore, death, or toilet stuff at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. If you have a giant anthro Pokemon grow the max size is 10,000 feet. Unless it's one of the Legendary Pokemon since they are more powerful then the other ones they can grow up to 20,000 feet. (again optional)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Please use proper grammar and spacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Have fun.</td>",
