As he got out, he saw his friends Adrian, Moses and Austin heading into the Hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Wait you guys!\" Justin said as he ran to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"So, do you guys know what room your in?\"  Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Nope... Mr. Dimarco said he would tell us when everyone was in the Hotel lobby,\" Adrian said, trying to sound excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As they walked in the Hotel, they saw Mr. Dimarco telling each student what room they were in. Justin was hoping he was in the same room as his friends, because the last time his class came to a hotel like this, he got stuck in a room by himself. Mr. Dimarco then walked towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Okay, well you guys are the last four people who don't have a room yet, so... I guess you guys will have to be roommates. Take your bags to your room and start unpacking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes! Now we can all watch that movie Moses bought! You did bring it, right?\" Justin said hoping that Moses didn't forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Obviously. It is the scariest movie ever! Why would I forget it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Thank God, I thought we'd be stuck doing nothing,\"Austin said in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Adrian was getting tired of waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"We'll watch it after we unpack, if we have time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  All four boys began walking up stairs, soon making it to their room. Little did they know, though, there had been a gas leak in their room the other day, that would have some weird affects on certain people.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

In the room, there were two dressers: Moses and Austin shared one and Justin and Adtrian shared the other. As they unpacked, Austin, Arian, and Moses felt a weird, yet exciting feeling. When they had finished unpacking, the three boys felt their pants were a little tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what's up with these pants?\" Moses asked, unzipping his jeans. Austin and Adrian did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was probably your washer, Adrian,\" Austin chuckled. The previous night, the four boys spent the night at Adrians house and Moses, Austin and Adrian washed and dried their clothes. Justin has already cleaned his clothes before he went to his friends house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or Maybe it was because you suck at video games\" Adrian told Moses. All four teens played video games for hours the night before and in every one, Moses could never come in first. The other boys teased him, saying it was because of his big hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys changed into their sweatpants and Justin got the dvd player ready, putting in the latest Friday the 13th movie.  But the others were still feeling odd, almost as if they were growing, though, they didn't believe it.</span></div></div>",

It's just.  A.  Movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that!\"  Adrian insisted, pushing himself up jerkily and sputtering.  \"Pleh.  I taste cheap motel soap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you must <i>hate</i> crappy soap, huh, Adrian?\" Austin asked sarcastically as he chucked some popcorn at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault!\"  Adrian groused, snagging one of the kernels out of the air and shoving it vindictively into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their clothes shrank in <i>your</i> washer.\"  Justing pointed out over the terrified screams of some teenage girls.  \"Kinda makes it your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we gonna wear tomorrow, huh?\"  Moses asked gloomily.  \"We'll have to go around in these sweatpants all weekend or wear tiny clothes.  The whole class'll laugh at us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Adrien and Austin can probably wear your clothes now, Moses.\"  Justin mused.  \"Good thing you're so overgrown, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses immediately gave Justin a super-noogie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me then?\"  The demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack!  Stoppit!  I dunno, try shrinking or something?\"  His victim spat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off, you're blocking the screen!\"  Adrian griped, trying to get a better look at the practically-naked camp girls before they got all dismembered and gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin rolled his eyes and hopped off the bed to grab a soda.  Picking up a can, he frowned at how warm it felt in his hand; he shouldn't have kept it in the sunny part of his bus seat on the trip up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting some ice.\"  He announced to his friends.  Since they were either staring at the screen or beating each other up, nobody answered.  Shrugging, he sat back on the bed and tugged on his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he tugged some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyebrows drawn together in confusion, Austin checked to make sure he hadn't grabbed Adrian's shoes by mistake; they bought the same style.  They were his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck happened to my shoes?\"  He exclaimed, yanking as hard as he could; his heels just <i>refused</i> to go down into the shoes, and it felt like someone was making a fist around his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame me!\"  Adrian called out from the bed.  \"I didn't wash our <i>shoes</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say you did!\"  Austin snapped, tossing them down in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you pick up the right ones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mine won't fit either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine are alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four boys gathered around the mysteriously shrinking footwear, horror movie forgotten.  They had no idea that it wasn't the clothes that had changed, it was them; or at least, three of them.  They had no idea of the odd chemical that had contaminated Adrian's laundry soap.  Nor did they know about the mysterious gas that had leaked into their hotel room, and lingered in the air still.  They had no idea that the two substances, when combined in their bloodstreams, were changing into something new, something strange, and that they were changing along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they'd known these things they would understand why their clothes were so tight.  They would know why everything seemed...off...like they were standing on a low step, why everything looked the tiniest bit smaller, a difference so minor they weren't even really aware of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would also wonder if changing into their sweatpants was such a good idea.  For even now, even more of the strange detergent chemical was sweating out of the new clothes and into their blood...</span></div></div>",

The others were trying to pay attention, but found their shirts were getting tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, seriously,\" Moses leaned over to the other bed and whispered in Adrians ear, \"What is up with your washer and dryer? I feel like my shirt is a size too small\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I don't know. I just used this new detergent my dad bought. It hadn't been opened and there wasn't any left after using it on our clothes,\" He said, chuckling at his next comment, \"Supposedly, when you wear the clothes, the detergent goes from the clothes to you, making you 'smell nice', or at least, that's what the bottle says\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses chuckled too, but couldn't shake the feeling that something was going on. He looked at Austin next to him and saw he was tugging on his shirt a little bit too. But when he saw Justin, his friend was watching the movie, not noticing anything. Moses would have just left it alone, except fo rthe fact that Adrian, even sitting, Adrian looked taller than Justin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued tugging on his shirt, which was getting tighter, Moses decided to....</span></div></div>",

Luckily, it wasn't as hard as he thought, though he did have to watch how fast he pulled his arms out of his sleeves. At first, he thought he would feel awkward, but soon, Adrian and Aistin were doing it as well. Justin didn't seem to notice and if he did, he didn't seem to pay any attention to his friends. But the three boys stared at each other with a look of awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses motioned to Adrian to look at Justin and the once shorter boy looked at his friend. But when Adrian looked next to him, he found he had to look down a little to see his friend. His eyes widened and looked back to Moses, who was also shocked, as was Austin. Finally, Moses decided to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Justin?\" Justin looked towards Moses, but instead of seeing him, he saw a shirtless Adrian next to him who was taller than usual. Justin let out a gasp and jumped off of the bed. He was freaked out seeing his three friends taller than they usually were and all three towering over him as they stood up. Adrian paused the movie as they made their way towards Justin, whose eyes were darting from each boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, calm down,\" Austin said quietly, \"Seriously, we are just as freaked out as you are\". The three boys realized their sweatpants were getting a little tighter as well. They figured they were a little over seven feet tall.</span></div></div>",

It couldn't get any worse, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf coutse, at the very second he thought that, it did. Justin's friends seemed dizzy, like they were about to collapse. Swaying back and forth, they seemed to want to vomit. They realized they were getting taller. First, they grew by mere millimetres. Then they started growing by centimetres. Their entire bodies looked like they were being stretched like putty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin, I think it's safe to panic now\", Austin said half-jokingly. Of course, Justin took this literally and started hyper-ventilating. By the time, their growth was done, Justin's friends were well over 12 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had to crouch to avoid the ceiling. However, at that moment something else changed too.

Justin sat inbetween Adrian and Moses, still hyperventilating, mainly from the fact that when he looked left or right, all he could see was their feet. Their socks had already ripped and so had all their clothing, and they were still growing. He was too short now to see over their legs when sitting. As a joke, Moses and Adrian moved closer together so that Justin was trapped inbetween their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops! Sorry!\" Moses said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too small. I couldn't see you there\"  Adrian added as they all laughed. Soon, the 3 boys heads hit the ceiling, even while sitting and stared to pressed through it. The floor even started to sag in a little, which made Justin feel even smaller. Justin then couldn't take it anymore. He ran outside and pulled the fire alarm. Everyone ran outside of the building. 5 minutes later, the 3 boys decided to stand up, destroying the hotel in the process. First their head popped out of the roof, then their arms broke through the sides. Then the rest just fell. Now each one was 70 feet tall, and still growing. Moses saw the bus they had come in. He put his foot on it, which was longer than the bus the crushed it. They all walked over to the group of school kids standing there, crushing every car in the parking lot. All of them ran and scattered about except for Justin who looked up and stared. They all made a circle around him and looked down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this bug who stands before us?\" Adrian asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it's Justin!\" Moses says as he takes his toe and knocks him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so puny!\" Austin laughed. \"My foot is longer than you are!\" Then they all lifted their feet over him. Justin just looked up in shock. \"Looks like someone's too small to be our friend...\"  Moses said as he slowly lowered it onto him... </span></div></div>",

No previews, no music, no titles, no FBI copyright warnings... nothing.  The movie looked like an old color film recording, the kind that you think you'd only see while hearing an old film projector grinding away while people moved a little too fast on screen because the timing was off.  Being on VHS, though, there was no grinding, but the narration sounded home-made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When I'm done copying and annotating this film, I will destroy the original.  It's too dangerous for there to be more than one.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe accent was Portuguese, a fact that did not go unnoticed by the boys in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moses,\" interrupted Austin with the air of now-what-have-you-done.  \"What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is the film I recorded as a boy, only sixteen years old, when I followed my uncle Adao to the hidden temple at the base of Machu Picchu as part of his expedition.  What happened there was so terrifying that I never watched the film afterward, even though no one ever saw him again.  I didn't even tell anyone that I had the film.  These are my uncle's last moments, and what I saw should have been impossible.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Moses, what is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my grandfather's video.\"  The room fills with sighs.  \"There was a film reel on his bookshelf I kept asking about, and all he'd say was that he recorded it, and it was the most terrifying thing he'd ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is us entering the temple.  I got sand in my eyes right after we passed the first niche, so I gave Jose the on the right there the camera while I stepped out for a moment.  Ah, there's the tile breaking away from the ceiling and I'm handing over the camera.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He never let me see the film, but right before he disappeared, he copied it to VHS for me.\"  Just then, the video camera on the night stand started beeping, and Justin leaped up to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The battery is running low--I guess I need to plug it in.\"  Justin never saw the first creepy thing in the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That must be the writing they said was there!  It really was there!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point in the film, Jose was pointing the camera at some writing and bas relief carved into the wall.  The \"words\" were numerous (and incomprehensible), but the bas relief showed three young men as they grew up into three powerful warriors, towering over their enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creepy part was that carvings... vanished!  The stone wall was suddenly completely blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They really did vanish like that!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" said the three not-distracted boys in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shoulda seen it Justin!  That wall there had carvings on it that suddenly disappeared!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!  Could you rewind it, Moses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying anything, Moses leaned forward and hit the rewind button to go back to point after his grandfather left the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That must be the writing they said was there!  It really was there!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept... it wasn't.  The stone was blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They really did vanish like that!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... kinda creepy, Moses,\" stuttered Adrian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,\" said Austin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no idea,\" said Moses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys talking about?  It's just blank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This must be where I came back after getting the sand out of my eyes... ah, yes.  The team was already arguing over what they had seen, and it wasn't long before the changes started happening.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're crowding me Moses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Moses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, give me some room!\"  Austin and Adrian scooted over a little bit so they all had more room.  What none of them noticed, however, was that their t-shirts were riding up their stomachs and starting to pinch them under their armpits.  Their jeans, had they been standing, would no longer cover the bottom third of their calves, and they only subconsciously found themselves repeatedly... adjusting... themselves to sit comfortably with them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There!  You can see that the research team doesn't seem to fit in their clothes anymore.  Adao's shorts don't reach his knees anymore, Jose's shirt buttons are starting to be forced apart...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Jose was starting to look like an overbuilt Olympic swimmer crammed into a shirt too small for his body, as his pecs and shoulders became more and more prominent.  The other two men in the film were suddenly admiring their cobblestone abs that their shirts could no longer cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man,\" said Adrian.  \"I've got holes in my socks again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, mine's tearing right off my foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow guys,\" said Justin.  \"This movie is awesome!  Hey, didn't those guys used to have mustaches?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And this is where the men all became younger... I'd say they all became about my age at the time: 17.

Adao is the boy who takes care of our yard!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa's voice is starting to sound a little weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my...  I'm young again!  And I've outgrown my clothes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude... that's weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin looked around, and found his friends hulking, towering over him even as they all simply sat on the hotel room floor.  Their eyes were fixed on the television screen as the amazing story unfolded.  It was then that Justin could hear the soft sound of slowly tearing cloth.  Too stunned to speak, Justin simply gawked silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Moses, I made this copy of film for you.  You should be 17 when you get it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... I stole it sooner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...because I'm going to leave it to you with strict instructions that no one else should see it.  I'm going to have to disappear, and I'm sorry--but I don't think anyone will believe that I'm still me.  I'll find you again someday.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It *is* him!\", shouted Moses as he leaped to his feet... all 6'10\" of him, and growing.  \"Filip is Adao, and my grandfather must be--\"  Not being accustomed to standing nearly six and a half feet tall, Moses stumbled forward, and his shirt exploded as his muscles flexed in reflex.  His burgeoning feet were, at that point, a size 18, his tattered socks mere ankle-bands.  He looked down at his hands and forearms, which were huge, sinewy, and visibly veined.  Past his hands, he saw his friends, who still didn't realize they were bursting out of their clothes as they stared slack-jawed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin looked like he was starting to hyperventilate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked so small.</span></div></div>",

He and Adrian had to share one. Moses and Austin got the other. A similar problem existed with the beds, there were only two, so Justin and Moses had agreed to sleep on the floor, while Adrian and Austin got the beds for the first night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was all right, some parts of the walls could use another coat of off-white paint. Justin noticed, unpacking his toothbrush and putting it in the hotel bathroom. He looked at the inside of the bathroom, the walls were a blue tinted white, with an old looking wallpaper covered in a wave motif. There was the standard bathtub, toilet and sink as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin went back out of the bathroom, and continued unpacking his stuff. Putting his alarm clock on one of the bedside tables he looked at Adrian. \"Huh?\" He thought, noticing that Adrian seemed to be almost as tall as he was. Justin attributed this the fact that he didn't have shoes on, but, when he bent over to put some more clothes in his and Adrian's dresser he noticed that Adrian didn't have shoes on either; in fact his feet were completely bare. Standing back up he asked. \"Hey dude. Have you been having a growth spurt?\" Prodding his friend's shoulder to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian turned around. His tanned face looked a little pale. \"Huh? I dunno, maybe?\" He said tiredly. His pale blue Polish eyes seeming a little bit empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok Adrian. You look a little sick.\" Justin said, stepping back, not wanting to catch whatever his friend had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'd better not be, cause I had to sit next to him on the ride here, and I don't wanna be sick.\" Austin said, piping up from the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Moses agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine you guys! I'm just a little tired from the trip is all.\" Adrian protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. Let's watch that movie Moses brought.\" Justin said, ending the brief conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys all agreed, they each plopped themselves on the couch, Moses taking the carpeted  floor after popping in the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin and Moses spaced out pretty quickly watching the movie, it was pretty good. Adrian kept fidgeting, which distracted Justin, who was sitting in the middle, between Adrian and Austin. Adrian kept scratching himself on his chest, his elbow occasionally bumping into Justin's ribs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adrian.\" Justin hissed, \"Cut it out.\" Adrian was pulling on his shirt, his well-defined arms bulging outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Justin. My shirt just feels so sight all of a sudden.\" He said, getting up from the couch. Still tugging at his shirt. Justin studied his friend, his shirt did look tighter, a lot tighter. He could see Adrian's defined abs through the now almost transparent fabric of his T-shirt. Justin ws now craning he neck to look up at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, Adrian!? What's happening to you?\" Justin shouted, getting the attention of the other two boys who looked up at the spectacle. Moses stood up from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...Adrian!?\" He gasped, looking up at the giant as he inched higher and higher. Adrian's shirt surrendered to his rapid growth; first ripping at his broadening shoulders, then his rounded pecs bursting through the feeble fibers, then finally it split at his abs, tearing into pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....guy's?\" He said, looking down at his friends. \"A little help here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit.\" Austin gaped. \"How much more are you going to grow Adrian?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Austin was still asleep in the bed he, Moses, and Justin were sharing (as there were two beds in the room, and although they were large enough for three boys to sleep on, one with Adrian on it left little room for anyone else), and Moses was clutching his side, doubled over in pain.

Fantastic,\" said Justin, his voice dripping with sarcasm, \"Excuse we while I make sure his lungs can inflate anymore.\"<br>\r\n\"That's not where it ended, then I grew back to the size I am now,\" responded Adrian.<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's your...\" YAAAWWN \"Subconscious, trying to tell you something psychotic or Freudian or something.

It seems vague, and cloudy.  All the sounds are muffled, but a few events are prominent.  The instant his boxers snapped open, revealing what was already an ungodly package, wide enough to fit a small belt around when erect, which only grew larger.   The point when the bed is completely crushed under his weight, and the floor starts to crack.  When his growth subsided, and he was big enough wave to people on the second floors of buildings, there was an orgasm unlike anything he'd ever felt (and he'd had his share of orgasms), releasing, literally, gallons of cum on each squirt.  And this was a dream!  Imagine how this could feel in real life!  Why, he cou- SLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another resounding slap.  Adrian awoke, and when he did...</span></div></div>",

His clothes felt tighter on him, like when they first come out of the wash and haven't loosened up yet. He tried to brush the feeling aside but it only got worse the longer he left it.

Moses groaned in discomfort, his shorts straining and slightly ripping against his thicker, longer thighs, his shirt riding up slightly to reveal a few inches of his lower abs. Adrian, Austin and Justin sat down on the floor, cross legged in front of Moses\u2019 big feet. It was hard to believe it, but, their young friend was ever so slowly growing bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Adrian asked, diverting his vision from his friend\u2019s larger, more noticeable bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses just sat there, not knowing what to say. \u201cW-Well\u2026 Uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude...\" Austin began, \"You grew!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses couldn't help but smile after hearing Austin say that. \"Heh... I guess so!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin chuckled slightly, making Moses turn his head towards him. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Justin started, \u201cYou guys are all over reacting! Moses, you probably just shrunk your clothes in the wash, or, maybe you had a little growth spurt in the last month or two. It\u2019s called PUBERTY!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses sighed, rubbing his harder lower abs as they poked out of his shirt. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right...\u201d His smile slowly faded away, his excitement about the matter almost completely disapearing. He couldn't help but feel a little disapointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s not!\u201d Austin yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re bigger than you were when we came to this room! Your shirt\u2019s riding up, your shorts are riding up, and your socks barely even fit you anymore! Your clothes are really tight, and, if you haven\u2019t been paying attention, they\u2019re even ripping a little too! Dude, you\u2019re growing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses stood up, only to sit beside Austin on the floor, cross legged, now more than half a foot taller than when he had came into the room. Austin jumped slightly as he felt Moses\u2019 now bare, larger toes rub against his leg, and suddenly realized something. His larger friend\u2019s big toes had popped out of the front of his socks only about a minute or two ago\u2026 And now, the rest of his thick, long toes had ripped through the thin material at the front of his socks. Moses was still growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin patted Moses on the back. \u201cDude, you\u2019ve got to believe me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJustin\u2019s right!\u201d Moses insisted, \u201cWe all just over-reacted a bit! Though, the thought of outgrowing my clothes is just... so... you know!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian smirked, seeing his large friend getting all riled up, asking, \"We know what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses adjusted his muscular ass on the carpet, feeling uncomfortable in his original position, simple saying, \"Nevermind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... don't believe me...\" Austin muttered, feeling ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Justin glared at Austin, now annoyed. \"Give it up already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it really doesn't matter.\" Moses looked down at Austin, smiling. \"I like'd the idea thou-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses was cut off as a loud ripping noise filled the room. All of the boys turned their heads towards him, realizing that the back of his shirt had ripped half way down his back, his well-sculpted lads partly visible, the front also slightly ripping downwards as his large pecs pushed against the material. Moses\u2019 shorts were no match for his slowly growing body, as they too were being forced to rip at the sides because of Moses\u2019 longer, and thicker thighs, his bulge jutting out obscenely while the front of his shorts began to slowly tear. He suddenly put his legs in front of him, his big feet in front of Justin, the pressure on his expanding manhood too great to continue staying cross-legged. Justin watched in horror as a large hole appeared on each of Moses socks, slowly revealing more and more of his friend\u2019s smooth, slightly tanned soles as the hole grew larger, his large feet now to big to be contained by the meager fabric. As the majority of ripping and tearing ended, all of the boys couldn't help but stare at their behemoth of a friend. For a few seconds, everyone was completely quiet, though, the low sound of fabric strecthing and slowly tearing could be heard. Moses was now about a foot and a half taller than his origianlal height, almost every bulging muscle on his body visible, or being hidden by his ever so tight, slowly shredding clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I told you!\" Austin yelled, slightly scared of his gargantuan friend.</span></div></div>",

He carefully wrapped them around his waist, reaching only right above his knee, but it was good enough for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec, Moses\" he said, looking concerned at his giant friend, \"How are you supposed to get out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses froze. \"Crap, hold on.\" He carefully turned his body around to face the door. In doing so, he knocked over Austin with his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch out!\" said Austin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's getting kinda cramped in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As soon as they finished, Moses started getting the DVD player ready to play the movie. When he finished, him, Justin, Adrian and Austin jumped on the beds. There were two queen beds, so Moses and Austin got one bed, and, Justin and Adrian got the other. They all took their shoes off, and got ready to watch the movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You guys ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Can you JUST press play?! Austin yelled, getting impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Fine!\" Moses snarled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Moses started the movie. A few minutes after the movie started, Austin started to get uncomfortable. His shorts felt slightly tight and his sleeves were pinching his arms a little. He tried to ignore it, but a few minutes later, he noticed that his feet were lower down the than the bed than Moses', and his socks felt like they were too small. Austin wiggled his large, tanned toes in his socks, starting to get worried. As he noticed that his toes were beginning to poke through the front of his socks, he jumped out of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What the hell!?\" Austin yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Adrian paused the movie, asking, \"What's wrong?\" <br>\r\n  .<br>\r\n \"Do I look, bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I don't think so...\" Justin said, not really caring. \"But did you shrink your clothes in the washer or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Austin sighed. \"Moses, come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Why?\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I have to check something, come and stand beside me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses, Adrian and Justin were shocked. Austin was now a few inches taller than his friend! It was impossible to grow half a foot in ten minutes. Just then, everyone turned to Austin as they heard a ripping sound. Austin's sleeves on his T-shirt had ripped slightly at the edges, and his shorts were getting really tight, his thighs straining the material while his buldge pushed out slightly. Then, they realized something, Austin was now half a foot taller than Moses, making him about 6 foot five! Austin put his socked feet, the material at the front now snapping, beside his shoe, and he was surprised to see that his foot was now too big for his usual size 13's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Man, this is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Awesome!\" Justin said cutting Austin off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What do you mean?\" Austin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You're growing!

Then Justin stepped out into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Austin wants you guys to come back inside.\" Justin told the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, okay?\" Moses said, confused. But he and Adrian stepped into the room anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, to their amazement, was a massive hole in where there second story window used to be. Dust and rubble was everywhere and a thick smell of cement was in the air. Through the hole in the wall, the three boys could see Austin, now 35 feet tall and still growing. And past him, they could see block after block of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! What do we do!\" Adrian shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get out of here!\" Moses responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry guys.\" Austin said, extending his fingers like a bridge into the room \"I got you.\" Austins hand was now about 7 feet long and 4 feet wide. The three boys climbed on easily for the ride. Austin curled his fingers up into a fist, not a tight fist, but tight enough to keep his friends safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the city.\" Austin said. He began moving down the street, every step he took was a whole block as his smooth, tan feet collided with the pavement. Withe each step, people climbed out of their cars and exited their shops to see the hulking figure move by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's to much stuff in the way!\" Austin shouted, trying to walk without breaking anything or hurting anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just crush stuff!\" Moses suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then climb up buildings!\" Justin shouted \"Like King Kong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin smiled at that. The now 40 foot tall boy hoisted himself on top of the nearest apartment building. He looked out towards the ocean. \"I see water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go! Go! We'll sleep on a beach somewhere tonight!\" Moses shouted. Austin jumped off of the apartment building propelling himself towards the water, he barley landed in a small clearing, the heel of his 10 foot long feet landing in the street behind him. Austin ran off into the water, which quickly rose up to his chest, the hand holding his friends was partially submerged underwater. Austin and the others headed out to find a new home.</span></div></div>",

He was the tallest in the class, but soon, he would be dwarfed by Austin! He should be the one growing! Just then, Austin turned around, now being six and a half feet tall. His shirt was now ripped at the sides, slightly ripped at the back, and you could see about four to five inches of his six-pack. Moses wasn't surprised knowing how athletic Austin was. His shorts now only reached half a foot above his knee, and they were also ripped along the sides as his strong, tanned thighs overly stretched the thin material. His boxers were getting very tight, his buldge unbelievably noticeable and close to bursting through his shorts. Austin then saw Moses' pissed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Austin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses didn't answer, his anger over taking him. He had always wanted to be bigger, and seeing his friend growing, he just thought it was unfair! Austin then smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Is someone jealous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Austin's shirt ripped half way down his back, his broad lads jutting out. His long, strong toes had completely burst through the front of his socks, the rest of the material barely hanging onto half way up his sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin was estatic! \"This just gets better and better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you!\" Moses yelled \"It's bad enough that YOU\"RE growing, but you don't have to be a prick about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down,\" Adrian said, \"Its not his fault he's growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's AWESOME!\" Austin boomed, flexing and posing, trying to piss Moses off even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax!\" Justin yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses then tackled Austin to the floor, but, being more than a foot taller than him, Austin easily flipped him around, stood up, and put his massive, hot foot on top of Moses' chest, holding him down so he would stop fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell's wrong with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin lifted his foot off of his chest, and Moses calmed down, and sat on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man, I was just a little jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"A little?\" Adrian said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I just think it would be cool to... you know, grow huge!\" Moses said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Thats true...\" Justin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Moses sighed. \"Wait you guys, I'll be right back, I gotta go to the washroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

His large, once size fourteen feet were straining his socks material, his large, muscular toes wiggling. He rubbed his lower thighs, now not covered by his stomach. Though Moses' clothes hadn't ripped at all yet, they were getting close to ripping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its true, your both growing now!\" Adrian said, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how tall you guys are now...\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we check?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin looked in his luggage and took out a measuring tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Adrian sighed. \"You brought a measuring tape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know when you might need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Moses stood up straight while Justin measured him.

Moses looked at his shirt. It was slightly ripped at the sides and he could see the rips slowly getting bigger, while his big toes popped out of the front of his socks.

Just then on the side of the hotel two giant feet broke out of the walls. \"Guess I finally broke through the wall.\" Moses laughed. Both he and Austin stood up, leaving the rest of the hotel to fall to pieces. The were both now almost 50 feet tall,naked, and still growing. They walked over to the class, crushing the cars in the front parking lot that were still intact. They didn't intend to but their feet were too big to try and cross over them. The class started to run away in panic except for Justin and Adrian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Austin decided we're gonna rule this town\" Moses said looking down at them. \"Don't worry. you guys are our friends so you'll be safe.

Justin and Adrian watched as the now 60 foot boys walked over to the store. Each step made the ground shake a little. They also stepped on a few cars on the way but they were focused on getting food. They put they're hands on the store and ripped the roof right off. They started to take big handfuls of food and just shoved it down. Some of it still in the packaging. All the people started running out of the store and driving away. After they cleaned out the store, they both stood up, now 80 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The growth was still surging through their veins, and the meal they had just completed seemed to be fueling it.  Just in the minute or so they looked out over the city, they had each added another twenty feet to their height, bringing them to an even 100 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Austin!\" Moses said.  \"I'll race you to the top of that skyscraper,\" he said, pointing to a building about 80 stories tall, which was several miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Moses,\" Austin responded, \"You're on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Adrian screamed.  \"What about us?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses kneeled down and stuck out his hand.  \"Don't worry, we'll give you a ride!\"  He picked up Adrian and placed him onto Austin's shoulder, then picked up Justin and placed him onto his own shoulder.  \"How's the view from up here?\" Moses asked with a grin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Justin said, \"now may not be a good time to tell you that I'm scared of heights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Austin said.  \"Just hold on tight!  Ready, Moses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!\" Moses screamed, and the two behemoth boys were off, racing through the streets, their huge, car-sized feet thudding in the pavement and shaking the foundations of the buildings they were near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sped through the city, Moses had the initial advantage, but Austin quickly caught up to him.  Giving him a little nudge, he knocked Moses off balance, sending him crashing into a old warehouse building.  The weight of the now-150-foot-tall boy caused the warehouse to start to crumble, then collapse upon itself.  Moses grinned, impressed with the havoc he and his friend were causing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's not fair!\" he called out, and began to catch up with Austin.  He jumped on him and tackled him, bringing him crashing to the ground.  Cars, busses, street lamps and countless lives were flattened underneath their massive bodies as they horsed around, and their tiny friends were hanging on for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they reached the tower they were aiming for. By the time they had gotten their, they were almost two hundred feet tall, and the top wasn't too far away.  Austin began climbing the tower first, reaching out, grabbing ledges, and hoisting himself higher, as if he were King Kong.  The people inside the tower who hadn't gotten the chance to evacuate were treated to a spectacular, if terrorizing, sight, with the huge, naked fourteen year old with an ever-impressive manhood was shimmying up the building they were inside, with his equally astonishing friend right behind him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn their way up, Austin struggled, and Moses caught up with him, finally surpassing him and reaching the top of the tower first.  Clutching to the tower with one hand, he stretched his other hand into the sky, hooting and hollering.   \"Yeah!  I won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin, gasping for breath, finally made it up to where Moses was.  \"Only cause I let you win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses grinned, and looked at his friend, then back at the path of destruction they had made through the city, wondering what they should do next.</span></div></div>",

Still growing, he rolled off his bed, and on to the ground, having to crawl on his hands and knees now that he couldn't stand up without hitting his head on the ceiling.  He looked over and saw that Austin was now sitting down, leaning his head against the wall, and softly moaning.  He didn't want to disrupt his friend's pleasure, but he knew that they had to go before things got worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Austin, we've gotta leave before we're trapped!\"  Moses said.  He shook Austin by the shoulders, and snapped him out of his fantasy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, uh, you're right!\" Austin said, sheepishly embarrassed that his friends saw him that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me!\" Moses called out, and he began to make his way towards the door.  He stopped for a second, realizing that he was about to go outside where everyone could see him, and though he was proud of his body, he didn't want anyone who wasn't necessary to see it.  He grabbed the bed sheet from the hotel bed and in one swift move yanked it off, motioning Austin to do the same.  He quickly fashioned a make-shift toga out of it, tying it around one shoulder and letting it cover him down to the mid-thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! Toga Party!\" Justin said, jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and help Austin with his,\" Moses said to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin helped wrap the sheet around Austin, but it was clear that he was already becoming too big for a standard toga, so he wrapped it around his thighs like a loincloth.  At this point, Moses had crawled towards the door.  On his hands and knees, he was barely small enough to fit through, though the newly increased width of his shoulders meant he had to twist sideways to fit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way outside, he stood up again, and was slightly amused that his head was now eye level with the second floor balcony of their hotel.  Their room was facing the pool in the courtyard of the hotel, and many of their classmates were swimming in or hanging out next to the pool.  Some of the girls who were facing the room screamed when they saw the giant emerging from the room, and ran out from the pool area, hiding back in their room.  Most of the other classmates just stared at Moses, dumbfounded.  Some of them recognized Moses, and were either excited for him or afraid of what he would do now with his size advantage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses smiled; he loved getting all the attention, and he hoped this feeling would never end.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had tried to go through on his hands and knees like Moses, but he hadn't twisted his shoulders enough, and now they were wedged in tight, to where he couldn't move.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moses!\" he called out.  \"Help me!  I'm stuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses looked at Austin with amusement.  \"I guess you're just not used to being the big guy, are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and get him out of there,\" Justin called out.  \"His feet are right in my face, and they smell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to move back in the room,\" Adrian suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?\" Austin exclaimed.  \"I'm trying to get out!

He then tried banging the side of the door with his fists, causing the wall to start cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that!\" Justin exclaimed.  \"You're causing the walls to shake!  The building will collapse and kill us all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Moses said, reaching out his hand, \"grab a hold of this.  I'll pull you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin reached out his hand and grabbed hold of Moses's.  \"On the count of three, okay?\" Moses said.  \"One...Two...THREE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all his strength, Moses pulled as hard as he could.  Austin screamed as his arm was being pulled, but he finally broke free, taking the door frame with him as he did so.  Their momentum caused Austin to fall onto Moses, which then in turn to cause him to fall back, knocking in the fence around the pool, and taking them both splashing into the water.  Those who were still in the pool dove out of the way, trying to avoid getting crushed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin was now lying on top of Moses, who's back was now in the water.  Gasping for air, Moses pushed Austin off of him, and stood up in the pool.  Austin shook of the debris and turned over on his back.  Clearing out his eyes, he looked down, and saw that the water only came up to his knees, and that was in the deep end (at 8 feet deep)!  With a quick calculation, he realized he was now over 30 feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back to the room.  Where the door used to be was now a gaping hole in the wall, from which Justin and Adrian were looking out at the carnage unfolding, shocked and amused, respectively.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\"  Adrian said.  \"That was awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?\"  Justin exclaimed.  \"We nearly got killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses reached down and helped Austin up.  Since they had gotten wet, their white sheets-turned-togas were now almost see through, sort of defeating the purpose.  Moses was slightly annoyed that Austin was still a few feet taller than him, though at their ever-increasing heights, this was becoming less and less of an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding with Austin, Moses then turned around to look at the world around them.  Those brave few classmates who hadn't run away were looking up at them from their feet, awestruck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pretty awesome, isn't it?\"  Moses asked Austin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he replied.  \"What should we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses smiled and crossed his arms across his chest.</span></div></div>",

Why, what are you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Moses, who grinned back at him.  \"I'm thinking that we can have some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin smiled back.  He then noticed, out of the corner of his eye, a group of three boys standing in the corner of the pool complex.  They were all seniors on the football team at their school, and they always would give the younger guys a hard time, especially Austin and his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin noticed that the boys were pointing and snickering at him and Moses.  With one long stride, he moved over to where they were standing, looming over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of here, freak,\" Warren, the biggest of the boys said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin laughed.  \"What did you call me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard him,\" Ron, another one of the boys, said.  \"Go away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Austin said.  \"Hey, Moses, come look at these guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses turned and stood over next to Austin, towering over the three jocks.  \"What's up?\" he asked Austin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think these three need to be taught a lesson,\" Austin said, grinning devilishly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me!\" Moses said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two giant boys moved in on the three jocks, they suddenly realized what was about to happen, and began to panic.  Moses and Austin lifted a foot, and in one quick move each pinned down one of them.  The third boy, not wanting to get caught, quickly ran away.  He eluded Austin's grasp, but Austin didn't mind; he wanted to show the boy under his feet who's boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's my feet smell, pipsqueak?\" he asked to Warren, who was now trapped under his foot.  Moses and Austin were now about forty feet tall, and their feet were longer than each of the boys were tall.  Warren struggled to get free, but the massive weight pressing down on him was too much for him to escape from.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross! Stop it!\" Warren exclaimed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses was having fun tickling Ron's face with his toes, which were each about the size of Ron's head.  Ron began to gag from the overwhelming smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" he exclaimed.  \"We're sorry!  Let us go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses turned to Austin.  \"What do you think?\" he asked.  \"Is 'sorry' good enough?\"</span></div></div>",

He lifted his foot and let Ron wriggle free, and Austin did the same with Warren.  As the two scared jocks scampered away, Moses leaned down to them and said, \"Don't ever bother us again.  Got it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah sure, whatever,\" Ron said, and he and Warren ran back to their room and locked the door tight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses laughed at the fleeing pests, and then stood up again, looking around at the few classmates that hadn't ran away yet.  At this time, the sun had set, and the lights of the city stretched on in the distance.  Some floodlights had flicked on and were lighting up the pool area and the parking lots around the hotel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA car full of a family of five pulled into the front of the hotel, and Moses saw the kids pointing at him and Austin.  \"Look at that, Austin,\" he said as he pointed back to the car.  The young kids were looking on in awe, while the parents just gasped, stunned at what they saw.  Moses laughed as the car then peeled off, jumping a curb and speeding down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin suddenly felt a little tired, and started to yawn.  He stretched his arms above his head while he did so, and the bed sheet covering himself finally gave way, ripping to shreds and falling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww, gross!\" Moses said, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin shrugged.  \"I don't care; it feels good this way.  Besides, we're giants now, who's gonna stop us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses thought about this for a moment, and then decided he too wanted to go au natural.  He tugged on the knot that was keeping his covering together, and it fell gracefully down to his feet.  Austin whistled as he gave Moses' body a look.  \"Damn, you look good at this size!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, same to you!\" Moses shot back.  \"But what size are we now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows,\" Austin said.  He walked over and stood next to the two-story hotel, the roof of which was now only coming up to his waist.  His cock was swinging freely right next to the second-floor's windows, and it brushed up against one of them, causing screams to come from a group of girls who were watching inside.  \"Sorry, ladies,\" he said, smiling down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Moses realized that he hadn't seen Adrian or Justin for a while now.  \"Hey, Justin!  Adrian!\" he called out.  \"Where are you guys?\"  The two boys, who were still their normal heights, emerged from hiding behind a car.  \"Why were you guys back there?\" Moses asked as he crouched down to get closer to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian responded, \"Justin here got scared when you started to hassle those bullies.  He ran away, and I went after him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin still looked a little uneasy.  \"I'm okay,\" he said, \"I just thought you were gonna squish those two jerks, and as much as they deserve it, I get really squeamish at the sight of blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses smiled, reached out his hand and softly patted Justin on the head,  \"There, there, little guy.  Austin and I aren't gonna hurt anybody.  Intentionally,\" he said, grinning devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you two gonna do now?\" Adrian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Moses said, as he turned around to talk to Justin, who had come up behind him.  \"What do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Austin said, as another yawn escaped from his lips.  \"What're you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses brought his hand to his chin in thought.  \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

Their big, meaty toes wiggles and flexed freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdrian\u2019s right.\u201d Austin replied. \u201cI can feel the growing slowing down. Let\u2019s keep watching the movie until it starts up again!\u201d Austin flexed his bicep, loving how big it had gotten and hoping this wasn\u2019t the end. The four teens laid down on the beds again, but due to Austin\u2019s and Moses\u2019s new size, a change of pair-ups were required. Austin and Adrian laid down on one bed while Moses and Justin laid upon the other. As soon as the play button was pressed, Moses took notice to the fact his growing had also come to a pause and he was now a little taller than Austin. Satisfied; the still tallest boy in class turned back to the TV and watched with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour went by and the four friends were having a hard time getting into the movie. Perhaps the sight of two of them growing out of their clothes had been far too interesting compared to this \u201cscariest\u201d movie. Moses let out a yawn and buried his face into his arms (he was laying on his stomach) while Austin folded his arms behind his head and closed his eyes (he was on his back). In moments the two large teens had dozed off\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like they fell asleep\u2026\u201d Adrian whispered, glancing over at Austin\u2019s sleeping face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least they don\u2019t snore!\u201d Justin replied, imagining how loud their snoring would be now. He and Adrian continued to watch the horror film and became enwrapped in it; the movie picking up halfway through. They were so focused on the television they did not notice the slight sound of their friends\u2019 clothes ripping and tearing again. The growing had started again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tear in the back of Moses\u2019s shirt began to get wider as his torso expanded. His arms slowly started to droop over the edge and his sleeves started to rip open, revealing his thickening arms. The same was happening to Austin, but if Adrian had glanced over at him he would of seen that more and more of the growing teen\u2019s abs were being uncovered by his shrinking shirt. The straining material hugged tightly against his pectorals; leaving little to the imagination. Adrian\u2019s full attention was only interrupted when one of Austin\u2019s feet was pushing against his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Austin, stop that.\u201d Adrian muttered, not looking up from the TV and pushing his friend\u2019s large, bare foot away. In a few moments it was back again; irritating Adrian once again. Adrian muttered under his breath and tried grabbing the foot and tossing it away, but found it difficult to even get his hand around the foot. He glanced over  at Austin and his eyes widened. \u201cHoly crap; they\u2019re growing again!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Justin looked up from the movie and saw Adrian looking down at a sleeping, massive Austin! The growing boy was squirming a bit in his sleep; his shorts looked so tight it should be cutting off circulation\u2026but instead the muscular thighs were just tearing through the clothing. His shirt barely covered half of his torso; and looked like it\u2019d pop off any second. A loud rip directed Justin\u2019s attention to Moses next to him; the second growing boy\u2019s broad back was completely exposed! The shirt had tore open in the back; it was only the boy\u2019s sleeves that were keeping it on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, they\u2019re really getting big!\u201d Adrian exclaimed as he hopped off the bed; watching his spot being taken over by Austin\u2019s form. Justin did the same wand watched by Adrian\u2019s side; their friends were taking up to queen sized beds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so frickin cool\u2026\u201d Justin said as he watched Moses and Austin turn into giants before his eyes. He had no idea why or how this was happening, but he didn\u2019t care. He just couldn\u2019t wait to see how big they got\u2026</span></div></div>",

So he went to the washroom, and when he was done, he washed his hands. While washing his hands, he felt a tingling sensation spread out through his entire body, but tried to ignore it. Soon, he realized that it was impossible, as he noticed that his clothes were getting tighter, painfully tighter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses looked at himself in the mirror and watched as he started to grow. He was growing faster than Austin, but still pretty slow. He watched as his shorts began to rip at the sides, then continued to go up, until they fell off. His shirt was doing no better. It got tighter and tighter until it started to rip down his back, and looked like it would soon<br>\r\nburst of of him. He was left in only a pair of boxers, and his shirt, which was close to being in tatters. His already large, once size fourteen feet were moving across the floor as they lengthened, his toes clenching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes! Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses was so happy about himself growing that he nearly forgot how how big he was. Now around seven feet tall, and growing, Moses flexed his mighty bicep, and watched as it rose higher, and higher, and HIGHER! His thick, wide thighs strained his boxers' material, his boxer clad buldge painfully squished into them also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Moses! Are you done yet?\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah,\" Moses started, \"I'm coming....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At over seven feet tall now, his boxers weren't going to hold much longer. They were so tight, he couldn't really move his legs. His face was getting red with embarrassment. He could feel his body slowing down in growth, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin banged on the bathroom door. \"Hey Moses, you done in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the boys heard the sound of a loud BUMP! coming from the bathroom. Justin was instantly concerned about his friend. \"Hey, you ok Moses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine guys!\" the boys heard Moses's muffled voice. \"It's just...uh oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the boys know that Moses's head had just hit the eight foot ceiling, and he wasn't showing any signs of slowing down like Austin was. If anything, he was speeding up. He sat on the tile floor so that he wouldn't have to crouch. He noticed his muscles expanding all over his body. It was as if his body was growing in order to accommodate the size of his muscles. He knew he was bigger than Austin now, and that made him happy. He wanted to show his friends, but he was too big to open the door. <i>Well I can't stay here </i>, he thought to himself. He sat with his legs spread out, his feet resting on the bathroom door, and his back inching toward the opposite wall. He gasped as he looked at himself in the mirror. His body looked as though someone had taken the Hulk's body without the green color, and put Moses's head on top of it. His boxers had ripped to shreds by then, his large manhood resting by his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time, he heard his friends banging on the door where his feet now rested, demanding that he come out. It was getting on his nerves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'm coming out!\" the boys heard Moses say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" said Justin. \"Well what took you so--\" BOOM!<br>\r\nThe bathroom door flew from its hinges, narrowly missing Austin, and hit the back wall of the hotel room. Out of the bathroom came two giant feet, about 5 feet long each, and still growing. The boys were speechless, peering into the bathroom. Giant Moses waved at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, that feels better, it was getting cramped in there,\" he said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Get some pants on!\" Austin said, pointing at Moses's giant manhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get right on that, as soon as I find some giant pants laying around...\" he retorted.<br>\r\nSure, Moses felt embarrassed from the fact that his friends were seeing him naked, but what could he do about it? Anyways, if he kept growing like this, his friends won't be the only people who see him. By now, his lower body was filling the bathroom floor, his back still pressed against the wall. His arms were becoming cramped on both sides of the narrow bathroom, so he just rested them by his side. He felt restless. He was huge and powerful, but powerless stuck in this bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, stop bickering with each other,\" Justin said, \"You always do this. I don't know how or why this is all happening, but am I the only one who sees that Moses is still growing? We have to do something before he collapses the room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses's legs and feet were slowly inching out the bathroom and towards his friends, his feet being about half their size, except for Austin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or the entire building, rather.\" said Austin. \"Then he would finally match the size of his ego.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoses playfully nudged Austin with his foot, but he underestimated his new strength and knocked his friend down to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! Dammit Moses, that really hurt!\" said Austin, struggling to get up from the floor because of the tightness of his boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" said Moses sincerely. \"I only meant to nudge you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin was suddenly wary of his friend's giant strength. He didn't want to get Moses angry, or someone might get hurt. Or worse. \"Just watch it next time, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Moses filled the majority of the bathroom, and he was still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you guys help me out of here because I get stuck? I really don't want to spend the rest of my life in a bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin had an idea. \"Ok, I'll try to pull you out by your feet, while you push from the wall you're sitting against. Justin, move the beds.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin grabbed both of Moses's ankles and pulled, while Moses pushed. The bathroom door frame shuddered from the pressure as Moses's waist slid through. After that, Moses inched through the doorframe by himself. Cracks formed around the frame, but the room stayed intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...\" said Moses, relieved of the pressure. He spread his legs toward the other side of the room, and laid flat down on the floor, resting his head on one of the beds. His body took up half of the room already. He rested his right arm across the room, right between his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin was the first to ask the inevitable. \"What do we do now?\" he said, leaning on Moses's thigh. Moses's growth was now slower than Austin's had been, but he was growing nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he did, Justin saw a small air vent. \"There!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just air conditioning, dude.\" said Austin as he walked up to the vent. He put his nose up to it and sniffed. \"Besides, I don't smell anythi-woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, what was left of Austin's boxers ripped off, and Austin was suddenly butt naked.

The whole class had to split up into groups of four for each room, and luckily, Justin gets to be in a room with his friends Adrian, Moses and Austin. The first night Justin, Adrian, Austin and Moses are in the Hotel room, Adrian, Moses, Austin or one of them slowly start to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Adrian: 5'5\"   He is Polish, has dirty blonde, short to medium long hair, is somewhat muscular because he's fairly athletic, and is somewhat pale to lightly tanned. He's not very mean, generally easy to get along with, and he wouldn't hurt his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Austin: 5'8\"   He is Ecuadorian, has short and spiky dark brown hair, is as bit less muscular than Adrian (though a bit more notable in the case of his lower body), and is very tanned. He likes to joke around, but sometimes he goes a bit too far. He also has really big feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Moses: 5'11\"   He is Portuguese, has short spiky hair similar to Austin but lighter, is average towards muscularity (but has a somewhat wider body-type), and is a bit more pale than Adrian. He's self-assured and can come off as a bit domineering sometimes, but it's clear he's usually just playing around. He's the tallest in class, and wishes he was even bigger. He has pretty big feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Justin: 5'6\"   He is Italian, has light brown hair down to his shoulders, is a is fairly averaged muscularity-wise, and slightly more tanned than Adrian.

Just not to ridiculous proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(3) NO Shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(4) No toilet stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(5) No hard vore! It's nasty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(6) You may add on new characters later into the story, who grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anyways, enjoy! If you read, try to add please.</td>",
