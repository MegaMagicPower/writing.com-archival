In fact, the poor devils in the insane asylums are more sane than the rest of us or so it would seem. I sense a nervous fear is spreading into every heart that lets down its guard. People don't feel safe unless there are soldiers around, and yet, we live in a city with grand walls and impenetrable gates. Nothing and no one could get in here to harm them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, I do not think they fear weapons of cold steel. It is an invisible evil they fear, something that attacks the mind. It is as if a dark rain cloud has decided to settle over this realm and refuses to be moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sent some of my spies into the city. They came back with reports of whispers - rumors. Some people think I am not doing all that I can to protect the realm from this evil. But I ask, what can I do against something I cannot see? I do not yet even know what I should be fighting against. Nevertheless there are still trouble makers. I hope this will not lead to rebellion and mutiny should they seek to uproot me, but I am preparing for the worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count: 219 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkb.png\" alt=\"*Checkb*\" title=\"Checkb\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

Thoughts bouncing, swirling every which way, it was complete and utter chaos inside her head. That would be enough for anyone but to top it off Hannah's head suddenly began to pound. Clearly in pain, frustrated and yes even scared Hannah knew not what to do. It seemed everyone here was looking to her for a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she could remember who she was, why she was in the woods, who the strange man was and why three hags were tied to the mighty tree before her. Part of her wanted to flee but something held her back, made her stand her ground. Duty perhaps? She really didn't know but she felt with all her heart that whatever was going on here was important, that many lives depended on the outcome. She just had to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Hannah walking in circles, muttering to herself with a look of utter determination he knew better than to interrupt. His Queen had to be coming up with a sneaky a plan for these hangs, to trick them into sharing what they knew. If there was a way, his Queen would find it. He silently wished she would hurry up and make up her mind. If he had his way he would simply torture one until the other two spilled their guts, it was highly effective, however the Queen was still displeased with the body count from the last time she sent him for information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky darkened as the black storm clouds rolled in from the west. She realized that the harder she tried to remember the more cluttered her mind seemed to become. She looked up and was startled to find him looking at her. Why did that single look carry so much, mean so much? Giving her head a slight shake, she sauntered toward the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Queen Hannah looking at the eldest of the three hags..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are three lonely hags who call this part of the woods home, but you already know that Queen Hannah, so tell us, what is it you are really want to know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's entire demeanour changes. She is once again standing tall, looking strong, confidant as ever and ready to take on the world. A look that an be mistaken for none other than our Queen Hannah of Stark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As your Queen, I demand you tell me what is going on, now. I don't have time for games so if you want to live I suggest you start talking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel smiles and with unmistakable joy, he slowly removes his sword from its sheath. Ever eager to please his queen. So glad that whatever was bothering her before seems to have passed. Maybe, just maybe he would get to do things his way after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, Queen Hannah are being lied to by the very people that you call your friends and allies. Stark will come under attack and not from where you are expecting!\" yelled the youngest of the three hags as Daniel began to toying with his sword, slowly tearing apart the bodice of her rags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave her be, leave them all be. We have work to be done and our time is not best served here!\" Queen Hannah shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Daniel confused, and disappointed reluctantly did as he was told. He swiftly cut the ropes binding the hags to the tree, and before he could utter a word they were gone. He then helped Queen Hannah to mount her horse. He would never understand the old bat but he quite fancied his position with Stark House as spy, not to mention wanting to remain on Queen Hannah's good side, so he bid his time, and said nothing. He too had much work to do back at the palace. Time to solve this threat once and for all. If only she had kept the hags he was sure he would have the names of those who meant them harm by now! How that woman could anger him. Though he had to remind himself, in the past she has proven to be  sly, cunning and simply brilliant so this time he would keep quiet, for now anyway. Lost in his thoughts he was started when Queen Hannah suddenly shouted  \"Take me home, NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never let him take the lead. Were they under attack, was she being cautious, devious or has she finally lost her ever loving mind? Thankfully he followed her command without question or at least she thinks he is as he is leading her somewhere. All she could do was hope he was loyal and home is where he is taking her. She could not have made it home without him for she knew not who she was, nor where she called home. Hannah rode in silence, there was too much to figure out and lives were depending on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

None of it looked familiar to Queen Hannah, why oh why could she not remember anything? This was clearly so frustrating for her. The man leading the way, he called himself her spy, he clearly worked for her. She had a nagging thought though, could he be trusted? Could anyone be trusted right now when she couldn't even trust herself? She had no choice she had to take his word for it, she was the Queen and they were headed back to the palace, Stark House he called it. Maybe one there her memories would flood back. She silently prayed they would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they rounded the bend going through the dense brush, Hannah caught a breathtaking sight between the tall standing trees she could make out the sunset and it was magnificent. The pinks, reds, oranges, purples and blues it was simply breathtaking. She brought her horse to a halt, she needed some time and now was as good as any. She called ahead and said she needed a few minutes but would catch up. She dismounted her horse and walked to a small clearing. The view there was more stunning than the first glimpse that caused her to stop. Looking out over the bare trees, the snow covered ground there was nothing. No foot prints, horse tracks, no animal tracks for that matter other than those belonging to that man she is travelling with and of course Sunflowers hoof prints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah stroked the mare's main, she was such a beautiful girl this horse was. She was in awe, that she could actually be the owner of such a magnificent creature! Come to think of it, Hannah realized she likely had many more possessions that would blow her mind being the Queen and all. How on earth did that happen? Hannah tried and tried but once again her mind a blank canvas. Chaos all around, thoughts flying, but when it comes to memories there is nothing. Just a blank canvas waiting for her to create new memories. Unfair, she wanted her old ones back! Frustrated and angry Hannah mounted her horse deciding she had had her fill of the sunset and her beautiful horse had finished drinking, it was now time to catch up to that man or she would never make it back to the Palace on her own. That thought scared Hannah and she sent her horse full throttle forward to catch up. Not slowing down until she caught sight of him ten minutes up the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to slow down once he was in sight. She didn't want him to see her anger, her fear and most of all her confusion. She was certain anyone could know just by looking at her that she was a fraud. She could only imagine how he might take advantage of her if he found out she had no memory. She had to remember, what could she do that would bring back her memories she wondered. Closing her eyes and taking more deep breaths in hopes of clearing her scattered mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sunflower was still running full out, a snake appeared suddenly, spooking Hannah's horse. Without warning while Hannah's eyes were still closed tight, Sunflower reared up on her hind legs, neighed at the snake and bolted faster than Hannah knew she could go. This wouldn't have been so bad if Queen Hannah had not been unaware and of course not on Sunflower's back when it happened. Hannah was slipped sideways on the horse but did not fall off. Sunflower was now galloping at full speed and quickly passed Daniel who looked on in horror as his Queen lay across the side of her horse only holding on by the reigns being caught up in her legs and skirts. Her hands were dragging across the dirt, ice and snow, her face terrified, her hair a tangled mess across her face and dragging along the ice covered ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to save her, if anything happened to her on his watch, he shuddered at the thought. Bringing his horse to a gallop he rode full out trying to catch up. If he could just get the damn horse to stop! Clearly it didn't follow verbal commands from just anyone. He needed to catch her and his best chance was grabbing hold of the reigns. Watching Sunflower he realized she was headed into a section of dense bush where both the Queen and Sunflower could be fatally hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Hannah, you MUST free yourself from the horse and drop to the ground before you get even more seriously hurt! NOW!!\" Daniel yelled. His heart raced so fast, the thudding in his ears, he had no idea if she could hear him. Quickly Daniel was able to narrow the distance between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah could barely make out what he was saying, Her heart was pounding so loudly in her ears, and racing like it was going to jump out of her chest at any moment in time. She was sure she heard him tell her to drop. Humm if letting go and dropping to the ground was that easy doesn't he realize I would have done that by now! she cursed to herself more loudly than she realized and hoped he heard it, the idiot that he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled against the reigns, ripping her petticoat and dress and she was finally able to free herself from the reigns. Okay, deep breath. She was still too dizzy, tired and scared to be able to pull herself back up on to Sunflowers back. So her only other option was to go home all the way like this or if she could just let go she would fall to the hard snow and ice covered ground. As Hannah tried to make sense of her options and make a decision, Sunflower got closer to the trees and suddenly with a loud crack and thud Hannah was run head first into the trunk of a tree. It knocked her unconscious and she fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel couldn't believe his eyes, She was dead he just knew it. He got to her side as quickly as possible. By the time he reached her, she was lying lifeless on the ground. He couldn't tell if she was dead or alive. Packing back and fourth running his hands through his long hair he wondered what he should do. He could leave now, leave town and get far far away. They would blame him probably charge him with treason and have him drawn and quartered. You can't have the Queen die on your watch when you are out alone with her. People will think the worst. They will think he eliminated her in order to take over House Stark, Like that would happen with that greedy family of hers!! He stopped pacing long enough to look at his dear Queen once again. An honest and unsettling realization hit him, yes it is clear now... he loved her, as if on cue a lone tear slid down his cheek before he even realized it. She still hadn't moved. He began to make preparations to return her body to the castle. Looking around for something to make a travois so that his horse could drag her back with her dignity in tact and her position respected. Yes, that is what he would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sunflower, he called out in hopes that she would return unharmed. She was a beautiful horse, he wondered aloud what it was that spooked her for her to throw Hannah like that? So many questions. All that mattered was getting his Queen home, be damned with what the others may or may not think. He needed to bring her home to her family so that she can have a proper wake and burial. He wondered if she had ever thought about her death and what type of acknowledgement of her life she would have liked to have.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So many questions he would have to answer and he had none, not a single answer. He continued to pace in circles around Hannah trying to figure out his plan. He needed to slow down, take some deep breaths and calm down. Only then could he figure out how to get his Queen home where she belonged. Many possibilities occurred to him from a hostile take over, and burning her body to leaving her where she was and saying he hadn't seen her today. He wondered how many people knew he was with her today? Anyone? Too big a risk. Shaking his head he laughed. He might think all sorts of crazy things but the truth of the matter is that he loved his dear Queen Hannah and he would never do anything to hurt her in life or death. It was the old him thinking those thoughts. He was not that man any longer and hadn't been for some time. It still amazed him that this side of him was never really gone just buried and clearly not very deep. Resolved in his decision to return her home he quickly turned around to face the direction he heard a noise from, surly it was just Sunflower making her way back to her Queen? he wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah, you are alive!\" he screamed as tears of joy slid down his cheeks. He quickly brushed them away, it would do no good for his Queen to see how he loved her. Not to mention he was still getting used to the that he indeed loved her and was not ready to share it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet you damn fool of course I am alive. I swear sometimes Daniel you don't have the common sense you were born with! Now please be quiet I have one hell of a headache.\" said Hannah more harshly than intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood trickled down Hannah's face, her dress bodice and skirt were covered in bright red blood, it clearly wasn't just coming from her head. She sighed realizing just how badly injured she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen, please stay laying down. You are bleeding badly and you no doubt have a few broken bones. That was quite the accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a genius, is it this logic that I pay you so handsomely for?\" Hannah asked with her usual sarcasm dripping from each word. He had no idea what was up with her today, she was not herself that is for sure. Maybe those hold hags had cast a spell on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen, my apologies for insulting you. Of course you know that you are hurt. How badly my Queen? If you will allow me, I would like to assess and bandage your wounds as best as I can until we can get you back to the palace and the Doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on with it then, We have things to do. Now where did those damn hags get off to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, and don't look at me like that! What did you do with those damn hags. They have not given us the information that we are in such desperate need of\" Anger spewed fourth with each word she spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen, you ordered me to release the hags once they told us we were facing betrayal within our own ranks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release them, seriously how long have you known me now Daniel? Never would I allow such a valuable resource to be set free until I had everything they had to give, including their lives! Go back and find them NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen, it has been well over an hour I can assure you that they are no where to be found by now. I only did as I was ordered, if you have a problem then it is with yourself not me! Now, stop being a hysterical woman and let me take care of you and get those wounds looked at before you bleed to death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Hannah sat quiet. Was it possible? Her head was throbbing and she couldn't think clearly but there was something nagging at her. Something that said maybe just maybe he was telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are you waiting for Daniel, if I am bleeding so profusely that you are concerned I might die on you get me fixed up so we can get home. Now where did Sunflower get to?\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No my Queen, I called her but she refused to return. Whatever it was that spooked her did a damn good job of it. She took you for a good mile before she ran into that tree head first. You must have one hell of a headache, if you don't mind my saying. In fact you are one hell of a mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel held out his hand and helped Hannah into a sitting position, and she immediately vomited and lost consciousness again.</span></div></div>",

She raised her head and there was extreme pain in her head, \"Ow, damn it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are still irritated. Your blood pressure level was off the chart. There is something in your blood. . . Hmm, that explains your bi-polar behaviour in the previous few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's eyes shot open as she looked at her sideways to find Daniel sitting on a wooden chair, his hands clasped together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you talking about? What is all this?\" She tried to get up but she found herself struggling to get up, \"What . . . ?\" She searched around her to see why she couldn't get up and then the rattling and silver caught her eye. She was chained to the bed, both her hands and feet. This raged her, greatly as she began screaming,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL! DANIEL! I order you to free me, right now! I will kill you when I am free, I will not let you get away with this!\" She kept yelling as Daniel got up and walked out of the room. It was as if she was invisible to him, he couldn't hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel! Are you even listening to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like you are really angry. Good thing I can't hear you, otherwise, you would have destroyed my ears.\" Daniel spoke, grateful that he couldn't hear her voice, her mouthing showed obvious hatred and anger for him but after he spoke, those changed into utter confusion and sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be fine, Queen, there is someone who can help. Your Wizard. He is the one who did a few tests on you to find what was wrong with you. You were acting strangely, you fired up at everything, you were yelling, you had to be controlled. After you fell unconscious, I made sure I reached the kingdom before you woke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here we are, in the Wizard's dungeon. You have something blue, sparkling in your blood. Wizard says it is a spell, spell that was casted on your by one of the hag along with your memory loss.

The minutes ticked on, but felt like hours. How undignified that a Queen be treated in this manner. Does he not realize that she has a war to win, her House to protect and a kingdom to take over? Keeping her chained like some beggar off the streets, like some common criminal. Who is he working for? She tried to banish the thought from her mind. She had known him his whole life, he had dedicated himself to her long before she was Queen. Would he really betray her like this?  This was unacceptable and oh how her friend will pay. His job or his life that is the only question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she contemplated what to do with the wizard she fell asleep once more. Daniel watching fro a distance was glad, God she was wicked when she was like this. The wizard had best bring his Queen back to them because this woman was stark raving mad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire blue bubbles surrounded Hannah, she was overwhelmed by bubbles, she laughed, she cried, she swore, she got angry and then laughed again. Suddenly the bubbles popped and Hannah bolted to a sitting position. Stretching, heart racing, soaked through with sweat she woke shaking. That was the most bizare dream, but it triggered a memory. Something Daniel said earlier, blue in her blood driving her crazy. Could it be true? Is it possible that someone got past all of the defences and protections the wizard placed on her? She needed to know how, who and vowed revenge. Now if only she could get all of these jumbled thoughts from in her head so that she might speak her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a crack of light that flooded the dungeon, as the door slowly opened. Hannah struggled to stand, after all she needed to have some dignity but the way she was chained made it simply impossible. So she waited holding her breath. Who was it, it certainly wasn't Wiz he always arrives with a flourish and not known for making a entrance using a common door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel, is that you? Come here this instant and unlock me from this hell hole dungeon\" Queen Hannah demanded with a tone that made it clear she was serious and it was an order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some quiet shuffling, hushed voices and perhaps a scuffle. It was so hard to tell with her ears flooded with the sound of her racing heart. Damn what was this blue crap and what was it doing to her. She was now paranoid and feared for her life. How could she protect herself chained to the bed and wall by both wrists and ankles? This would never do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A queen was never used to, hell she was never, tied by chains to something where she couldn't more. Her wrists were sore and she was tired remaining at the same position. She imagined her wrists all red and swollen as the chains would go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will get you for this, Daniel, you just wait. . . \" Queen Hannah mumbled to herself as a sound caught her attention which made her head flung towards the source of a sound. There was a silhouette, a dark figure standing in the doorway, blocking the light from outside from coming in. She squinted her eyes and tried to adjust her vision to the darkness to get a good look at whoever it was. Guessing from the physique, he couldn't have been Daniel, even if it was him, he would have said something instead of standing in the doorway like a statue that was creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be the wizard but there was some kind of eerie feeling or aura that he gave, it sparked Hannah's sixth sense as she didn't think whatever was going on or will happen would be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Queen Hannah tried speaking with authority, power in her voice but she failed miserably. Instead it felt as if a small girl was pleading something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as the dark figure turned his head towards right as if observing her with humor, pleasure. It was creeping Hannah out and she wanted to be as away as she could from whoever it was, it was scaring her but she tried hard to conceal her feelings by balling his hands into a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so now you have forgotten me?\" The figure said. His voice was deep, he had that rich, silky tone. He spoke as if he was in control of the situation, the world, his experience seeping through. His voice might remind you of a stormy day, \"Ouch - you hurt me, darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know who you are, whatever delusion you are in, you need to get out of it, love.\" Queen Hannah spoke as her stomach churned and she wasn't sure why she was reacting this way and no matter how much she wanted to shake this feeling off, she couldn't. She somehow found his voice familiar, as if he was someone close to her, someone she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I used to love how you called me 'love' and now, looks like your memories are finally coming back! I am delighted!\" The figure clapped in appreciation as he stepped closer to Queen Hannah and sat a few steps away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you show your face, you coward? What are you afraid of? Why don't you show yourself and then maybe I might remember?\" Queen Hannah challenged, she was curious, the thought that he could see her when she couldn't see any part of him disturbed her. She wanted a hint, a clue to which she could get him afterwards when he ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, challenging, I loved that about you too, you know I loved you and still do. I am so glad we can talk now.\" He turned his face once again and this time Hannah got a good look at his eyes, they were golden in colour, reddish golden, 'what a strange and beautiful combination.' Hannah thought to herself and then mentally slapped herself for calling him beautiful, he spoke again interrupting her thoughts,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid I can't show you myself, not yet anyway, you need to know some things before I show you myself. You need to discover me yourself, you are destined to. . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you saying. .  . \" Queen Hannah didn't get to complete her sentence as she saw him get up and head for the door, \"Wait! Where are you going?! Stay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, love, but I have to go, there are some things I must tend to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about all the things you said? I can't solve this puzzle without all pieces! I need to know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would be interested in getting back your memories. You will get those in your dreams, look carefully in them and remember them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you are saying, I have all my memories, they were never erased. . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that you would remember. . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he said that, he closed the room, all the light that there was in the room closed as the wind forced the flame of the candle to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is everyone leaving hints? Why can't anyone tell to me everything straight forward?\" She groaned, still tied with the chains.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n809 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

These hours felt like centuries. It was then she was hindrance in the light she could see from below the door, as if someone was there. She waited patiently, not getting her hopes up high and then the knob turned as the door opened revealing Daniel standing on the other side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time you came, Daniel, I thought you'd left me,\" Queen Hannah spoke sarcastically putting emphasis on 'left' as she spoke. Daniel could taste the venom in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you know I did it to keep myself safe and besides you needed to be treated, whatever made you so snarky and bi-polar needed to be removed from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, have you now?!\" She yelled, mocking him but his answer surprised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" He simply stated as if there was no need for any kind of explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait - how do you know if it has been removed from me?\" She pointed her fingers at herself as she spoke, \"See, I am still flaming, snarky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made Daniel laugh as he clutched his stomach and continued to laugh like a maniac. \"What the hell, Daniel? This isn't funny, I am serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes - yes, I know you are quite serious, it's just that, it was funny,\" He straightened up as he heaved a huge sigh, \"The wizard made sure of that, now all your snarky-ness, is definitely because of the anger of being kept and chained here, nothing more. You'll get over it, I believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so full of yourself.\" She stuck her tongue out at him, \"Hmm, what if I don't get over it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, then I guess I will have to chain you again and for longer period of time than I have right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah immediately jumped up, trying to stand but the chains stopped her as she fell down with a thump, \"NO! You can't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, talking like that will only get you into trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. I am sorry, I beg you, please don't do this again, I hate being tied in chains. Now please will you open them?\" She made her puppy eyes as she watched Daniel who was eyeing her up and down, his brow raised, this was amusing to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good girl,\" Daniel remarked as Queen Hannah's lips turned into a tight smile. She decided to keep quiet as she watched Daniel fumble keys out of his pocket and then step closer to her. He sat in front of her as he worked the chains off. As soon as they were off, Queen Hannah rubbed them, they were red but not sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are lucky these weren't swollen.\" She showed her wrists to him as he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, lucky me. Okay, let's get a move on, we need to discuss a lot of things that happened while you were here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I need to talk about whoever he was who came in here to the wizard too, I need to see him now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you mean there was someone who came in here? You mean me? The wizard already knows about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not you. There was someone else, someone I didn't know but he knew me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I told you, he seemed to know me and called me all kinds of endearing words which I ddin't like at all. I wanted to see him myself but he said it was my fate and destiny to discover him, he wouldn't show himself. He was pitch black, all I could see was his reddish-golden eyes and nothing else, just a silhouette.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's . . . very strange. It's not possible. You must be imagining it.\" Daniel spoke as he got up and turned the light on in the room as the room was lighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are saying I am crazy?!\" She yelled at him, taking a look at him properly after a lot of days \"Get me the wizard right now, we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have loved to carry our your order but unfortunately, the wizard isn't here.\" Queen Hannah noticed the criticism in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you mean he is not here?\" She asked, utterly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He left, a few hours ago, he was acting strange and he said he needed to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you just let him leave? Just like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I tried to stop him but he said it was very important. No big deal, he said he will be back after a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't exactly see him right now . . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are putting a lot of trust into someone you don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then do you know him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah didn't speak. She got up and then headed for her room. She was in a dungeon in her own castle, she had been there once but not more, she made her way directly into her bedroom and then lay there as she slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw strange symbols, she thought that she knew some of them, the language seemed familiar but at the same time, she didn't know what it was, she tried to understand it but nothing and then soon she woke up to find her in her bed, \"It was a dream. . . he said it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know what the symbols meant but she had to do something about them.<br>\r\n</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n932 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The symbols she had just seen were floating all over her drowsy mind, even as she tried to block them \u2013 those random crisscrosses each of varying color, varying size and each rotating at a different angle.  It is the crisscrosses she remembered out of the near hundreds of symbols which had visited her subconscious mind only the crisscrosses managed to imprint them on her mind. But why, she wondered. She knew that she needed to talk about it to the Wizard but something in her told that probably she needed to do it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQueen Hannah,\u201d it was Daniel who stood on the door of her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a moment, Daniel,\u201d she said, as she went to wash her face to freshen up. She splashed her face twice or thrice till she could no longer see those crisscrosses buzzing her mind. As the cold water met the warm face of hers the instant connection of two opposites made her forget the symbols for a while. She splashed her face again till she felt much better than what she was feeling before. She took a deep breath to live the moment but sadly it couldn\u2019t last long. That relief proved to be momentary as the symbols started to collide against the walls of her brain again. Even as she changed into her purple robe \u2013 her favorite robe which generally got her in the jolliest of moods - the symbols just wouldn\u2019t go away, almost as if they had stuck themselves against the canvas of her eyes. A sigh escaped her lips as the feeling of being overwhelmed was now started to seep into his consciousness again. It was a curious situation for her because her stressed out mind wanted to share the secrets of the symbols with the Wizard but her innocent heart told her otherwise. And she was a heart person, by miles and she didn\u2019t even try to reason her heart. A smile floated across her lips as she was now somewhat piece considering that she had made her mind about what to do with her new \u2018friends\u2019. She smiled looking herself in the mirror to avoid that plastic smile that people sometime pass on to anybody in sight and then, walked out of the room to meet Daniel. And then, as she saw Daniel she had a smile ready for him. Daniel bowed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs the Wizard back, Daniel?\u201d she started the conversation from where they had left before. Her voice had a finality and a firmness about it which hinted that saying \u2018No\u2019 was not an option \u2013 at least for her ears.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Queen the Wizard is back,\u201d Daniel said with a smile, thanking his stars for the return of the Wizard just moments before he set off meeting Queen Hannah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah smiled back but said nothing, which surprised Daniel a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr-Would you like to meet him, Queen Hannah?\u201d Daniel said, almost biting his tongue as he said it. After all he was a spy and it was way beyond his powers to be suggesting something or anything to the Queen and that too as they stood face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah noticed that fleeting moment of repent in Daniel. She said \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Daniel but I would sure like to talk to you for some while,\u201d she kept her tone as casual as possible so that it wouldn\u2019t seem to be out of place to Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Queen. What can I do for you?\u201d Daniel did a little bow as the gentlest of smile decorated his lips.<br>\r\nQueen Hannah went towards the table where a large Silvery Jug full of water was kept. Daniel came running towards her, lifted the Jug almost snatching it out her hands and pouring the water into a glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWater - Queen Hannah?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah was almost surprised by Daniel but she understood what she was doing. She waved her hand to signal \u2018no\u2019. Daniel kept the jug back on the table, a bit surprised, perhaps, as he took two step back. Queen Hannah poured the water out of the Jug onto the floor to form a tiny little puddle on the floor. Daniel looked on not understanding a single thing but he dare not interrupt her. He kept his eyes fixed on Queen Hannah who took her feet out of her leather shoes and dipped her toe into the puddle. Seemingly she was drawing something on the floor but at present it just seemed like random collection of lines to him. He wondered what the Queen was up to and whether this was a prank being played on him. Just then, she looked towards Daniel and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me, do you see anything?\u201d she pointed towards the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was already looking towards the figure on the floor, which had a curious shape alright a collection of many hashes (#) probably but meant nothing more. He moved around a bit, trying to make sense of it but nothing seemed to work. He didn\u2019t understand it one bit and his face told it all to Queen Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said and then changed them a bit, so that it looked like a collection of walking stick crisscrossed by straight lines. It made more sense than the previous figures but still not something in which he saw any meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow?\u201d she asked, her eyes a little expectant of something which would ease the burden of her mind; sadly though, no such relief came her way when Daniel moved his head sideways. When he saw the disappointment in Hannah\u2019s eyes he felt so bad that he blurted gibberish \u2013 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo \u2013 no, like I can see sticks \u2013 no, swords of those Kings from \u2013 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop Daniel,\u201d she smiled. She knew what Daniel was doing, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to say something just because I want it to work, okay?\u201d Daniel nodded and Hannah continued, \u201cYou tell me when you really see something, fine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel sensed the desperation in Queen\u2019s voice despite her calm demeanor. She stooped low now, to draw those symbols which she saw in her mind, as accurately as possible. She closed her eyes to remember them in their finest details and then a smile flashed across her face. With the right thumb she struck through the mishmash of symbols she had drawn until now. Then, moving to the other side of the symbol she dipped the thumb in one of the stick shaped symbols and changed to look it more like an arrow. She did it for three other symbols and walked a little further away from the symbol. She tilted her head a little to the left, analyzed it from that angle and then asked Daniel to have a look at only the first three symbols, at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel moved towards the symbol, and saw it with his head bent to the left but saw nothing. He then tilted his head left and although it didn\u2019t made complete sense to him he at least knew that he had seen something of this sort somewhere. He walked even closer to the symbol and sat on his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Daniel,\u201d Daniel jerked his head towards Hannah and saw that she had her right thumb raised to her eyes, \u201cDo this now,\u201d she gestured him to rub both of his eyes with his right thumb. Daniel found it silly, a bit childish perhaps, but a Queen\u2019s order is a Queen\u2019s order after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill sitting where he was, he rubbed his left eye as quickly as he could, perhaps a bit embarrassed by what he was doing. Queen Hannah smiled at this urgency of Daniel as he rubbed his right eye too with an even more urgency than the first. All Daniel could see now was crisscrosses floating randomly, piercing each other but it lasted just for a second. However, it was good enough for him to notice something fishy in those few seconds. He rubbed his eyes again, vigorously this time in excitement more than anything. He saw those floating images again, swirling right in front of him as if trying to talk to him. In fact, one of them swam right across his left eye\u2019s view and then, just when it was to disappear into his eye he saw two little eyes appear in that symbol, a tiny stubby nose and finally, a horrific mouth which was wide open, as if trying to suck his soul. Daniel closed his eyes shut in horror and the color of his face turned not a pleasant shade of white. His heart beat was rushing ahead like a train on steroids and he felt like even Queen Hannah could hear it beat. He slowly stood up and looked at Queen Hannah who stood beaming nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel had still not recovered from the shock and his eyes grew wider with every passing second. Queen Hannah stood their smiling as if waiting for Daniel to say it. When he opened his mouth to say it, Queen Hannah joined and they both said it together, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Silvery Ghosts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel couldn\u2019t believe what his eyes had just seen. He had seen the ghosts which going by the rumor had wiped of the practitioners of Voodoo magic from Stark some one and a half century ago. The ghosts didn\u2019t stop at that \u2013 they cursed the Stark Realm which resulted in ravaging of Stark House by the ravenous Kingdoms across the seven seas.  If it were not for Queen Hannah\u2019s great grandmother who was a white voodoo magic practician, herself, the Ghosts would have chomped off member after member, citizen after citizen of the Stark Realm.  But they had been gone for over three decades now so why did he see them in the pure air of the Stark? And worse even, why did Queen Hannah even ask him about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will tell you why, Daniel,\u201d Hannah said, as she understood the myriad questions going on in Daniel\u2019s mind. She told him the complete story of the symbols, how she had started to see them in his sleep as well as while he was wide awake. She then told him how she had found the key to the encrypted symbols just when she drew those symbols for him and a little insect hit her eye; that little insect which changed everything. She had to rub it out from her eyes and that is when she noticed the symbols having those impressions of silvery ghosts for the first time. Daniel still wanted to know that why they were seeing it now, was it anyway related to the Silvery Ghosts massacre, and should he be prepared to for an emergency in near future \u2013 he wanted an answer for all of those questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that question, Queen Hannah had nothing much to offer apart from a look which said that she was busy reaching to the root cause of all the questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1818 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\"But how can it connect to the person who came to me?\" All kinds of questions ran in her mind as she wondered once again who was he. His golden-reddish eyes came in front of her eyes as she found them exquisite and beautiful, they were mesmerizing, it was as if it were actually there and not just a figment of her memory. She looked deep into them as they sucked her further in them, they were deep like e blue sea but the sea wasn't blue this time, it was red, like the sea was on flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes squinted at me through hardened eyes, their color had only yesterday reminded me of my sea-port home, gazing out to where the blue of the ocean blended into the red-orange sky that was there in sunset, it made her feel hot. Every muscle in his face was tense and without a word it seemed like his eyes were communicating, he communicated mysterious emotions, hope, glint of love, amusement and teasing. They seemed to bore into her as she looked into them and nearly lost herself She felt herself falling, she tried to look away from them but she failed terribly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard a voice, the same voice of the dark stranger, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Silvery ghosts will return,<br>\r\nas everyone else will burn,<br>\r\njust like they did before, until the time they were tied<br>\r\nbut now they are free, they have not died.<br>\r\nFury will drive them, as they set everything on fire,<br>\r\nworking with someone, they will get what they require.<br>\r\nThe symbols are from ancient language of magic,<br>\r\nlong before you were born, centuries old.<br>\r\nEach of them represent a famous story,<br>\r\na famous person, a legend, a place.<br>\r\nI am sure you will be able to connect the dots,<br>\r\nyou are smart, I know you can do it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Hannah?\" There was a faint sound but it wasn't enough to break her from her reverie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Hannah!\" This time she felt jerked wildly as she opened her eyes to find a frantic looking Daniel looking at her, concern written all over his face as his gaze lingered on her face, asking the question if she was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am fine, just, just thinking something deeply. Were you saying something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was asking you what should we do now. These symbols can mean anything. We have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't have an idea then but we have an idea now. We have to look for ancient magic books and match each of the symbol with something significant, something famous, something known. . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a legend! A place, a person, I don't know, anything famous that was popular.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get this head start? How did you know?\" She watched as Daniel's eyebrows furrowed and he questioned. Hannah knew that she would have to tell him at some point about everything but she figured now was not the time, there were other things that needed to be done, she didn't need to tell him anything right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's call it a hunch, a sixth sense. Let's get started, shall we? How about from the library?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the back side of the library which was closed and no one ever went there. Dust collected everywhere as far as they could see, spider webs wove loosely around books, dirtied shelves, and stands. The ground was littered with dirt, glass, books, and torn paper. Dust floated lazily in the air causing them a difficult time breathing, and every step put more of it in to the air. All that was heard were the faint chirps of birds outside, the scurrying feet of invisible rodents, and the rustling of papers catching the draft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's so dirty, no one ever comes here to use this anymore. My great great grandmother last used it but then it was closed ever since because new magic books came, latest, modern techniques so we pushed them further at the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries at all, I can understand that. I am glad there are no spiders!\" Daniel laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you are afraid of spiders?!\" Hannah laughed and hit him playfully on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said that! Anyway, we need to find anything related to those symbols.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's get started on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both went different ways searching for old magic books. Those were rare so it was easy to spot them in the royal library. The royal library had every book there ever was. The books were old and heavy, the leathers felt soft and delicate as she ran her fingers over the faded blue bindings. She fingered the gold lettering carefully before she opened the cover, paper rustled as she thumbed through the book to find what she was looking for. Words appeared and disappeared as her eyes flitted across the pages, quickly picking out anything of importance from the jumble of sentences that littered the world she had become immersed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent hours in the library working out the symbols and matching them to something significant and at last, they had some progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! Found it!\" Daniel spoke enthusiastically as he took the book and stood near Hannah showing her what he had found. It was the same symbol and the story of the Silvery Ghosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we already know this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there are things that I didn't know, perhaps you didn't know too. There are some things that we did too that provoked the ghosts to attack us so cruelly. . . \"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n928 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Queen Hannah, alert was ever, spotted it and looked at the Hag, with the threatening eyes reserved for the liars and buffoons alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHag looked at the Spy and opened her little mouth to ask his name, \"What do people call you?\" she said, looking at him, with a twinkle in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spy took offence to it; not the question per-se but the fact that as ugly and as old a woman as her was flirting with him. But then he considered the fact that something was better than nothing. He smiled a bit before opening his mouth to answer her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah had other plans though. It wasn't as if she was possessive or anything but just the fact that she had spotted something which hid amoral spy had missed.<br>\r\n\u201cLady Aqua of Martell has been trying to impress the Stark realm since ages,\u201d Hannah murmured with gnashed teeth, \u201cThey want my friendship, our support and our vision to conquer this world. That is what I know for sure. Did they send you too, little bony hag?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHag knew she had someone uncommonly wise to deal with. She wondered what made Hannah sense it \u2013 whether it was that the lie was too good to believe or was it her over acting which gave way to the revealing of the truth. Hag believed too much in her own acting abilities to doubt herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was stretching the facts a little too far, anyway. How could I have fooled the Enlightened Queen Hannah herself with it! And see, how silly it sounded when it came out!\u201d she chuckled before mocking what she said earlier , making silliest of faces which would have made the naughtiest kid in Martel kingdom proud, \u201cThere's something growing in the East, a power, a power that's good, bright led by Lady Aqua of the Martell\u201d\u201d she chuckled, yet again, laughing uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah looked at her, wondering all the while whether Hag was under a magic spell of the dark kingdom. She knew that Queen Aqua of Martell wouldn\u2019t do it because she had a good heart after all, not as good a heart as Queen Hannah\u2019s of course but second best probably which was a complement in itself. Queen Hannah looked at the spy in her service. He too looked flummoxed, a bit scared too as he believed the Hag to be contacting some \u201cSuper Silly Black Souls\u201d from the beyond. The souls of this kind were the worst types and everybody knew it. These silly black souls were known to tell jokes, one after another, which were so pathetic that a word hasn\u2019t been coined till date to describe their level. It made the cortex of the listener feel hammered, pounded and crushed. In some cases, it also made them curse the God who placed it inside a human body. <br>\r\nThe soul is a little thicker skinned in these situations - no matter how much ironical that may sound but it is the truth. The soul can will itself against the onslaught of the stupidity for a much longer time but after all the silly dark soul are not prefixed with Super for nothing. They were known to have over a million mega-ton of joke in their bags; not a real bag, of course because it would be too environment unfriendly to make a bag this big. The onslaught this big could cause any soul to escape the body using any natural outlets; in fact, in some cases it has been seen that the soul makes a passage of its own to escape from such ghastly experiences. A chill ran down the spine of the spy until it reached an unhygienic part of the body encountering which it ran back up and left the body via the spy\u2019s little dumb head. Spy\u2019s spine simply surprised (the) standing stupid spy (and probably said \u201cLook how good I am at alliteration\u201d) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hag on the other hand realized that she must be looking crazy, much crazier than she actually was, as she was smiling for over ten minutes now. It was not as if she had time crunch or had something to do but doing same thing for over five minutes probably bored her. (Possibly, she was the first person to show the same symptoms as those prevalent in twentieth century people who say they are multitasking but in reality are doing nothing other than surfing the web and digging their nose as they peer out of their office window every two minutes.) She thought for a while about her failed task before making peace with the fact that Lady Aqua of Martell would assuredly kick her out of service. But she knew she wasn\u2019t the first lady who failed in this almost impossible task; the task to get the Queen of Stark on her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n{824 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkb.png\" alt=\"*Checkb*\" title=\"Checkb\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come on, where's the knife?\" Hannah spoke again, trying to get his attention but it didn't have any effect on him, at least not on the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?!\" She went to him, jerking his shoulders, which did the trick of getting his attention, \"What <i>is</i> wrong with you?!\" The spy looked back at her, his features confused, as he looked at Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE KNIFE,\" Hannah spoke again, emphasizing on each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, y-your M-majesty. . . \" The spy began fumbling for the knife in his pockets, his hands trembling for some reason Hannah was unaware of. At the same time when he was searching for the knife, she heard her laugh again, worse this time, it almost sounded like a scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you didn't tie her mouth either, what is wrong with you?! Why are you not here with us? Never mind, I need her to scream right now, scream all you want, witch.\" Hannah was enraged; the hag's explainable and creepy behaviour was intolerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me hag, you know something I don't, don't you?\" She stepped closer to her as the hag backed away, sticking as near to the tree as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? Speak!\" Hannah held the knife to her throat which would have scared a normal person but the hag wasn't normal, she wasn't a person. She still had that evil grin on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think Queen Aqua of Martell is behind <i>this</i>? You know nothing, honey. Go live a luxurious life in your castle.\" The hag tried to wave her off with her tied hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like death, hag? Do you crave it?\" Hannah threatened her, still there was no effect on the hag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can scare me queen? Nah, <i>he</i>'s the one who everyone should be scared of him. Queen Aqua is already arranging her troops against him, you stand no chance alone, none of you kingdoms do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the hag screamed, tears of blood falling from her eyes. Hannah dropped the knife and stepped back, wondering what was happening. Both the spy and Hannah put their hands on their ears to try and block out the shrill scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hag's eyes went pitch black and then all of a sudden turned into ashes. \"What the . . . \" The spy looked in horror, not believing his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to go, Queen, I know you might not agree with me but I think for once, we should believe the hag, we need to be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you suggest we unite with Martell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should, what harm could they do to us anyway? You yourself said they are a peaceful nation, one that does everything fair and square.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like that's the only choice. We need to eliminate this evil before it wipes and destroys everyone we love, no matter how. Let's move to Martell territory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't they attack us, though?\" The spy looked questioningly at Hannah, who was examining the hag's ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, if we don't do anything stupid or take our weapons out.\" Hannah got up and walked towards the spy, handing him his knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how do you know?\" The spy asked hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been there before.\" Hannah simply replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's get moving then, Queen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>663 words</b> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkb.png\" alt=\"*Checkb*\" title=\"Checkb\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

He moved toward Tora \u2013 Queen Hannah\u2019s Royal Horse \u2013 and patted his head. Tora neighed back gently, and lowered his head. The Spy patted his head once more and then proceeded to adjust the saddle of the Royal horse. He then proceeded towards his own horse, Zora. Then, as he stooped a little to check the stirrup, he saw Queen Hannah from the corner of his eyes - standing near the Hag\u2019s ashes. She seemed to be in her contemplative self, murmuring something to herself and staring at the nothingness which stood in front of her. Spy stood up; he was concerned for her as he had never seen her like this before. <br>\r\nEquanimity and poise was her second nature. After all, she was known to never give away her moments of hesitation,   leave alone these limp moments of weaknesses. The fact that she had never let that mask slip even once in her numerous public appearances and interactions made it even harder for the Spy to comprehend Queen Hannah\u2019s behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe coughed a little to draw Queen Hannah\u2019s attention but that didn\u2019t do anything. A louder cough followed but yet nothing changed. In fact, he saw that Queen Hannah was now stooping to inspect the Hag\u2019s ashes from up close.  He wondered what the wisest of souls could glean out from a sweltering pile of ashes. For some unexplained reason, he was worried about the effects the proximity to ash could have on the Queen. His heart then leaped to his mouth as she saw Queen Hannah digging her right feet into the tiny hill of ash lying in front of her. He felt he had to do something more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drew a long breath, lowered his head and said in the gentlest of voice- \u201cYour Highness,\u201d and Queen looked at him. Spy flashed a courteous smile and said - \u201cYour Highness, we can move to the land of the Martell, anytime you want. We are ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah nodded, and dipped her hand into the pile of ash and filled into the decanter, tied to the saddle of her Horse. She gave it to the spy to keep it with him. He wondered about it but didn\u2019t have the courage to ask the reason about it; moreover, he was happy that the ashes were at least at a safe distance now from the beloved Queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n****   ******         *** **        **** ****<br>\r\n It had been an hour since they had started to gallop towards Kingdom Martell, saddled on the back of their muscular black horses from the point where they met Hag. Their bodies were moving away from that point did but their mind was still contemplating what they just saw; the crony Hag, mysterious hysteria, tears of blood, Hag\u2019s words and her disappearance into ashes. It was way too much to digest all of it, or even parts of it. More so, it had happened rather too quickly to register it at that time. It was only now that it all was sinking in; burning the brain and the senses as it seeped into their conscious mind. What a night! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat all it changed! What remained unchanged though was that there would be ally between the kingdoms soon. And together, the House Martel and House Stark could take down the choicest of battalion of the most Savage Army of the worlds. It made Queen Hannah smile.

There was more to what Hannah was showing and the spy swore that he would find it out, one way or the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Highness, why did you hand me this decanter?\" Daniel, the spy, spoke, intending to start a casual conversation that could give hints, some answers to his questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah didn't answer immediately, Daniel thought she hadn't heard him until she spoke after inhaling a deep breath, \"You saw me, didn't you? I know I can't lie now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was dumbstruck, he didn't know what he should say, he assumed Queen Hannah would hide it, or at least not mention about it until he asked directly about it. Hannah turned her head to her left to look at him, waiting for his response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I saw you,\" Daniel replied and then Queen Hannah straightened her head and continued to see in the front. There was complete silence for a moment and then Queen Hannah broke it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was I doing?\" Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Daniel was confused, he was worried that he might give an answer that might displease the Queen, he knew she did not harm her people but then again, he wasn't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you see?

It was if that her soul had drifted to some other realm, some other universe; she was somewhere which had scarred her \u2013 her past, probably. Daniel looked at her and wondered whether he had touched a raw nerve. He hated himself for it because he knew that Queen Hannah was the as warm hearted and nice as they come in Royal Blood. He stole a glance at Queen Hannah, more to ask forgiveness than anything else, but was taken aback to see Queen Hannah\u2019s lips curved into a feeble smile. He wondered whether Queen Hannah was really happy or was it her famed mask at work. But something about the smile told her that it was genuine. What was she thinking about? Daniel looked ahead towards the dusty road on which their horses were galloping away. He wondered about the reason behind it. Before he knew it, the past events had revisited his brain cells and soon he was lost in them. Daniel didn\u2019t fight them too; maybe, it was the best possible way to fight the time of this eternal journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome two miles later, Daniel\u2019s ears heard anything apart from the galloping and the neighing of the horses. It was the sweet sound of a gurgling of a river stream. It seemed like music to their barren ears. Such was the purity and the calmness of the gurgling that it not only broke Queen Hannah\u2019s oneirism but it washed over her soul, too. She leant slightly back and gently pulled the reins of Tora, her splendid black horse. Tora gave out a gentle neigh and soon came to a gracious halt. Daniel, who was some ten feet behind her, pulled the reins of Zora and brought his horse to rest too.<br>\r\n\u201cWould the Royal Highness wish to have a sip or two from this fresh stream?\u201d  Daniel glanced towards Queen Hannah, more to see is she was at peace than to get an answer for this. To his surprise, she not only nodded but smiled, too; that same warm smile which he was accustomed to see on her charming face. She went towards Tora, untied the gold carved vessel, and handled it to Daniel. Daniel felt much more at peace having seen her return to her usual self after what seemed like an aeon. He smiled back, did a courteous little bow and turned to move towards the river. That is when he heard those words which he was to remember for his whole life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe had royal blood in her veins,\u201d Queen Hannah said in the gentlest of voices, almost as if she was sorry for having said it, but it hit Daniel like a torpedo. His steps froze in their place and a stroke of lightning ran through his body. He jerkily turned back to look at the Queen; she stood their smiling and looking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was my sister \u2013 half-sister from my other Queen Mother, Jia,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-so what w-went \u2013 \u201c was all what Daniel managed to get out before Queen Hannah completed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWrong? Do you want to ask what went wrong?\u201d she asked, with her head bowed and stream of salt flowing down her rosy cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was cursed when in the womb of Queen Jia,\u201d was all she managed to say before a train of sobs took the rest of her sentence down. Still sobbing profusely, she walked a bit farther from where Daniel stood. She kept moving towards the river stream nearby. From where Daniel stood, he could still see Queen Hannah wiping her tears. After such unfortunate moments had passed, she kneeled down on the gravel beneath her and buried her face in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel didn\u2019t know what hit him and stood in his place, stunned and with his mind buzzing with questions. Of course, he couldn\u2019t go and offer Queen Hannah her shoulder. Nor he had the courage to ask her who did it. All he did know was that the Queen Hannah needed somebody to listen to her. He made a dash to the river. He stooped to swoop in the cold water into the Golden Vessel and instantly felt the freshness of the river hit his mind and soul. He made a quick splash of the water on his face and then dashed to where Queen Hannah was. Hannah was not sobbing now and she was looking towards the river - her eyes red as a drowning sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Daniel said, and offered her the vessel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah took the vessel and poured some of it onto her face. She then looked at Daniel and said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaniel, nobody in the whole kingdom has even an inkling about it,\u201d Daniel nodded, \u201cTake it as your Queen\u2019s order to lock this secret in the darkest chambers of your hearts and throw away its key into the deepest of oceans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel nodded again. So was this the reason she took her ashes with her? Daniel had a feeling that it was not the case. But, who knows, it could well be that too. It had been that kind of couple of days, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah put the vessel to her lips to quench her thirst. After a few sips, she got up and started to walk alone towards the bank of the river. Daniel got up to follow her but Queen made a quick gesture with his hands to Daniel to not do it. She wanted solitude, probably. She kept moving towards the river and paused a little while. Daniel wondered what she was contemplating about. After a few more idle moments, she went further into the river and was soon in knee depth water. Daniel\u2019s concern grew with each passing moment. Right there, standing in the knee depth water, she took out the decanter which had the ashes of the Hag in it. She looked at it for a while, kissed it and then sprinkled some of the ashes there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1017 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They moved in the air and Daniel saw them touch the surface of the water. He was going to turn but then something caught his eye - the ashes shouldn't stay on the surface of the water, they should have sunk in the water. There was something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately turned his head to Queen Hannah who's mouth hung open as she watched the ashes settle around her in a perfect circle. She turned her head quickly, looking at Daniel in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?!\" Daniel shouted as the vicinity around the Queen began to shin, sprinkle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea, this is not good, definitely not good.\" Queen Hannah tried to make her way back to the dry land but instead she found herself stuck here, to that point. With each passing second, the sprinkling glowed and it only added to Daniel's concern. Then, Queen Hannah looked at Daniel, her expression gave away that she knew something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel, which river is this?\" Queen Hannah asked, her eyes wide, as she mumbled, \"Please don't be that, please don't be that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Reborn River. . . Why do you ask?\" Daniel looked at her, confusion on his face. As soon as Daniel spoke the name of the river, there was a scream, a shrill scream. . . and it was Queen Hannah's. \"No! No! What have I done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Queen? What is going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an enchanted river! It brings someone from the dead, someone who died by some one else's magic and the river is undoing it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you are saying that the hag . . . I mean your sister is alive?\" Everything Daniel was hearing and seeing, it didn't make any kind of sense for him, he was utterly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but she will be, now.\" Queen Hannah spoke calmly, Daniel couldn't understand why she was so calm, she wasn't even trying to struggle against the water's hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can we do to stop it? Wait, I am coming!\" Daniel pulled up his pants and moved forward to step in the water but stopped after hearing Queen Hannah's voice, \"No! You will get involved in the magic spell too! We both will end up in the decanter! We can do nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then what can we do? How will you make it? Why are you being circled?\" Daniel had so many questions and he didn't hesitate to voice them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a price for every magic, Daniel, even if it is an unintentional act, I never meant to wake her up again, I wanted her to be trapped here, she needs to be caged somewhere she can never hurt anyone else. I stepped in the water with the decanter, I freed her ashes, I let them fall on the water. As soon I stepped in water with my feet and the decanter in my hand, I was tied to this magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happens to you?\" All this was now making sense for Daniel, he got the main idea but still, he didn't know what he should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a price, one that I will now pay. . . \" Queen Hannah didn't complete her sentence, even shew as wondering how calm she was, why wasn't she struggling? Did she want to get away from the world and be trapped? Did she wish solitude and distance? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is that price, Queen Hannah?\" Daniel's voice brought Hannah out of her deep train of thoughts and questions. She was getting tired of his questions but he was right in asking them, he would get her out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was done to her. . . I will turn into ash like she did, in this decanter, and she will come into a body, her own body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God. Pardon my tongue but what the hell are we going to do?! What should I do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not die, just like Leah, my sister, didn't. I will turn into ash, I will be trapped in this decanter. Take the decanter to the Martells, they will find a way to get me out, their magic and intentions are purest. Please.\" Queen Hannah pleaded, tears burning at the end of her eyes as she spoke in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I will make sure of that.\" Daniel promised, trying to be comforting and helpful at the moment. He couldn't think of anything else, anything that he could do, Hannah had told him what he must do but for now, there was nothing. He had never seen a magic occur in front of his eyes, this was the first time and he was both shocked and amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said that, a storm rose from the water, a tornado, with strong wind blowing that pushed and threw Daniel far from the water where he lay unconscious. Queen Hanna had a sad expression on her face, she looked at the storm surrounding her, the storm that soon turned into flames and engulfed her, then it ended, leaving nothing but ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no one else, the silence mocked the scenery as the decanter floated on the surface of the water and Daniel lay unconscious on the murky floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel had no idea how much time had passed since he lost his conscious. He couldn't remember anything, he groaned as he got up and rubbed his wrists and cleaned the mud off his clothes. He recalled everything that had happened and immediately he looked in the water to see no one, Queen Hannah wasn't there, she had turned into ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout stopping for a second, he made his way to the water as he fumbled furiously to search for the decanter which had Queen Hannah's ashes. If he didn't find it, Queen Hannah would forever be trapped inside the decanter and never get out, her life was in Daniel's hands. As he splashed the water and looked for the decanter, his hands passed over something, it was the decanter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank the gods, I've found it!\" He heaved a sigh of relief and dashed outside the water so that he does not end up the same way as the Queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I have to go to Martell Kingdom.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1052 words</b> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

As he went up close, he could see that Tora\u2019a eyes were watery. Daniel\u2019s heart sunk when he saw it and tears of pain build up in his own eyes too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went towards Tora who turned his neck to look towards Daniel, as he came. With his throat choking, Daniel patted Tora\u2019s forehead and then hugged him, wrapping up Tora\u2019 neck in his arms. Tora leaned into his hug, perhaps trying to listen what Daniel\u2019s heart wanted to say and let out a feeble neigh as if to say \u201cI understand\u201d. Daniel caressed Tora\u2019 neck and placed a peck on his forehead. Tora looked straight into his eyes as if ascertaining whether Daniel wanted to say anything more. <br>\r\n\u201cI \u2013 no we \u2013 we will bring back our Queen, together,\u201d was what Daniel could say before the lump in his throat made it impossible for him to speak any more. He carefully tied the decanter in the saddle of Tora and then kissed his forehead again. Tora blinked his eyes as the reply for his love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel wiped away his tears and then moved to his own horse Zora who was sitting on the gravel. Zora saw Daniel coming from the corner of the eyes and started to stand up. Zora seemed to be abnormally restless and swished his tail back and forth. Daniel patted him and murmured, \u201cI won\u2019t leave you here, Darling. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d Zora neighed back. Daniel knew that both Zora and Nora were trained to return to castles if the riders commanded them to do so. But just the fact that they would pass through the deepest of forests filled with wild animals and evil spirits in their return journey meant that he couldn\u2019t allow them to go to the Stark Realm on their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I do then?\u201d \u2013 Daniel said to himself and as he wondered aloud he heard Zora and Tora neighing back to him, almost at the same time. Daniel smiled. He walked upto Zora, adjusted the saddle, placed his left boot in the stirrup and swung his legs up to climb it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCare to follow me, Zora?\u201d he said, turning towards his right, where Zora looked on intently. He was not sure about it but in his mind he believed that Zora gave him a gentle nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~###~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning Sun had just come out to defeat the darkness when Daniel first a saw a shining monument, in front of him. When the juvenile sunrays fell on the golden dome of the castle, they made it glow in a mesmeric, warm rosy hue which could be felt - rather than seen - from miles away. It was if it was meant to be felt rather than inhabited.  A peace, an air of calmness surrounded Daniel and made him feel so much at home; after all, the beauty of the Martel Castle could only have been met with none other than Stark\u2019s Castle itself. He could only have a partial view of the castle through the gatehouse which stood in between him and the castle now but whatever he saw he couldn\u2019t have enough of it. He stood their gazing at it for several moments. There was something in the view which made his heart smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, he gestured to the Queen\u2019s horse and together the three moved closer to the gatehouse. What glistening carving on the walls of the gatehouse to the castle! He didn\u2019t expect to be astonished by a gatehouse of a castle as generally the gatehouses are considered to be the ugliest thing surrounding the castle. Given what he had seen on the gatehouse, made him wonder about the elegance that he would see when upon entering the Castle itself. His gaze then fell of some dozen soldiers who stood nearby the huge bronze doors of the gatehouse. There was something about it. The soldiers standing alongside the elegant gatehouse were equipped with their swords, bows, daggers and what not; it painted quite a contrast with the serenity which surrounded that place. <br>\r\nThere was a hint of irony in the air and it made Daniel smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n One of the soldier who was watching all three of them \u2013 Zora, Tora and Daniel \u2013 for quite a while now, called out to him \u2013 <br>\r\n\u201cWho are you, Senor?\u201d The soldier had the courtesy in his voice which again reminded Daniel of his own Realm Stark\u2019s principle and mannerisms.<br>\r\nDaniel placed his left foot on the stirrup and gracefully slid down the tall horse. He made a little bow to the soldier before saying \u2013 \u201cI am from House Stark \u2013 the kingdom of gracious Queen Hannah.\u201d<br>\r\nSoldier bowed back to him. He had heard only grandest of stories of House Stark and it was the first time he was seeing somebody in person from that place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe welcome you to the land of House Martel,\u201d said the soldier as he bowed to him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel bowed back and looked at Tora. He went towards her and untied the decanter which contained the grand Lady\u2019s ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, dear,\u201d he said and Zora and Tora tick-tocked their way into the gatehouse behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they entered the gatehouse, his fortunate eyes met the vast green expanses surrounding him. It was if all the greenery in the kingdom begun and ended here in this garden. The garden was full of exotic plants laden with flowers of colors he had never known to exist. That violet yellow striped rose to the left of where he stood, that black daffodil sprinkled with white and red spots just an arm away from the narrow road to the castle, that magnificent yellow colored flower which looked like a distant replica of the Sun itself. The gentle breeze which played with his mane also filled his nostril with fragrance which he could only describe as heavenly. It had a certain sweetness in it, a soothing ability to take the mind away of someone even who had seen the worst of the world. Daniel\u2019s overpowered mind was a living example of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there she stood \u2013 the grand Castle pf Martel shining like a Red rose in itself. The four minarets which stood around the castle was built in the choicest of crystals \u2013 the Preciousa stone. To increase its beauty even further \u2013 if it was possible \u2013 it had a giant petal shaped structure on top of it.  It bathed the castle in a crystal shadow which only increased the effect of magical abode which stood right there in front of his eyes. Was it really something that he was seeing or was he imagining things! How could the architecture and structure of something as other worldly as this could even be visualized by a person leave alone be built? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Daniel\u2019s thinking took a backseat and his senses went in an overdrive. This is how he had imagined heaven to be; maybe a little less beautiful than the beauty lurking in this wonderful place called the Land of the Martel\u2019s.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1222 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">Daniel's eyes wondered around the beautiful scenery as he thought what he should do next. The garden was peaceful, arranged in a precise and accurate way. The trees were lined up with perfection followed by flower beds in front of each forming a large stone path in the middle. There was a water pond where water lilies floated, a beautiful, fresh scenery created. Daniel had never seen such a beautiful garden before, \"Who might have worked so hard to take care of it? It's like a secret garden!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel saw that the two horses were sitting by the pond, drinking water and relaxed, on the grass blanket. He took his shoes off and felt the grass on his skin, the feeling were beyond indescribable. He felt the dew drops and their moisture before touching the bare soil which was soft, and cool. He walked up ahead and stepped up on the stone path. His series of amazement stopped when he heard Tora's neigh which helped him realise his original purpose of being here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Tora, I am sorry I got distracted, I have to find the Queen and get the high Lady out of this. . . \" Daniel looked at the entire scenery in front of him and then something shimmering got his attention. He walked in that path, it was behind a bunch of neatly cut and 'sun-shaped' bushes. He cautiously walked, his hand on his sword as he approached the shimmer. He retreated his hand from his sword as soon as he saw someone standing with what seemed like a tall, magnificent fountain. Daniel couldn't see the person's front but he saw that whoever 'she' was, wearing a yellow-orange gown. Normally, someone might not have liked it but there was something about it that made him immediately like the dress.He saw black hair that had fallen in a cascade, a waterfall, black hair that complimented perfectly with the yellow dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped on a twig, breaking it which caused her head to turn slowly to his direction and then there eyes meet each other. She looked at him, her head turned and sign of amusement on her face as her lips turned upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I see there is a stranger walking around,\" She turned and supported herself with the fountain. Her skin was flawless, her complexion was fair and she wore some kind of bracelet and gauntlet  on her wrists, golden in colour, she looked around twenty-three or so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Miss,\" He bowed lightly as he spoke with courtesy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you, young man?\" She asked with a curious glint in her eyes. Daniel was surprised with her initial reaction, normally when someone finds someone strange, they are not so free with each other and yet they were talking comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Daniel from Kingdom Stark.\" Daniel introduced himself and watched for her reaction when he mentioned Stark. There was no change in her expression, it was as if she was even more interested to know about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are alone?\" She asked all of a sudden which baffled Daniel. Could there be any way she could know about Queen Hannah? Although it was a question, he felt as if she knew there was someone else with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he spoke, he was telling the truth, he was alone for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I see that you have two horses, Where's the other passenger?\" Daniel was very amazed at her in-depth speculation and attentiveness, she noticed everything, she was clever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is why I am here. I was hoping to get some help.\" Daniel had no choice but to tell the truth, he had a feeling that if he lied, he would be caught and that would be quite embarrassing for him. His voice was strained when he said it, the image coming in his mind when she disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of help?\" Her eyebrows were not furrowed and she looked at him, listening attentively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I wouldn't like to talk about it to anyone other than the Queen.\" Daniel spoke, worried he might have offended the lady but he was glad to see her not offended, at least she didn't show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Her eyes went wide in surprise and she laughed, \"Oh, okay. Sure, I can understand that.\" Daniel was very surprised, she was laughing, why? He must have looked baffled because she acted like she was coughing and then stopped, looking at him as Daniel stepped away but stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I didn't catch your name.\" Daniel said to that he would have a reference to whom he met at his arrival in the kingdom, if anyone asked, he could say he knew her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is because I never told you.\" She smiled and looked at him, carefully, examining his expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. . . ?\" Daniel's mouth hung open as he took in his mind her reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll know soon, don't worry.\" She waved her hand in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, um, can you tell me where I can meet Queen Aqua?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, go inside the castle and tell the guards you want to meet her, she will summon you to her council chamber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thank you! Hope to see you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, you will definitely see me around.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she had said it in low voice, Daniel still heard her and he was absolutely confused, what was with her? She was different, strange, nice yet cautious and mysterious, Removing the thoughts from his mind, he made his way to the castle and went inside the huge gate that were opened by three guards in golden armor. He was surprised that they didn't ask anything about him or stopped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Martell Kingdom, I am Sebastian Marrowgh, Queen's right hand. How may I help you?\" A tall man in a royal blue <i>butler</i> coat with golden design on it. He looked around young, probably in his twenties, really active and fresh, confidence in his figure and speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came here to seek help from Queen Aqua of Martell.\" Daniel lightly bowed his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! It must be you! Yes, I was told! Please follow me to the chamber room, Lady Aqua will be there in a minute.\" Daniel could no longer count the number of times he got mysterious replies and the times that confused him. How could Sabastien had known he was coming? Who told him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the questions in his mind, he followed behind Sebastian Marrowgh, passing through huge halls with high ceilings and sun paintings on the ceiling, it looked like a story being told in pictures. The walls had large paintings with beautiful artwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebastian opened a grand door as he gave way to Daniel to go inside the room, he went inside and saw a large conference table with at least fifteen chairs with a chandelier hanging above it. On the corner, there were chairs and sofas set, along with side tables. the floor was made of wood and it was polished nicely and had an excellent texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Aqua is here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel turned to look at Lady Aqua, expecting something else but what was before his eyes left his mouth hanging in the air, his eyes wide open in shock and he spoke without a single thought,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how. . . ?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same person he had met before in the garden. The only difference was that this time she was wearing a yellow robe which had glitter on them and paintings of sun drawn beautifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Daniel, how do you do? I told you we will see each other quite often.\" And she smiled.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1270 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cY-you, I \u2013 I am D-Daniel, oh let it be,\u201d Daniel kept looking at the beautiful princess standing in front of the. He didn\u2019t what to say except for that he was sorry but that he felt useless and worthless considering his stupidity. He still said it though,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry, Queen Aqua,\u201d he did a little bow or two. \u201cI did not think that you could be found so easily wandering in the gardens. I mean, I thought you would \u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like gardening? Why ?\u201d said Queen Aqua and smiled like a kid would. Her jovial reply made Daniel wish that he bury himself down right there where he was standing because he felt so stupid, yet again. He wanted to clarify what he wanted to say but did not trust himself to give a satisfactory enough reply for the buffoonery he had done for the last half an hour or so. Instead he though it to be better to come straight to the point. He said - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQueen Aqua, we are in grave danger and we need your help,\u201d Daniel\u2019s face turned pale as he said it, a light shade of yellow. The memories of happenings around the Reborn river had run screaming back to him, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you think I would be able to help you, Daniel? Are you sure about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes,\u201d he said hesitatingly, thinking the reason behind is answer as he could not really remember what told him that Queen Aqua would be able to do the magic for Queen Hannah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to hear this from you, Daniel. You will know soon, why,\u201d Queen Aqua said it, still looking curiously at Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel didn\u2019t know what was wrong. He looked around but nobody was there. He looked Queen Aqua now turning back and seeing somebody standing directly behind her. He craned his neck to look beyond Queen Aqua but could only see somebody standing in Royal Blue Gown. Her golden curls bounced on the Royal blue robe of hers as she slowly came from behind the many layer of curtains which stood between Queen Aqua and that lady in blue. Daniel grew even more curious because with every passing step he saw a strange excitement in Queen Aqua\u2019s eyes which belied her calm appearance. It was as if something unpredictable, something other worldly was to happen any time now. For no reason Daniel\u2019s heartbeat a notch too. Who is it who pleases Queen Aqua this much? Is it a trickery, a game against us House Stark people. He glanced in Queen Aqua\u2019s direction; Queen Aqua\u2019s glowing face and the aura around her assured him that a person of such pure air around her possibly can\u2019t hurt a fly let alone a human being. This train of thought gave him a lot of peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel couldn\u2019t bear the suspense any longer. Seeing that Queen Aqua was anyway not looking in his direction, he took a step in her direction so that he could see what she was seeing. Still no success. Another step but nothing changed. Just when he was about to take another sneaky step he heard \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaniel, I hope you are fine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel\u2019s heart leapt out of his mouth when he realized that the voice had come from behind the curtain. He moved towards the voice, as if in trance. Queen Aqua smiled, moved towards him and then raised the final set of curtain to reveal who stood there. There stood the Diva \u2013 Queen Hannah - who had called him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel hopped a step in shock. His eyes couldn\u2019t simply believe what they saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d he whispered still pulling back in shock, \u201cYes, I must be dreaming,\u201d he reasoned with himself. The lady in the blue robe still stood there smiling at her. He looked towards Queen Aqua who stood glowing as ever, on the right side of the lady in blue robe who told her to be Queen Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I saw Queen Hannah disappear into ash, right in front of my very own eyes,\u201d he clutched the decanter in his hand even harder. There was surely a decanter, in his hands. He opened it and flung the contents out of it and all which came out was mud, silvery smoky mud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh, see. Of Queen Hannah - ,\u201d he said to lady in blue who stood smiling at him. What was this happening to him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-the h-hag, the m-magic. W-wait, It did happen,\u201d he clutched his head which was spinning like a tornado into his palm. He stooped down on the wood floor, questioning his mind whether anything had happened at all. He simply couldn\u2019t believe anything which he saw, heard or felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind wanted him to be happy but such had been the previous few days that he found it difficult to believe almost anything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what ..w-who are you?\u201d  he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright, Daniel? I think you are losing it,\u201d said Queen Aqua, seeing that Daniel was showing signs of delirium. She was concerned about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said with a hint of irritation but checked his caustic tone, \u201dYes, I remember her. She was Queen Hannah\u2019s sister - that cousin of hers who had been cursed when she was in the womb,\u201d he mumbled.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was only one person who was cursed Daniel,\u201d said the lady in the blue robe, \u201cand it was you, Daniel. It was you,\u201d saying this she came towards her, stooped to pinch the ashes from the ground and sprinkled it all around Daniel. Daniel felt a sharp pain in his chest, a pain as if hundreds of arrows had impaled him. He let out a sharp cry of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~***~~~~~****~~~~~***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Aqua and Queen Hannah were sitting on that mahogany carved seat in the garden, discussing the exotic plants and trees when Daniel too joined them. So engrossed were the two new found friends amongst themselves that they didn\u2019t notice his presence. Daniel coughed a little which made Queen Hannah notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaniel,\u201d she exclaimed and walked towards her,\u201d how are you now?\u201d she said, putting a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am okay, Queen Hannah,\u201d Daniel said, with his head still bowed. He was now remembering things he had said before he went unconscious after Queen Hannah sprinkled the ash around him. The mutterings, the cuss words, the profanities which had escaped his mouth. Why, he didn\u2019t know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Aqua too came forward towards him. He understood his dilemma and his guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d said Queen Hannah and Queen Aqua, almost at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel\u2019s eyes had turned watery. He looked up at them and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to me, Queens?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah beamed a smile to him and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were cursed by the dying Hag. She simply wiped out me from your consciousness stream so that there would nobody to protect me when we would pass that forest. She made you saw all those things which you saw. I was with you the whole time Daniel, the whole time. It was around River Reborn that I noticed your strange acts first. You running towards the River and snatching the decanter off my hands, crying standing near Tora and Nora, talking to them and telling them that you would bring me back. I knew this was her black magic at work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel had his mouth open, listening to all this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah continued - \u201cI had an inkling of it, actually, when she asked your name. I know the kind of curse they can bring upon the person and I knew that if it would happen then only two things would save you. One \u2013 the land of a realm which had purity ingrained in it and two, the \u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe ash of the hag, right?\u201d Daniel asked, with him looking with an awe towards both Queen Hannah and Queen Aqua who stood smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold you, he is a bright one, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Queen Hannah smiled proudly at Queen Aqua who nodded full heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1346 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a few days. You have been unconscious since the last three days. . . yes that was it.\" Queen Hannah replied and it was Queen Aqua's turn to eye her and laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel stood quiet, watching the two royal ladies laugh together, that was a good thing you know, two queens of two kingdoms together, progressing as friends, but they were laughing at <i>him</i>, that wasn't an ideal situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, the gentleman is not at ease, please refrain from making fun of him.\" A familiar and different masculine sound came from behind them and Daniel turned around to see it was the butler, what was his name again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sebastian! Don't tell me you weren't enjoying it, I saw you behind the door, listening.\" Queen Aqua had powers, powers that she never mentioned to anyone and no one knows what she is capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I am guilty. Would you like some English Tea, Queens and Daniel?\" Sebastian offered, looking at everyone, waiting for their response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, you should definitely try his English tea, I swear his are the best ones across the entire realm!\" Queen Aqua spoke, her excited expressions showed how much she loved Sebastian's tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that sounds interesting, what is your secret ingredient?\" Queen Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, you know, the usual - Lots of love.\" Sebastian spoke casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed at his comment, \"What? I told you the truth! Let me get them for you, right away.\" Sebastian walked away, smiling,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door closed, Aqua's face became serene as she spoke, \"Daniel, have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's talk about the serious matter, what made you travel all the way from your kingdom to here, Queen Hannah?\" Aqua folder her arms and looked questioningly at both of them, Daniel and Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel and Queen Hannah exchanged glances, \"Go ahead,\" Daniel said to Queen Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were journeying around our part of the kingdom to oversee some things when we . . . met my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leah? But didn't she disappear?\" Queen Aqua seemed to know more about Queen Hannah than Daniel, he wondered how she could have known all this, spies? Or perhaps were they both close in their childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she did, everyone called her mad, heck, I did too. And there she was acting all weird and stuff. She mentioned that there was something coming and we all would be destroyed by it. That was when she actually caught my attention and I listened to her carefully but you know her nature, don't you?\" Queen Hannah looked at Aqua who was nodding affirmative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know her, continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was playing, she didn't talk after saying this. I had a bad feeling about it and I thought that there is something she is hiding, something that is of a lot of importance. That is when I threatened to kill her, slice her throat and she gave it away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did she say exactly?\" Aqua's eyebrows were furrowed as she listened attentively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the first time we heard what she said, I thought you sent her to us so that we will turn to you, become allies so easily. But then she denied it herself and this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You think Queen Aqua of Martell is behind this? You know nothing, honey. Go live a luxurious life in your castle.\" The hag tried to wave her off with her tied hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like death, hag? Do you crave it?\" Hannah threatened her, still there was no effect on the hag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can scare me queen? Nah, he's the one who everyone should be scared of him. Queen Aqua is already arranging her troops against him, you stand no chance alone, none of you kingdoms do.\"</i> \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how did she know about my kingdom? And that I am gathering force?\" Aqua was confused, hint of anger on her face. Was there a spy among her kingdom? That wasn't possible, not a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, so it's true then?\" Queen Hannah asked, her voice strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Aqua sighed and began, \"Yes, you might know that I have contact with the witches of the Silverstorm, Laura and the others as well as my own Beast Master (<span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'sum1swriting', '', '', 'lighthouse', '60', '', 'ON', '100798518'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'sum1swriting', '', '', 'lighthouse', '60', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: sum1swriting\r\nMember Since: June 16th, 2010\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;font-weight:bold;cursor:pointer;\">\ud83d\udef8 Sum1 \ud83d\uddff</a></span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/sum1swriting','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/sum1swriting\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'sum1swriting', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Today', 'Today', 'June 16, 2010', '', 'lighthouse', '60', 'Moderator');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 4px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-lighthouse-60.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a>). They showed something to me that made me believe it even though I did not want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is something spreading, something evil, lurking in the shadows, growing with each second as we speak. The dangerous thing and the weakness is that we do not know what it is or who it is, it is said that it is being controlled by the Dark Lord and his minions. As soon as I heard about it, I had started assembling my troops, they consist of both light and dark creatures, so we might hold an advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will fight by you.\" Daniel spoke, \"That's why we are here, Queen Aqua.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to have surprised Queen Aqua for she looked at Hannah for confirmation and only after she nodded did she speak, smiling, \"That's excellent! For everyone's good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I've got one question.\" Daniel spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, shoot away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that you are assembling your troops. But when I came in the kingdom, there were no buildings, no citizens, no soldiers, no guards, nothing. . . \" Daniel wasn't sure how to express this but he did anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that is a powerful spell that has been activated by my great ancestors. The spell spreads at least a thousand miles radius with my castle as the centre of the spell circle. Anything that has dark intentions will not be allowed to enter since there's a force field and those who enter easily, like you, have good intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is why when I saw you in the garden, I didn't feel as if I was in danger. And as for the city, the buildings, they lie behind this castle, whoever passes the castle till the end of its walls can see the kingdom of Martell. My army works in secret, underground and invisible camps, large fields. How about I give you a tour while you dispatch a message to your kingdom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that would be a great idea.\" Queen Hannah spoke. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1088 words</b> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check5.png\" alt=\"*Check5*\" title=\"Check5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'dmadison', '', '', 'stars_moon', '60', '', 'OFF', '101053567'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'dmadison', '', '', 'stars_moon', '60', '', 'OFF'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: dmadison\r\nMember Since: September 28th, 2013\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;font-weight:bold;cursor:pointer;\">\ud83c\udf18 Darleen \ud83c\udf12</a></span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/dmadison','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/dmadison\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'dmadison', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Private', '', 'September 28, 2013', '', 'stars_moon', '60', 'Moderator');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 4px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-stars_moon-60.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a> <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bigsmile.png\" alt=\"*Bigsmile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Bigsmile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

The massacres in those deep forest of Brouu didn\u2019t mean that the wild tiger and Lion had become extraordinarily devouring all of a sudden. It meant only one thing \u2013 that the beasts of the place were being rekindled by an outside force. An animal wouldn\u2019t attack another being until it is hungry or it is being pushed into attack. The Lions, Tigers and Hyenas of Forets Brouu had ample of food supply,  courtesy the acres of land the Forest was spread in. They had never been known to attack humans before \u2013 not in the memory of Queen Hannah and the fact that the animals started to do it, out the plain old blue, was something which had struck her as especially odd, at that point too. She had a passing doubt at that time but now, she was sure that the ugly spirits and the mercurial beasts roaming in non-human form and shape in that forest were gaining ascendancy. Somebody was working for them \u2013 digging them from the past, rekindling them, stoking their dark sides and forcing them on the souls of the animals. All of it made sense now. She winced a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinking of something, Queen Hannah?\u201d Queen Aqua asked Hannah who was diving deep into the recent past. She considered whether to tell Queen Aqua about those ugly beasts of Brouu but she hesitated; not because she didn\u2019t trust her but because she wanted to counter this threat on her own. She was already feeling as if she was asking too much of Queen Aqua and she didn\u2019t want to exacerbate the feeling. Queen Hannah diverted the topic -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWondering whether the people back home know that I am alive, that\u2019s all,\u201d a faint smile spread across her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, Queen Hannah,\u201d Queen Aqua gently squeezed Queen Hannah\u2019s hand, \u201cwe can surely do this much for a Queen of such a benevolent kingdom.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smiled again and nodded. Queen Aqua clapped her hands twice. A train of servants, all dressed in Off-white robe, came rushing to her with their heads bowed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Queen Aqua. What can we do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeliver the message to the great Stark Realm that Queen Hannah is safe and sound and in the company of Martel Kingdom,\u201d she looked at Hannah to ascertain if that was enough. Hannah nodded, thought a while and then said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust mention the word \u201cAzure\u201d in the letter, in some place where you think it would fit seamlessly  like say right at the start where you address the Stark Realm,\u201d Hannah smiled as she completed and so did Queen Aqua. Aqua didn\u2019t ask for what \u201cazure\u201d meant and took it for some secret key which would signify to Stark Realm people that the message had indeed come from Queen Hannah herself and not some interceptor. But \u201cAzure\u201d was something which nobody was prepared for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShall we move towards our base camps, Queen? \u201d said Queen Aqua as she motioned the servant on his way to House Stark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Queen Hannah said. Daniel followed them. They all moved towards the fountain in the garden which stood right in between an Oak tree and a great Banyan tree. The Banyan tree, the grandest and oldest of them all, stood there as if guarding the fountain and the vicinity on its own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Aqua asked them, \u201cDo you see what I see, Queen?\u201d Hannah smiled back and nodded whole Daniel wondered what they were talking about. Of course he saw a Banyan tree and an oak tree and a fountain but what was there to ask about it. There was surely something which he had missed. He looked again, a little stern look than the cursory glances he gave it a while ago and slowly, he saw pattern emerge from the Banyan tree shoots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a set of swords that the shoots looked like,\u201d Daniel murmured, \u201cNo, they are spears for sure,\u201d said he squinting his left eye. <br>\r\n\u201dNo, no it is a bow and arrow!\u201d he didn\u2019t know what to make out of the weaponry which was seemingly appearing in thin air, right in front of his eyes. It was if the shoots would wave a little which would send dust flying towards the fountain. The sprinkling water from the fountain would settle on the dust particles to reveal the weapon like shapes. He also doubted himself whether his mind was playing tricks again with him. How can he be sure of it when so much had happened over the past week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive,\u201d said Queen Hannah and looked at Daniel whose mind was still trying to comprehend the act of pure magic unveiling in front of him. Queen Hannah understood that and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is no normal tree, Daniel, this you must have figured out, right?\u201d Queen Hannah asked with a mischief in her eyes and Daniel blushed. He nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut do you realize that there is no tree standing in front of you?\u201d Queen Hannah said it, looking impressed by this chimera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Daniel moved towards the tree to try to touch and feel it. As he moved towards it, he saw the Banyan tree slip back a feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe again moved towards it but again the same thing happened. Daniel\u2019s neck turned instinctively towards Queens who seemed to be enjoying the act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d he managed to utter a word after a moment\u2019s silence, \u201cWhat is this? Is this a magic, witchcraft, w-what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a chimera, Daniel,\u201d Queen Aqua said, looking proudly at the tall, handsome \u201ctree\u201d standing right in front of their eyes and still standing nowhere. Why wouldn\u2019t she be proud of such an asset in her kingdom. It was the open secret of the Martel Kingdom; everybody knew that Banyan tree was a chimera but nobody knew the reason behind it \u2013 the hidden purpose it solved, apart from Queen Aqua that is and her mother and her mother\u2019s mother and all the women in the lineage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Aqua looked towards Daniel and said \u201c You are going to eb the first Male to be knowing the secret of this tree, Daniel. How lucky are you! I had to wait for seventeen years to get this secret from my mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why is it exactly a secret kept exclusive for Women?\u201d exclaimed Daniel, looking towards Queen Aqua then Queen Hannah and then again towards Queen Aqua for an answer. All he got from them was a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will see,\u201d Queen Aqua said and touched the Oak tree with the smallest finger of her left hand. She closed her eyes for a second and then, placed her palm on the Oak tree and caressed it. Lo, out jumped the Soldiers, all women, equipped with weapon of all those kinds which he had witnessed a while back. He was astonished not in any means by the weaponry but by the form which those lady soldiers had; they all were built from millions of tiny water droplets, arranged in a lady-figure. They had non-distinct facial features but their physical features were such that it was hard to not imagine the most beautiful of faces on that body form. And they just kept leaping out of the mirage of the Banyan tree, one by one, till their count had reached the magical sum of seventeen. As the water figures lined in front of them, apparently waiting for a command from their Queen, Aqua took her hand off the Oak tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said - <br>\r\n\u201cWelcome my army of the Aquas-17.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel couldn\u2019t make a head or tail out of what he had seen. All what he knew was this must be special army. The fact that they were made of nothing but water droplets made him wonder what could possibly defeat them. Ice \u2013 No, can\u2019t defeat them, Fire \u2013 No, can\u2019t touch them. Weapons \u2013 what weapons could do to a water form! Daniel\u2019s eyes went wider as he thought about it. And to top it all the Aqua-17 army had the weapons of their own. What troubled him for some time though, was the seemingly small count of the \u201cbattalion\u201d.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cJust 17 of them, huh. How would they fair against an army of millions!\u201d he muttered, gently enough to not be noticed by anyone in vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah looked mighty impressed with what she had seen. She didn\u2019t remember if she had seen something like this in her life; the spirits of the Red Snow came close but this was something else. It made her wonder for a little time as to what happened to the Spirits of the Red snow but she brushed aside that thought for late user. Instead she said with a twinkle in her eyes \u2013<br>\r\n\u201cAnd do you know, what is the beauty of the Aqua-17, Daniel?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApart from the fact that they are ladies, essentially, \u201d Queen Aqua chuckled. Daniel\u2019s cheeks turned a darker shade of Red. He thought it safe to just move his head sideways to escape answering this tricky question. Queen Hannah had a grin on her face, too. <br>\r\nShe then said - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe beauty is that they don\u2019t get destroyed but essentially multiply into even more Aqua figures.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel\u2019s eyes went even wider in appreciation of the Aqua army and some moments passed before he got the genius of this army. <br>\r\n\u201cShall we move?\u201d inquired Queen Aqua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1606 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check5.png\" alt=\"*Check5*\" title=\"Check5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He had heard that Queen Aqua had the magic in her but to what extent? How much of it could she use? How powerful was she? Who was she exactly? So many questions gathered in Daniel's mind, unanswered questions that were frustrating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have something to ask, do it, you look like you want to break something.\" He opened his eyes to find Queen Aqua's head titled as she watched his, her eye brow raised. Daniel had forgotten the times he had turned red in a single day, all shades of red, not a single one he left, he might as well, paint his entire body red to avoid all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed as they continued to walk behind Queen Aqua who led them somewhere. He looked at Queen Hannah to find that she was already looking at him, expecting him to voice out his questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? Really?\" Daniel thought Queen Aqua was just saying it as a formality, he didn't know that he had to speak his thoughts out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, otherwise, try not to show expressions, Queen Aqua is very observant, even if her eyes are not on you, Daniel.\" Queen Hannah spoke and Queen Aqua laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hannah, you make me sound like a witch! That's mean!\" She hit Queen Hannah teasingly and continued, \"So, Daniel, what's in your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel hesitated a bit before speaking, \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I am Queen Aqua of Martell Kingdom.\" Queen Aqua spoke casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean, w-what exactly are you?\" Daniel wasn't sure how to ask this question, he feared he might offend her or it may come out as a rude question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, my friend, is something I don't even know. Perhaps a witch, then, considering Queen Hannah was correct? Or . . . how about a Hybrid Fairy or a Hybrid Witch! That would be amazing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Queen Hannah's turn to speak, \"Why would you consider yourself as a hybrid? Why not a completely one type?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel had the same question, and was glad that Queen Hannah asked it. Queen Aqua stopped in her tracks and turned to them, clearing her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have both dark and light power and magic. I think I got the light from my mom and the dark from my dad, so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was your father?\" Daniel asked, without thinking, \"I am sorry, I don't mean to. . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, these questions come naturally in someone's mind. I would have loved to answer your questions but here we are.  . . The main army camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stepped forward to look behind her. \"Woah.\" Both of them spoke. There were large buildings, towers, camps, campfires, the air was filled with the cacophony of all kind of sounds, sharpening the swords, arrows striking the wooden targets, the 'thud' or spells bursting from hands and hand-to-hand combat, the clashing of knives, it was unbelievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah watched the entire scene in front of her eyes, it was amazing in its own way. Her eyes landed on a tall, huge fort like structure with a few windows, she saw fire coming out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that? Where is the fire coming from?\" Both Daniel and Queen Hannah spoke at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh those are our stone training grounds, we train dragons too, the finest you will ever see. Since stone walls are a good insulator, they keep the others protected from the fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you not have in your army?\" Queen Hannah wondered, voicing out her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have to be prepared for everything. Queen Hannah, your kingdom is known for making powerful, finest swords, perhaps we can join alliance and work together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that seems like a good strategy.\" Queen Hannah spoke, \"We also have Platinum, gold, tough shields.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be tired, no? Let's get you to your rooms, you should rest now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be very kind of you, Queen,\" Daniel bowed lightly and just then, his stomach grumbled which left him once again red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen chuckled as she spoke, \"Okay, so let's get you feasted and then to your rooms.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>710 words</b> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

He had always been a bread and butter man with no interest in the exotic food items but this was surely an exception. All types of exotic food filled the air with a saliva inducing aroma and to top it all he had never heard the name of the food in front of him \u2013 nothing stokes the fire of hunger as much as a mysterious and strange sounding food item.  A near triangular potato filled delicacy called Samosa piled up in the Starters section while a variety of finger shaped, stuffed delicacy called as Paneer Kebabs decorated the other corner. The most of the main course dishes looked tempting but cottage cheese gravy and the butter chicken looked lip smacking even from where he stood. To top it all, a sweet dish made from milk and rice called Kheer was being served along with over hundred varieties of mangoes. Daniel had never seen so much food at one place in his whole lifetime and now, he had all of it to devour. He didn\u2019t know where to start from and where to end - How life changes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah and Queen Aqua chatted away to their heart\u2019s content. These two had gelled so much over such a short period of time. It was if two lost sisters were catching up. The thought of the war was as far away from their mind as possible. Everything looked so hunky dory again. Daniel was enjoying the serenity of the place along with the food. He knew tougher times were upon them but not so soon. He wondered about how all the realms could be brought together under one roof. Was it even possible, he thought. Though he had no reason to believe that it would happen, something in his heart did say so. Or was it hope? He took his mind off the war and decided to enjoy the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later they all descended to their rooms. Daniel seemed to be the most tired of them all, more mentally than anything else. He was escorted to his allocated room by the choicest of Queen Aqua\u2019s servant. The room allotted to him was such a marvelous piece of architecture that it was almost as if it spoke with eloquence. The linen curtains hung low near the ends of the carved Oakwood bed.  The mattresses built from the choicest of cotton enveloped the person in its arms as one lay on it. Just nearby his bed was a broad mouthed utensil which had warm water in it. Daniel went to his bed, sat on the side of it and then gently dipped his feet into that warm water in the utensil. As soon as he did it, a smile swept across Daniel\u2019s lip and a soothing feeling took over his body. He threw back his head in pleasure and closed his eyes to relax.

Is something burning? Come on, let me sleep.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Daniel's mind calculated what he had thought, he sprung up from his bed and yelled, \"Smell!?\" He looked around him to find everything around him on fire, the only thing that was left was his bed. He wondered how he was still safe, it was as if there was a protective circle around him that avoided any flame, even a sparkle of it to enter in the vicinity. Pushing the thought away to focus on the fire, he yelled, struggling to breath. He was suffocating due to the smoke in the closed room and his eyes were becoming watery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-someone. . . \" The words never left his lips because he started coughing violently. He heard the door open with a loud thud and a lot of loud voices which he was not able to make out as he surrendered to the darkness, to the unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt something wet on his eyes which made him blink them rapidly. The vision before his eyes came into focus as he recognised Queen Aqua staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you should call a person from the medical or perhaps your own wizard, Queen Aqua?\" He recognised the voice, it was Queen Hannah's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" He got up, rubbing his head. His throat felt like burned and he coughed and Queen Aqua handed him a glass containing a liquid that was purplish in colour. He looked at Queen Aqua, who nodded, confirming that it was okay for him to drink it. He gulped it down his throat and felt immediately better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I remember there was a fire in the bedroom and I wasn't on fire and then I blanked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you weren't on fire, that is what really disturbs me. I have enchanted all the rooms that whatever evil, whatever accident happens in a room, it doesn't spread to the other rooms. That is the reason why the fire didn't escape your room but you, I am surprised you don't have even a single bruise. . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah cleared her throat and Queen Aqua blushed, \"Of course, I am really glad that you are fine but it just surprises me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does it surprise you?\" Daniel was confused, why would she be confused,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because when I came into your room, everything was on fire, but you. You were lying on the bed and there seemed to be an invisible force field around the bed that protected me. I saw a flicker of fire deflected when it was flying over to you. No human can possibly have magic and do something like this. There is something about you, are you sure you are human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was beyond surprised, Queen Aqua's question left him dumb-founded as he stuttered. \"B-but. . . . N-no, wh-why would I be not human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There have been many events in the world where people don't know who they really are, maybe it's time we find who you are. What do you say?\" Queen Aqua spoke, she was kind, she wanted to do according to what Daniel wanted, did he want to be the way he was, thinking he was human or would he like to know things he didn't use to about himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel gave it a thought and then said, \"Yes, I want to know. I may be more useful that way knowing what I am, what my strengths and weaknesses might be. I know it will be extremely hard for me to accept a completely different reality than what I believed in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find out then.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n629 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Do you see?\"  Queen Aqua spun the pin in her thumb and forefinger, back and forth, making the light of the room dance across the surface of the jewel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel gazed beyond the sparkling flashes cast by the edges of the jem as Queen Aqua spun it in her fingers.  He thought there was something, something just beyond his grasp, behind the flashing. <i> Yes</i>, he thought to himself, <i>I do see it </i>and he nodded.  <i>But what do I see?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you see the very first day of your apprenticeship Daniel?\"  asked the Queen, \"Look deep inside, deep behind the sparkles.  Tell me what you see, Daniel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw himself before a great building of wood and stone.  There were many stone steps and red-tiled roofs above carved dark wood.  He stood in a courtyard and watched as three blackrobed men walked toward him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see? Say what you see on the first day of your apprenticeship, Daniel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see three men from a temple, I think.  They wear black robes like priests.  They are coming to me down stone stairs that lead from a great wooden building roofed in red-tile.  One man has white hair and a beard, one man is young, but his eyes seem very old, and one. . . There is a man, I see. . .\"  Daniel frowned, trying to see the third man in the facets, \"It is odd, I see his face, it is like everyone's and no-one's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that, Daniel, what happens next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They talk to me, ask me questions, questions I could never know, but I answer them.  They welcome me, I think, but then they turn away and go back to the castle, or temple, that big building with the steps.  I turn away, confused, and right behind me is an old man all in white.  His hair is white, what there is of it, and he has a long beard and mustache.  He looks very old, wizened and not much taller than me.  He asked me if I want to know a secret and I say that I do,\" said Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queens look at each other, puzzled, but Queen Aqua continues, \"It is now three months that you've been at your apprenticeship.  What do you see now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel squinted into the crystilline glitter, \"I'm watching the boys at their training.  I wish that I could train with them, it looks like fun, but Kan Chet San says that I am becoming a great secret and such as me have no time to play with the boys who beat each other bloody in the yard.  I tell him, yes master Kan, but I still wish I could beat them bloody with the rest.  From Kan Chet San I learn the way of the hand and the way of the foot and the way of the many faces and the none.  Kan Chet San is good to me, but, though I try and try, it is always me who takes the beating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Aqua placed the jeweled pin back in her hair, \"Daniel, rest now, we will talk of this later, sleep deep and dreamless and forget for now what you saw.  I will tell you all you need to know when you wake.\"  Though Daniel was full of questions he found sleep stealing over him and he lay down where he was and fell deeply asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwords: 618 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniel stuttered to his feet as both the Queens stood either side of him. There was something special in that moment right there; not that two of the most beautiful ladies surrounded the hapless Daniel whose luck was finally changing for the good but the fact that Queen Hannah and Queen Aqua looked at each other, placed the thumbs of the right hand to each other which resulted in a ray of yellow light which basked the surrounding in its radiance. It was a marvelous site as if Lord Sun himself had come into the room to create that sparkling glory. Daniel found it odd that the although each and every object in the room had turned yellow in the magnificent shining in the room he himself was untouched by the glitter of yellowish gold. It was quite a curious scene with Daniel standing in a hollow bubble which guarded him from the brilliance of the color in the room. In fact, Daniel could no longer see Queen Aqua or Queen Hanna. He guarded his eyes with fingers of his right hand and then squinted through the gaps in the finger; all he could manage to see was two thumbs emitting color \u2013 as if it were a tiny fountain of sunray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see you Queen Hannah,\u201d he whispered but got no reply. \u201cQueen Aqua?\u201d he said more in hope than anything else and nothing changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to find a way out of the door of the room to escape the brilliance of the light which was starting to hurt his eyes a little. To his surprise, even when he opened the door of his room, a room very similar to the one he was before in appeared and to his utter surprise it was too bathed in yellow light. The similarity didn\u2019t end there because some two hands away, he saw the two thumbs as if hanging in mid-air and oozing light all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it mean? \u201c Daniel murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more he thought about it the more joined thumbs appeared in the room, each a little fountain of golden color in itself. He tried to touch them, catch hold of them and probably use it to get the Queens\u2019 attention their but his utter surprise, his clasping fingers caught nothing more than air as it went through the figure appearing in front of him. His head was now started to spin again and almost out of pure instinct, he looked at his own thumbs and placed them together. He felt a surge of lightning pass through him as multitude figures and images flashed through his brain \u2013 a village nearby a river, attack of the Horse Riders on the village, the slaughter which ensued killing everything that breathed. And then he saw a little kid, with a face so angelic that it appeared to be of the God\u2019s themselves, lying in the bushes surrounding the cottage being carried in the mouth of a silvery wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still struggling to make sense of the things he was seeing but the bombardment of images in his head continued \u2013 he saw the silvery fox placing the little kid nearby a Black tree, height of which threatened to pierce the sky. As soon as silvery fox left, the leaves of the Black tree began to flutter manically and wind acquired a voice of its own. And then it happened - from that Black tree descended a Old man, who had flowing white man and an aura beyond description. For some reason, the legs of his seemed to be tied to the Black tree which stood there; however much he would try, he couldn\u2019t free up himself from it. But he didn\u2019t fret for one instant but rather smiled; a smile of hope, as if his savior was there. <br>\r\nThe Old man stooped further to see the little kid lying at the root of the tree, checked the breath of the little pie and caressed its tiny little head. The old man then, drew a long breath and placed its thumb on the kid\u2019s forehead to emit a streak of lightning which set the Black tree on fire. The tree burnt on rapidly as the wild wind stoked the fire even rapidly. The Old man hurriedly picked up the little kid and almost at the same time, jerked his legs to detach it from the remnants of the burning Black tree. A heart wrenching mourning emanated from the roots of the Black tree as the Old man kissed the child. <br>\r\nStreams of tear ran down the Old Man\u2019s face as he caressed the kid\u2019s forehead, as if wiping out his memory of what he might have registered subconsciously. The scene then changed to reveal a grown Up Daniel playing with the Old Man - Zula, his grandfather. Zula \u2013 the legend. Zula \u2013 the wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plundering images stopped then and there as Daniel stooped to his hunches. Hundreds of question ran through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why did he do that? What was the reason he never taught me his tricks? Or did he teach them but it\u2019s just I don\u2019t remember them now? Was this the reason behind those pre-teenage dreams he often had where he would save his kingdom, destroying the enemies in the battleground not by the strength of his swords but by mere waving of his hands?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nAnd most important question which plagued him now was \u201c<i>Am I a wizard</i>?\u201d Something in his heart nodded with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(917 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

More over, he was panting. He looked around him to find the bed sheet all messed up and torn with drops of blood on it. He looked at his hand and was shocked to see that he was gripping the bed sheet so hard that his knuckles had gone white. He immediately loosened the grip and looked around him, he wasn't in the castle, he wasn't in the room where Queen Aqua left him, it was a completely different place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls were black, so pitch black that he wasn't sure if there were any walls and if he was surrounded by complete darkness. There was a single window through which the moonlight came into the room and it was the only source of light in the entire room. Daniel's eyes focused as they adjusted to the darkness. The wind howled outside making the curtains on the window move making a light sound that normally would be unnoticeable but right now, his senses seemed to be hypersensitive, he could hear his own heartbeat and he wasn't sure if it was because of fear or because of his active hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drew in a huge sigh and lay on the bed, getting his head comfortable on the pillow. He turned to his left, with his eyes closed and then he felt something, breath on his face, he opened his eyes abruptly to find two red eyes looking at him, a crooked, evil smile lingering on the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heellooo, Daniel, is it?\" The figure said. Daniel screamed at the top of his lungs and jumped away from the bed, looking for a weapon in the room through which he could defend himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, you look scared, what is it, little pup?\" He focused on the figure to see that it was the same hag at the tree, Queen Hannah's sister, she stepped forward and Daniel took a step back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it me? The one scaring you? You shouldn't be scared of me! It's her!\" She pointed to the door and screamed, her appearance was hideous, her face was pale with the only two red eyes prominent feature of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who? Q-qu-queen Aqua?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face looked agitated but then it turned into a creepy smile, a facade. \"No, silly, I mean Queen Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean your sister. . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHE\"S NOT MY SISTER!\" In a blink of an eye, she was near Daniel, just a step away, yelling, grabbing his throat with her long nails that dug in Daniel's throat and he felt liquid running down his throat, it was his own blood. Her eyes were bloodshot and Daniel couldn't breath, he was beyond terrified. A bright light got his attention as he saw that the room was on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burn, burn, all of you shall burn, one by one, you all will die. I will be back, honey.\" Her grip on Daniel's throat loosened and the entire room turned into darkness and the hag disappeared into it, leaving Daniel being encircled by the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up screaming, \"Shh, everything's fine, it's okay, it was just a bad dream, everything is fine, breath with me. Come on, you can do this.\" He was panting, he did as he was instructed and his breathing calmed down, his eyelids heavy. \"Sleep.\" The voice commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she will come again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she won't. I will be here to protect you this time. Sleep now.\" He felt soft hand ruffling his hair as it soothed him and he embraced sleep that he was previously denying.</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n605 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning rays illuminated the Daniel\u2019s room and the chirping of the birds hit his ears. He had had a rough night and took some more time for him to realize that the soothing chirping of the birds and the warm sun-rays were not a part of his dream. He slowly opened his eyes, only slightly opening them as if looking directly into the sun, and saw the magnificent brilliance of the room.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a Good Morning, alright!\u201d he muttered as he rubbed his eyes and slowly got up to a sitting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he straightened his back, his hand went towards the back to apply some pressure on it in order to loosen it. That is when he felt that dampness. Some part of his cloth was still moist in the sweat which had been his partner for the night. It made him remember the nightmare he had seen at the night. Soon, he remembered that somebody had soothed him back to sleep when he woke up badly distressed. He jumped out of his bed and turned to look at the chair kept on the other side of the bed to see if that person was still there. But no, there was nothing in the room to suggest that he had been even visited by somebody else during the night. His handkerchief still lay on the chair along with his upright turban, exactly as he liked to place it before going to sleep. His eyes went towards the open window right behind his back. He ran towards it to search for any human existence there but no luck. In fact, when he looked down the window then all he could see was a sprawling garden and an exquisite pond in which Ducks and some other species of birds - which he didn\u2019t knew name of - were swimming. Only thing near his window was a Brown colored Oak tree with curiously long branches decorated with the greenest of leaves and reddest of flowers. But the tree was at least some twenty feet away from the window and he found it difficult to believe that any human or animal could take this big a jump especially considering that the leap, if unsuccessful, could be not good for even the bones made of platinum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt too must have been dream then,\u201d he told himself with the improbability of the event having not happened, still lingering in his mind. He shook his head as if to shake of the train of thought and went towards the restroom to freshen up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beautiful and delicate basin as if made of the gentlest of rose petals greeted him along with a life sized mirror which had golden rim all around it. He splashed water on his face and considered whether he should tell about the nightmare to the Queens. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat harm would it do?\u201d he said out aloud, as he fought with the thoughts of his mind who wanted to do otherwise. As he surveyed his face in the mirror, he noticed a huge bath tub in the exact opposite of where he stood. A smile flashed across his face as after all is there  a better way to think of answers to your questions than to be lying in a tub of warm water and pondering over them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome three quarters of an hour later, he was standing there with both the queens narrating his tale of woe.  Unlike to what he (and his ego) had been wary of,  both the wonderful Queens \u2013 Queen Aqua and Queen Hannah \u2013 patiently listened to his agony. Neither of them looked disinterested or stunned but maintained a calm around him which was in complete contrast to what was being exhibited on Daniel\u2019s face. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat a vivid nightmare that was!\u201d Queen Hannah whispered, as if walls around her had ears. Queen Aqua nodded and looked at Daniel who seemed to share something more with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Daniel. Something else?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQueens as much as the nightmare stunned and paralyzed me, I for once can disregard it as hyper activity and imagination of my fearful and stressed out brain. But what I am having difficulty passing off as something my mind conjured up is the presence of someone who soothed me, just at the stroke of that nightmare. Some motherly figure who sat by me, caressing my head and helped me drift into sleep,\u201d Daniel raised his eyes to look at Queen Hannah and he had tears in his eyes. He continued \u2013 <br>\r\n\u201c I know all of it may sound like a complete hogwash but what I experienced at that time hasn\u2019t been experienced by my since my mother died some fifteen years ago. It was the bliss of the mother\u2019s touch that I experienced, I feel.\u201d Daniel covered his face with his palms as stream of tear gushed out of his eyes. It had been building up for some time now and now, there was no stopping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(831 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

At the corner of the room, stood a small round tea-table, and upon it a golden, shiny kettle with cups that seemed magical, a miniature silver tray held a sugar-dish and a cream-pot and a half-dozen gold-lined souvenir spoons. Sebastian passed a smile to Queen Aqua who smiled back and nodded to him, as a thank you for the tea as he handed each to all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All my ancestors left ancient scrolls for us, their later generations and everything we know right now about them is thank to those scrolls. The scrolls mentioned that there are at least, and note that it is the minimum number, that the spells that my ancestors used for my kingdom go beyond a thousand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI, myself, learnt the art of magic and mastered it.

I had heard that the ancient of Martells and the Martells themselves are very secretive and quiet about what they do, I never though to hear that they went through so much trouble to preserve their kingdom, imagine their love for their kingdom, it's inspiring.\" Queen Hannah spoke as she straightened herself, amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's inspiring and that is what keeps my love for the kingdom alive and bright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if it weren't for your spell, then. . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you would have gotten hurt of the fire that you told us about, or worse, her claw marks could actually have peeled your skin off. Anything could have happened. But thank God, you are safe now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Queen Hannah and Daniel sighed, gratefully. They felt nothing but safer every minute they spent in Martell Kingdom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel, what do you think about being given a chance to train with perhaps the best knights in the entire universe?\" Queen Aqua grinned as she asked Daniel, \"I know some myself, perhaps you would like to take on a duel with the <i>Queen</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Daniel spoke, his voice raised, he was enthusiastic, excited like a boy on christmas, \"Are you kidding me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean it, do you want to train? Get into shape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah! Let me get into my gear.\" Daniel got up and made a dash for his room to get his sword and the rest of the gear. He got into the room and the entire nightmare or whatever it was came in his eyes and it made him stagger just for a moment, his breathing hitched and his heart started beating faster and his head went in all places, his vision blurred. He took the support of the chair. Slowly, relaxing himself over the chair, he calmed himself. There was nothing dangerous anymore, the spell would protect him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was well slept but his eyelids suddenly felt heavy and he surrendered to the feeling that was overwhelming him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Daniel, Daniel, it's time to get it out of your blood.\" He turned around to find Queen Aqua looking at him, her expression grim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Aqua? Where am I and what are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hag returned through your dream, that means you are still cursed somehow, there is something she enchanted still in your blood, I need to remove that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a dream, you mean? Because it will be less painful and convenient for me, getting the curse out of you in a dream will make sure that all the hag's enchantment is out and in the dream where there is nothing which it can haunt or occupy or survive in the shape of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait - what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will only take a second. Please avoid movement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Daniel could ask anything else, there was extreme pain in his body, he couldn't pinpoint where. He felt as if someone was squeezing his insides and it was getting difficult for him to breath as time passed. He couldn't count how many seconds, how many minutes had passed, it felt like eternity before he could breath properly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, all done. Sorry you had to go through this but it had to be done.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel fell on his knees and recovered his breath. The next thing he knew was that he was in the chair and Queen Aqua sat on her knee, looking at him, worried. Seeing him okay relieved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God, you are fine. Now let's get into gear shall we?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>933 words</b> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Dragon riding is one such thing and Daniel was experiencing it in every pore of his soul as he stood there, almost paralyzed looking at those beasts coloring the sky in their own streaks. This is was something out of ordinary and Daniel didn\u2019t know what to say or do or think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah on the other hand had similar emotions but a little less suppressed as she had seen dragon riders in her ow lovely kingdom; as a child, she once befriended a dragon baby in her childhood and learnt to ride it even before it grew wings. So she knew the tricks and thrade screts of the Dragon riding but riding a humongous beast such as this was quite another story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeautiful,\u201d is all she could utter as she saw two dragon on Red colored and the other Blue, nosedive to the valley which stood in front of them and powering ahead and just making the turn upwards as the collision with the rocky ground seemed inevitable. There was something gracious, other worldly in their supine movements which created an awe.  Daniel almost clapped when he saw one of the dragons make their spilt second turn as they flew towards the rocky mountain boundaries which surrounded the training ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Aqua looked towards Queen Hannah and Daniel and basked in the story of wonder their eyes told. After all, Queen Aqua was responsible for hand picking each and every dragon present in the training ground, right there. All 17 of them carefully graded based on their anatomy, their characteristics, their movements and their magical abilities. The magical abilities in particular is what she was most proud about as she herself had prepared seventeen different magic potions exclusively for each dragon. She learnt it from her forefathers who used to do similar things for their horses and now Queen Aqua did it for her \u201chorses\u201d \u2013 their flying horses! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Aqua looked at Daniel and asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Daniel, ready for the ride of your life?\u201d she winked as she said it but that too didn\u2019t sooth Daniel\u2019s nerve at the first go. He was busy imagining himself being brought to death in 17 different ways \u2013 crushed to the floor, grilled by the dragons, ripped apart by the beasts and trampled by the flying murderers were his most recurring thoughts. It gave his face a peculiar whitish look. He nodded anyway as he knew that this was something he might never get a chance to do again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould there be some trainers?\u201d he cleared his throat and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, there would be,\u201d Queen Aqua looked at Daniel and then Queen Hannah with a twinkle in her eyes,\u201d In fact, their <br>\r\nalready are and you have seen them flying \u2013 all 17 of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah\u2019s eyebrows went up in acknowledgement and she beamed at Daniel. At first however, Daniel didn\u2019t get what Queen Aqua was hinting at but when she clapped twice and a Brown eyed Dragon with horn for ears came near Daniel, his heart leaped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tapped on Daniel\u2019s shoulder and added mischievously - \u201cCome let\u2019s meet the trainer.\u201d<br>\r\nDaniel moved towards the Dragon, with pursed lips, still imagining the worst of scenarios. In his nervousness, he went to his Dragon and patted on it and the Brown eyed Dragon let out a shrill cry, as if something had impaled him.<br>\r\n  \u201cNo, no. Easy,\u201d Queen Aqua said as if shushing the mighty Dragon and then looked towards Daniel,\u201d they don\u2019t like to be caressed or patted. They get offended because it feels like being treated like some inferior specie. They demand respect, Daniel, they are our partners. Look them in the eyes, Daniel, and take their permission before you ride them,\u201d she motioned to Daniel to come stand in front of the Dragon so that it could look at Daniel too, like a friend would before shaking hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel felt a little embarrassed with what he had done and rushed to meet the Dragon, face to face. Now, this face to face meeting was not something you get to do often and he was thankful for that because the might of the dragon looked tenfold from where he stood now. The Dragon\u2019s head must have been equivalent to a small horse in itself and its strong tree trunk like neck shone like starlit night. The Dragon wiggled its body as gracefully as a mermaid would as Daniel\u2019s eyes met the Dragon\u2019s for the first time. Daniel saw his own reflection in the Dragon\u2019s brown eyes which seemed to be an entry into some other world portal. He kept looking in those eyes for some time before finally managing to utter the words \u2013 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we be friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon let out another of those noises but it was significantly different and much more melodious thatn the cry it uttered some while ago. The Dragon smelled Daniel and then bowed his head in recognition to Daniel\u2019s bowed head.<br>\r\nBoth the Queens smiled as Daniel moved to the side of the Dragon, caught hold of his horns and climbed onto it. Daniel couldn\u2019t believe what he had just managed to do and he waved at the Queens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(914 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

In some time, Daniel opened his eyes to find himself drenched in his sweat but he didn\u2019t remember any of those voices. All he remembered was little bits of the nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that was a dream?\u201d he wondered and rubbed his eyes which were heavy from excessive sleeping. He stretched his hands outwards a let out a yawn. He wondered why the room was still dark because it looked like he had slept for good nine ten hours. With his eyes narrowed, he looked around to search for that window which let in moonlight at night but couldn\u2019t find any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is strange,\u201d he murmured as he got his bed, put in her feet in the cotton slippers and got up. As he got up, he felt as if something squishy had touched his knee as if he had run into a jelly. Not thinking much of it, he put his hand all around him, searching for something to hold to so that he could gauge where exactly he was in the room. And then, his hands touched something which felt like multitude strands of Silk \u2013 or wait was it human hair? He moved his hand again and he got the same sensation again. He didn\u2019t know what to do as panic started to hit him again. Till now, he had remembered the exact details of the nightmare but it was all rushing back to him now. He stuttered ran then stuttered some more to go towards the approximate direction of the window but his feet kept refusing his efforts, as if made of jelly. To make it even worse, he couldn\u2019t find the window soon enough. He ran his hands from one wall of the room to another but there was nothing to be found except for more wall and corners. Before the already building panic in Steven could reach a crescendo, he remembered that he had noticed a matchbox on the table kept by his bed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNow all he had to do was to reach back to his bed, which he managed to, with far lesser stumbles than some minutes ago. He moved his hand around in the blackness, fearing the possibility of an unknown touch all the time, but finally found the matchbox. With trembling hands, he struck the matchstick against the sides of the matchbox to light it. Three unsuccessful tries and many wasted breaths later, he was able to light the matchstick which shone like a Sun in itself when compared against the darkness of the pitch black room. He moved the burning matchstick around himself and walked with it towards the corners of the room but still he found nothing. As he turned from the corner, he felt a tap on his shoulder and a breath of air which made his matchstick go lifeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hurriedly lighted his matchstick again and almost immediately regretted having done it for in front of him stood an old woman with the meanest of cheekbones and the fakest of smiles attached to her face. She had white marbles in those ghastly eye sockets and two punctured holes instead of a nose. <br>\r\nWith terribly shivering lips and flickering hopes of survival, Daniel managed to somehow ask \u2013<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-who...w-what...w-who a-a-re y-y-you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel felt a terrible churn building in his stomach as the Skeleton lady standing in front of her raised her hand towards Daniel. He moved a step back to be away from the clasp of those bones. The Skeleton Lady let out a long drawn giggle which stopped with her pointing at him with her bony index finger. Daniel wondered what this was about but before he could ask, she said in a nasal voice \u2013 <br>\r\n\u201cI am your servant, master.\u201d<br>\r\nShe bowed her head as she said that which revealed her collar bone which protruded out like impellers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-what?\u201d was all what escaped out of Daniel\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(665 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Daniel couldn\u2019t look at her anymore and turned his gaze away. The skeleton lady slowly crawled \u2013 on all fours \u2013 to where Daniel was looking now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYikes,\u201d yelled Daniel as he almost fell over, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d he yelled at her.<br>\r\n\u201cFollowing the order of my master, that\u2019s it,\u201d she said, staring at her with those white marble eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cGod,\u201d Daniel jerked his head away. He wanted to push her away but wasn\u2019t sure how the she would react. Also, she wasn\u2019t sure whether she had enough strength in those bones to withstand a light push, leave alone a shove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, master? DO you miss something? Anything?\u201d the lady, still sitting on the floor which her legs crossed, looked upwards to look into Daniel\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I miss peace?\u201d he hurled his frustration laced voice at her. The lady didn\u2019t twitch a muscle and said \u2013<br>\r\n\u201cHow many?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what do you bloody mean by \u201cHow many\u201d, huh?\u201d Daniel was starting to lose it but the lady was calm as before. She managed a smile as she said \u2013<br>\r\n\u201cHow many leg piece would you like to have, Master? Also fried or simmered?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel held his head in his palms. He didn\u2019t know what to say to her. The one thing which was good after this conversation was that he was no longer scared of her \u2013 maybe bothered by her idiotic talks a bit but hey, it is far better than getting limbs ripped out by a witch (this is what Daniel at first though what the lady would do). Daniel liked to look on the brighter side of the things. He raised his buried head from the grave of his palms and said \u2013<br>\r\n\u201cI just want \u2013 \u201c but to who he was talking; there was no one in the room. He jerked his head back to see in case she was a vampire or something preying over his shoulder but found nothing there. He squinted his eyes to see as far in the darkness his non-owl eyes allowed to but frankly speaking, he didn\u2019t see much beyond his own nose (which was also something he only believed he saw because subconsciously he hated his parrot\u2019s beak shaped nose) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that a dream?\u201d he murmured, \u201cis she gone?\u201d he looked around himself.<br>\r\n\u201cNoooo,\u201d shrieked the lady in Daniel\u2019s ears, as she came out from behind the chair where she was hiding. Daniel jumped upon where he sat and his heart went on a trip to Land Horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook look, how master is jumping in joy,\u201d she squeaked, as Daniel gasped for breath. He wondered what he needed to do now. He reckoned that the best would be to talk to her man to man (or man to bone rather)<br>\r\n\u201cWitch, why are you my servant?\u201d  asked Daniel. The white eyes of the bone lady twinkled as she opened her mouth to answer. But before that Daniel himself spoke \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd no, you can\u2019t answer by saying \u201cBecause you are my master\u201d\u201d Daniel waved his threatening index finger towards her aggressively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBone Lady smiled, \u201cI am so proud of my Master. How quicksilver he is?\u201d she waited for a token of thanks from Daniel but that wasn\u2019t coming anytime soon. She coughed a little to get over the embarrassment and said \u2013 <br>\r\n\u201cRemember the match stick you rubbed against the matchbox?\u201d she gave Daniel most gracious of smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Daniel clasped his head, \u201cSo that was why this happened. \u201d Daniel was now cursing himself for every bit of it. It went on for a while when he realized that he hadn\u2019t done some uncommon thing like say rubbing a lamp or something.  That is when his angst got diverted towards the bony lady again. He yelled -  <br>\r\n\u201cBut why the hell did anyone place that Matchbox by my side. Of course, that is what anybody would do isn\u2019t it \u2013 rubbing a match against the matchbox. Is that uncommon in this part of the world, huh?\u201d Daniel\u2019s eyes were still burning with anger and his voice with sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Master that is why I placed it there to reappear to life. In fact, that is why I created that perfect darkness in the room to trick you into mastering me, Master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you not call me master?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t, Master\u201d she said in a matter of fact tone and went on with what she was saying when Daniel cut through, \u201cActually I have been living in that matchbox for some three hundred seventy years now, Master. The last Master tricked me to go search for hi Dog in my matchbox and as soon as I did it, he shut the matchbox close. In fact, he threw away matchbox in the deepest of well, Master. What an adventure that was! You know what happened after that? I met a frog who for some reason seemed to be pretty interested in that little matchbox. He took it to his \u2013\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBony lady kept going on for another twenty minutes which felt like entire lifetime to Daniel. He wasn\u2019t even listening to her harangue and what he heard in actual was Mumble followed by \u201cMaster\u201d followed by more mumble. His eyes had that blank look of a husband who knows that her wife is talking about how he needs to do more housework. It was Daniel\u2019s fortune that Bony Lady had never been married else she would have caught his bluff right there. Daniel closed his eyes, took a deep long breath and tried to block out the Lady\u2019s voice. He was partially successful in doing that since he heard \u201cmaster\u201d every 1 minute now instead of every 10 seconds. He felt a little more peaceful but he knew he had to find a way out from this new problem he had landed into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(991 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

She stood there for a while and then slid her one hand under her thigh \u2013<br>\r\n\u201cW-what i-in t-the \u2013\u201c he pushed her back and she landed on her back on the floor, \u201cWhat are you trying to do stupid woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was trying to pick you, Master?\u201d she smiled back to him, as if nothing untoward had happened.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why the hell was that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you were asleep and chair can be a bit uncomfortable for the posterior \u2013 it hurts mine, \u201cshe turned around and wiggled her bony tushy at him, \u201cand hence I came to lift you and put you to bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I was not sleeping,\u201d Daniel screamed.<br>\r\n\u201cBut sleeping is not a bad thing, Master.

He kept mum, still glaring at the lady who smiled like those lunatics in the horror movies of the old.<br>\r\nSeveral moments of silence stood between them with nothing but good intentions and flaring temperatures drenched the air. Daniel jerked his head away from the lady\u2019s gaze and Bony Lady took it as a cue to come and stand to the new direction in which Daniel was now looking but thankfully he had closed his eyes again as in his mind he was thrashing this lady for the third time. Now he was twisting her head beyond what is allowed for anything that breathes \u2013 well, apart from the owls and it made him smile. He felt a little better and he opened his eyes to find the lady sitting at one arm distance from her. He was not overtly surprised considering the events of the past half an hour; he pulled his head back a little just to show to the lady that this was not what he liked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d  he said in the most measured tone he had used while conversing with the lady, \u201cpushed you and all that,\u201d he felt a little guilty about his outburst. \u201cSorry for that lady,\u201d he raised an arm in air for apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, Master? I am perfectly fine,\u201d She smiled, \u201cis master okay?\u201d she asked and Daniel nodded.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d he took a deep breath, \u201cso what\u2019s your story, dear?\u201d Daniel asked, leaning towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t like to get too personal,\u201d said the lady and Daniel\u2019s eyebrow went up in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this thing!\u201d he wondered about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, since you seem to be very interested, I will tell you something personal,\u201d she said, not looking at Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be my anti-ageing techniques,\u201d she beamed at Daniel. It was a good thing that Daniel was holding something on his chair else he would have fallen much to his embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Master, can you guess my age?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut what\u2019s the point of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, Master. I know I don\u2019t even look half my age and hence asking my age is pointless but that is the whole point, you know,\u201d she wiggle her  bony fingers the whole time she talked. \u201cI am full seven hundred thirty two years old and \u2013 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut matchboxes weren\u2019t invented seven hundred thirty two years ago, were they?\u201d Daniel interrupted. <br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not, Master. In those times I co-habited with a lousy genie who \u2013 what do I say about him \u2013 he made babies by dozens with me. That is when I decided to move out of the lamp and live on a tree. But then the monkeys thought I was some kind of itching device and used me for their backs, arms and - \u201d<br>\r\n       \u201cOkay, okay enough details about the places you itched. How were you born?\u201d<br>\r\n       \u201cNaughty, Master,\u201d she jiggled her shoulders a bit, \u201cI am not telling you that.\u201d<br>\r\n       \u201cO-oh. No no not the process, of course I know the process but who gave you birth?\u201d<br>\r\n       \u201cYou don\u2019t know who gives birth to genies, Master?\u201d  Daniel shrugged his shoulders in reply.<br>\r\n       \u201cGoats give us birth, Master. The wild ones,\u201d she smiled.<br>\r\n      \u201cWait. What. The Goat goat, huh? The one which gives milk and has that beard on their chin that goat,\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, Master, you are making fun of my mother.\u201d<br>\r\nDaniel was stunned not for the first time. He was brave enough to ask the next question \u2013 <br>\r\n\u201cAnd fathers?\u201d and he saw Bony lady\u2019s facial expression change and so he corrected himself, \u201cit must be the Male Goats, right? Of course, what kind of question was that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Master, Male goats are not our father. They are too ugly to bear beautiful child like us,\u201d she smiled her best smile, the one which doesn\u2019t show her tooth gap.<br>\r\nDaniel looked at Bony lady and studied her. She sure had the body of a goat \u2013 a malnourished goat maybe \u2013 but a goat sure. That is why she had that hint of hair on this chin which he had been mistaking for mosquito till then. He continued - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you were saying that the Goats are not your father then who is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by \u201care\u201d your father?\u201d this is the first time she hadn\u2019t added master in her conversation. Must have pinched her real bad.<br>\r\n\u201cI mean if Goat\u201cis\u201d not your father then who is, right?\u201d Daniel corrected his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBony lady said  -\u201cNo, ugly Goats are not our father,\u201d Daniel wanted to stop her right there and tell her to correct \u201cGoats are\u201d to \u201cGoats is\u201d but what was the point, he thought after all he stood there talking to a bone frame, who was supposedly a genie and had Goat as her mother - what could be more woeful and pointless than that. He let that feeling pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOstriches are our father,\u201d she said, \u201cand mind you, just the wild ones,\u201d and she winked at Daniel who was trying to imagine the union of a wild Goat and a wild Ostrich. It was a curious scene, something he never believed his mind would see and he had to shake his head to get over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are born as eggs, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaah, Master as spirits \u2013 hollow spirits if I may say \u2013 until we find our vessel,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this is your vessel, right?\u201d Daniel pointed to the matchbox. Bony lady smiled yet another widest of smiles and said \u2013 <br>\r\n\u201cMy new Master knows everything,\u201d she seemed to be so proud of him. The word \u201cnew\u201d had caused a curiosity in a Daniel\u2019s mind and hence he asked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Lady \u2013 Hey by the way, what is your name?\u201d he was kind of embarrassed to have asked her name so late in the conversation. He wondered what he had been calling her till that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bony Lady seemed to be taken back by this question as if Daniel had asked her to draw the exact structure of Mitochondria - \u201cO-oh. U-umm, I d-don\u2019t know master, \u201cshe waved her hand around in surprise, \u201cNobody has asked me my name in ages, I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! You have served people all your seven hundred thirty two years of life and nobody has made the effort to know your name,\u201d Daniel felt aggrieved for her but was also astounded by the fact that he remembered the exact number of years the Bony Lady had lived for.<br>\r\nThe Bony Lady was very surprised herself too and she looked with watery eyes towards Daniel, \u201cMaster, you name me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-whoa, now this is some responsibility!\u201d Daniel exclaimed and felt a bit overwhelmed, as if somebody had asked him to rear up a teenager. \u201cA thing \u2013 sorry \u2013 a person didnt have a name for over seven hundred years and suddenly that responsibility falls on me. Very unfair,\u201d he tut-tutted, \u201chow does Selvy sound to you?\u201d he was surprised by the pace with which mind had come up with a name, never mind how foolish it sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bony lady rolled her eyes around for an instant, as if trying the multitude scenarios in which her name would be called which were nothing a big fat zero till then, and said \u201cIt doesn\u2019t dazzle, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel tried again, \u201cSylvia, Selica, Strontia?\u201d he fired the names but each were met by disapproving eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it about starting with letter \u201cS\u201d, Master?\u201d she whined. <br>\r\nDaniel came up with twenty names in alphabets from T to Z and all were rejected \u2013 the closest which came to approval was Zitty but the Bony Lady thought it to be too classy for her taste. Daniel tried to convince her but she wouldn\u2019t budge and now they had reached the alphabet C but nothing was working. It had been an almost hour since when this game started and Daniel was starting to lose it now. He was trying hard to not scream at her (less realistic) or kick her (most realistic) and that is when the Bony lady said \u2013<br>\r\n\u201cHow about Selvy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but this was the first name I told you,\u201d spoke Daniel, gnashing his teeth and walking towards her, tightening his calf muscles to kick her. But this aggressive posturing had no effect on the Bony Lady who was now trying out her name in multitude of scenarios while talking to herself. It felt just fine to her and it was evident with that beaming smile of hers which had returned to her face. She sang the following \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can Selvy do for you, Master?\u201d and her white marble eyes twinkled a little too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1612 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The white marble eyes of the lady moved around in the socket as she scanned Daniel\u2019s expression. The skin on her face appeared as if it could peel off any moment, as she walked towards Daniel, such was the looseness and paleness of her skin. Her walk had an air of menace about it, those crouching jerky motions quite synced with the thoughts going on in her rotten mind; in some way it was quite like the walk of a leopard, who walks knowing that the prey won\u2019t get away no matter how much the leopard dawdles.  With every jerky step which the lady took, Daniel\u2019s heartbeat wnet up a notch. His eyes went towards the lady\u2019s feet to find the cause of such awkward walk \u2013 what he saw he couldn\u2019t believe and he felt the hair on the back of his neck rise. Although the darkness in the room didn\u2019t allow him to anything much but he was sure that he saw her feet were turned around with the ball of the heels facing Daniel. It was as if her body, waist down onwards, was of somebody else who was standing with his face in the opposite direction.  She looked at Daniel\u2019s face and flashed a smile at him, looked at her legs and said \u2013<br>\r\n\u201cThat happened on an exorcism night, Daniel. That was a bad bad day,\u201d she added in a hushed tone. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThere was something about the way in which she said it that made Daniel even more comfortable than he was. That nasal voice of hers could pierce through glass and right now, it was piercing through the bravado and courage of Daniel. She was now standing at an arm\u2019s distance from Daniel, whose lungs were tiring from filtering breathable air from the most putrid of environments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel knew he had to solve this mystery before it went further into his head and stressed him even more. He gathered courage to look into those sickening eyes which were piercing his soul and asked \u2013 <br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\nDaniel\u2019s room reverberated with the sound of the lady\u2019s laugh which seemed more and more sinister as it went on. <br>\r\n\u201cI am Haddiva from beyond the living realm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was not overtly surprised about it since he somehow felt that the soul standing in front of him wasn\u2019t from the realm of the breathing ones. He asked \u2013<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why are you here, Haddiva?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo serve my master,\u201d she said with a smile which curved her lips but didn\u2019t reach her eyes, \u201dand that would be you, Daniel.\u201d<br>\r\nDaniel had heard this before and he wanted the \u201cwhy\u201d of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are from the dead, Haddiva, and you belong to that place. Who called you here?\u201d<br>\r\nDaniel noticed that Haddiva\u2019s face contorted when he said those words to her \u2013 it was if someone had pricked a needle in her heart \u2013but she was now regaining normalcy. <br>\r\n\u201cNobody calls me, Daniel,\u201d her voice shivered with suppressed anger as she said those words, \u201cbut I come to those who belong to me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBelong to you? Why do you think I belong to you, Haddiva?\u201d Daniel was peeling off the layers one by one in order to reach to pit the truth.<br>\r\n        Haddiva\u2019s eyebrows curved upwards as if surprised by Daniel\u2019s comments \u2013 <br>\r\n        \u201cHow could you not remember it, Daniel? You sacrificed your own mother for me,\u201d she smiled       again, slightly opening her mouth which very looked like the hell in which Daniel\u2019s brain was getting sucked into. Daniel\u2019s head was spinning like a whirlpool in the middle of a wild river. Leave alone him, but how could anyone sacrifice their own mother, the one guardian angel we are blessed with! He held his head and crashed to his bed.<br>\r\nDaniel was raised by his grandmother alone in a village far beyond the Stark Realm. Ever since he remembered, he hadn\u2019t seen her mother or even father for that matter. Grandma said that Father went through the Re-Re forest once, to collect food he told them but never returned back. And his mother \u2013 well he knew nothing about his mother. Every time he had asked to get the facts straight with Grandma, she had avoided it like plague, as if something rotten was behind it. Grandma not only shooed the topic away but did it with such force and thrust that he felt below dignity to raise it again with her. As if something more was there to it than what met the eye. Those images from his conversations with Grandma were now flashing in his mind. He could see in them how pained Granny looked every time that topic was brought up. And then, an image hijacked his mind which gave him a bolt of sorts; it was the image of his grandmother trying to say something to him. He remembered now that she had started to tell him about his mother dying while giving birth to him. She was now opening up about his father who had left for the forest to never come back and that is when she started to choke, as if somebody was pulling her breaths away from her. She was sick, and on some really cold and foggy days she did have problems while talking, but this felt something different as if some invisible force was strangling her, not wanting to let her talk any further about it. He remembered her waving her arms around as someone who is choked would and then falling silent all of a sudden. Tears ran down his eyes as he relived those heart wrenching images in his heart. He cursed himself that he didn\u2019t push her Granny more for it back then because as what now seemed pretty certain was that there was something evil behind it all and he knew nothing about it till today. <br>\r\nHaddiva was looking at him all this while, as he murmured and cursed himself. She knew what he was going through but just to be sure she decided to ask her \u2013 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that your mother was killed as she gave birth to you?\u201d her voice was dull, monotonus and had no trace of earnestness in it; all what it had was malice.<br>\r\nDaniel flung his stare to her, as it could cut her to pieces \u2013 \u201cBut, I didn\u2019t kill her,\u201d he said, gnashing his teeth.<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t but your birth did, Daniel and there is no denying \u2013 \u201c<br>\r\n\u201cWhat could a child do if the mother dies while giving birth. What is there which a child could do, Haddiva?\u201d<br>\r\nShe thought for a while, as if considering before revealing some secret, and then said, \u201cBut maybe, your father could have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFather!\u201d a look of angst and surprise came on his face, \u201cFather was away in the forest, Haddiva. He had gone missing some months before my birth.\u201d Daniel wasn\u2019t even sure of whether Haddiva was saying the truth but it didn\u2019t stop him from feeling awful about it, as his mind made him relive those old wounds again.<br>\r\nHaddiva had the coldest of smile on her face as she spoke \u2013 \u201cBut did you ever question your mother why your father went away, Daniel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did \u2013 that is what I told you. That is what I know!\u201d Daniel was now screaming at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow gullible little kid are you, Daniel?\u201d she sniggered, \u201cshe tells you that father was lost in the forest and you take that? I pity you,\u201d she smiled some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel moved threateningly towards Haddiva and muttered under his breath \u2013 \u201cOne more word about me or my family, Haddiva and I would \u2013 \u201c<br>\r\n\u201cYou would what? Kill me? Kill the darkest of spirits which inhabit the land of the living, Daniel?\u201d she laughed on his face, \u201cPoor gullible little kid,\u201d she tut-tutted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel had had enough of her; his tightened hand landed with such force on Haddiva\u2019s cheeks that it made a thudding sound so loud that the birds sitting on the tree flew away. Haddiva was violently pushed to a side by another shove from Daniel who was now walking towards the window of the room. He stood there looking outside for some time, taking deep breaths to take his mind away from what all he had heard till then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas this all true? Was he the reason behind the death of his mother? Was there something else behind the disappearance of his father?\u201d many more questions such as these bulleted in his mind as he considered the possibilities of the story which Haddiva was trying to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he heard her whisper - \u201cLike father, like son,\u201d and she whispered it just loudly enough for it to reach Daniel\u2019s ears. He turned to look at Haddiva who still had that sickening smile on her pale, dead face.<br>\r\nHe walked towards her with urgent steps and said \u2013 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want from me, Haddiva?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have told you before too, Daniel. I want to fulfill your wishes \u2013 especially the darkest of them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about my father, will you\u201d Daniel said, with tears burning his eyes, without even listening to what Haddiva offered to him.<br>\r\n\u201cOr you could ask for the ultimate power in the darkest of realms?\u201d Haddiva teased her, not thinking twice about her tears. Daniel didn\u2019t answer but his red eyes did which were baying for her blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you want to, Daniel \u2013 just like your father,\u201d she said with that manic smile again, \u201dyou were a blessing from Satan which was got after sacrificing your mother for it. Poor Mother, little did she knew that her husband didn\u2019t go to the forest to just bring the woods but he also went there to raise the dead from the morgue. He was a necromancer, Daniel, he was a NECROMANCER!\u201d Haddiva\u2019s thunderbolt hit Daniel with quite some force and he plopped to his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1652 words)<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

They smelled like moss left out in the sun or brambles under the roses. They each had different color hair; one had silver gray hair that streamed behind her like a lace curtain, another had hair a fierily red with green stripes, short and curly, the last was bald, shaven to the deep mahogany skin. Or what she thought was skin. It had a pattern on it that resembled tree bark and not the smooth skin of most human types<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah was not afraid. These three looked like her book club old ladies before discussing Fifty Shades of Gray, a book some had thrown against a wall and others had put through a blender half way through reading it. She, herself, had torn the pages out and used it for paper on the bottom of the royal parrot's cage. Inner goddess, indeed, thought Hannah. More like an inner prepubescent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hags waved their arms at her, all pointy fingernails, black with something, wailing away, coming closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Hannah planted her tiny feet on the ground and crossed her arms. \"Oh, go away and bother someone else. I have many things to do today. That sword looks like you got it out of the five and dime store or a high school musical. And whoever that was you gave it to is obviously the village simpleton. I don't know what you want but hurry about your way, I am Queen Hannah and too important for the likes of you. Plus, you stink. Sorry, I know it's not politically correct to call a homeless old person a stinky person, but you three could use a good hot bath at the YMCA. Plus, they have cots you can sleep on and some clean clothes to wear. The ones you have on are all tattery and torn. How do I know about the YMCA, you may ask yourself, or selves, being a Queen and all. Well, my Uncle Jasper liked a little too much of the gin bottle and smoked a little too many bunches of gangee to have a straight head. He lost his job and ended up at the YMCA for about a year or so. Best thing that ever happened to him. He fell down the stairs and broke his leg and..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hags were getting agitated. they weren't use to humans not running away from them and screaming. It ruined their act. They menaced closer. The red haired hag stuffed moss in her ears to try and drown out the whiney, sing song voice of Hannah the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..and then he ended up in the hospital and met the cutest little nurse's aide who took pity on him and got him on the straight and narrow. He owns a furniture story now and sells those chairs you lay in, you know, a Lazy Boy chair? Oh, look, you three need a manicure. Your nails have brown and green fungus all over them! I know a great manicurist in East Hedgerow over in the North Kingdom. If you don't mind a dwarf doing your nails, they do a wonderful job, much better than the pixies who tend to get more of the nail color all over themselves and the floor rather than your nails. So let me just pull Chez Beauty's card out of my sleeve (that's where I keep all my cards, you know, better than a purse, although sometimes they fall out into my soup)..\" the Queen chattered on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hags had had enough. The silver haired hag reached out with bony hands and grabbed the Queen's long, slender neck. She startled. The hag's fingers went right through the air, as though the Queen wasn't there at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, ha, you old witches with a b! You think I got to be Queen by being a fool? I am a first class ventriloquist, and a second class mirage maker. The great Houdini taught me all he knew before he got sucker punched. You will never find me! I was sure and researched all I could about these parts before I came over. Don't you know there is a Fodor's guide to the kingdom? Of course, I don't use that one. Too conservative for me. I prefer to use the Lonely Planet's Guide to the GOT Kingdom, version 2.12. In English, although I heard the elfin version had..\" the Queen prattled on and on and on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hags passed their one eyeball around to each other and stared. They tried to strangle the image of Queen Hannah again, but is was like trying to squeeze a mist. The red haired hag kicked a horny foot onto the mirage Queen's buttocks. That really made the queen laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed so hard, she fell over, feet over kimble, Her tall crown fell off her head and she lost another crown jewel (really they were the faux jewels, the king didn't let the real one out of the vault. Queen Hannah was forever losing things or getting into battles. He tried to explain to her that a crown was not a disc to be hurled, and her staph was not a sword, but Queen Hannah would use whatever was handy.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fair,\" growled the silver haired hag. \"You aren't playing by the fantasy rules. You're supposed to be a helpless female who needs a strong knight to come save her. We even polished up our eye to scare you better with. Don't you know who we are? We are the three witchy hags of the forest! We eat gross things and moan and groan. We strangle small children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shame on you, then,\"scolded the mirage Queen. \"You should know better than that. Small children make good pets, sometimes. Why waste them? I have a whole prison full of scumbags you are all welcome to so I don't have to keep feeding them and entertaining them. Did you know they gave me a list of commands? The nerve of them! Well ladies, it was nice to chat, but I have things to do and people to be royal to. If you would like my card, here, let me look up my sleeve..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hags vanished in a poof of air. They knew they wouldn't get anywhere with this crazy queen. They felt bad for the king, though. They promised themselves they would send him a big fruit basket next Yule tides<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the hags were gone, Queen Hannah removed the invisibility cloak she had borrowed from a brat of a boy named Harry, and lifted her not so delicate nose in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, they are gone, thought the Queen. The air smelled like pine and poppies again. Speaking of poppies, the Queen felt her stomach rumble. She pulled out a long loaf of Frenchified bread, a pat of European butter (made by elves of course) and a knife to spread from her sleeve. A couple of cards were stuck in the butter, so she pulled them out after licking the delicious creamy yellow butter off them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, well, they weren't readable anymore, she thought. I can get more. But this bread is divine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Queen was devouring her bread and in plain sight in the opening, without her invisibility cloak on, a creature started to creep up on her. It was attracted to the heavenly smell of fresh baked bread and oozy warm butter.

Seven white geese landed with grace in the clearing, shook their feathers and lined up in a row to face Queen Hannah, who stood gaping in amazement.<br>\r\nThe mages , however, were totally annoyed.<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first Goose, the leader for this moment, {for as you well know, geese take turns} pecked at the mage and turned to speak to the Queen,;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great Queen of Stark lands, long have we flown and borne witness to the trials of this kindgdom. Mages, it is true, give allegiance to none, but yet truth can be tricky to interpret. We are the 7 as the mages are 3 and all must be heard for the return to peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second goose  was preening her feathers and at the end of the line two were squawking to each other.  The smallest, one was roosting, tired our from her journey. It was her first since she replaced the old one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence\", the mage said in annoyance. 'You geese are so.. oh just.get on with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In time,\" replied the leader, setting her gray eyes on the mages. \"Now, some refreshment would be nice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and the mage just shook their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and if you would look from the tallest tree there, out to your right, you will find a band of rebels camped. And not Martell , but  the Night's Watch! Just in case it matters to you. Though again, we judge them not and cannot promise not to squawk there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh Right\" piped up a much younger goose from behind. \"they would be more as like to shoot first and listen later if we just flew in there. They have little trust in such as us--given all they have seen.  Though they are not the worst of the Houses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, squawked the elder and pecked his beak.

They flew south by southwest for a few hours, before finding themselves near the BeastMaster\u2019s home.  Spying the telltale signs of the BeastMaster.   They knew they were close when predators and prey were seen roaming fields side by side.  Normally aggressive predators acted as meek as sheep, yet none appeared hungry.  Surely some magic beside the BeastMasters ability to control the beasts was at work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally they spied a small wood cabin that they innately knew belonged to the BeastMaster.  As they landed, he emerged from inside and looked at them with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been expecting you my friends.  What causes you to visit me in such a rush?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBeastMaster, we beseech thee, please kind sir!  As geese, the wise ones of the land will not listen to our advice.  We are cut off before we can complete a sentence, mocked to our faces.  If only we can be wise like you, or human even.  We have heard you know magic, by chance is there a spell you can cast that will allow us to be listened to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy friends, come inside, let\u2019s sit and talk a little, and decide exactly what it is you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The BeastMaster led them inside his spacious cabin.  It had looked so small from the air, and while talking outside, but once inside it was a veritable castle!  Once they were all seated comfortably, the BeastMaster asked, \u201cNow, exactly what would you like of me?  Yes, I can do many things to help you, and will do so gladly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0BeastMaster couldn\u2019t help but smile as the geese talked among themselves.  Finally, the elder shushed the rest and turned to him and said, \u201cSire, if it\u2019s not asking too much, we\u2019d like to be wise beyond years, and human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He rubbed his chin as he looked at them and said, \u201cI can do one or the other, but I cannot make you wise, and human.  You have to choose which you will be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once again the geese talked amongst themselves, and finally the elder again addressed BeastMaster.  \u201cWe would like to be human.  We think that only by being human will people listen to us.  Thank you for this boon BeastMaster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is done then, sleep well tonight, for tomorrow you wake as seven humans.  All female, sisters.  I name you,\u201d he pointed at each one as he said their names, \u201cAsterope, Merope, Electra, Maia, Taygeta, Celaeno, and Alcyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next morning, seven stunningly beautiful women stood before BeastMaster.  He looked at them, and knew he had done the best he could, but still, something was not quite right.  It was not until Merope, who had been the elder spoke, that he realized what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh girls, look at us!  Let\u2019s get going!

She had watched closely as Yore spoke with the BeastMaster, and confidently took it from him.  She placed it next to her ear, upside down.  \u201cBeastMaster, we need help!  You didn\u2019t tell us about shopping, that things need to be paid for!  What shall we do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhich one of you is this?

When the call was finished, he turned to the girls and said, \u201cHe\u2019s on his way.  BeastMaster is not an easy man to cross, so don\u2019t get on his wrong side.  He doesn\u2019t feel you girls are going to make it, so he\u2019s going to change you back to geese.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a lot of protests from the sisters at this; it was all Yore could do to placate them and keep them calm.  About an hour later the BeastMaster came in the door and looked at the seven sisters in the cell.  He shook his head as he saw them, then looked at Yore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you sure you can handle this old Yore?  Are you sure you want an anchor like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yore hung his head a little and quietly said, \u201cYes Sir.  I like the curly haired one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0BeastMaster looked at the sisters and said, \u201cI know Yore has told you what I\u2019m going to do.  However, I am only going to change 6 of you back.  Yore has needed a mate since his changing\u2026\u201d  There was quite a commotion at this announcement, and quite a few questions about Yore\u2019s changing.   Finally getting the sisters quieted, BeastMaster said, \u201cYes, at one time, Yore was like you, and underwent the changing process.  He\u2019s done well, and has served me well.  It\u2019s time to reward him.  Like I said, I only need six of you, and he likes Electra the most.  I know, I know.   But I don\u2019t have 6 more donkeys acting as human around here, so I can\u2019t find mates for all of you!  Besides, I already have seven swans a swimming.  Maybe the rest of you six sisters can lay eggs and raise some young.  And, if we do happen to find any suitors, I will change you back just like I did this time.  Now, lay down and sleep, for tomorrow you regain your former beauty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that, the BeastMaster walked out of the jail, leaving the sister still having a fit, and Yore with a silly grin on his face\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1037 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Before he could be allowed to embarrass himself, Lord Matt saved the day and called in the Targaryen dragons. They swooped down and burnt the shop to the ground.

Hannah knew a few words of Lannisterish and flinched when she heard them.  \"War\"  \"Witch\" and \"Magic\" were the words but she wondered how they fit into the conversation and the future of the Realm.  The woman handed the Lannister spy two candles.  Hanna wondered what kind of magic were represented by the candles; surely they were magical because he could have purchased any of many varieties of candles back in the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second ancient woman spoke in a language which Hannah understood, however she spoke in low tones with an unusual accent so her full message to the spy was incomplete.  Hannah heard her say, \"A uniquely unusual army has armed itself and is marching toward the river.\"  The remainder of the message, where, when, for what reason, and such, just wasn't spoken loud enough for Hannah.  She gasped, \"Huh?\"  The ancient woman wearing a royal purple cape, handed the Lannister spy a small kitten.  Hannah wondered what the kitten was about?  Did it have some ability such as speaking or performing magic?  Would it become an aggressive fighter for the Lannister people?  Was it of a religious origin with the ability to hear the secrets of the Lannister enemies, like Hannah's people?  What an unusual item to hand to a strong man on a horse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third ancient woman spoke clearly in Hannah's language which made Hannah wonder if she was a spy with or against the realm.  She knew spies needed to have strong language abilities to serve their House well.  Listening closely, she heard, \"You must arrive there before noon on the fifth and be at the central well or you will miss your contact.  Your contact will be carrying on his horse, a blue light similar to this one.\"  She handed the Lannister spy what appeared to be a round ball, white in appearance, but flashing an emerald green light.  It was similar to what Hannah had seen other Lannister men carrying on the horn of their saddle so she wondered if there was something different about the one given to the spy?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spy stood there for a moment as if he had questions to ask but the last woman who spoke to him waved him off, \"Hurry, there is still time if you hurry.  Go.\"  He responded and leaped on his horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching him leave, Hannah turned her sights toward the three ancient women but they were no longer there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah knew where she needed to go so she was quickly in the saddle and rode off in a different direction than the spy had gone. She needed to share the acquired information right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2736 characters</span></div></div>",

Gold and silver threads woven into the rich silk tapestry of a wall hanging wink and twinkle, mirroring the stars of the evening sky outside as a breeze ruffles the folds of the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA narrow rectangle of flickering light comes from an open door to the left.  Spender listens to the melodious notes of the snatches of an old country song which waft through the air as Hannah moves about in the room next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA container of wooden spills sits on the hearth.  As Spender strides across and touches the end of one to the embers of the fire and lights the wall sconces, the singing stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that you, Spender?\u201d  Her footsteps hurry towards the door and her silhouette fills the rectangle of light on the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho else are you expecting, cousin?\u201d  His teasing laugh and grinning face greet her as she enters the newly illuminated room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah has discarded her riding clothes and stands resplendent in an emerald green velvet gown embroidered around the neckline, cuffs and hem with exotic flowers and birds.  Her chestnut tresses have been released from braids.  They frame her face and cascade down onto her shoulders.  Spender\u2019s eyes soften as he catches sight of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Liege Lady!\u201d  He sweeps down into an elaborate bow; admiration filling his voice, then leaps across the room and enfolds her in a most un-cousinly embrace.  She laughs and returns his ardour momentarily before breaking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough of this buffoonery, my dear!  We have much to discuss.\u201d  She takes his hand and draws him over to a table laden with scrolls and manuscripts.  Unrolling one of the scrolls, she spreads it out on the table in front of her.  Spender comes and stands at her shoulder and they peruse the map revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Mystic Alliance are on the move.\u201d Hannah takes a small pebble from a bowl on the table and places it on the map.  \u201cI say three of the old hags meet here, deep in Waverley Forest, with a Lannister spy.\u201d  Spender bends over the map and examines it closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes!

What on earth was that all about?\u201d  Hannah looks at Spender expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat ties in with the troops I saw in the Forest.\u201d  His eyes light up with excitement.  \u201cBut the kitten!  Who knows what they are up to there?\u201d  He shakes his head in dismay.  \u201cNo doubt we will find out in time.  What about the third old biddy?\u201d  Hannah resumes her tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe spoke fluently in our own language.\u201d  Hannah closes her eyes in concentration.  <i><b>\u2018You must arrive there before noon on the fifth and be at the central well or you will miss your contact.\u2019</b></i>  Hannah speaks in an eerie singsong voice.

What are they up to?  We will have to try and find out.\u201d  Spender started to pace around the room distractedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe spy stood there for a few moments, as if he was about to ask a question, until the third old woman waved him away and bid him to go quickly.\u201d  Hannah breathed deeply.  \u201cThen, he leapt on his horse and I watched him gallop off.\u201d  Hannah walked over to the easy chair beside the fire and sat down.  \u201cWhen I turned round to see what the old women were up to, they had just vanished.  It was as if none of them had even been there.\u201d  Spender joins her by the fire and they sit in silence thinking for a few moments.  Then he leans forward towards Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe must ride towards Westeros and see what we can discover.\u201d  He walks to the table and Hannah follows him.  \u201cWe will make for the Inn on the corner of these crossroads.\u201d  He points to a spot on the map.  \u201cDress warmly, for winter is coming and there is a biting wind outside.\u201d  Hannah nods and her face brightens at the prospect of some action.  \u201cMake sure you have your hair and face well-hidden.  We don\u2019t want anyone to recognise you.\u201d  Hannah rushes to the door of the dressing room next door to prepare for the journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToday is the first of the month, Spender!  There is no time to lose.  We must fly like the wind.\u201d  She disappears into the room next door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will go to my room and collect what I need.\u201d Spender heads for the outer door and puts his hand on the doorknob, his voice ringing out like a bell.  \u201cBring the needle with you, Hannah.  We may need to fight our way to the truth.\u201d  He opens the door to the corridor as Hannah\u2019s arm reappears round the edge of the door of the dressing room, brandishing a sharp blade which glints in the daylight, closely followed by her grinning face.  \u201dGet a move on, slowcoach!\u201d  Spender guffaws loudly as he exits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you in the stables in twenty minutes.\u201d  He closes the door behind him and races down the stairs and heads towards the kitchen, mentally making a list of all that he will need for the days ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dressing room above, Hannah hums to herself as she pulls on her travelling coat and starts to throw things into saddlebags and stuff her pockets with smaller items.  She suddenly stands and stares into the mirror on the wall, then she picks up the Needle, her sword.  Very deliberately, she bunches her beautiful hair tightly together at the nape of her neck and, with deft strakes, saws through the thick hank with the sharp edge of her trusty blade.  She thinks it is a good feeling to be off on the road again with a true and loyal companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n929  words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n5116 characters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hannah will have to disappear for a while.  She opens one of the drawers in the dresser, reaches into it, takes out a small jar, and opens it.  A pungent aroma rises from it and she wrinkles her nose.  She hesitates for only a second or two, then, she sighs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith quick, deft strokes she smooths the dark, greasy contents over her lustrous hair, obliterating the burnished copper glinting in the light of the wall sconces.  Her hair and hands smell of the deep forest as she rubs the substance into her hair with vigour.  She takes another jar from the drawer and spreads the rough paste from it into the pale skin of her face and neck.  She stands back and surveys the result with some satisfaction.  Another few touches and the swarthy complexion of Anya Stark stares back at her from the glass.  She pulls on a hat, over her hair, and tucks the tendrils up under it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya throws her saddlebags over one shoulder and grasps Needle firmly in her other hand.  She has wrapped the blade carefully in leather and she straps it securely to her back, turns on her heel, and leaves the dressing room.  In the Upper Hall she rolls up the map, inserts it into a leather tube, and tucks it into the inner pocket of her greatcoat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya grabs an apple from a bowl on the table and bites into its sweet flesh as she crosses the landing and lopes down the long sweep of the staircase to the Lower Hall.  She stops just long enough retrieve her riding boots from the old cupboard and pull them on before following Spender\u2019s exit route through the deserted kitchen and out to the stables beyond.  A full moon illuminates the yard and the damp cobbles glow silver in the moon\u2019s eerie light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpender is waiting for her with their mounts already saddled.  He looks at the girl in momentary surprise, but makes no comment.  An indulgent smile touches his lips and his eyes dance.  In the last ten years, he has seen this side of his cousin many times.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe must fly like the wind if we hope to get there before daylight.\u201d  Anya mounts her horse and turns its head expertly towards the stable yard gate.  The hooves clatter on the cobbles as Spender follows her out onto the bluff and they begin the descent to the forest road below.  Their dark figures blend into the rock behind them as they pick their way down the boulder-strewn, narrow path cut into the cliff face.  They have to dismount at one point to negotiate a rock fall but are soon on the road below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya takes her bearings from the stars above and heads west on the road, with Spender at her side.  They settle into an easy canter.  It would not do to exhaust the horses before they get to their destination.  The road is covered with fallen leaves, which deadens the sound of the horses\u2019 hooves, but Anya realises that it will also deaden the sound of any other riders that may be abroad this night.  She prays to the Old Gods to watch over them on their journey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n558 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The hot breath of the cantering horses steams from their nostrils and mingles with a gathering ethereal mist which rises from the damp evening ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya\u2019s mind floods with memories of other headlong rides through the night.  She had fled from King\u2019s Landing disguised as a boy to escape Joffrey\u2019s Guard, just after her father had been murdered.  Her sister had not been so lucky.  As far as Anya knew, she was still a virtual prisoner in the Capital.  The following months had been a constant, vital battle to keep her identity hidden from the others in the party.  Eventually, she had come to regard some of them as trusted companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo years had not noticeably dimmed the feeling of being hounded that had dogged her on that fateful journey.  Many times she and her companions had faced discovery and death.  They had endured privations and hardship, had been at her side throughout, and had become a loyal band, looking out for each other as they fled from the capital.  Some had not survived.  She wondered what had become of those who had.  Rumours were rife in these troubled times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was younger then, a mere child, really, but her will had been strong, and it was, subsequently, to be tempered in the fire of danger.  Her present steely resolve was the result.  As her recollections of that trying time fill her thoughts, this resolve hardens. <i> \u2018King Joffrey will pay for all the pain he has caused to my family and friends.\u2019</i>  She tightens her hold on the reins and increases her speed to catch up with Spender, who has raced in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya\u2019s thoughts snap back to the present as she realises that Spender has reined in his horse up ahead of her.  She eases back on the speed of her horse, Midnight, and trots to her cousin\u2019s side.  He is standing up in his stirrups, listening.  Off in the distance there is the thunder of hooves.  It seems as if many riders are on the road, approaching from the opposite direction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be seen here!\u201d  Both horses are snorting and tossing their heads.  \u201cWe must get off the road and hide until they pass.\u201d  His voice echoes in the stillness as he turns his mount towards the trees.  Anya follows him deep into the undergrowth where they dismount.  They have barely had a chance to conceal themselves, and settle the horses, before the first rider appears. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnya gasps and sinks further down as the imposing figure heaves into view.  He is wreathed in a swirling white mist which leaks sideways into the forest, and he sits astride a magnificent, pure, white charger, which has a flowing silver mane and tail streaming out behind it, in the back current of the forward motion.  Every part of the leather saddle and harness are studded with burnished silver.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA silver helmet in the form of an eagle\u2019s head sits on top of the rider\u2019s head, glinting in the moonlight, and a flowing plume surmounts its brow.  A thick fur cape is fastened around his neck.  His face is shrouded in shadows, but his eyes glow with a piercing blue light.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA White Walker!  So far south!\u201d  Anya\u2019s horrified gasp is quickly stifled as the rider draws nearer. <br>\r\nBehind him ride a horde of insubstantial figures who seem to be part of the mist.  As the horde approach, the White Walker pauses and the tumult of the hooves subsides leaving behind a sibilant whispering.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya feels a chill creep over her as the mist seems to surge out towards her from the deathly form on the white charger.  An aroma of death and decay fill her nostrils.  Seconds elongate, as time seems to stretch.  The two cousins press themselves closer to the ground and pray to the Old Gods to keep them hidden.  It seems that the old Gods are listening.  The mist flows around them before it ebbs back towards the forest edge once more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flourish of his reins, the White Walker surges forward once more, with the swathes of ghostly horsemen following in his wake.  The ground trembles as they pass.  As the tumult subsides, muffled by the trees as the riders disappear down the way that Anya and Spender had come, the icy white mist lingers at the margins of the forest and filters through the trees.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya and Spender stay where they are for a while, not quite believing that they have escaped the scrutiny of the the White Walker and his horde.  Gradually, they begin to shift from their uncomfortable positions and with many glances down the road that the host had disappeared along, they emerge from the undergrowth and squat down under an old oak tree to gather their strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think the White Walkers had come this far south.\u201d  Anya\u2019s voice shakes with emotion.  \u201cSurely the Wall has not been breached?\u201d  She drops her head in despair at this turn of events.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was talk in the tavern, but I didn\u2019t give it much credence.\u201d  Spender brushes at the leaves clinging to his coat in distraction.  \u201cThis means things are much more dangerous for the whole of the Kingdom, not just for us.\u201d  The sound of the horses cropping the nearby grass fills the ensuing silence as the two young people sit deep in thought for several minutes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo matter!\u201d  Anya gets to her feet and dusts off some clinging ivy tendrils.  \u201cWe still need to deal with the events in hand and get to the crossroads.\u201d  Spender gathers up the reins of the horses as she speaks and passes those belonging to Midnight to her.  \u201cWe must be vigilant on the rest of the journey.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be slower but safer if we stay off the main road and travel through the trees for a while.\u201d  Spender mounts his horse and turns its head in a westerly direction, through the trees, and away from the road.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are right, as usual.\u201d  Anya mounts Midnight and follows his lead.  They move off in single file, as fast as the trees and undergrowth will allow.

The passage they follow is long and arduous but the Old Gods are watching over them and they encounter no more obstacles to reaching their destination.  The sky lightens to the east and they venture out on to the open road once more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, they make better time without the undergrowth and trees to hamper their progress.  They pass several small parties of other travellers, some going in the opposite direction, others in the same direction.  They pass, without incident.  One or two small parties are camped at the edge of the road.  A few others have made camp a little way off the beaten track.  None of them give more than a cursory look at the two travellers on the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dawn breaks Anya and Spender notice that the road is becoming more congested with people, animals, and carts.  They round a bend in the road and the bustling Inn is in sight.  The area around it is packed with other travellers, many readying themselves to leave.  A number of soldiers dressed in the livery of King Joffrey are either lounging about or patrolling the assembly with watchful eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya and Spender dismount and lead their horses to the back of the Inn, their heads lowered to avoid being seen by the soldiers.  They pay the stable hand and he takes the horses inside the stable to rub them down, feed, and water them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two figures blend into the general melee.  No one seems to be paying them much attention.  They move about the area for a time, their eyes taking in all, then, make their way back to the Inn.  There is no sign of the Lannister spy so far.  They take up a vantage point at a table at one of the windows, order some food and drink, and settle down to watch the road outside for his arrival.  They know he has to come here and meet with his contact before noon the next day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barmaid brings their food and they eat it in silence, each one deep in their own thoughts.  They must be vigilant and prepared to act at a moment\u2019s notice.  All through that day they watch and wait, taking turns to stretch their legs.  They know that this meeting must be stopped at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey don't know how they will manage it but both feel confident that when the time comes, they will find a way to complete their mission.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n425 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He was whispering \u201cBlack blood\u201d and had that fear in his eyes which is seen in the eyes of someone about to be impaled.<br>\r\n\u201cBlack Blood!\u201d - The word echoes in my mind each time louder than the before \u2013 each time venomous than before. \u201cHow could that be possible?\u201d I murmur as I feel this rage which I haven\u2019t felt for decades, now.  <br>\r\nMadness, pure savage madness, has crept up in my soul, my head, in the minutest particle of my being, my existence. My teeth gnash against each other as I stoop down to get hold of the neck of the spy and strangle him, crushing him against the floor - \u201cHow could that be true? Tell me you are drunk?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cMaster\u2026K-keeper, I am n-not l-l-ying. I c-can\u2019t forget those e\u2014e-yes, M-master,\u201d I push him back with force, in unadulterated angst. My head feels crushed, as if thumped with hundreds of hammer, at once. My veins throb as if it carries a pulsating wild River in it; waiting to burst out of my forehead and the forearm. I roared and thumbed my fist on the floor, sending shards of marble flying across me. The spy crawled back in horror; he thought he was going to die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn my head away from him. Maybe, that would lessen my angst. I don\u2019t want to look at anything which reminds me of those gloomy, bathed in blood times. Through the corner of my eye, I see the spy slowly slip away. I could hear his receding footsteps in the distance. I don\u2019t know what came to me. Poor Spy. Had to suffer so much in a single day. My Rage and  Those ghastly eyes. I feel my vein throbbing again with a new venom as I think about what the spy told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemon Eyes. The orbs from Hell. Cobra Eyes. Call it what one may but nothing justifies the stench of blood they oozed and the fear which they struck in the onlooker\u2019s heart. Those dark, pit-less maroon eyeballs. How could I forget them; how could anybody forget them? Death danced in them every moment. But wasn\u2019t he dead? <br>\r\nWasn\u2019t Queizan, the most revered and most brutal of leaders of Necromancer Army, dead for a decade now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI killed him,\u201d I murmur, \u201cI killed him in the battle of Sculptarian with the war-scythe of the warlord Asgus, himself. How could he not die? \u201d A renewed wraith enters my body and I shiver in angst like a tree in the strongest of winds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(479 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkb.png\" alt=\"*Checkb*\" title=\"Checkb\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

There were six of them in that group. It was a war party from the northern provinces, and they were on their way back to inform their king of their victory against their enemy's. That night they raised some issues in the inn, mainly with the wenches that served at the bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man paused, as the crowd was obviously hanging on his every word, for some unknown reason the seemed like they couldn't just walk away, they needed to hear the rest of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next morning,\" The old man continued,\" They left the inn peacefully, they didn't even pause when they rode out of sight that day. The town was glad for their departure as they kind of needed the time to get everything back in order from their visit. By the time the sun started to sink beneath the horizon a boy rode hard into town  with news that the party had been found and they reacted the same way he  seems to have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so what happened,\" Another voice called out from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the old man continued the story, telling them about the search party the town sent out.

There is also a cottage just out of town where an old wise woman lives and has precious shiny stones that are said to have powers or energies. I have met her and she seems harmless.

You keep my secret, I keep yours and we;ll see the land safe. No accident you shared that tale, it seems or that I happen to hear you.  Gaia be praised.  We need take care.  Now what will you do with him? He has sure seen things beyond his ability to deal with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mm. Yes, and the lord will keep at him.

Only elf and fairy kind could wander in as long as they were in balance with the earth.<br>\r\n She and Talen, her half brother were sent to seek what information they could.  She didn't like Talen's path--page to the king, for heaven's sake. Talk about being in the middle of things.  He was a master of deception though, like an actor. He could pretend and masquerade.  Likely a gift of being half elf. Magic was afoot the day he was born and all say he was special. Agelak the ancient seer even had a dream prophecy but their parents never told them exactly.

Something is happening here and on other planes....we must follow the energy and steps as come to us.\"  he ruffled her hair, blond like his own but curly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at him with eyes as blue as his.. \"You are right and allies come as boons. So you are all set. I can come..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no, you can't be seen with me, you know that\" he sighed. \"This is mine to do. You have another path.  We will be gathering soon enough but now we must seek and find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  I just needed to check on you. It is a hard habit to break after all these years.\" she stood straighter and took a breath.<br>\r\n\" Right , so off you  go and be careful.   I am off as well.

He rode alone through the west forest, stopping only to feed and water his horse. Going on a quest was more tiresome work than he had expected. The gypsies were a wandering people, they never settled down - something about the Mother of the earth calling to them. They were civilised enough, but they had quick horses and even quicker wits - any whiff of 'visitors' and they set off, scrambling. He'd only ever sighted their camps once during his journey - it didn't help that the earth magic favoured their cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on the eight morning that he found some favour with the gods. He had headed down to a stream to freshen up when he sighted it - the telltale glimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd followed it, reckless cutting through the undergrowth with his blade until he caught up with the light. It finally yielded to him and he touched it, excited but fearing what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe illusion of the forest shattered around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dozen tents were erected all around, the dazzling silks every colour imaginable. Talen gasped as he took in the sights - and the smells. Sharp incense filled his nostrils, the smell of fresh wine and cinnamon wafting in the forest air. There were only a dozen of the gypsy folk about minding their own business and they paid him no attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was said only those favoured of Mother earth would be allowed to enter the gypsy dwelling. Talen grinned from ear to ear, wiping the sweat of his brow. Apparently, he was favoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe so wanted to explore their forest town of exotic markets and silk tents. But he had a job. He had to seek out his acquaintance, or perhaps the gypsy priestess would be of more help regarding the \"shinning stone\"? Even as he thought about it, Talen felt the week's exhaustion descend on him.

He might need the rest, but he had more important matters at hand. Talen decided in an instant that he would visit the priestess. She would know best of the matters of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't put two feet ahead of him when he tripped and fell face first. \"What in the world -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalen pushed himself off the ground, dusting his cloak. When he turned to see the cause of his fall, he saw a little bundle of white cloth. Talen was incredibly puzzled - the thing hadn't been there a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the cursing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white cloth unfolded itself and a small arm and two feet appeared out of it. It was a cloak, he realised with a start and from the bundle emerged the smallest man he had ever seen. The dwarf hobbled up to his full height of two feet, looking at him with absolute contempt from his healer cloaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You insolent, blind wretch. Show some respect, else I'll be tempted to cut off those tall legs of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalen fought off the insane urge to laugh. The dwarf was clearly older than him - his hazel hair was streaked with a few silver whiskers, though his face showed none of his age. If it hadn't been for his manner, Talen could've easily mistaken him for a boy of seven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, I didn't -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See me here?\" The dwarf crinkled up his face, his hostility clear. \"You are as tactless as you are blind, then. You won't win any favours calling me a small man. That I already know, boy, or do you take me for an idiot, as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalen held his tongue for a while, not sure what to say. His mother had always told him that it was better to hold his breath and be thought of a fool, rather than to open his lips and remove all doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarf seemed to agree on that. \"Your silence is wise. Why are you here, puny human who intrudes in our land?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalen took offence at that. He wasn't puny. \"I'm Talen Earnhardt, First of his name, squire to -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, spare me the chattering, boy. I asked of your business.

There was not a night that went by when at least one of her patrons would be rushed to a medical centre or a mortuary.  Nobody dared to enter the place sober and nobody dared to refuse a drink when offered, which was why the spy had been so intoxicated upon his return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Inn had been surprisingly empty when the spy had entered.  There had been a couple of men, a few forest-dwellers, two firewraiths, and a couple of necromancers.  Despite the fact that they were all from different walks of life and from different lands, they were all huddled around one large table in the far corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough their voices were hushed, the spy was able to tell that the group was arguing.  The men were waving their arms about and the firewraiths were glowing a dangerous shade of blue.  The necromancers were the only people at the table who seemed to be relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spy took a seat at a table close enough to the group of conspirators so that he could eavesdrop, yet far enough away so that he would not appear too obvious or be taken for a threat. He summoned the barman and began drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the conversation he overheard was mundane and filled with the usual centuries-old mistrust that existed between the great races.  Although this group seemed to tolerate each other, the only two races who really got along were the necromancers and the firewraiths; that was only because they both drew on the ancient dark magics that man had long forgotten about, and they both shared a common ancestral bloodline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drinking three or four glasses of mandrake wine, the spy was well away with the faeries.  However, it was only then that the conversation he was listening in on took a decidedly dark turn.  There was a legend as old as time about The End of Days, and how it would ride in on the backs of four demons - the demons of earth, air, fire and water.  The End of Days would herald in an age of evil the like of which no man could imagine, and the necromancers had already summoned the demon of earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spy knew he had to report back to his master, and quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n397 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkb.png\" alt=\"*Checkb*\" title=\"Checkb\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

The wild tales of a drunken informant wouldn't normally raise alarm, but this fellow was usually a fairly reliable source.  Still, if it had been just this fellow, it might be chalked up to the wine, or the mad imaginings of fire wraiths and necromancers overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was not just one wild eyed report.  His whisperers had all been whispering similar tales of nebulous fright.  Nothing that could be named, nothing that could be taken in hand, nothing, but the whispers had all risen in chorusing unanimity, cacophonous as it was alarming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do.  He was of three minds.  What should he do for his own personal safety and continuance?  What might he do in service of the Realm, as it had always been in this way that his own best interest had been served, at least to this point?  How might he discover the source of this threat and so avoid what must be disasterous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all came down to information.  He'd had an ear full of the stuff, too much, but none of it clear.  There was no way to know what would help him survive if he didn't know what was coming.  Exasperated, he settled on a course with his usual decisiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must not appear to be as ignorant as I am.  In service of the Keeper of the Realm such was invitation to punishment from above or undermining and replacement by his peers.  Neither would serve.  He drew from his desk his favorite tools of the trade, slipping them into hidden pockets and strapping them to his person.  Weapons for stealthy killing, impliments for the foiling of locks, and small magics to aid in remaining free to do as he pleased.  These were his stock and trade when he'd been like the fellow who snoozed in the chair, just an informant.  <i>I must see what is wrong with my own eyes,</i> he thought.  <i>All these hints are confused by fear.  I must see for myself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was not just that simple sneak-thief of secrets, he had expanded his skills in the areas of the mind.  What he most needed, beyond seeing the state of the realm for himself, was the opinion of a man he trusted who's skills were as great as his own if in other areas.  Enalphose, his old comrade and true friend.  If anyone would have the sense of this dark storm that was rising, he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged into his old grey cloak, nearly black, like true shadow, and comfortable.  He stepped through the door to his receiving room and spoke to his assistant, Miss Jones.  \"Jones?  Do give Enalphose word that I will seek him at the usual place in three days time.  There is foul doings afoot.  I would have his thoughts on what comes our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecure in Jones' competence he slips out into the Realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count: 492 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkb.png\" alt=\"*Checkb*\" title=\"Checkb\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Know who it is thou speak against?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAye.  \u2018Tis the man who as babe I changed his diapers.\u201d  Od now recognised the face of the woman who had been his wet-nurse; the woman he had been raised to respect as much as his own kith and kin.<br>\r\n\u201cThe boy tells that you knowest about the End of Days.  That is was summoned in your younger time.\u201d<br>\r\nThe White One turned to her grandson and cuffed him harshly about the ear.  \u201cThe boy\u2019s tongue wags more than is good for it! Now runneth along home Kaden, and tarry not in the markets.\u201d<br>\r\nKaden excused himself from the presence of the two adults, and did as he was bade.<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak, please,\u201d Od said.<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.  I shall speaketh of the terror of my childhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt began in the foretime, in the days of the previous Keeper of the Realm.  He was a strong true man in his youth, but by the time these events took place he had become quick to judge and was rash in his decisions.  It was that rashness that not only caused the summoning of the End of Days, but also paved the way for our current powerful and benevolent Keeper, the Great GotWitch, to assume guardianship of the realm.  May Her Extreme Greatness preserve the Realm for all time.<br>\r\nThere was a plague of firepixies destroying the realm, and there was but one person who knew of the magics to defeat them.  The granna of the Keeper was the most magical of the White Ones and was the last of our line to know that magic, but she had been departed for near twelve seasons.<br>\r\nGilgamesh, the Supreme Necromancer of the time, offered to summon the deceased so that her magic could save the realm.  The Keeper agreed without hesitation, as to deny the necromancer\u2019s offer would have meant death for the realm.  His granna was summoned, and within two sunrises the firepixies were banished back to their realm.  However, instead of returning the summoned back from whence she had come, Gilgamesh used her in the darkest and foulest of rituals just to glimpse the future.<br>\r\nThe Keeper found out, and Gilgamesh was banished to the wastelands, but not before he swore vengeance would be his.  It took him near three seasons, but he finally collected all of the Five Substances.<br>\r\nAs commanded in the ritual, he had then endured the Austerities for three years.   He had gone without clothing since finding the last substance (leaving him blistered and burnt from the harsh suns that beat down), he had denied himself water on five separate occasions for fifteen sunrises (leaving him blind and near madness), and he had fasted once each year for fifty sunrises (leaving him horribly emaciated).  None who clapped eyes upon him, would recognise the once great Gilgamesh.<br>\r\nWith his dying breath and dying magic, he did the unpardonable.  He summoned the Elemental Demons and the End of Days.<br>\r\nThe demon of earth was the first to come.  He laid waste unto the lands and the harvests.  The grounds shook with such ferocity that the gods would have felt it and people feared the sky wouldst surely fall.<br>\r\nThe demon of water came on a great tsunami.  He flooded the lands and drowned hundreds of citizens of our fair realm.<br>\r\nThe demon of air summoned sandstorms and great whirling dervishes.  Houses were uprooted and deposited hundreds of leagues away.  The rich and the poor alike were left homeless.  Even the great castle of the Keeper was destroyed.<br>\r\nThe demon of fire scorched the land in preparation for The Coming.  Great seas of magma were called from the bowels of the realm.  It brought yet more suffering, as it ushered in The End of Days.<br>\r\nThe sun was blotted out by the chariots of the Unseelie Court who rode day and night bringing misery to all they came into contact with.  The rivers ran with the screams of the tormented.  After fifty days and fifty nights of this suffering, the Final Sacrifice came.  The Keeper of Realm was hoisted high into the sky by the Unseelie.  His soul was ripped from his body and cast into the Fire of Eternal Damnation, and what remained of his physical being was torn asunder.<br>\r\nThe mortals in our realm trembled and prayed to the Ancient Ones for deliverance, but they did not answer.  Instead the roars of the Unspeakable One were heard.  He rose up from his netherworld, opened wide his great maw and prepared to swallow the universe whole.<br>\r\nThe magic folks of the realm were now left with no choice.  They had to force this malign djinn back into the bottle from whence it had been summoned.  It took the combined magical powers of all forty races to undo what one insane necromancer had done.<br>\r\nThe magical world was left decimated by what we had done, but Gilgamesh\u2019s final act of hatred had to be stopped.<br>\r\nThe piskies, the mariae, and the lunatisidhe used up all of their magic.  Six of the faerie races gave up their entire existence.  The Grey Forest Elves lost their immortality.  We White Ones were the lucky ones.  We were the most magical of all of the races, but even we are now a mere fraction of what we once were.<br>\r\nThe Underworld Napthas and the Conflagron Masters sided with us at the time, but it cost their magics dear.  They have these last ten decades devoted themselves to regaining what was once theirs, what so ever the cost may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Od.  There be the tale of my youth.  Make what of it you will.\u201d  The White one then left him to his own devices.<br>\r\nOd could scarcely believe what he had been told.  He hoped that was still magics in the realm that could stand up to what had been summoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1023 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

His feet made squishing noises as he walked behind his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>squish, squash, squish, squash, kersplat!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pageboy tripped and landed face first in the muddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOd turned around and laughed at the spectacle. \"Can't even keep yourself clean now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pageboy picked himself up and wiped mud away form his eyes with the back of his hand. \"Gaaawwwsh, and I just took a bath yesterday.\" He started walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>squish, squash, squish, squash,</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pageboy yawned. He looked forward to a nice warm bed and a good night's rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>squish, squash, squish, squash, thud!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA booted foot stomped into the mud followed by another then two more sets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOd stopped in his tracks. Three hooded men stood in front of them blocking the way down the street. The glittering of swords could be seen beneath their black cloaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you there!\" Od shouted at them. \"Step aside! Me an' the boy are just going home now. We want no trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft but cruel chuckling broke out under the hoods. One of the men, obviously the leader, stepped right up to Od's face and with one swift motion slid his sword from his sheath and laid the blade against Od's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look fella,\" Od's voice was firm, \"I don't have any money on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men chuckled again. The leader spoke:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Money? No, we do not want your money\" His voice was raspy like a winter's breeze cutting through ice. \"We want to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't talk to anyone who's face I cannot see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to see my face? Very well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man flipped back his hood. Od gasped at what he saw: nothing! The man had no head at all. Od squirmed. Even with their absence he could feel the man's eyes watching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could give you a long explanation, but the simple side of it is, I am nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it or leave it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have orders. You come with us now, or you don't go anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! I am going home, and home is where I am going.\" Od tried to wrest himself free off the man's grasp, but the invisible hand was strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No funny business, now. You'll regret it I have no doubt. Our master doesn't like tricksters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">````</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the time Od was distracting the ghost man, the pageboy had been hiding in the shadows slowly making his way back to the council room door. He could slip out the front door instead. So far he didn't think the men had seen him, but it was hard to tell when you were being watched by invisible eyes. He held his breath and walked as slowly and softly as he could dodging through shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he heard a shout of Od, and he broke out in a run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count: 796 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cobwebbed darkness of the tunnel slowly cleared as a ray of light fell on him. It came from the small window a few feet away.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The spy, William, left his lord's tower the next morning. He'd made up his mind to forget about the End of days, certainly Hawthorne was right. There were no demons. He would know, the story had been drilled into him - into them all - during his childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Black smoke.\" His caregiver had told him in an ominous tone. He had been nothing but a child of five when he'd heard the stories but he remembered them as though it were yesterday. \"Black smoke with talons sharp enough to slice air itself. They had eyes but they had fire and they spewed brimstone from their mouths. They wielded magic, magic of the earth and magic of blood. To feed their magic, they lusted on the soul. The souls of men and that of their own, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reigned supreme over all the beings on the planet, even the dragons. Everyone feared the dark ones - the shadow walkers, they called them. Then arose the Great War. The benign beings of this realm objected to their vile, dark ways and rose up against the demons - only one thing could purge the earth of their bloodlusting existence and it was a sacrifice. A hundred warlocks sacrificed themselves - they did not die rather they were promised to the service of the realm. They called them the mal'akh and they wielded the only weapons that could destroy the demons. In one colossal battle the reign of the demons ended and the earth was purged of every one of them. The peace would last for a long time, it was promised, yet none knew how long it would last.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow promising, William thought as he headed into a forest grove. He wanted to get away from the city tonight. Tomorrow he would ride down to the neighbouring village and listen to more rumours. William sighed as he lead his horse to a stream. What had his life come to? He was reduced to being the ears of a noble man. Since when had he started being a hired rumour monger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered, of course. It had started the day his father died, he thought bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. William thought, strongly. I refuse to go down that road again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his horse had drunk enough f the water, William threw down his saddle and decided to stay near the stream for a while. He loved getting lost in the woods and hearing the whisperings of leaves for a change. They were good company - they certainly didn't talk of sinister things like the end of the world, for starters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water rippled by softly and William took off his riding boots. He perched himself on a rock and let his toes touch the water beneath him. It felt cool and relieved his worries instantly. He sat there for a long time until the sun was overhead. It calmed him down, listening to the forest sounds - this wood had ferns, soft grasses and evergreen trees the towered over him and extended well into the sky. Occasionally, a bird would chirp in the constant hum of the grasshoppers. He sat there until the smell of fresh earth and wild grass filled his lungs and cleared his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlwoly reality set back in and he decided that he would have to head back soon, else ride in the forest at night - as comforting as the forest was during the day, the second option terrified him and rightly. The Wildswood still had it's wildness, only the beasts came to play after dusk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just about to get up when he heard it. A telltale rustle of leaves, the kind that signalled the approach of a person. But it was so soft he wondered if it was a child or perhaps one of the birds flying down. William didn't stand up though, he merely looked around, his eyes sharp, his ears shaper still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere - behind the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam slowly got to his feet, careful not to make any noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't bother with his boots, treading lightly to the tree, his dagger in his hand. Once he was close, he moved fast, quickly moving to the other side of the tree to see -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most beautiful creature he'd ever laid eyes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nymph held his gaze, her hazel eyes searching his face curiously. There considered good luck, the wood nymphs or dryads. It was very rare to see them in their work, while they weaved their forest magic. She didn't bother running away or vanishing, as they usually did. Instead she held his gaze for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam couldn't shake it off. The nymph was so beautiful. Her slender form was swathed in dark silks, her hair as red as a flame, her doe eyes deep and curious. Her tanned skin adorned gold flecks - sigils of sorts. She looked like a dream, so much so that William reached out to her without even realising it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count - 834 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

There, in the east, the banner of the House Stark fluttered in the wind. A sudden fear gripped me.<br>\r\n\"Surely not them,\" I mumbled. \"They are my most loyal subjects. They are industrious, hard working, and most important, they fear me.\" <br>\r\nI turned my face to the south and frowned. There, across the verdant field lay the remains of the House of Martell followers. <br>\r\n\"Lazy, good for nothing buggers,\" I said. I knew the Martell house members to be the worst of my subjects. They dealt in money games, they drank heavily, they participated in games of chance, and worst of all I knew their intentions, their secret, diabolical intentions. <br>\r\nShaking my fist at their flags that lay flaccid, I shouted, \"Never!  You will never wrest the throne from my benevolent grasp.\" My words were gobbled up by the soft breeze blowing over my shoulders. <br>\r\nI needed a plan. Something simple I told myself. Something no one would suspect. I had to call on my most trusted ally. I walked to the guard standing watch at the head of the stairs. <br>\r\n\"You, guard,\" I said. \"Do you know the maestro?<br>\r\n The guard lifted the metal grill protecting the lower portion of his face. \"Yes, of course, my queen. Everyone knows him.\" As he spoke I couldn't help noticing that his beady eyes traveled over my beautiful body. I felt myself warm inside. Stop it! I told myself. <br>\r\n\"Go and fetch him,\" I commanded. \"Bring him to me.\" <br>\r\nI could hear the guard's suit of armor creak as he walked down the stairs, and I vowed to purchase a case of 3-in-1 oil and maybe some WD-40. Maintenance of the guard's protective equipment would be useful when I hatched my plan. I returned to the rampart to wait for the maestro. <br>\r\nAs I gazed upon my realm I could hear the sound of metal scraping against metal, and soon the guard stepped from the darkness. He stooped and placed his hands on his knees and he tried to catch his breath. He spoke a moment later, his breathing still a bit labored.<br>\r\n\"I'm getting too old for this s--\"<br>\r\n\"Enough of that kind of talk,\" I said. How many times had I instructed my commander of the guard to make sure these men stayed in shape?  I would see to that later. <br>\r\n\"Well,\" I said. \"Did you find the maestro?\"  Again his eyes traveled over me, and the metal grill covering his face did little to hide the gleam of his blue eyes. Attractive eyes, I told myself. In fact, the way he filled out his chain mail shirt made my skin warm again. But the sound of footsteps on the stone steps pulled me from the beginnings of a rather heated fantasy. <br>\r\n\"You called, your highness?\" The maestro stood before me. He was not tall, but his broad shoulders spoke of strength. His waist was trim, his thighs powerful, his chest bulged with finely honed muscle. He kept his baton inside the waist band of his tights, its length revealed against his thigh, I sighed at the sight of the the instrument he used to make beautiful music. I had to force my eyes away from him. I turned and spoke to him without looking at him. <br>\r\n\"I have come up with a plan that involves music,\" I said calmly. \"And that means you are an integral piece of that plan.\" <br>\r\n\"I am here to serve you, my queen.\" His words were like a song, soft, sensual, song-like. <br>\r\nI turned to him, and said, \"Have you ever heard of this new kind of music?\" My eyes rose to the sky as if I would find the right words there. \"It's called Rap. Sometimes it's referred to as Hip Hop.\" <br>\r\nThe maestro hesitated, his eyes closed as if he was in deep thought. His hand went to his chin as if in great contemplation. \"Yes, my queen, I believe I have heard a trio of musicians in the court yard playing it. There is a strong rhyme factor to it. But the words can sometimes be quite offensive.\" <br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" I said and turned to him. \"I want you to seek out these musicians.\" I turned my gaze back out to where the House of Martell members staggered in a drunken stupor. I clucked my tongue and shook my head. \"What am I going to do with that lot,\" I asked no one in particular, my words drifting on the breeze. <br>\r\n\"With whom, my queen?\" <br>\r\n\"Nothing, nothing at all, maestro.\" I turned to him and said. \"Bring these rap people to me. Tell them there is something important they can do for their queen.\" <br>\r\n\"Can I give them some small piece of information about what you will require of them?\" the maestro asked. <br>\r\nI slowly let my gaze drift back to the south and frowned. \"No, maestro. Just tell them I command their presence. Tell them that their music will assist me in keeping my throne.\" <br>\r\n\"As you wish,\" maestro said as he bowed and slowly stepped back. <br>\r\nI was alone except for the guard whose eyes seemed to follow my every move. I had the remainder of the day with nothing to do. I needed a distraction to fill my time. I turned and admired the guard's physique. Stepping in front of the guard, I spoke slowly.<br>\r\n\"What time do you get off word, my protector?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n935 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check5.png\" alt=\"*Check5*\" title=\"Check5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

It was locked away, sealed in a dark place in a dark hole. How did it get out? That was the worst part. I was one of only two people who knew where this unspeakable horror was buried and I know that I did not speak. That did not bode well for the other person. I considered him as I sat at my desk in the darkness, tankard in my hand. I couldn't remember the last time I had actually taken a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelin seemed like a trustworthy man, a fool yes, but trustworthy. Would he really have betrayed me--the realm, in such a manner? It was hard to believe. I had known the man since being a child and the unlikely nature of him uncovering such an evil was plaguing me. Yet I had to know. And I had to act. Four days of mourning, of grief over what would come, and nothing had happened. Nothing would happen as long as I could stop it. It just depended on whether there was time now.

I am thousands of years old, but this evil is older still.  I need the books written by the Elder Keeper.  But he has since passed-- or so it would seem.  All of the Keepers sacrificed themselves to save the kingdom.  All but me.<br>\r\nHelin once asked me about my origins:  if I had a mother, father, brother, sister, or any other family.  I told him I didn\u2019t know.<br>\r\nHere is what I know of my family:  they were Keepers, and they committed high treason for me.  All I know of my kind, of my history, I\u2019ve read in the books.  Obviously, the books stop at a certain point, given that the Elder Keeper died before he could complete his work.  But what I can tell, the Keepers planned to bind the evil to a jar of carved glass.  When I reached the age of two hundred, I decided to go looking for the glass jar.  By analyzing the Elder Keeper\u2019s plan and following the humans\u2019 tales of the Keeper War, I managed to locate the jar mired in a swamp oozing with magic.  Engraved on it was a powerful spell, written in the language of the Keepers, which I had immediately understood though I had had no prior reading.  The spell called for the life essence of all Keepers to be absorbed, in order that they and the evil may be forever confined in the jar.<br>\r\nFinally understanding the weight of the jar I held in my hand, I placed it back in the swamp, and borrowed some of the magic-- which I can only guess is residue from the life force of so many Keepers-- to sink the jar deep into the earth where only those who knew how to capture the magic in the swamp and use it.<br>\r\nAnd since my discovery of the jar, I had only taught one person to harness the magic in the swamp (which, by the way, had been only a field before the Great Battle)-- Helin Masander.<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know who of the Keepers were my parents-- but I know that if they defied the order of the Elder Keeper that they committed high treason.  My stepfather Nan told me that I was left on his doorstep at the tender age of three (Keepers age normally until the age of fifty or so) and that I was calling for my mother.  I had only the clothes on my back, and a strange carved glass medallion around my neck.  I believe that is what kept me from being absorbed with the rest of the Keepers, as it closely resembles the jar itself.  I have not taken it off since I found the jar, for fear of being pulled into the jar myself.<br>\r\nI finally reached my secret library and entered.  I was surprised at the sight that greeted my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 504 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maribelle would be my first choice as Lulla can be too insecure, too needy. Who wants his woman at his heels all the time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle, on the other hand, acts as an independent agent, responsible for her own emotional needs. But being responsible doesn\u2019t mean detachment. And Maribelle isn\u2019t detached per se, and she can be quite accommodating, when it suits her purpose, which shows a bit of self-interest, to me. If I go and conquer her somehow, I will always be thinking why\u2019s she doing what she\u2019s doing? Or whatever it is she\u2019s doing, she ain\u2019t doing it for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lulla can be such a pain in the rump, too, always sweet mooing or hanging her nose on my tail when I am enjoying my hay while eyeing Maribelle. I think it will have to be Lulla, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, it is the lazy way out, but I can be excused for that because of my ancestry. Us bulls don\u2019t like to be distracted with trivial thoughts. Annoyance we can deal with better. Just showing the horns in a menacing sort of way always does the trick. I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do to Lulla when she makes me see red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle notices me eyeing her and slowly makes her way to the haystack whose mixed flavors I was enjoying. Lulla, seeing Maribelle, mooes as if she has something stuck in her belly besides the teats. I size up Maribelle and eye her warily. I am the legendary badass bull who can snort a heavy breath, daring anyone. Besides I have the no-you-can\u2019t-touch-me attitude fortified by my glaring dark eyes. But I don\u2019t use that stuff with my ladies. Well, only rarely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulla mooes again. Maribelle throws a hoof her way, challenging her, my old feisty darling that she is.  Lulla moves close to me almost touching me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this is just too much. Lulla is no gorgeous, unattainable female, and she doesn\u2019t own me. Not when Maribelle is softly mooing at me now, with teasing eyes that sends me over the moon. And the cow, excuse me the bull, jumped over the moon, right?  But then, only a cow like Maribelle does that to me as I do believe in magic and luck and everything spiritual, and I could drown in Maribelle\u2019s sexy eyes, even if it means taunting the devil himself. My blood now is pounding unlike anything I could ever recall, and I know my earlier decision about staying with Lulla has been erased with this new overpowering wish of chasing my hot angel, Maribelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I give her a friendly snort and whip Lulla with my tail. Lulla sticks up her neck and howls like a perplexed wolf. Maribelle inches close to me her dark eyes never leaving me. Oh, to be watched like that by a female!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis means Maribelle hasn\u2019t forgotten me, and she\u2019s back at my side like a homing pigeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind if I bunk with you, Tiger?\u201d she mooes in a soft voice.  Shall I take the bait? Of course, I will. I sigh with happiness and pick up a clump of hay and leave it in front of her. She slurps it down, her gaze hitting me at chest level. Then she surreptitiously winks. A change ripples through my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But another change is coming over Maribelle, too. Is this love?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this can\u2019t be love, because now she looks scary.  Her mere hoofs have turned into cloven hoofs. In her mouth, fangs appear. No, a cow cannot have fangs. I turn around for Lulla, but Lulla has far disappeared. Terror washes over me, while Maribelle\u2019s hide starts forming scales, scales of a lizard. Her chest heaves and splits open, to be immediately covered with more scales, ugly muddy, greenish scales\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I feel weak, wondering how it was possible for this change to take place. I hadn\u2019t displeased her at all. I blow out a long breath and snort heavily, more with fear than anything else. No guy or bull should fear his woman, should he! But I do and she is no cow anymore. Her evil is focusing on me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must be the evil I heard the two-leggeds talking about. The evil that was spreading like wildfire.  Maribelle comes charging at me, the scales on her lizard skin flapping about in the wind, and I have no power to lift a leg, let alone protect myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes are no longer black, but more like the dulled moon while it sets and sickly. She is chaos itself, threatening the very fabric of the world. I have no defense. Lulla has no defense. No one has any defense against the edict of evil. Not anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n787 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mariibelle suddenly pulls her head up and sounds the alarm. The herd gathers around her as she mounts the outdoor podium to speak. All members face the podium with their hind ends forming an outer circle so tight there is no space to squeeze in. I trot round and round pushing here and there. Finally a very old cow gives way out of weakness.Taking advantage of the space I push forward until I am close enough to hear. Maribelle is reading a list of suspected spies. \"Four members of the herd have been weeded out for further interrogation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho, I wonder. Who in these times with war on everybody's lips, and with winter coming on would even think of spying for our enemy? Maribelle reminds us of the importance of loyalty and duty. We all pledge allegiance to our kingdom and sing songs of praise.  I am furious with anyone who has betrayed our kingdom. Maribelle continues firing up the hers with her rhetoric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am surprised. Maribelle is a philosopher of sorts, not a professional but of philosophical bent; a lover of wisdom and the meaning of life beyond appearances.  She has always preached against rushing to judgement. This must be very serious for her to be persuaded to take the podium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? Tell us who,\" we all chant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hush comes over the crowd as we strain our ears to hear.\" One-Pom, two-Fen, Three-Chester the Jester, and four-Lillian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian, that's me, there's been a mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wait for Maribelle to correct her mistake. Instead she reads the charges: \"Pom, Fen and Cheater are charged with eavesdropping on the Lords to relay information to the enemy. Lillian is charged with fraternizing with the enemy and inviting them to visit the herd incognito. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Herbert, she's talking about my childish fling with Herbert from the Kingdom to the North. Oh, he was a handsome steer, so strong and virile. He was my first love. But wait, I never told anyone. Did I? Let me think. I might have told Maribelle whom I trusted more than anyone in the world.<br>\r\nBacking up I slink away to a near-by shed to be alone. Peering through an open window in my refuge I see Lulla standing beside  my long time mentor. Lulla, a new member that I considered a friend. I should have known better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulla is a fine looking animal. She has a delicate head with large wide set cow eyes, her head  is topped by slender horns that shimmer in sunlight and moonlight alike. The curves of her body swayed ever so slightly as she sashayed about the pastures to graze.  In short, Lulla had the kind of allure that made the rest of us, cows and steers alike, want to be seen  hanging out with her. I suppose we wanted to bask in her radiating auroa, hoping it would rub off on us by virtue of association. I could understand it because I had almost been sucked in myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I could not understand  was why my trusted mentor, Maribelle, would choose to have Lulla on the podium, standing beside her at a serious time like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</i>Then it hits me. <i>She must have told Lulla about my love for Herbert and Lulla must convinced her the affair was a a cover for a covert operation; Lulla must have said I worked in collaboration with Herbert, who was a spy from the Kingdom of the North. <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"What am I to do? How can I build my defense? A sound, I hear a sound outside the shed. Frozen in place I wait for them the guards to capture me and lead me to the slaughter. I hear another noise outside the shed. Then Chester pokes his fat head around the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lillian, what is to become of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alone, Chester?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Pom and Fen are here too. We are not eavesdroppers, We have been falsely accused. Lillian.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, no more than I am in collaboration with a spy from the North. It is the fault of that new member, Lulla. She is poisoning their minds against us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  Pom and Fen enter and we all peer out the window. The herd is stomping around, being directed to search the four corners of the kingdom for us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will all be slaughtered,\" Fen weeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not.\" I decide to reveal the secret passage Herbert and I once used to traverse back and forth for our meetings. \"We will sleep here tonight. Since they foolishly assume we are on the run because they foolishly assume we are guilty, we should be perfectly safe here until morning. Quick, help me shovel this hay into a corner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever for?\" they all complain at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask me no question, I'll tell you no lies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pick up a pitch fork and begin slinging hay. The others soon follow suit. \"There it is. See that lever, pull it sidewise.\" They do as told. The trap door opens and I ask Chester to lead the others down the slope to the damp floor of the tunnel leading to the Kingdom in the North. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwords-863 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check5.png\" alt=\"*Check5*\" title=\"Check5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If the gods are smiling on us, we will be safe by then. Excuse me, Pom, Fen and Chester are waiting for me. <i>I must take the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</i> \"Follow me,\" I shout knowing full well we are headed into the unknown. Is Herbert still alive? If so, does his family still hold a position of influence? Will he remember me with kindness, if at all? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am betting on a yes, to every question. We have no other options. Let the others worry about the future. My mind is slipping into the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll never forget the first day I saw Herbert. I was standing in the gallery for spectators. Herbert's father  sat on the board of directors overseeing water rights for their kingdom and his son stood behind him.  My father was there because the River Lyle was on the agenda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe River Lyle formed a border between  the kingdoms of the North and our kingdom, Lyola. It was in our interest to keep abreast of any proprietary rights that any kingdom might attempt to lay on the river, our main source of drinking water.  It had never been a problem before;  the spring thaw always refilled the water to the banks of the river. But now, with rumors abounding of a coming drought, all kingdoms bordering the River Lyle   wanted to secure their rights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all of this happened before the mind of evil crept into the land. In those days a Council to discuss water rights with other kingdoms had been a time of coming together and a time of celebration - everyone valued cooperation. They even met at a round table. There was no talk of evil or spies or eavesdropping in those days. After the first meeting, which was  largely a report of a lack of snow in the mountains, the round table was cleared and food for a feast brought in. Throughtmorton, the king of the North, invited my father to sit next to him and made room for their children to sit at a small square table behind them. I sat at the table demurely saying nothing while Herbert and my brother, Hank, talked about the coming polo match and the disastrous idea of inviting horses to enter the match this year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n401 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check5.png\" alt=\"*Check5*\" title=\"Check5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Because Hank Albert showed so much enthusiasm for Polo during lunch, Herbert invited him to watch the game that afternoon. Casually he added, \"You can bring your kid sister if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, she wouldn't want  to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I would. I love polo,\" I lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brother threw me a deep scowl, and kicked me under the table. Later, at the game, he helped me understand what was going on. \"It's like people polo except that instead of people riding horses driving the wooden ball, we drive the ball with our hooves. Four players on each team, and you can tell who's who by the color of the jersey around their neck. Herbert is on the green team. See, here he comes now. He's trying to keep the ball to his right and drive it into the opposite team's goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cheer for Herbert in a most unlady like way. When the game ends he says that my cheering helped his team to win. Hank later told me I blushed beet red when he said that. Herbert showers and changes clothes. He asks Albert and me if we'd like to meander to the south pasture and stroll across the bridge over the River Lyle. Albert discreetly disappears leaving me on a bridge with a guy for the  first time in my life. It is not a very romantic moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The water is very low for this time of year,\" Herbert says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" I say. Following a few more stabs at awkward conversation Herbert walks me back to the guest barn where our family is staying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening kids,\" my father greets us. I am surprised to see him waiting outside. Herbert bows and leaves. \"He's a handsome lad, and polite enough,\"dad says, \"but don't get involved. He has a reputation with the lady cows and you are too inexperienced for the likes of him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough I pretend to agree, my ladylike heart is pounding way too fast to stay away from Herbert very long. I remember the smugglers underground tunnel, the one built in the old days. My father once showed me the entrance to the tunnel from a shed. He said they dug all the way to the Northern Kingdom. I wondered if dad remembered that. I wondered if Herbert knew anything about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day the men held their second meeting about water rights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday's meeting had a different tone than yesterday's. For one thing, King Rupert from Flinchland arrived-late of course. Albert told me cranky King Rupert always arrived late. He was not well received by the others For one thing he failed to maintain the cisterns in the land to preserve rainfall. For another thing, most of the windmills in Flinchland were in a wretched state of disrepair. The entire herd thirsts every dry season. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of these days,\" father warns us. \"One of these days the Finchlanders will rebel. And what will happen then, I ask you?\" He immediately answered his own questions. \"The starving Flinch will descend on the rest of us like Locusts. Our own people will rise up amid cries of, 'war,'<br>\r\nwill fill the air. You mark my words.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right. I didn't realize it until early this year when strange bony looking cattle were seen on the fringes of the kingdom. About the same time pastures were being nibbled away during nights and hay stored in barns disappeared. This caused much discussion. The Council of Lords advocated for setting traps to catch the thieves and throwing them in jail-after they built one, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Maribelle and her ladies suggested setting up certain areas for grazing and storage for them to use. \"Poor things are starving to death,\" she said. We should put them back on their hooves, give them a good start and then send them back to their own land  with a goodly supply of seeds and materials to repair their cisterns and their windmills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir were many meetings and many resolutions that soon fell apart.because the two sides simply could not agree. Maribelle confided in me and valued by opinions on the matter in the fall of the year, when the Flinchlanders first started coming. <br>\r\nAs winter approached and the wolves began to howl, she seemed removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first time I saw her walking with Lulla I assumed Lulla had become one of Maribelle's students of philosophy. I looked forward to Lulla and I <br>\r\nstudying together and becoming friends. Little did I suspect that it was the other way around, that Maribelle was being influenced by that siren <br>\r\nfrom Hades. First Lulla worked her magic among the men, supporting them in their  desire to capture the foreigners and jail them then very quickly advocating for attacking them in their own land. \"Lyola is in grave danger of attack from them if you don't attack first, \" she said. \"I have <br>\r\ncousins who have visited their land. They have seen huge warehouses full of weapons. That is where their time and their energy goes, preparing to attack your country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the men were convinced, Lulla began to work on the women. \"In your innocence you don't recognize the spies in your midst.\" She started with Pom, Fen, and Chester the Jester, accusing them of eavesdropping  on the highly placed and passing word to Flinchlanders  on the fringes of our country.  I could see it now. Just as clear as day. Lulla had sidled up to Maribelle, spreading the magic of her beautiful aura, insidiously planting the idea that I was a spy. Maribelle hadn't told her a thing. Lulla's cousins, who visited Flinchland, learned about Herbert and I being in love, and together they concocted this  lie that I was a traitor to the country of Loyola.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwords: 963 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check5.png\" alt=\"*Check5*\" title=\"Check5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I couldn't help remembering by-gone days when  Herbert and I would meet in the center of the tunnel, and snuggle together while we made our way one direction or the other.

I waded in and before long some hot sticky stuff at the bottom was pulling me down. As I sank to my belly, those three crones over there became visible . They cackled loudly while they stirred the brew in their pots. I was in a pure state of panic for what seemed like hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they stopped stirring and pulled me out, I had two long legs instead of four, I looked like a freak, Besides It was very impractical so they sent me back in for a re-do. This time when I popped up my body was fully human. So, why do you think I brought you here, Lillian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you think I'm one dumb cow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsolutely not.

I know you don't recognize me. Why would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sure right on that one. I was more concerned about my friends Pom, Fen and Chester the Jester, than I was about this human pretending to be my lost love. I kept my head down, What could I say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this will help. Do you remember the polo game  where you and your brother watched me hitting the ball with my  hooves? You were cheering me on like nobody ever had before and we won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course I remembered. I sneaked a look at him. I suppose he  was handsome, in a human sort of way: broad shoulders, two legs, no horns, no tail, hands with five fingers instead of hooves. But to think that this creature was my Herbert-impossible. He was insane to suggest it. I remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued. \"Do you remember how the tone of the meetings on water rights between the kingdoms changed when King Rupert from Flinchland                 arrived? He put no money into infrastructure to help his countrymen through the drought. The other members of the council predicted rebellion from the Flinchlanders. Don't you remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaguely,\" I mumbled. \"Is that the reason everyone is talking about war?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one of them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who told you?\" I asked. \"I don't remember any humans at the meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't a human then, I was a young steer madly in love with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you stop using our secret tunnel to come visit me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were getting so involved with the  teachings of your teacher, Maribelle, that I thought you wanted to become a nun. I didn't fit into the picture any more. My presence was only a distraction to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, I was headed in that direction before, Lu-Lu-\" I couldn't say the name. \"Before a newcomer arrived and started telling lies to Maribelle. She told her that Pom and Fen, and Chester were eavesdroppers and that I was a traitor because of my association with you, I mean with Herbert.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My poor darling,\" He started to pace. \"I had no idea. Is that the reason the four of you came all this way?  Because you had all been accused by Lulla?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know her name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she came here once. She tried to work her charms on my father, but he was too wise. When he refused her, she had him accused of being a traitor too.  Our whole family was condemned to the slaughter house. We were being trailered in when another cow in the trailer told us about the transformation process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy ears perked up and I raised my head. \"What transformation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't explain it. All I can say is that when we agreed the whole family became human. You should have seen the look on the faces of the <br>\r\nworkers when they opened the tailgate to let us out and there were no cattle. They shooed us away and sent out a search party to find the treacherous cattle.\" He laughed. \"Of course they never did.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If what you say is true, then why did you send my friends, Pom, and Fen, and Chester to the Slaughter house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you misunderstood.  They are going to an outer pen for rest and relaxation. I kept you here so I could explain. I still love you Lillian. Of course, it's a ludicrous term in our present physical states. One of us has to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd feel better if I could talk with my friends,\" I said. \"Frankly Herbert, what you're telling me sounds insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it does, it takes getting used to. I'll have you delivered and pick you up in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I had been dropped off in a lovely green pasture with it's own pond for bathing and  a water trough for drinking. There were several lean-tos where cattle could escape a broiling sun or excessive wind, rain  hail or snow.  After all, we were in the Northern Kingdom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince today was mild and clear without a cloud in the sky, none of them were necessary. Pom. Fen and Chester were were already mingling in the open with other cattle. I hoped they hadn't told them where we came from or how we traveled to the Northern Kingdom.  I knew Chester would remain mum. Pom and Fen could be real chatterboxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing me they all galloped over. \"Lillian,\" Pom mooed, \"We were so worried about you. With that rope about your neck, we thought they were going to  hang you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so too,\" I sympathized. \"Actually the human who stayed behind is someone I had met before. He remembered me and wondered what I was doing here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at me strangely. I had to think fast. \"Do you remember when my father was on the inter-kingdom water rights council that met here  several years ago and Hank and I came with him?\" Chester remembered. \"Well I met him then, we all did, I mean my whole family-did.\" I was rambling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester became suspicious. \"Do you mean that's the one who gave you the combination to the tunnel lock at this end, the one you call Herbert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean, yes. Oh Chester, I've got to talk to you alone. Do you think Pom and Fen would mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's ask. Would you women like to go back and graze with your new friends?\"  They left in a flash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester and I found a shady spot under a tree to talk. \"What's going on?\" he asked. I can tell that something is bothering you. Are you afraid your friend, the human, will betray us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he won't do that. Oh Chester, how can I tell you?  I know what you'll think because I thought the same thing. You'll think I'm insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me,\" he said. \"Court jesters are very adaptable. I've seen and heard just about everything. What is it Lillian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The human says that he is the same Herbert we met at the council. But when I knew him he was a young steer. He says he and his whole family have been transformed into humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they do something so stupid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like us they had been accused of being traitors to their country. King Rupert of Flinchland had sent spies to see if the Northern Kingdom was harboring Flinchland rebels.  The very same Lulla who convinced Maribelle to accuse us, accused Herbert's father, Lord Flanders, of being a traitor.  <br>\r\nThey didn't want to be humans but it was a matter of going through the transformation process or going  to the slaughterhouse. Now Herbert wants me to go through transformation also.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester backed up in shock, as though he were about to be contaminated. \"You're not, surely you're not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told Herbert I wanted to talk to you first. I couldn't do something like that without telling you and Pom and Fen first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind Pom and Fen,\" he said. \"They mean no harm but they like to chatter. It will have to be our secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you approve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that. Lord almighty, what would your poor father say if he knew? I can't give you advice on this Lillian. I've never heard of such a thing. <br>\r\nI've never even dreamed about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask yourself this question, child. Who are you? Where do you come from?  Are you a member of your family and your herd and your species?<br>\r\nOr are you a free spirit that can flit from all these to another?  Could you truly leave everything that you've always been behind? I know I couldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not in love,\" I said simply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah, so that's it. I should have known. Well then, in that case, this is something you and Herbert must decide between you. I only ask this much of you, child.  If you decide to do it, don't tell me. I don't want to know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In their excitement  they told their new friends in the pasture. I could only hope they didn't reveal our secret underground passageway. \"Do they know how we arrived ?\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. Nothing has been said about that yet. You'll have to transform right away. What about your friends, will they be interested? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only told Chester,he is totally against it. The two lady cows don't know. I didn't dare tell them because they are such chatterboxes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's where the news leaked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought of that too. Let's talk to Chester and see what he thinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester listened in horror. \"If we remain in our present form we will surely be killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Herbert said. \"Do you want to be a martyr or a human?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are both forms of martyrdom, Sir,\" Chester said ungraciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the other two? Are they staying or coming with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they go with you then I'll have to come too. They are far too, shall I say \"limited in mental capacity,\" to adapt to a new identity on their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, go ask them. We'll wait ten minutes before leaving. I will not risk Lillian's safety by waiting any longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester galloped away. Nine minutes later he returned with Pom and Fen trailing behind, mooing at their loudest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be still, do you want to attract attention and get us all killed?\" Chester scolded <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert led us to a covered trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you're wondering how the transformation took place, you are going to be disappointed. Chester and I were sworn to absolute secrecy and <br>\r\nPom and Fen were given strong sedatives. We remained isolated in the barn for a month to get used to our new bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned out rather pretty, but not a breath taking beauty. Herbert was very satisfied with my latin look and created a back story to go with it. \"We will tell people  you were an orphaned princess discovered by me on the streets of the Southern Kingdom.  Immediately recognizing you as a person of royal blood and and great potential, I  arranged for you to return with me and live as one of our family proteges. During this time I fell in love with you; now we are engaged to be married. How's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's wonderful but what will the rest of your family say to such a lie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forget, we were once transformed ourselves. We know the danger of a wagging tongue.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the others?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pom and Fen can be ladies in waiting in another household. They remember nothing, but it is best not to have them living with us in case they ever do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about me?\" asked Chester while he  practised reading a book while sitting in a chair? \"Where shall I be farmed out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll say you were once Lillian's tutor in the Southern Kingdom and  when we discovered it, we sent for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously pleased, Chester enquired about his name. \"Chester the Jester is to recognizable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" Herbert agreed. \"You will all need new names. Lillian can be Lillith and you can be Socrates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like the name, Socrates?\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm honored,\" Chester said. \"What do you think of Pamela and Francis for the two ladies? I rather like the ring of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then so be it,\" Herbert and I agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good that's done,\" Herbert said. \"I will go to find a household for Pamela and Francis to work as ladies madis. You, Socrates,may set up to begin your tutoring of Lilith in the arts and sciences. And find her a riding instructor. She must learn how to ride horses, now that she is a lady of substance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything but polo,\" I laughed. \"It would ruin my shins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No polo,\" Herbert grinned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Coming to an arroyo, they suddenly disappeared. The calves hid behind trees to wait until the intruders emerged on Northern's side of the border.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, they're picking up wood to build a fire. I think they are going  to set up camp,\" Janel said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to chase them back.\"  the bull calf named Bold moved in their direction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Janel stopped him. We need to tell our Borderland Council leaders . They may want to talk to them first. \"You stay here. If they decide to move on you follow them at a distance; leave bent branches to mark your trail.\" Bold agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't talk to humans,\"  Thunder, the head council bull, said when the children approached them with their story. \"You did right to tell us,I need to tell Lord Herbert of the inland province. He understands cattle prattle.\" Thunder sent one of his own men to watch the foreigners with Bold.

Thunder, head bull of  the cattle council in the area, needs me to accompany him. It is important I go because no other Lord in the kingdom speaks both people talk and cattle prattle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" I said. \"Chester has been wanting to take me to an art museum in the city.  I didn't plan on it because I didn't want to leave you. You go do what you must on the borderlands while I will ask Chester to arrange transportation to the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter so many years of going everywhere on all fours, it seemed strange for both Chester and I to  have to arrange transportation  in advance. He didn't question why all of a sudden it was okay for me to go. He just took my word for it. He is such a dear, I don't know what I would do without him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert rode his black stallion, Storm, alongside Thunder the Bull without stopping, except for water, until they reached the forested section of the  border area. \"How will we know where to find them?\" Herbert asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know every inch of the borderlands,\" Thunder replied. \"First we will pick up Bold, and see what he has to say. He is a brave and bright boy. He and I will remain hidden in the shade while you ride Storm into their camp. If things take a bad turn, Bold and I will charge the camp. The children didn't know how many came across. They estimate about ten.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert dropped back so that Thunder could lead. Bold heard us coming and trotted out to meet us. Bold said the camp was still there but the men were seldom in it. \"They seem to be using it as a headquarters for coming and going and  changing clothes. There are eight of them with no obvious leader.. Each one seems to know their own assignment and to come and go independently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert liked Bold immediately. He reminded Herbert of himself when he was that age.  \"Did they bring weapons?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to tell. They buried something when they first arrived. It could be weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should take a look, I'll go back and get shovels,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two steers laughed at Herbert. \"You be the lookout. We'll paw the dirt out with our hooves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, I forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they found the spot with freshly turned earth, they started to dig. They had dug about two feet when Herbert signalled someone was coming. <br>\r\nHe ran out to help them fill in the hole as best they could before running to hide.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHiding behind a hillock they watched one lone figure stride into camp. Bold said he had not seen that one before. The human showed no interest in the freshly turned earth.  His interest lay in a pond of water fed by an underground spring. \"He's thirsty,\" Bold said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their amazement, the human began to undress. He hadn't gone far before Herbert realized HE wasn't a He.  It had breasts, and other curves in the wrong places. It took off its cap to let long straight hair fall down it's back. \"It's a woman,\" he said. \"I can't see her face from here. There was something familiar about her body. She turned to face their direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lulla,\" Herbert whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know her?\" asked the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father did. It's uncanny how she hasn't aged a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful,\" Bold said. \"You can talk to her before the others return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert remembered what Lillian had said about Lulla and Maribelle. \"She must be a shapeshifter, easily able to shift back and forth between <br>\r\nfemale  cow and human, either way, a fem fatale. \"There's no reason for me to talk to her,\" he said. \"If she's involved, the group is here to make trouble, probably spying on us and pointing the finger of espionage on those who cross her. Let's just watch. We can take turns, one at a time while the other two get some rest, or take care of business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it came to be. The Flinchlanders came back one by one, or sometimes in twos, to talk to Lulla. We were too far away to hear but close enough to see gestures and pick up on body language. No doubt about it, Lulla was calling the shots. The question was, who was directing Lulla?<br>\r\nSomebody else, somebody not here had given her instructions. Over and over all three of us heard, \"I'll have to check that out with----\" She always lowered her voice to an inaudible tone  for the last word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first we worried they would discover our digging. After a while so many people had trampled over the spot that noone would notice unless they <br>\r\nknew where to look. When it became apparent there was no more to learn from that distance, Herbert finally agreed to ride into camp and introduce himself. After all, there was no way in the world that anyone, even Lulla, could recognize the handsome human, Herbert as the same young bull calf who had once known her as the would-be seducer of his father.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not remember she once condemned their whole family to the slaughter house because his father rejected her. \"She thinks we are all dead,\" he smiled to himself.  How could she know the transformer himself had been riding in the trailer they used to haul us away?\" If it weren't so dangerous, he would have laughed  loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends arranged for Bold and Thunder to keep watch while Herbert rode Storm into the camp, armed with a sword sheathed by his side. <br>\r\n\"I hate leaving now,\" Herbert said to Lillith, \"Something important has come up on our border with Flinchland. Thunder, head bull of  the cattle council in the area, wants to show me something that worries him. He cannot go elsewhere because I'm the only Lord who speaks both people talk and cattle prattle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" I said. \"Chester has been wanting to take me to an art museum in the city.  I didn't plan on it because I didn't want to leave you. You go do what you must on the borderlands while I will ask Chester to arrange transportation to the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter so many years of going everywhere on all fours, it seemed strange for both Chester and I to  have to arrange transportation  in advance. He didn't question why all of a sudden it was okay for me to go. He just took my word for it. He is such a dear, I don't know what I would do without him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert rode his black stallion, Storm, alongside Thunder the Bull without stopping, except for water, until they reached the forested section of the  border area. \"How will we know where to find them?\" Herbert asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know every inch of the borderlands,\" Thunder replied. \"First we will pick up Bold, and see what he has to say. He is a brave and bright boy. He and I will remain hidden in the shade while you ride Storm into their camp. If things take a bad turn, Bold and I will charge the camp. The children didn't know how many came across. They estimate about ten.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert dropped back so that Thunder could lead. Bold heard us coming and trotted out to meet us. Bold said the camp was still there but the men were seldom in it. \"They seem to be using it as a headquarters for coming and going and  changing clothes. There are eight of them with no obvious leader.. Each one seems to know their own assignment and to come and go independently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert liked Bold immediately. He reminded Herbert of himself when he was that age.  \"Did they bring weapons?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to tell. They buried something when they first arrived. It could be weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should take a look, I'll go back and get shovels,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two steers laughed at Herbert. \"You be the lookout. We'll paw the dirt out with our hooves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, I forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they found the spot with freshly turned earth, they started to dig. They had dug about two feet when Herbert signalled someone was coming. <br>\r\nHe ran out to help them fill in the hole as best they could before running to hide.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHiding behind a hillock they watched one lone figure stride into camp. Bold said he had not seen that one before. The human showed no interest in the freshly turned earth.  His interest lay in a pond of water fed by an underground spring. \"He's thirsty,\" Bold said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their amazement, the human began to undress. He hadn't gone far before Herbert realized HE wasn't a He.  It had breasts, and other curves in the wrong places. It took off its cap to let long straight hair fall down it's back. \"It's a woman,\" he said. \"I can't see her face from here. There was something familiar about her body. She turned to face their direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lulla,\" Herbert whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know her?\" asked the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father did. It's uncanny how she hasn't aged a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful,\" Bold said. \"You can talk to her before the others return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert remembered what Lillian had said about Lulla and Maribelle. \"She must be a shapeshifter, easily able to shift back and forth between <br>\r\nfemale  cow and human, either way, a fem fatale. \"There's no reason for me to talk to her,\" he said. \"If she's involved, the group is here to make trouble, probably spying on us and pointing the finger of espionage on those who cross her. Let's just watch. We can take turns, one at a time while the other two get some rest, or take care of business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it came to be. The Flinchlanders came back one by one, or sometimes in twos, to talk to Lulla. We were too far away to hear but close enough to see gestures and pick up on body language. No doubt about it, Lulla was calling the shots. The question was, who was directing Lulla?<br>\r\nSomebody else, somebody not here had given her instructions. Over and over all three of us heard, \"I'll have to check that out with----\" She always lowered her voice to an inaudible tone  for the last word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lulla couldn't possibly recognize him as the young bull calf sentenced to the slaughterhouse with the rest of his family because his  father rejected her advances. While his two friends stood guard from their hiding place, Herbert mounted his black steed, Storm, and rode down to meet her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow strange it was to know he could draw his sword and cut off her head if he wanted to. He didn't. What Herbert wanted more than revenge was <br>\r\nthe name of her director, the Nexus of the Flinchland operation. Was it King Rupert?  That seemed unlikely. Rupert couldn't even maintain the <br>\r\nwindmills in his country, or the cisterns, when drought was their biggest threat. How could he control and direct an invasion of any kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, much as he would like to show Lulla how he and his family had survived, he had to keep it to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt their last meeting they each had four hooves, a tail for swishing flies, and he had the very beginning of horns. Now here they were, two humans. Or at least he was. He had agreed to transformation and lived in a world where there was no going back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lulla, on the other hand was a shapeshifter who could assume any form, possibly at any moment. The only thing that remained the same was her desire to control, at any expense. He had seen it in action many years ago.  Now he only sensed.it glowing in her eyes and projected from her vibes. He must not surrender to the glittering aura that she spread to pull him in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking away he turned his attention to the camp. \"You are not alone,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want to be alone with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wondered who was here, and why? People from the North seldom camp so close to the border.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are strangers in a strange land,\" she said with her teeth glittering. \"Will you not welcome us into your homes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what the others doing? Insinuating themselves into our homes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a suspicious man you are. Come, dismount and let us sit together by the fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled on the reins to back up Storm. \"I came to find out you sent you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hint of a scowl passed over her face. \"I am sent by he who one day will rule. That is all you need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dismissed him then, walking dangerously close to the freshly turned earth. He did not want her to know they'd been looking for the weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look there,\" he said pointing to a bird cruising overhead. \"Perhaps it is an omen of things to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish man,\" she said. \"I'm not into omens, I'm into power. She raised a bow and arrow laying close by, pointed it at the bird and let the arrow fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert willed the bird to fly faster. Lulla's harmless arrow fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have gained nothing little man,\" she said, walking away from the suspected cache of buried weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

This time the Flinchlanders returning to camp for food and rest did not return to the forest. One by one they stayed to huddle around the fire until all eight of them, nine counting Lulla, were there. They spoke so softly that Thunder could not hear a word. They pulled back from the fire like howling wolves,  then started to break up camp. One of the men picked up a shovel  to dig where the Northeners suspected their weapons were buried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With a bellow loud enough to wake the dead, let alone Bold and Herbert, Thunder crashed into the camp. His huge long horns tossed men this way and that. Bold soon followed. Herbert lept onto the the bare back of his stallion, Storm, and charged into the camp with Bold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frightened men, thinking it must be the great god, Thor, scattered in all directions. Four got away, Bold cornered one at the edge of the fire pit and  and Herbert lassoued two.  Where was the other one? They counted again and realized  two were missing,  Lula and one of the men. \"How could they get away?\" Bold asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a witch,\" Herbert said with no proof. \"They probably flew off on her broomstick.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three prisoners started to chatter among themselves. Bold tightened the ropes that bound them and gagged them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert picked up one of the shovels left behind. Thunder and Bold pitched in with their hooves.  Soon they came to what looked like a huge casket.<br>\r\nThe prisoners howled behind their gags. Thunder opened the lock with one of his horns expecting to find  sharp spears, swords, cross bows and  maybe some of  those  new fangled firing sticks. Instead a  bundle of bones fell out of the casket and a gaggle of spirits flew away dripping blood behind them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horrified prisoners screamed so loud they popped off their gags. \"The avengers, the avengers,\" they cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gag them again,\" Herbert cried, corralling the bones left behind with his lasso, and stuffing them back where they came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The others will return for the casket, we'll have to take it with us,\" Bold said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me a harness,\" Thunder directed, and I will drag it back to the herd for judgement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prisoners should go with you,\" Bold said to his new man friend. They are humans, a human court should try them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert, who wanted to return to Lillith and hear about her trip to the museum , balked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bold is right,\" Thunder agreed.  If you are afraid  to deal with them yourself, you should take them to the Keeper of the Realm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She inspected them closely wondering  how they mated and when their mating season started.  The tradition in the herd had been for  one steer to mate with several cows in order to replenish the crop of young calves each year. Lillith had not conceived  her first calf when she led Pom. Nel, and Chester the Jester into the underground smugglers tunnel to escape Llula's unfounded charges of espionage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time the fleeing suspects had expected two choices: be assimilated into the crowds of the North, or be extradited back to Loyola for trial as spies. How could she have known that her true love, Herbert, had been transformed into a male human, and that she and her friends would choose the same fate?  Their's had been a bitter choice; extradition or humanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Lillith's rekindled love for Herbert drove her to the second choice. Lillith and Chester had not yet entered the big house. They remained in the barn, which Herbert had fixed up with comfortable living quarters for the two of them while they adjusted to their new life. Chester had gone to town several times on his own,  but this trip to the museum was Lillith's first sight of street bustling with people. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simple brown and white smock and brown sandals that Herbert had provided never bothered Lillith before. In fact, she appreciated that he brought her smocks the same color has her previous cow skin. But in comparison to the fancy, colorful dresses and shoes worn by other ladies in town,  Lillith now felt downright dowdy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People are staring at me,\" she said. \"They think I'm odd. Maybe they know the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an effort to put her at ease Chester said, \"They are only staring at your great beauty. Hold your head high and step out smart.\"<br>\r\nOnce they entered the museum Lillith felt better because people were staring at the paintings, not her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Herbert is home yet?\" she asked on their way back to the barn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should think so, \" Chester said, secretly determining to speak to Herbert about Lillith's clothes when they had a minute alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert was fast losing patience with the slow pace of the prisoners stumbling along behind his horse, Storm. He wished he had Thunder with him but the strong  back of the huge bull had been needed to carry the casket of bones back to the herd. He could at least  have brought Bold.  Maybe he should back track and get Bold. Herbert tried to approximate the difference in miles between going back to the camp or going forward to his home. Then he added the distance from the camp to the herd that the two steers would have covered by now. The choice was obvious, they had  to keep going forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange noises and strange sights worried him. What if the four escaped Flinchlanders were lying in wait to attack him?  Would they  free their <br>\r\nthree comrades and kill Herbert, or maybe take him prisoner? The idea of it made him shudder. He could cut lose the rope tied to the trailing men and spur Storm ahead at a gallop. The others on foot would never catch him then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSave his own skin and leave these men loose in the Northern Kingdom?  No, it was a cowardly thought.  Just then a cloud of dust appeared to the right. Men riding in?  Who could they be?  The escaped Flinchlader s, or his own captain of the guards from Wooster?  He squinted his eyes looking for clues.  The prisoners were also searching. \"Can you tell who it is?\" he asked, momentarily forgetting he had gagged them. Seeing the rags stuffed in their mouths,he jumped from his saddle, gave each a long drink of water, and asked the question again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Avengers,\" one of them said. \"They are the spirits of the avengers . They are wondering in search of their bones. Until they reconnect they are  lost spirits roaming the earth looking for the casket that holds their bones. Without them they have no body to support them. They are not born from flesh and blood like the rest of us, they are born from the Spirit of Revenge. that lies dormant in their bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are they coming here? What will they do?\"  Herbert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can they do?  Choke us to death with their whirling dust storms, I fear.  We best lie down and cover our heads. Play dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a trick,\" Herbert  thought, \"The prisoners are tricking me to lie down in a dust storm so they can run away. I should keep going.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut already whirling wind and flying bits of dirt and dust were filling his eyes, and his ears, and his mouth. Storm was snorting and coughing. The prisoners were lying face down with their hollow walking sticks held up as a breathing tube. \"They will live and I will not,\" Herbert thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swirling wind felt like it lasted for hours but probably was much less than that. When all of them stopped moving the avenging wind swept away in search of more victims.  The event had altered the dynamics between captor and captives.  Herbert shared out the rest of his water among the captives and his horse. He removed their lasso and wound his rope on his saddle. \"We might as well die as friends,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother cloud of dust appeared on the horizon, only this time men on horseback were easy to distinguish.  They carried the Wooster flag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are my men,\" Herbert said. The prisoners groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Herbert,\" the captain of the guard greeted him when they drew near.  \"Your mother was worried. She asked us to look for you. Who are these?\" he asked, pointing to the three men on foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Herbert  lied. \"Whoever they are, they are lost. They saved my life, and Storm\"s. \"We'll take them to the house for a meal and a night's rest before they journey on to the Keeper of the Realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord,\" the captain said in obvious disapproval.   \"Here, you men, each of you carry one of these on your horse behind you until we reach  House Wooster. You may dump them in the courtyard so others do not see them with you.\" He looked at Herbert for approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" the young lord said.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert reached down to pat the chest of his friend. \"Thank goodness for that,\" he whispered into Storm's right ear. Now you can move forward at a right smart trot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's under restoration. Take them to the guest house\"<br>\r\n\"The guest house?\" Surely you don't mean it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert laughed. \"I see what you mean. Turn the hose on them. Shower them down first. Then find some clean clothes for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Brawn watched his master springing to the old barn. What was going on? Why restore the place when they already had a new barn? He made a mental note to ask the downstairs maid next time he saw her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later one of the prisoners signalled to a guard outside the guest house. \"We need to see Lord Herbert right away. It's an emergency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can give me the message.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him we want to make a deal but there's not much time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the emergency?\" Herbert asked when the message had been delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want to tell you why we were sent across the border, the spokesman for the prisoners said. And---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we want to work for you. You been square with us. We don't trust that Brawn guy. We want to be your personal guards\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert laughed. \"Brawn's fine. But if you really want to work for me I'll find you some sort of a job - provided you tell me the truth about why you were sent across the border.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe talky one continued, \"Rufus has plans to take over the Realm, one kingdom at a time . He spent spies in all directions to scope out weak spots. When he heard the king of the North never goes out among the people, he decided the the king must be dying. . We were sent to find out if the king is already dead. If he is, Rufus plans to take over. Then he called for Lulla the witch, and her gaggle of <br>\r\nspirit avengers to start spreading rumors in the population that their king was either going to abdicate or die and Rufus would be there new king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those who escaped when you captured us are still working on the plan. We want to warn your king of the North that he should be seen in public and he should appear strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He might think it is a plan to get him assassinated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He might be if he remains hidden and secretive and has no support from the people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Herbert said. \"What do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show us the way to your king. Go with us. Tell him what you saw at the border, all of it. Tell him about eight of us setting up camp, and Lulla, the<br>\r\nwitch and her gaggle of spirits that rise from the bones in casket whenever it is opened. Tell him we saved your lives on the way here, and how we are on your side now. If you do all these things he might believe us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert wished his father was still alive for him to consult \"There's someone I want you to meet.\" he said, thinking of Chester. He used to be a Court Jester for the herd. He's very wise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the herd?\" The man raised his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a matter of expression. It's a Northern expression for group.\" Whew! Herbert almost blew it that time. He would have to be more careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is this court jester? Will it take him long to get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. He happens to be visiting us now. I'll go get him. He noticed Brawn watching them from a distance. \"You go back inside. I'll bring <br>\r\nChester to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three prisoners and Lord Herbert left in a horse drawn coach for the palace of the king , a small crowd of well wishers gathered to see them off. Among the crowd Captain Brawn noticed a beautiful young woman he had not seen before. \"Who is she?\" he asked a man next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shrugged his shoulders, \"Never seen her before. \"Not bad looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you like the type.\" Brawn hid his interest until the coach pulled away and the crowd thinned. He noticed an elderly man, perhaps her father, walking with the girl. His interest soared when they entered the door to the old barn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was she, why was Herbert keeping her hidden?\"/i} He considered it his job to find out and report to Lady Wooster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillith had seen the well muscled captain staring at her in the courtyard, and she had squirmed under his glance. She opened the half door on the barn to make sure he was gone. Instead she found him strolling back and forth directly in front of her view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at?\" Chester came up behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the sky,\" she said. \"See what a bright blue it is tonight, it almost sparkles.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you happy?\" Chester asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.

Which one are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Snip, sir.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, Snip, when we are presented you may walk behind me and the other two may walk behind you. Do not sit down in the presence of the king. Stand at all times and when it is time to leave we must all back out. So Rip and Tip will back out first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no why. It's the way it is done. Do you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir, they said in chorus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were ushered into a waiting room filled with other people waiting. \"Why are we all waiting?\" Snip asked. \"Who's inside.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one,\" Herbert said. \"That's the problem. \"No-one can find the king. Don't look so surprised. You yourself said he needs to make himself more available to the people. Well, that includes the people of the court. He's not a snob. He's a recluse.\"</span></div></div>",

There is no peace, no silence, but quiet that sets the nerves on edge with the soft falls of carefully set feet.  It is the ghost dance, the manuever that leads to blood in the night.  I know it well, I have danced this dance and know that a dancer will step and step, secret and silent, but then the next step will bring the battle's noise and the silence that hides the coming battle will be shattered irreparably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are two armies, maybe more.  Who can say what forces are arrayed in the darkness, not even the armies themselves may know their own force.  Could there have been defections?  Who can say?  Might error or cowardice have thinned their forces in that dark field?  It must be said that it is possible.  But in the moonless night a fighter and his foe must meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy tread of the thick necked battlers, anger burning through torpor.  These are quick to anger and fierce in their pride.  There heads are crowned with death and their feet are hard enough to break another's bones.  Oh, they are fierce and like to charge a friend as to kill an enemy, but who can stand against such as he?  It is death to face his thick muscled body, trampling to stand against him to his face.  There is a scent upon the air that makes the battlers rage.  A scent that calls their blood to fight, they move, swinging sharp tipped weapons side to side as they seek what they may kill or failing that to vent their rage upon their own kind if that is what they find to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the darkest shadows moves a pack of darker shadows.  If light betrayed there might be gleam of sharpened tooth, but these drift near the earth.  Weapons for the ravaging of those who come to grief in the night of the stealth hunters.  These know the meaning of the scents, the heady scents of fearful fighters, food if they should flee.  It is their way to hound their prey, to fight a skirmish, and perhaps to run away only to turn back to tear their foe to pieces.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunger is their goad, they seek the meat of the slain, not like the carrion crow, not like the raven that will feast upon the fallen in the light, no, these are not patient for their food.  They will make a kill and feed upon the dying while its blood is hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the clouds are torn away.  The wind upon the fields falls with the light of moon and stars above the clouds that wind has torn to gibbious threads that glow and their the battle down below.  A bellow and a growl as two armies set to.  Two armies that will fight until the feathered black birds that love the battles leavings will descend.  This is war, and this is death.  The death of bulls and wolves and too, the death of silence as the thunk of horn and ripping sound of fang are but the least of sounds that shatter all quietness that once held sway upon this field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords: 534 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check5.png\" alt=\"*Check5*\" title=\"Check5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

The Dragon raises his head a little, opened his mouth to reveal the wildly uneven, hundreds of sharp, stained red and yellow teeth \u2013 nah daggers \u2013 which would have devoured hundreds of humans at once just by merely placing its toothy jaw on them. The froth building in his mouth signaled to the warrior of what the Dragon thought of him \u2013 a nice, juicy piece of lump; nothing more, nothing less. As the man-creature looked at the dark abyss revealed by the agape mouth of the dragon, the warrior wondered for a while about remnants of how many villages, how many of his countrymen could be found beyond that abyss. The gleaming teeth of the dragon, gnashed together as the dragon let out a noise from its nostril which sounded something like neighing of hundreds of wild horses together. Good thing that the man-creature had a headgear which shielded his pale face, death seeing eyes and the quivering lip from the furious, preying eyes of the Dragon; Dragons prey on the fear of the feeble, detest it; They devour the carrier of weak willed soul and see it as their duty to wipe out the land of such limp creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man-creature tried to firm his grip on his war-skythe but his strong wrists had lost their power as the Dragon\u2019s sweltering breath grazed his neck. Dragon\u2019s breath smelled of all those things which the warrior didn\u2019t want to think of at this point \u2013 it smelled of blood, not of one but of an army battalion of thousands of stronger warriors; it smelled of the razing fire in its belly which would turned hundreds of villages to ashes in a matter of two deep breaths. The warrior considered whether the being standing in front of him had the pride, the ego which said to the other species that see I am the most majestic, most powerful creature in the whole multiverse. The warrior wasn\u2019t sure but the thought that the Dragon drew back a little, as haughtily as it could, one step at a time total five steps in all. It gave its wing a slight flutter, as if brushing off the tainted weak breaths of the warrior it must have gathered from standing so close to him and looked away towards the group of warriors standing nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I not good enough for him?\u201d the warrior wondered. He got his answer, not in the way he expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar, as if hundreds of simultaneous thunderclaps, echoed through the land where they stood. It was a if a minor earthquake had hit the land; after all, it was the Dragon, the most savage beast in the history speaking \u2013<br>\r\n\u201cWho is your Master?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight rustle and clicking of the panoplies as the suited warriors looked around to search for what the Dragon asked for. Nobody knew what they were looking yet as their master, if alive, was a thousand miles away in the valley of Sminvalia. Yet they were hoping for an answer from someone; someone who was brave enough to proclaim himself as their master for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon dragged its fiery claw into the muddy ground below. He was sensing it was worthless to talk to the bunch of pushovers encircling him. Perhaps they would be of more use in the empty chambers of his belly. His eyes twinkled.

Every few steps the old man glanced back over his shoulder and this seemed to help him keep pace.  There were a few more men, men at arms perhaps, that straggled behind the lock-box and the knights with their lord, these seemed as nervous as their lord, glancing backward like Kefnir, but also looking around them trying to penetrate the shadows of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAris stepped out of concealment and shouted, \"Hold there lord Kefnir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of his men moved out with him, drawing their bows with arrows noched.  Kefnir squeeled in fright and then screamed, \"Shoot them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men behind the lord revealed that they carried bows, drawing at the command, but Aris's men were already firing and they fell or fled.  Kefnir shrieked his displeasure and howled for his knights to \"strike them down.\"  But there were only six against thirty and they dumped their swords in the dirt and stood with hands raised in surrender.  \"Cowards!\" shouted Kefnir, but the knights glanced at their lord with distain and ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there were many more men in the woods.  But before he could order his men to defense Aris saw that Jaren was at their head.  \"I don't believe this is the whole of the garrison, but I believe we've smoked out the treasury,\" said Aris to his lieutenant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd rob an old man on the highway, you're no better than brigands,\" spit the erstwhile lord of Winebrook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smoked out, that's a good word for it.  We set campfires for an army when it got dark, but it seems that a few, well, all of them got away from us.\"  Jaren looked slightly embarassed, \"Looks like the smoke and fire sent the rats to scuttling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aris's men approached the lock-box, the bearers and the knights stepped away.  Lord Kefnir clung to his riches, \"Its mine, you're common thieves I tell you. . .\" but he merely slumped on the ground cursing when they lifted it and carried it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAris looked over the scene. <i> What do I want with the old ruin of a castle?  A base?  Perhaps, and there was reason to want to see what they could find in the castle's armory and larder, but it surely was not worth the lives of my men to take it from the garrison, reduced as it was by a dozen or so men.  Jaren's trick had netted them a rich treasure, they could avoid any losses and just take what they had, but maybe there was an even better outcome.  What should he do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Leadership, he knew, was about making decisions, sometimes the quickest was better than the best, but sometimes it was the best.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count 560 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

It was a mere six inches long, and barely as thick as a quill!\" Yet, he shortened the reins and motioned Jaren to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fly man, for we know not what more they have in check!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two horses needed no urging, they sensed the tension and made ate up the road with their long strides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been four or five miles later that Aris signalled a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! I can ... go on ... no more. I feel ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAris swayed in the saddle and fell to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaren jumped off his mount and stopped to the still figure. He tried to support him, but Aris just slipped back, his jacket opening to show the bloodstained shirt underneath. He pulled that cloth out of the waistband, there was a tiny puncture wound, but the flesh was purple and green for inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Poison. The arrow was meant not to injure but to deliver the poison.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaren starred at his companion's limp form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I have to tend to him, but know neither the poison nor its remedy. I have to find Sramius. He will be able to tell me how to tackle this. I pray he will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne tear trickled down his his weather-beaten cheek, he let it roll into the corner of his mouth, salt and bitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend, for you are that. I swear I shall keep you alive and well and help you find the answers you seek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted the dead-weight of his friend, staggering under the load as he arranged it over the saddle of the patient steed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnward, we ride to Scramius' lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n800 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

They longed for real shelter, but the prospect of steady wage kept then moving.<br>\r\n   On a particularly dark night Jared and Aris were awakened by a blood curdling shriek that ripped through the dark. They jumped to their feet and grabbed the swords that hung from their saddles. The horses were snorting nervously and the men hung tightly to the reins in case the animals bolted in fright. <br>\r\n   A large, dark shape flew over head. The moon was blotted out as it swept past. Both Jared and Aris screamed. The shape took another pass. The horses screamed and both men lost hold of the reins. The horses bolted and ran into the woods. The men barely noticed as they watched the sky for the figures. The trees swayed as an unnaturally strong wind blew through the forest.

It was as if thousands of venomous snakes with their heads recoiled, hissed at them; maybe preparing to strike at the same time, anytime. With the corner of the eyes he scanned the vast expanses of nothingness surrounding them. Not even a plant, leave alone an animal, was anywhere in sight. He wanted to survey more of a land around them but he soon sensed that sound was coming from something in front of them. It soon dawned upon him -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s them? It IS them!\u201d Jared eyebrows went up in acknowledgement of the fact it was the breathing of The Others which was causing this ghastly wheezing, hissing sound! The hair on the back of his neck stood up as he realized the fact although The Others stood some ten feet away from where AJred waxs but he could still hear each and every breath so clearly. <br>\r\nW-w-w-h-h-hh-hhh-e-e-e-e-z-z-z-z . H-i-s-s-s-s-s-s-s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded so death like. Jared was stunned but not afraid by any stretch of imagination. He looked straight into the Other\u2019s eyes \u2013 those cold blue pupils, cracked at the ends and red veins zigzagging in them, as if ready to burst - but didn\u2019t bat an eyelid and instead stared even harder. His fists were clenched and head upright. His muscular strong trunk like legs were tightened - not stiff just ready - to jump into the action if need arose. The gentle, cold breeze flowing under the blue, starry sky played with Jared\u2019s mane and it flowed in the air, giving him a distinctive Samson appearance. He was ready for any mischief The Others may cause \u2013 well, almost ready \u2013 and all he needed was his thirsty Sword. He didn\u2019t care about himself but he knew that he wasn\u2019t alone in it. He had a responsibility of a partner who was possibly cursing him because it was he, Jared, who dragged Aris onto this adventure for which Aris was possibly not prepared to cope with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, my friend Aris,\u201d -  a mighty lump formed in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared turned his neck slightly \u2013 not much lest he might miss a view of The Others who looked posed for an attack -to look at Aris who was standing to his left. Aris\u2019 pale eyes told the story of all the fears, all the brutality and all the savageness he was imagining at this point. His panic stricken yellow face shone even more under the moonlight and it went whiter with every passing moment. His lips shivered worse than a dry leaf in the autumn wind and his knees seemed like a mirage which could dissolve in the desert underneath them, without warning anytime now. It was if the shrillness from The Others\u2019 eyes was impaling his soul, devouring it and ripping it out, one strand at a time \u2013 it is more painful that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared knew that he had to do something or the other else the anxiety of Aris would take over. As The others stood staring Jared and Aris, possibly trying to ascertain whom should they devour first, Jared parted his lips to say something. But The Others didn\u2019t let him do it. The one in the middle said to them,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWaskulyn Astrysda Ondro, va?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared didn\u2019t know what it meant. It was a question perhaps, going by the tone of it but there was no way to know it meant; well, apart from asking The Others themselves and that is what precisely Jared did- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Others looked at each other as if to mock Jared\u2019s innocence and foolhardiness.<br>\r\nThe one standing in the middle looked at the one standing to the right of him and planted his sharp, long, red stained silvery nail to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Right one opened his narrow mouth and hissed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat makes you two scum to flow into the Forest of the Doom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-we c-c-came b-b-y m-mist-t-ake,\u201d Aris jumped into say what had been building up in his head for so long, \u201cw-w-w-we l-l-l-lost our way, M-m-m-aster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOdoruska spezel vascianto, ni!\u201d It was not a voice but a dozen thunderclaps disguised as chatter which spoke this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the Left most being who had spoken and his eyes looked full of hatred and disgust; hell bent on destruction. Without losing a moment, he flexed his long sinewy limbs and placed it on Aris\u2019 skull and began to crush it with all his force.<br>\r\nJared flung himself at Aris\u2019 tormenter and swished a violent kick at his chest. The beast in the Left didn\u2019t move an inch. Jared got up and placed a kick at the knee joint this time. No effect. Jared flung himself again to plant a kick at those sinewy limbs. It worked - not the way he expected it to \u2013but he knew it had an effect because he saw Aris lying on the floor, still and possibly unconscious. But in this process his own foot had went through the nerve and tissues in those limbs of the monster and got strangled in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the attacked Blue creature writhed in pain, the other two beasts now came towards Jared; one of them placed his dagger like nails on the windpipe of Jared who was still trying to punch and kick his way through the mess. It wasn\u2019t working and worse enough, the chances of it working was decreasing with every passing moment, as the sharp nail cut through the thin skin of the neck and into his windpipe. Jared\u2019s eyes were losing the battle but his soul wasn\u2019t. Just then, he heard somebody apart from The Others speak their language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice said \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnuendo Masterss.

If Vishnu and Hidra do not exist, then it is not reasonable for other gods to exist.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not gods, but perhaps something else,\u201d a new voice cut in.  The three Others dropped to their knees again, and this time Jared heard the clop clop clop and snort of a horse.  He spun around to face the new intruder.  His hand was at his scabbard, but his shock caused him to freeze and gape.  Aris couldn\u2019t even hold back a cry of surprise.  \u201cBy the gods!\u201d<br>\r\nOut of the woods came clopping a horse.  But this horse not just a regular sorrel stallion, as was common among the knightry, but a lightning blue mare, with a golden mane, tail, and hooves.  White feathery wings sprouted from the horse\u2019s shoulder, an unheard of feature not even wild enough to appear in myth.<br>\r\nWhat really stole the show, however, was the winged horse\u2019s rider.  She was little, probably around five feet.  But she was dressed in a full suit of armor, with the blue-ruffed helmet peeking out of her saddlebag.  Her skin was tan and wrinkled, and her hair was long and white, portraying a woman in the age of carriages and sedan chairs.  But Jared suspected from her garb that she was not the sedan chair type.<br>\r\n\u201cFey araba,\u201d the Others spoke as one.<br>\r\nThe woman smiled.  \u201cRise, my chosen ones.  You have done well.\u201d<br>\r\nThe Others rose from their knees to a squatting position.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d the woman demanded<br>\r\n\u201cIt is disrespectful to raise one\u2019s head higher than a goddess\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n\"Oh, poppycock!  You're eight feet tall!  That's how tall I made you, and I want you to use all eight feet of that height at all times!\"<br>\r\n\"As you wish, fey abara.\"<br>\r\nThe woman smiled as the Others rose back to their feet.  She then turned to Jared and Aris.<br>\r\n\"My name is Dame Melrose Marinafeather.  I am one of the nine knights of the beyond, the queen of the Mars, or as you know them, the Others.  Please, come with me, that I may help you with your quest.\"<br>\r\n581 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

There was no escaping and he knew he was doomed.  As the Others advanced, Jared waited until they were close enough- and then threw a punch.<br>\r\nThe Others hissed and swarmed into the circle, surrounding Jared, who pulled out his sword and tried to fend them off.<br>\r\nAris pulled out his sword and attempted to do the same.  One Other fell, only to be replaced by a fourth Other.  It was clear they were not going to win.<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Aris cried.  \"What if we can find you another human sacrifice?

It was your bright idea to challenge the Others and continue on.  I just wanted to go back.\" replied Aris.<br>\r\n\"Oh, so it's my fault, now eh?\" Jared sneered.<br>\r\nTaken aback, Aris snapped back at his friend.  \"You know what? Yeah, it is.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once upon a day rising Emma of the House of Martell left the world. She just didn\u2019t get up one morning as the others went with their daily rites.  They didn\u2019t even notice her absence at first. After all, what is one less vieing for attention?<br>\r\nWhen they finally missed her, they went to her chamber and found her sleeping. Try as they might they couldn\u2019t rouse her. She simply went on sleeping, oblivious to their call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo began she first adventure of Emma to Otherworld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke, she was in a strange yet familiar surroundings. No comfort in the familiarity, for it was dark and dank and her nerves were tingling.  Yes, she knew the place now.  It was the world of her reveries, when , at times, she\u2019d just stare off in some distraction. Usually, it was a fair place but recent ones were ominous like this hall of darkness.  Once it was a place where you were meant to face your own fears, your fearful self. Now it was menaced by a horrid beast set on turning those entering into his minions, using their dark selves permanently. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe shuddered as she remembered something  impressed upon her in the last contact before the darkening images began:<br>\r\n\u201cWe are in serious danger. Without our visits to the Hall of Dark, where we face new levels of understanding, wisdom and strength, our society will stagnate and die or worse.  Should we give in to the Morbidane, we become evil and turn in on ourselves, becoming a threat to others, even your world, eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have always served as peacemakers of spheres, constantly shifting to preserve a balance, as we have for all time, as directed by the Master.  We serve to keep others at bay. The dark force too, is ever present. Greater it grows. Now it even enters our domain. A test, perhaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a rare one to have been able to delve into our world and we welcome peaceful intrusion.  Now, it seems, in our hour of greatest need, you may be of service.  In fact, he has already crept into you as well, so that you have stopped fighting in your own world.  Little does he realize he may have played into our hands. Yes , the Great One makes use of evil to turn it to good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood silent in the hall, she had so many questions battling for expression.  How did she get here? What was she to do? Oh, she didn\u2019t understand this. She just wanted to rest!  Now she was to be a worse battle and had no clue.  Worse still, it was not just for herself anymore, but would effect these gentle beings fo her reveries. Where would she be without them?<br>\r\nShe made herself quiet and concentrated, to make contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes , Emma , I hear you. Cannot help, I\u2019m afraid. On ly to say that you have all you need to face this foe.  We will support you and pray for alone we cannot defeat this evil. You have been chosen, so believe\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Emma panicked. \u201cDon\u2019t go! Don\u2019t leave me alone here!\u201d she cried as the voice faded.  A gentle echo reminded her: <i>You are never alone , dear one.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma leaned against the smooth rocky interior of the cave-like hall and took a deep breath, wondering what her next move should be.  Should she wait for whatever was to happen or go in search of it? She was not eager to find it but wanted it to be done. She was about to decide when she heard the most raucous nerve tingling voice she\u2019d ever heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome , young Emma. See how easy it was to just give up fighting and come to me? Fatigue is an easy tool to manipulate, don\u2019t you agree? He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do not willing come to you, whoever you are! I am merely resting and you are totally imaginary!\u201d she responded with all the courage she could muster on being confronted by this eery being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Morbidane roared with laughter, tossing his gigantic head back. \u201coh, no! I am quite real,  though not know well in this form. And you, you are one of many falling, or rather coming to our ranks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever! Why me , anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? The higher they are , the more power I gain whrn they fall.  It happens sooner or later, my dear. So face it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes , we all make mistaken choices but there is always a way back.  You may think you have me, but I will not stay! You cannot make me, If I will against you.\u201d Emma retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorbidane merely grinned at the challenge. \u201cNot easy, ma petite. I have several of these sickening peace creatures in my clutches, already primed and now, with you too, I\u2019ll soon take over this domain. It is much too restful for my taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will not help  you. The others you tricked were not expecting subterfuge. I know you. I have forewarning. I will , but the Maker\u2019s grace, not stay here.\u201d Emma firmly stated as she stood, arms crossed, head held high in defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorbidane squinted at her steady clear eyes and rubbed one grubby had across his chin.  \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he said , as he turned away. \u201cYou have yet to face the secrets of this hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat you have tampered with, no doubt. You are not in charge of me, do you hear?\u201d Emma yelled after him. \u201cYou do nothing but take orders and hurt innocent beings, ignorant uninformed people. You have none of your own power.  Only use theirs, you parasite.!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was quite angry at his confidence and a  trifle afraid as well.  She was not used to anger. Was she drawing on his?  She didn\u2019t know what to expect. The unknown was always a frightening concept, and for all her bravado, she didn\u2019t know if she was strong enough to withstand the great tempting to come. In little things she even failed.  Yet she learned from them and grew stronger.  Now so much depended on her.  Oh , she wanted to go home and cry in a corner at her fate. But somehow, with her anger turned to potency she knew she wouldn\u2019t give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned to begin her trek down the corridor, she saw a flash of light reflected off of a mica stone wall. Instantly she recalled Camil\u2019s words, \u201cYou are never alone.\u201d  That\u2019s right, she thought. She looked around for a dry spot and knelt to pray. She knew , in all humility, the only way through this was with the Maker\u2019s help.  She could not manage it alone but knew, if she asked in faith, He\u2019s give her strength. It was a magic the Morbidane could not fathom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Great Maker, I kneel before you, seeking, in  my little faith, your help. Help my weakness in this grave time, for your peacemakers and for your greater peace. Let not this evil one win the day with his pride and arrogance. Surround us with love and strength, here in this darkness. Thank you.\" She ended in a whisper. As she signed the blessing she heard the faint echo of \"unbowed, unbent, unbroken\" the chant of the Martell Sunspears as they headed to battle, and with a lighter heart , she rose and began the trek into the Hall of Darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered, as she heard it just then, if it was happening back in her own time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1257 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"> Martell House</span></span></div></div>",

Emma looked toward the center of the room and could barely make out the shape of a human form located there, deep within the snows. \"The time of House Martell has come to a close. Winter is coming and those who are prepared shall endure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma raised her chin. \"The sun will melt the snows.\" Her voice was strong and defiant, belying the tremor she felt through her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sun may try.\" The scratchy voice laughed and Emma felt an odd familiarity. She knew that voice. She knew this soul. \"Grandmother?\" She stepped a little closer to the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my dear,\" her grandmother said. \"But you can come no closer to me. I cannot offer you physical help here. It is forbidden. But you must beware the snow. It covers lightly, gently, until you realize that your path is blocked and you are no longer able to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked around at the snowflakes that fell into her golden locks and onto her thin night shift. She gave an involuntary shiver at the cold she had expected, but there was none. The Martell sun must be keeping me warm, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cold is not always felt on the skin,\" Grandmother warned. \"The cold we must fight against most is within the heart. He will try to corrupt your heart. He will attempt to make you believe things that you know are not true. If you believe, your heart will freeze and all will be lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma worried her lower lip with her teeth. It was a habit that she thought she had broke as a young child. And, like a child, she longed to rush into her grandmother's arms to find comfort. Grandmother had been a Stark and had traveled from Winterfell to House Martell when she married Grandfather. \"It makes sense that you would be in here with the snow,\" Emma said. \"You always did miss it. I still think of your stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandmother chuckled softly. \"I never could get used to the heat that you all seem to thrive within. But you must be prepared, my granddaughter. Winter snows can cover even the warmest of hearts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded. \"Yes, Grandmother,\" she said solemnly. \"But, can you tell me, why am I here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandmother sighed. \"You were chosen,\" she said. \"None but the Maker know the reason why. But He has faith in you. And I do as well. You must defeat this best. You must refuse him. For if you do not, the Martells will perish along with the rest of the realm.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma felt a weight, like that of a fifty pound feed sack, press down on her shoulders. She was barely fifteen, so how could she be expected to take on this task and save the kingdom. Wasn't that a job for knights and squires? Maidens like herself were expected to embroider and run households. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell to her knees in the deep snows. The white powder covered them and crept up her thighs. She considered lying there and allowing the snow to cover her body. What cannot be seen cannot be hunted, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must not give up before you begin,\" her grandmother's voice traveled toward her ears and she found she could not shut out the words as she longed to do. \"You are chosen and you must fulfill your destiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want it.\" Emma said simply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we are all surely lost.\" Grandmother's voice was sad and disappointed. The words felt like a dagger slicing her thin skin and Emma felt the coldness of the snowdrift in which she sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so cold,\" she remarked. \"I feel as if it is sucking all of the warmth from my body.\" She lifted her hand from the snow to stare at the reddened skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you give up the warmth, you allow the cold to seep in.\" Grandmother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must continue your destiny, child. You must defeat the Morbidane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I cannot?\" Emma's voice trembled, though she wasn't sure if it was from fear or the cold. She stood, eager to leave the snow's icy grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must!\" Grandmother's words were harsh and firm, like the winters she often spoke of in Winterfell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded, her eyes brimming with tears. \"I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all are afraid when our destiny comes to call.\" Grandmother's voice softened and Emma took solace in the warmth there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do?\" She steeled herself. Fear was for children. She was a woman and would do what was needed to save her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must face your fears and let them not change you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma let out a ragged breath. \"Okay, I am ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have passed the first fear.\" Grandmother said. \"You did not allow the cold to freeze you. You found your warmth. The others, I'm afraid, won't be so simple. But you must continue. We all depend on you. Be well, child.

As she sat pondering, she felt the stirring of a notion ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Emma, get out of your mind, your logical thought will not help.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? who?\" Emma looked around but saw nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"figuring things out with mental capacities will only lead you in circles\"</i> the voice continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Emma was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" In the mind are all the ideas, notions, opinions,judgments, answers that you were taught by others, by mere reality here.

Be open to all that is--in allowance---without the limits of judgment---and you will see what really is.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma took a deep breath and asked for this gift of dropping barriers and expansion of her energy.

Now what do you know About Morbidane?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma reached out beyond her feelings, fears , judgements and touched the energy of the Morbidane.  \"He is fearful and cruel, there is no love and he chooses it.\" she said, amazed that it came so easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Look deeper.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma reached her energy out further.  \"There are more--he is but one. but I can't...\" she tried to see more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Yes, now stop trying.

His brother Clawling is more powerful and is out in the world here but even more dangerous is his sister. All three will be in your path.  Yet, allies there will be too.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how will I know....?\" she was nervous again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Trust being you, not the definition or projection or mind chatter. How did you \"know\" me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just felt light and knew....ah...it is a quick and light feather touch. before I  think a thought?\"  she was beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well done. It is a practice so keep being aware...trust your knowing. And by the way, what if your nervousness was really excitement about what is possible and the adventure before you instead of the burdensome thought of a trial? Interesting Point of view, isn't it?\"</i>  the voice was fading in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I need...\"  Emma didn't want to be left alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \"Interesting point of view...need....\"</i>   was the last echo Emma heard as she stood now and faced the next passage in the maze.  \"Adventure? Be space and know...I will know what to say, what to do, what is real..\" She affirmed to stop the mind chatter that was already coming back , now the all encompassing vibration of the master had gone.  What would it take for her to  be that space, that light? She committed to herself to work toward it, and with that, a notion that all is possible filtered through the fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n649 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">House Martell<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Young acolytes with hopeful shining eyes, listened to the master and were soon saddened by his words about the rise of evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She lives comfortably there in darkened passage, her throne room at the darkest center.  She cannot bear the light of the Star child kept in the Temple of Lubria.  Occasionally light escapes, small fairies flit through cracks, and heighten her dimensia.  Her brother Clawling, who oft thinks he\u2019s in charge, cannot withstand her power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack her heart,<br>\r\nCold her soul,<br>\r\nBarren of love from eternity,<br>\r\nBorn of broken trust and shattered dream <br>\r\nOf the victims of conformity,<br>\r\nShe has no conscience<br>\r\nNo thought for any, save her own need and want;<br>\r\nPower  and revenge her aim, <br>\r\nA regal pedestal:  her foot stool,<br>\r\nRage: her garment;<br>\r\nHer lashing tongue and glare of eye, her weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes , she has sliced through many a beast and wanderer with a mere glance and curse from her serpent\u2019s tongue.  Her blood boils rage and hate, jealousy without recrimination and she fires doom at will, careless of even her own minions.  Children has she none. Not birthing thing , she, though creatures  she has created of words from her lips.  Seething slime on battle turrets and edges transform should enemy camp near.  At night, their dreams haunt, confusing  even the glory cause.  They are foreigners, not of their own psyche, alien.  Impress upon consciousness of a innocent to disrupt.  Luckily, only a small disarray form short exposure, for in dreams, one\u2019s own shadow caster despises intruders and our guide still stronger yet to provide alternative toward the light.  But woe to those long exposed to her wiles in this manner, for sleep deprived souls, whose dreams directed from without, soon, bewitched, follow other master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Indeed, she is wily. Ebbing what is good, holy, what is gift and talent, masking with other matters seeming consequential, frustrating the need to explore and be. She hoards all for herself, even imagination, with which she concocts such fear imagery that they stop travellers and cause great dilemmas.  This causes depletion of energy , so they use energy up and forgo the true quest, unless  by  some miracle, a charmed stranger appears in the land and momentarily lifts the dark so a further step might proceed.  The fairies once played apart here.  Few are left, unfortunately.  Now a reliance upon talismans and charms, once forged at the great fires of the Star Child, and so relegated with power, are the only hope.  It is to those who bear these charms the Child has called to ride the land of this evil darkness.  For the land is dying. Too long has it been since a golden upheaval has occurred.   Too few fairies and light masters.  Darkensfeld has spread wider and caused more forgetfulness and diversion than the land could endure on its own any longer and few recall the way it was before the great dark, carried on by Clawling\u2019s clan. Chalice was one, Emma, and the Old One. The time of the Star Child\u2019s Return had come. All need by ready. There was a need to gather and rise to lighten the Great Dark to clear ways to Recognition. Spells were not enough, not against her. Will and love and trust, perception and faith were necessary tools now, the greater weapons, in fact and a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps to win over the minions, who cannot trust their mistress not to harm them. To devour them with love or diminish them in the same way they were born, by word of power, or banishment. Death to anti \u2013life.   Subdue, transform with light so the dark can see. So many were the battle cries of hearts that knew.<br>\r\nCruel , it may seem. For life to be , there must be death.  And heroes must destroy.  For new birth. For salvation. Either give of their life, transcend of endure, facing down the enemy, denying their power, forcing it to creep away or lure it to the good with love.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can we do?

She was the one with common sense and<br>\r\npracticality, who served as an objective seer. She kept the peace when one or other did not have an upper hand, which happened once in a while.  Anger of the child liked to have its day in the sun.  It was allowed but Emma liked to keep things balanced.  It was, however, a  fatiguing, thankless job.  So one day she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos reigned after the initial denial that she was gone .  Anger rebelled and went on a rampage, often swatting the inner child.  The child played and pulled tantrums. The critic was ceaseless in her torment of the others. Wisdom was all but effective. Spirit was buried beneath a pile of gathering rubbish withheld or as a result of aftermath\u2019s rubble. None were happy. Nothing was fair. It wasn\u2019t perfect before and each one had complaints about things. But, at least with Emma there, there was some semblance of order and each got a fair shake.  It was often subject to Emma\u2019s moods or feelings as well, whether she wanted to hear or approach certain issues or not.  But, in time,  all got a hearing. Without her they couldn\u2019t get it together at all. They were, for the cause, making attempts to work together to bring Emma back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did they know that Emma was facing some darker choices of her own in the Hall of Dark.  And it came to Emma that she would have to call on each of them to help her in her journey. She was learning that she, too, needed those she felt  she had to keep in line.  And that ducking out on them was not a viable or happy solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she had called them forth. The anger to stand and speak up had she conjured first, which was why perhaps there was more ease with the others trying to co-operate.  They didn\u2019t know Emma could reach them and would call them from where she was.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Zarsan stood at the edge of the cliff, the only one of his kind after the great merging that deformed and scarred the world permanently.  Great winged creatures were born of the changing and took to white skies, squawking in unison, much as horses running in a race.  Black holes appeared in the sky , suspended as if by chains and while he could not see clearly, he could make out hands trying to reach out of each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis club leaned against a hollow tree trunk, but he had no reason to pick it up again. He just stood  gazing, a slight breeze shifting his hooded cape. Suddenly he dropped to his knees and wept as the memories of what had taken place flooded his tired brain.  In this despair, he thought he heard  a raspy voice.  He looked up and saw a giant hand reaching down with a chalice, shaped like a castle with a tower set inside and the base as curled as a snake.  It was like a vision he has seen once before.  He had resisted.  This time the voice was insistent, persuading, \u201cCome, sip. Use you power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, he remembered who he was and what he could do. If he sipped he would shrink and be entombed forever in the chalice prison of the Clawling. In his weakened desperation, he could feel his strength pulling at his mind to obey.  But some tinge of will kept him resisting. He knew this could be the end\u2026 <i>so what?, Maybe I should. What is there to live for now?</i> he heard as he fought inside himself. My club, if I could only touch my club. He pulled himself out of his reverie and reached for the sword handled club and felt the jeweled bauble at the end.  Power surged through his hand in to his body\u2014just a jolt but enough to clear his thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t. Go away!\u201d he spoke firmly and the vision melted away.<br>\r\n Clawling\u2019s raucous laughter echoed, as if he knew he would win eventually.  Hadn\u2019t  his forces already opened portals to Other world and destroyed most of the Daeraykon, including the seat of government? Few resisters were left\u2026too bad he was one of them, not that he could be that dangerous any more.  He was alone and weak.  Clawling knew this and would keep tempting  him until he succumbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZarsan turned away from the cliff, that,  only moments before had represented a bleak way out of his misery. <br>\r\n\u201cGlad you didn\u2019t give into him!\u201d exclaimed a fierce little voice.  Zarsan turned in the direction of the vice and there crawling out of a hollow stump was a small dwarf-like man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Crispin!\u201d Zarsan was so surprised.<br>\r\n\u201cNo,  afraid not. He\u2019s gone beyond. I\u2019m his brother Thorn and you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI am Zarsan.  Cripsin and I were friends.. I am grieved that he did not make it. So many others didn\u2019t either.\u2019 He wandered, hand tightening on his club.  Then, remembering Thorn. \u201cWhat are you doing here and how did you know\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout your brush with that sinister lout Clawling?  Oh , I am like you in one respect, I too , can discern the presence.  I am the elder twin, you see. Crispin had other gifts but I was doomed with this one.   Clawling has not found me out yet, but he will try. He has vowed and cannot be entirely safe until all who have the power become his minions or perish.  So, I sought you out, figuring that we\u2019d be safer, more effective together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZarsan listened to the tale Thorn was telling and was still bothered by gaps in the story. How could he know if he was telling the truth or a trap.  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you know about me?\u201d he asked, \u201cI have never heard of you before. Were you not in the conflict?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy brother left his memory gem for me. It tells all he perceived.  As a twin, I knew when his life ended and called it to me. I was in other places doing my part. As to never having heard of me, it\u2019s true.  Crispin was under oath never to mention my name or connection for our own safety, his primarily. You see, I was a traveller to Otherworld, which would have been forbidden superstitions. Our father was from that realm\u2014a traveller.  I inherited some of his traits plus the perception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I came of age, my father came back for me.  Crispin wanted to come but it would have been too much for my mother to bear losing both of us, and as he fit rather well with our people, he stayed.  It was told that I had gone away to Ityria for training.  Later, when the wars started with Dag Claw, Otherworlders   stopped coming here and we sent word to Crispin to hush up the connection.  We knew that if Claw was victorious, he would somehow open the gateways and allow the evil of both worlds to combine\u2014with him as Higher Ruler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Our world is not perfect either, but like yours, the evil forces were manageable.  That your world has lost its battle is a sign that Claw has had some other ally.  Yes, it is great sadness that so many were overcome.  Now we must search out the remnant and join forces, my world and yours to prevent the total loss of all creation.  We are two of the keys, you and I, and two others.  You have been saved for this.

I was found to have certain gifts, which my mentor, Teor felt should not be widely known.  <br>\r\nThe sight and this club and an affinity.  I became a counselor of the Wisdom seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do not think it rather odd that neither of your parents had any affinity for these gifts, not their family, or any other children?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think about it much.  Although I was upset for a while,  because it took me away from my parents.  They died before I became of age. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeor never mentioned anything to you about why you might have had thee talents?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. He left me some papers when he died but I have not found them. We were in the midst of the when he went beyond. I have not been back to Ityria. What do you know about it?\u201d Zarsan was beginning to be uneasy as it his world were about to change, yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you see, you are an Otherworlder.\u201d Thorn began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZarsan looked at him with a furrowed brow. \u201cWhat are you talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour parents were born there as you were.  They had connections in Ityria and brought you across as a baby to show you off.  Your father had to meet with the wise council.  Unfortunately, they were killed in an internal storm. You had been left with a nurse in Itryria, and it was decided that you be given adoptive parents here as suspicions about Ityria and the connections with the superstitious Other world became rampant.  Travelling between the two slowed drastically and was almost cut off for years.  When you were old enough, it was thought you would be safer growing up and training in ityria itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs to how I found out, it was rumoured that there was a prophet of sorts in Otherworld with great power in your world, and that, as a babe, you had been a foundling among these people. I did find records in Ityria, and the letters of Teor, and then my brother confirmed it for me.  Now that I have met you I can sense your power for good, much as I felt your wavering during the tempting on the mountain.  You have strong magic and are going to need it if we are to reverse this defeat..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZarsan\u2019s head was spinning with all he had just heard. The funny thing was  that as much as he tried to fight such nonsense and reject it, he was, in fact, getting images  faces, a man and a  woman\u2019s, whom he\u2019d not met before, and in his memory, was recalling some of the doubts and questions he\u2019d had as a youth growing up. He recalled too the urgency of Teor\u2019s last message, which he never had a chance to deliver.  Inside, despite the confusion, he believed it was the truth.  Something rang true deep down.  When he sifted it through, he found he had a lot more questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThorn felt his confusion and put a comforting hand on his , \u201cSorry ,, lad, but you had to know. What destiny has I store we must be prepared for.  There may be surprises enough.  Chosen ones cannot always choose their fate.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n573 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">Martell House</span></span></div></div>",

My mother was strict with me.  There was a time for grazing and a time for walking.  I kept to a strict schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a time when Ned Stark was alive and Cat Stark was present.  Of course, Jon Snow's existence was always a problem.  Jon and Mama Stark did not get along or see eye to eye.  I guess that was because she wasn't his mama.  Ned went off to fight and came back with baby Jon.  Jon fit right in with the Stark children though.  Now, he's off in the Night's Watch fighting monsters and doing God knows what.  I miss him and Arraya most of all the children.  I miss Brandon too and how he used to ride upon me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all changed when King Robert and the Lannisters rode into town.  One day Ned was teaching his children the ways of the world and the next he was forced off to Westeros to be the hand of the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came out to talk to me about it in the pasture one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooves, I don't want to do it,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moo,\" I replied, thinking that if I were him I wouldn't want to do it, either.  He had a nice life here in the pasture.  Nice and settled.  Going off to Westeros would pose dangers that even I could not imagine at the time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNed was very much beloved by his wife and children, inspite of having the bastard son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Ned was a person whose word could be trusted.  He never would have done something sneaky or underhanded.  Of course, he had a bastard son, but that was something that most of the men of a certain stature did.  I don't really understand why, but there you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't like people who deceive.  I think it catches up to them in the long run.  I like to do my best each day and know that was the case.  If I do that, I can let it all go and not worry about it.  The Gods will see me through as I am good of heart and trustworthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, it helps to reminisce about things and how they have changed in my world.  I wish I could turn back time and make all the Starks happy once again.  Of course, that is a dream.  They were never all completely happy.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A new day has dawned, but my mind is always a whirl of jumbled thoughts.  Today I drift into the future into my early days on Writing.Com.  I was but a wee calf of a writer back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce upon a time, way before Game of Thrones,  I went to join Stories.Com, which later became Writing.Com.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe year was 2000.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I first joined this site, I came with a group.  The site was about 9 days old and the only writing we could do was in Interactive Stories like this one.  My group came from a website that wrote fan fiction about a movie.  When we came to write in the Interactive we did not have to go through an editor because we could post our work instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea who ran the site when I first joined.  I just jumped in, created a portfolio so I could write in the Interactive Story called Sam and Josie, I believe and wrote and wrote and wrote.  I wrote literally 100's of pages.  I had so much fun and so did my friends.  We eventually quit going to the other site because we would have to wait months after we submitted our work for the person in charge to post it.  In looking back, I think she was quite mean to some of us, especially the younger writers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point I saw that the Interactive Story briefcase was \"Cool\".  This is the equivalent of what is now being promoted to preferred.  I seem to remember some sort of dark glasses on the briefcase.  I wanted to have that and when we could add items to our portfolio (not to long after joining - maybe a couple of months) it was not long before I was cool,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea who Moderators were or what they did because I never interacted with anyone outside my group until I decided to make a forum for myself.  That was a mistake because soon after I made that forum someone came into it and told me my writing wasn't good and it was all the same thing over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Moderator called <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'themilkman', '', '', '', '40', '', 'OFF', '100014556'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'themilkman', '', '', '', '40', '', 'OFF'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: themilkman\r\nMember Since: December 17th, 2000\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;font-weight:bold;cursor:pointer;\">The Milkman</a></span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/themilkman','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/themilkman\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'themilkman', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  1/22/20', '1/22/20', 'December 17, 2000', '', '', '40', 'Preferred Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-40.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a> came in and defended me and so did SMs and SM.  They were very nice to me.  So, I got over it and branched out and started to read other things besides my groups story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made up my mind then that I would write more than just Fan Fiction about the movie, Never Been Kissed, but I continued to write stories and my popularity grew until I was pretty far up the most viewed list.  I started reading and reviewing more outside of my group and I had a great time doing that.  I tried this thing called The Writing Assignment that was run by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'nlthomps', '', '', '', '10', '', 'OFF', '100018342'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'nlthomps', '', '', '', '10', '', 'OFF'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: nlthomps\r\nMember Since: January 15th, 2001\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">NL*</a></span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/nlthomps','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/nlthomps\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'nlthomps', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  3/17/14', '3/17/14', 'January 15, 2001', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a> and I was a co-winner of the first gift point giving contest on the site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy handle back then was CAROLINELOVESTHEBUS.  I wrote some really racy stuff back in my youth - we called it red ball then, but today it is known as XGC or something like that.  I blush thinking of some of the stuff I wrote in my stories, but it got readers to come to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings went along alright and I didn't pay much attention to site politics until one day in June 2001 when I was promoted to Moderator.  I had no clue, so I wanted to see what was what with that.  Let's just say my feelings were hurt by people who said I couldn't write.  A lot of people, like SMs, <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'nlthomps', '', '', '', '10', '', 'OFF', '100018342'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'nlthomps', '', '', '', '10', '', 'OFF'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: nlthomps\r\nMember Since: January 15th, 2001\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">NL*</a></span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/nlthomps','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/nlthomps\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'nlthomps', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  3/17/14', '3/17/14', 'January 15, 2001', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a> and others defended me, but a lot (who later admitted they hadn't read my stuff because they hated fan fiction) thought my writing was cow pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI overreacted, lets just say that.  I overreacted and was a bit of an ass my own self in my overreacting youthful (compared to now) rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI declined the promotion and wrote some angry rants.  I never named people, but I went off on their behavior in a way that I shouldn't have done.  Sometimes, even a bull like me allows my temper to rule the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also found out that some of my friends in my group were not really my friends.  Oh, they pretended they were, but I saw enough things around then to know that my friends were now allied with the people who wrote terrible things about my writing and about me as a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJealousy is a revealing thing.  When I moved up that list of \"Most Viewed\" the long knives came out for me and some came out in writers who were here because I told them about this site.  Some of them no longer wanted to know me when I was hurt and at my lowest point.  But, the feeling there was mutual.  Later when they tried to butter me up, I had none of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome figured out that I was back as 4provinces, but I kept my identity to myself for a while.  I wanted to prove that I could write and so that is what I did.  I wrote and I wrote and I read everything I could find to read.  A forum called, \"You Should Be Reading This,\" was hosted by Yemassee, the number #1 Most Viewed author for a time.  It was a great place to recommend fine reading and to find great reading.  Yem would feature those of us who frequented our forums and personally recommend us.  A recommendation from him meant a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYem was one of the first people here who encouraged me.  He had no idea who I was, but he read my writing and endorsed me.  That means so much to me, even today.  I am in his debt forever for that.  He had quite a sense of humor and sent me pictures of cuts of meats once I became the hooves personal as a secondary account.  But, I get ahead of myself in my story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYem was a good friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know fair weather friends and allies when I see them.  I know the duplicitious evil that envy engenders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, that was a hot summer, that summer of 2001.  In August I folded my tent and said adios, until I returned to write again in September as 4Ps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the beginning of the modern era for me.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must find something to graze on as I continue to think of the past - recent and not so recent.  The evil duplicity I have seen this weekend reminds me of some of the evil I saw so long ago.  I wonder if the dark days are upon us again.  Winter is Coming and I need a sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1,121 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

I will write more about it on another day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday I will write about the Game of Thrones experience I have had this time and I had last year.  Last year I cheered for another team.  I cheered and wrote a few poems and was very happy and excited to do that.  I felt that way until I read something where one of the team members of the team I was cheering for fussed about cows in the forum.  When I read that I felt embarassed and I sort of quit.  I had, up to that point, cheered a lot, but I didn't feel it anymore so I sadly walked off into the meadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person apologized and all was forgiven, but I did not feel excited anymore so I didn't do much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis past year a lot of things happened.

She was Vampy and Mr. Bones characters, at the time.  Vampy took umbrage (rightly so!) and gave me a good thrashing on the train.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the start of a beautiful friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen later we interacted some more and she invited me to join her remooing group.  Even though I have stayed away from being in a group doing reviews, I felt like it was time to be part of a team.  There was no question of me joining another group.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI considered it, but I had two bad experiences with another bigger reviewing group's members (the one in G.o.T last year and another with a raffle at Christmastime.  So, it was set that I joined PDG at the first of the year.  When I heard they were doing a G.o.T. team I decided to try and compete.  What could I have to lose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am doing my very best to be a credit to my Team.  I guess the human character in Game of Thrones who I want to be like is Tyrion because he does his best even when people expect little or nothing from him.  I don't know if he will prevail, but I think he has a good heart.  I want to play with a good heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'b.meridith', '', '', 'heart_scribble', '60', '', 'OFF', '100287909'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'b.meridith', '', '', 'heart_scribble', '60', '', 'OFF'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: b.meridith\r\nMember Since: November 18th, 2004\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;font-weight:bold;cursor:pointer;\">Brooke-Thanks Anonymous! :)</a></span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/b.meridith','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/b.meridith\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'b.meridith', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Private', '', 'November 18, 2004', '', 'heart_scribble', '60', 'Moderator');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 4px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-heart_scribble-60.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a>'s murder mystery adventures in September, I met <b><a href=\"/main/authors.php?action=search&amp;search_for=lizco252\" target=\"_blank\">lizco252</a></b> also.  She opened my eyes and ears to the music of my life.  It really enhanced my enjoyment of the site, tremendously.  Her Soundtrackers Challenges are a lot of fun.  We find music on a daily basis and write about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore that, since my mother's death in 2005, I listened to maybe 4 CDs over and over again in the car.  I never listened to music at home or on the computer.  Soundtrackers got me to listen to some old Motown, Beatles, and even some Irish music I'd forgotten.  Nine years is a long time to go with just listening to comforting music.  I even bought a couple of Cher CD's this past Fall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will digress and tell you a little about my favorite music I listen to in the Pasture.  First, there is Raglan Road, a poem/song that is Celtic in origin.  It tells a beautiful story about unrequited love.  Lately, I have listened to B.B. King's Stand By Me a lot.  I really like that song and the words to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got rid of Direct TV in March.  I do not miss the cable type channels at all.  We got sick and tired of that Direct TV bill going up and up for no reason.  We cancelled and a week after our refund arrived (it took a month and they did it with a debit card from Citibank) they started sending us invitations to come back at 29.99 a month.  We would have to do automatic debit from our checking account to get that.  I wouldn't let those idiots have access to our bank account, first of all.  Second of all, we were paying, for less than they are now offering almost 80$ a month in fees.  It totally was not worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I watch local free TV, Netflix and Amazon Prime free stuff.  I watch videos.  I don't miss CNN or Fox News, not one bit.   Recently, we went out of town and stayed in a hotel that had cable.  It was not thrilling.  We did watch the Women's College Softball World Series, but I could live without that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will have to wait until February to watch Season 5 of Game of Thrones.  So what?  It gives me something to look forward to in February besides my wedding anniversary and grandson's birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn January next year I will watch the final Season of Downton Abbey on PBS, which is, of course on free tv..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, on Amazon Prime, we are watching The Good Wife.  I had never seen that before.  On Netflix, we watched The Gilmore Girls about 5 times.  I could watch that show for the rest of my life and never get tired of it.   Logan, from The Gilmore Girls, is an important character on The Good Wife.  It is a good show with a lot of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. hooves watches The Walking Dead and I watch Madmen.  We like our shows.  I digressed a lot here, but that will happen as my Interactive Story will have a lot of mind wandering.  That is what happens when a bull is in the field alone on a sunny day outside of Westeros.  I think about things.  I write about things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1,017 Words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

If you stand by me, you had better not stand too close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am feeling very lost at the moment.  I always thought if I do my best I will feel good about things.  What if you do your best and it doesn't matter.  Well, it matters to me.  I guess in any quest or undertaking there are low times.  Eight days into the month of June, I'm having a low time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get the feeling I was betrayed big time.  I do not know the particulars, but I think it happened.  I can feel that sort of thing when it happens.  I have a sort of sixth sense about it after the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to get my car inspected this month.  What a ripoff.  I don't think those inspections really mean a thing.  What a pain in the hindquarters to have to do that and it is not cheap here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Game of Thrones on TV was written up in Entertainment Weekly.  Yes, I get that magazine.  They practically pay me to subscribe to it.  It used to have good reviews there by Stephen King in a regular column.  He left and it because someone juvenile in tone, but I still like reading the book reviews.  Sometimes I find good books in there before they win the Pulitzer Prize.  It is how I found The Goldfinch, All the Light We Cannot See, and The Girl on the Train.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading has not been as productive for me this year off line.  I cannot seem to focus much.  I finished The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.  I think that had such a profound impact on me that I cannot get past it.  I wrote a story based on that (sort of) dealing with Cat dealing with the invasion of Poland.  It was called Othello's Adjustment.  I worked really hard on the story and I got a terrific review, but a couple of the reviews didn't take what I tried to do in there seriously.  I have felt defeated ever since as a writer.  It just makes me want to stop and cry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I will carry on and do what I committed to do.  I do not understand not doing that, except if there is illness that prevents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you do your best and it doesn't count, what then?  I don't know, quite honestly.  You continue to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are characters in Game of Thrones, like Tyrion for instance, who have undeserved cow pies thrown at them all the time.  They can either be proactive or reactive.  It is much safer to be reactive.  I will try and keep my mouth shut no matter what.  In The Good Wife they say things are the Chicago Way.  I don't think I would like it in Chicago, but I'm not sure anywhere else is much different.  They seem to be more honest about what they are doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat about when someone uses what they know about you to further something that is against your interest.  It is all in the name of \"fun\" sometimes, but it still hurts.  I see what I see and I know what I know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth is a funny thing because it persists despite cloudy hazes.  The truth will inform us and set us free to be ourselves if we listen.  It is a hard thing to do, to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must listen if I am to survive this painful experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 590 Words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In an effort to update you on my time travels, my journey from the pasture to modern times took me to Kohl's yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I told Mr. hooves, there are no bad surprises at Kohl's only good ones.  I have four things I had to show at the register, Credit Card, Some Rewards Card I got at the beginning of the year, 20% off for Friends and Family and a 10$ off Certificate thing that was emailed to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were returning some shoes that Mr. hooves got a couple of weeks ago.  He wore them once and they pinched his feet, so he was looking for a larger size.  Mr. hooves gathers many boxes of shoes to try them on, piling them up.  He does this the same way he eats crabs.  He picks all the stuff out of all the crabs before he eats anything.  With shoes, he hunts and gathers all possibilites and stacks them next to me.  I take the paper out of the shoes and make sure there are no sharp objects in them.  Last time we shopped for shoes at Kohls there was a loose thing resembling a big thumbtack in the heel of one of the shoes.  We are on our guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. hooves selected the winner (after a lot of trying on) and we went to look at socks next.  He told me he wanted short, white golf socks.  I looked around and found a five pack of gold toe socks.  The price on them said $17.00, but the price is never the final price at Kohls so I urged him to scan.  He did and price came up, \"Clearance - $1.70\"  With 20% off we were looking at five pairs of socks for $1.30.  We couldn't believe it, but it was true.  This emboldened Mr. hooves to find another pair of shoes.  He found a $70 pair for $29.99, again with another 20% off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were happy campers as we realized, at the register, that Mr. hooves had returned a pair of shoes and repurchased two pairs of shoes and five pairs of socks for just about 13$ more than the original purchase price of the rejected shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is something about shopping at Kohl's that gets me out of my pasture every time.  It is challenging like the Game of Thrones and this time it was very rewarding and pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe will leave the pasture to go back soon in preparation for Father's Day Celebrations!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 440 Words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

That was a wild scene.  Did you know that Rob Stark's wife was played by Oona Chaplin, Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter.  I love Charlie Chaplin.  I learned a lot about him that I didn't know before.  He has ties to everything in Hollywood, a silent era Kevin Bacon of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie Chaplin had an absentee father and his mother was in and out of the nuthouse in London.  When she went \"away\", Charlie had to go to the orphanage with his brother.  Think about how bleak that must have been for the little guy.  He was the first to write, Direct, produce and act in and write music for his own films.  They take liberties with the facts, but the biographical film of him starring Robert Downey Jr is quite something.  I really enjoyed that film and it made me want to learn more about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother cool fact about Chaplin is that he stood up to Hitler.  Hitler had a Charlie Chaplin moustache, not the opposite.  So, when Chaplin ridiculed Hitler in the Great Dictator (around 1940) Hitler put Chaplin on his \"kill\" list.  If Germany had won the war, Chaplin would have been toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hoof aches today for some reason.  I was tormented in the night, and did not sleep well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes, I will take my trusty Basset Hound with me on my travels.  Her name is, Boo, and she is a great one to sniff out anything that has an odor.  Most people do have a specific scent, you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so deflated and depressed yesterday, but today I feel unexplicably better.  I am still confused about some rules, but that will become clearer as the days progress.  I know it will.  This is as close to organized chaos as I want to get in my lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInch by inch, row by row.  Going to make my garden grow.  Little by little, I will write about what I am thinking and imagining.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would not want an invitation to a Wedding on Game of Thrones.  Bad things seem to happen at weddings.  Bad things can happen at real life weddings too.  I think big events can turn on a dime into horrible tragedies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGive me a nice justice of the peace private wedding any old day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 405 Words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so it goes.  I hope this is my lowest point in Game of Thrones because I do not remember a darker time in my days here besides summer of 2001.   Summer of 2001 ended with me deleting myself in August.  I do not want to have a big blow up because I am exhausted and worn out.  Back then I had someone who had a drinking/meds issue badgering me at all hours of the day and night, so combined with little to no sleep, I was provoked and flew off the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do not respond well to being told, inferred, suggested that my best isn't good enough this past weekend.  I am really quite steamed about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder if anyone will read all these meanderings.  I guess they will discover something if they do.  If I delete 4provinces there is always the secondary thing.  Yes, that's me there.  All the others have scampered off into the mist.  I am the one guarding that gate and paying whatever needs to be paid, which I am happy to do.  I could just quietly go there I think at this point in time.   Don't know what I'm talking about?  Well, think about it and I think you might figure it out someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, today is June 10.  The good thing is Mr. hooves and I walked our pup this morning.  We had a lot of fun doing that.  Our pup was good  A speeding motorist going to fast got yelled at by us and then he was stuck at a stop sign so we could laugh at him.  Poetic justice prevailed there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan I just write about modern Motor Vehicle Administrations.  What a ripoff!  We have to get our cars inspected in June and Mr. hooves has jury duty.  I mailed in the blessed (not really) registration moola and forms about a month ago.  It will be a month in two days and our incompetent tax paid state employees cannot process the payment for two cars in 30 days.  I guess it is too taxing for them.  Get it?  Game of Thrones Humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have learned over the years not to combine anything else with the Inspection.  That is a sure way to jack up the bill to a lot of unnecessary cow pies.  We had the oil changed on my car, along with the transmission fluid changed, with is an enormous ripoff there in March.  I have driven less than 2,000 miles since then so the car will not need another oil change until September and it probably won't need another transmission change in my lifetime.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are letting the AAA repair center do the Inspection because it is less than a mile from our castle royal.  They really messed up my car a while back so that I learned my lesson on it.  If I want to be ripped off, I take it to the Toyota Dealer (about 3 miles away) where I know the car will at least run.  AAA has a habit of pulling on wires and disconnecting things like batteries that are kind of important.  But to just do an inspection I guess we will trust them this once and see.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing I learned is to take a folder with me showing dates of all repairs and services when I go for oil changes.  This is where they try to say dumb things need doing like transmission fluid replacement.  They do that a lot, although a mechanic told me that the transmission only needs to be replaced every 60,000 miles or so.  If the Toyota Dealer here sees they haven't done it, they say it needs it.  They did mine after only 14,000 miles and I called them on it and Mr. hooves screamed at them.

I am not into violence, but I think beheading is a good deterrent for ripoff vehicle repair guys and gals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun is warm today.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another day in the pasture.  Swords are flashing in the distance.  I have to keep my own council at the moment as my plans are very secret and secure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am someone who observes and takes note of behavior patterns.  I see things that perhaps others, who are human, might not notice.  There is always the potential to be wrong as one prepares for the battle royal for the throne.  Since I, as an individual bull, will not sit on the throne, you might ask what is in it for me.  This is what I had to figure out.  It is better for me to get back to what I enjoy, which is reading and reviewing and rewarding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrategy is not my strong suit.  Win or lose, I know what I won't be doing this time next year.   Live and learn, I guess.  I don't enjoy plotting and reacting to what I see as plotting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the modern day times, many centuries after this is all forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, mr. hooves has jury duty next week.  We got our cars inspected this week, which is good.  Now, the stupid Motor Vehicle Department just has to send the stickers for our license tags.  I sent in the check on May 12.  What are they waiting for?  I guess is is hard to process and figure out a payment for two cars but that's why we pay property taxes so they can be paid the big bucks, right?  I set up the 15th as the day next week that I'll throw a fit on the phone if I don't get anything in the mail.  Then, I'll go in to the local office (about 10 minutes from here) on the 22nd and throw an in person fit.  I can hardly wait to vent my spleen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to family issues.  Sigh.  Without my parents the whole thing has crumbled.  Their eldest grandchild has been dead almost four years.  My parents never could have endured that loss.  So, there is a reunion of sorts on the 4th of July.  I won't be there.  My brother says he wants me there, but I don't really think anyone else does.  I would have to get a hotel room and it's just not worth it to me right now to do it to my dog.  She would have to board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I wll be here judging the site contest and probably watching the fireworks on PBS at a Capital 4th.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am happy that Mr. hooves is doing well.  Four years ago he almost didn't make it because of Veteran's Administration Doctors who committed major malpractice upon him.  It was horrible one night when they told me that he had a 20% of surviving that night's surgery, but he did and God bless the non-VA doctors who saved him - he's still here.  The anniversary of the first awful surgery just passed on 6/6.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hate the V.A. medical team scumbag rubbish that lied to us that summer.  I have many dark thoughts about their lying selves.  I would like an Army of invaders to go and punish every medical staff person who has ever been mean or thoughtless or worse to a veteran.   But, now, 4 years later VA is a disgrace everyone knows about.  That is something, but someday maybe a President will seriously tackle straightening that house of horrors out.  There is a lot of lying and evil in the Veteran's Administration Hospital we used.  I spent a lot of time there and I saw how they treat veterans and it isn't pretty and it isn't right.   Plus, in summer, the elevators did not work right.  Imagine that when someone is critically ill on the 7th friggin floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI may write more about the V.A.  With game of thrones, the medical care was more straightforward.  I don't know what I would do to punish people who are mean to those who fight their battles, but I have some ideas that I'll keep to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, there are good things in my world today.  Mr. hooves always says things like if game strategy is my worst problem today (and it pretty much is) then we are doing okay.  We are okay and so is our pup and I'm grateful for that.  I'm going to do what I can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'deadzone', '', '', 'eyes', '60', '', 'OFF', '100877101'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'deadzone', '', '', 'eyes', '60', '', 'OFF'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: deadzone\r\nMember Since: April 25th, 2011\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;font-weight:bold;cursor:pointer;\">Angus</a></span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/deadzone','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/deadzone\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'deadzone', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Yesterday', 'Yesterday', 'April 25, 2011', '', 'eyes', '60', 'Moderator');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 4px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-eyes-60.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a>'s birthday on another team.

I am going to have a new direction as of today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night, at my lowest point probably, I got this email saying last weekend our game of throne butts were kicked?  What?  Saying that to me at this juncture is not a motivator.   It is browbeating me and highly unnecessary.  I have no idea how we did, but I know that I, personally, put forth a best effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I don't think it is true or makes sense.   I did not and have not seen any validated facts or figures to back up that claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, I think all the teams might have been told they were behind some others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, why beat up on ourselves?  I took that butt kick remark quite personally since I worked hard all weekend sending a lot of reviews.  I am sick and tired of being told that what I did last weekend wasn't good enough.  Anybody who sends me that kind of nonsense from hereon in, I'm going to ignore.  I figure why give anyone the satisfaction of throwing a fit.  I will just keep my head down and soldier on without excuses doing what I committed to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean really, review more than I did and then you can get in my face about my performance.  I was ashamed, at first, because I thought I'd failed to produce enough reviews there.  That was not the case by a long shot, if comparisons are made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd offering me a bunch of carrots at this point isn't an incentive because I don't believe they will ever materialize.  There is some serious reevaluation that will take place in July, which is coincidentally my birthday month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy strategy is to work hard.  Maybe that is dumb, but it's all that makes any sense to me in this world.  Work hard and follow the rules if you can understand them.  If you can't understand them, it's because they are meant to be confusing.   What can one do with that?  Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuly is also the month that hooves becomes tHiNg.  tHiNg is much diferent than hooves.  tHiNg should have been the one in this game.   I just don't get it sometimes when it comes to behaviors here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the swords flash and the band plays on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYesterday, I went back to listening to my Coors CD in the car.  It was quite a soothing experience.  We went out to dinner with my big group  of 7 of us for some nice sandwiches.  I wasn't the main course there, so I could relax and kick back.  We even talked about books.  If you are so bored you are reading this, I have a book recommendation for you and that is Paula Hawkins' The Girl on the Train.  It is fabulous.  Those of us who read it were raving about it at dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome fathers Day shopping and Birthday shopping for mr. hooves also took place yesterday at Kohls.  They sent me a 30% off coupon and with the 8$ off for 8 years having a charge with them, $10 Kohl's Cash I got about 190$ worth of discount.  Plus I got 20$ more in Kohl's cash and a special additional coupon for 10$ off too.  I found quite a few things for Mr. hooves so it was a good outing even though it was a terribly hot afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun really bakes me as I go out to graze and time travel back in time.  Did you know that Game of Thrones was filmed outside of Belfast, Northern Ireland?  I would love to go there and see the filming even from a distance, but we could not bear to leave our dog for such a long time boarding.  My heart would break and I wouldn't be able to enjoy it like I want to.  Ireland is such a beautiful and majestic place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could graze there forever under the moon and stars, calming my troubled soul.  \"This too shall pass hooves, my lad,\" says tHiNg.   Now I am talking to myself so it is troubling in more ways  than you might think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 708 Words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, that happy occasion did happen in the 4th Season of Game of Thrones.  Can you say dance on his grave?  I did that happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what I'm referring to is a cataclysmic event that changed my whole outlook.  Get ready for it.  You ready?  I can't believe anyone would bother to read this drivel and apologies to geja if you actually have hung in there and are still reading my whining endlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYesterday, I had a pain.  Not just any pain, a really bad stabbing pain in my back.  This is alarming because my spine is held together by hardware on that side, complete with bonegrafts after seven hours of surgery in 2008.  I took two tylenol and rested and today it is better.  I do not know what I did or what is happening, but that was a wake up call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, if I'm not careful, could be something that I cannot survive.  On my other side, I have an artificial hip thanks to 2013's surgery event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that made me face the music and realize something. I have to have a break now and then.  This should be enjoyable and it is up to me to find a way to make it that way or not do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will keep trying with a lot of stretching breaks, but no more sitting at the computer for 5 hours at a time doing remoos.  I hope I can keep getting up and moving around.  I don't know what I am so tormented about anyway.  I have to learn to do my best and let it go and ignore things that come my way from the herd (like cow pies).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to listen to the music in a few.

Their voices rose as one, exuberant and exultant. The atmosphere was festive, though tinged ever so slightly with fear. The man in the red silk paid no heed to the music riveting the other celebrants. His eyes were downcast, focused on the grave. He danced to his own time signature, and muttered words no other could hear, even if they had been attuned to them. If his words failed, their fate was sealed. He carried on, bare feet stomping and arms swaying, out of sync with the rest of the revelers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde haired woman in the silver gown rejoined him at last.  Her dancing mirrored his own, and like a reflection in a mirror, neither image touched the other.

Together, they twirled faster and faster, as if something wicked nipped at their heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night wore on, and the triumphant dancers faded away, exhausted by the frivolity.

I have read that it is being compared to Downton Abbey, but there is no (in my opinion) comparison.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe started watching Downton Again for the umpteenth time on Amazon Prime because we felt that it would better track where we are in the watching as we fall asleep doing it.  It is free (included in the Prime Membership) so why not.  We were too lazy to break out the disks and keep track because of the heat I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething quite odd happened at Kohl's that I will write about here.  See what I meant about get out while you can?  Do you really want to read about a bull's shopping adventures at Kohl's?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bought four things and a Barnes and Nobles gift card.  I got two tops and two skimmer shorts for my husky hindquarters to fit into, if you must know.  Well, of course, at the register there was confusion because I couldn't locate my rewards card.  I had a 30% off thing and the credit card and couldn't find the rewards card.   There are so many things to scan at Kohl's - so much savings to enjoy!  Well, I found the card in my cavernous purse and showed it and said I didn't want the hangers for the skimmer shorts and we were all set.  But something didn't sit right with me about the total.  It seemed low, even for Kohl's with all the savings you get.  Plus, I didn't earn any Kohl's cash and was confused about that.  My thoughts were swirling in my brain as I drove home (about a ten minute drive, not far).  When i got home, Mr. hooves and I looked through the receipts and discovered that the sales clerk had neglected to charge me for one pair of the skimmer shorts.  We looked and looked, but that was our conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohl's has been very good to me as a customer, so I could not let that lie.  So, I got all my things together in the bag and drove back to show the receipt to the customer service guy and tell him I wasn't charged for one of the things I bought.  He was very nice and told me that he wished there were more people in the world like me.  I told him I did not want the sales clerk to get into trouble because the confusion was on my end, not hers.  He said she wouldn't and I have to trust him on that.  I paid for my skimmer shorts and drove home the second time with a clearer mind about the whole thiing.  I could not live with the free skimmer shorts on my hindquarters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you know why I wrote get out while you can in the reading of this.  Until next we meet at Kohl's.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 805 Words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosted June 14, 2015</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>June is a funny month.  I don't mean funny as in funny ha ha.  I mean odd.  The days get longer and longer until around the 21st and then the amount of sunlight starts to shrink.  We are having a heatwave in my pasture, but when next week comes and that amount of daylight starts to wane, I know that Winter is Coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will write now about something that chaps my hide under the blistering sun.  I do not like it when people commit themselves to do something and other people depend on them and then they don't do what they committed to do and act like it is nothing.  It is not nothing.  It is a sure sign of lack of character in a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there are things that are valid excuses (sickness, family problems, etc)  but I had to go to the grocery store is not a valid excuse.  It is pathetic and rude.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should have planned better to go to the grocery store/supercenter when you hadn't committed yourself to do something else.  Simple as that.  If your stupid underlng who you blame (can't blame old #1 because you are never wrong are you?)  can't do it, you should do it yourself since you are the one who committed.  You know who you are.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am sure you are exemplary in everything else that you do in life.  No, that is a lie.  I am sure this is part of a sorry pattern and you do it every day and then you have the nerve to have an attitude about it.  Poor everyone who has to deal with your pathetic, infantile behaviors.  I pray for the future of this country, I really do.  But maybe you already are harvesting the fruits of your shortcomings in the state of emergency you live in.  If you have children, I feel sorry for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAw well.  Another day another disappointment in the herd.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow will truly be the halfway mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn to what happened to my Motor Vehicle Administration fiasco.  Today is show and tell day.  On Saturday in the mail I received my documents and check sent back to me because I didn't get an inspection before sending the darned thing in.  Nowhere in the instructions does it say you have to get the inspection first.  It just says I have to get the inspections before the end of June.  We (mr. hooves) got them done June 9 and June 10, but I mailed in the check and paperwork on May 12.  The morons at motor vehicles took a whole month to process this.  What are they doing there, brain surgery on the side?  Why did it take a month to let me know anything?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will go in in person today and maybe write to the governor if I have the energy.  He needs a new figure head to lead up Motor Vehicles who can get something done in less time than a month.    I think if I were in charge I would fire everyone I've ever seen or dealt with there.  You would not believe the behavior I saw a while back when I had to go into the place to get a new Driver's license.  Sheesh.  It was party time with long lines!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 550 Words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosted June 15, 2015</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oh joy.  Now I get to vent my spleen about actually going to two government offices this morning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, I went to the post office to mail something to my niece's husband for his birthday.  Of course there is a long line and of course in front of me are people who have to share every detail of their existence with the postal clerk.  There are at least four postal clerks who are there, but at least one is doing something else all the time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is true no matter how long the line is and no matter what time of year.  Tax time, Christmas time, any busy time - you will find no more than three clerks actually \"helping\" people.  One guy is actually quite helpful, the other two, not so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I waited for Citizen Pain to tell the clerk the story of her life and all her residences and postal experiences over the years while the line grows.  Then when she has to pay, she has to fiddle around in a cavernous purse to find her debit card that she doesn't know how to use.  The clerk has to help her with that too.  You would think I'm talking about someone quite elderly, but I am actually talking about a person who looked to be at the oldest maybe 35.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy cash transaction with no storytelling on my part took about two minutes.  It only took that long because I had to press the screen to say I wasn't sending anything hazardous, etc in my paper thin, smallest envelope they make.  Yeh, I'm sending the agreement with Iran in there, top secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this joyous encounter, I girded my loins for the DMV, which is about ten minutes from the Post Office.  These hell holes couldn't be close together because all that government inefficiency would clog up the traffic too much.  They have to be conveniently far apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, there I am.  There are two lines a front and a back line.  I am in the back line behind a guy who has a filtered resemblance to Jeff Bridges in a biker movie with a lot of paraphenalia and tattoos and sleeveless outfit so we can all see.  This person appears to be in his fifties from the lines on his torso and the gray hair and delightful missing teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should come in to join him, but his lady fair.  I will not describe her as it is too gross, except to say then they started to hug and tug and make out right there in the DMV place with about 40 people waiting in the two lines. Of course, I get these two geniuses next to me.  The woman is 50 if she is a day and she outweighs me by a lot.  She could take me in a fight I have no doubt so I have to zip my lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman in front of them is making a bid deal at the window about the same stupid thing that happened to me - sending in your stuff and getting your inspection later.  She's really telling them off loudly and I am enjoying that.  It almost makes up for standing next to this loser version of Romeo and Juliet.

It feels like flames are licking my body and my temperature is all rising.

I love when Angela Landsbury makes her grand entrance in Mame.  I could sweep down a staircase, too.  Then there is the movie Hello Dolly with Barbara Streisand.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There came something across the meadow, howling at the moon.  Oh yes, it is the direwolf leading me to wind my story back to the country of my origin, the place where Game of Thrones (part of it anyway) is filmed.  That would be Ireland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day I returned to my native land.  This was after I was transported forward in time to the year 2005.  It was December.  I flew in a giant Aer Lingus plane from Boston to Shannon, Ireland.  The hillsides were alive with grazing sheep and cattle as I landed in the early morning hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI carried with me a heavy mantle of grief and pain that is always with me through the centuries.  When one loses ones loved ones as I have done, you feel the loneliness quite keenly.  This is all the more painful for me around Christmastime as I lost both my parents close to Christmas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy travels this time took me to Westport, Galway, the Dingle Peninsula and then to Adare.  In Adare I went walking one winter's day.  All the leaves were brown.  And the sky was gray.  It was foggy and the village streets were clouded with a heavy mist.  I knew somehow I would find my brethren as I walked, and so I did.  I turned a corner, as if drawn to them by a siren's song.  There they were, a fine bovine herd grazing in the earling morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a lot of fine music on that trip, in pubs and in the streets of Westport.  There was no more welcome sound than those early morning moos.  An old man I passed on the street, called me, \"english\".  He appeared to be suffering from some sort of confused anxiety or dementia.  I am no more English then he was.  Maybe, he felt that I was different and as a time traveling bovine, so I am.  I am very different.  As we passed one another, I deliberately passed gas.  I confess this because I feel a certain triumphant guilt about it.  Things happen.  I forgive myself.  He deserved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I work hard for my herd and for my team, I am me, first, last and always.  I am not perfect.  In fact, I have a jealous streak and I am quite competitive when the mood strikes me.   I will carry my mantle and do what is right no matter what comes my way.    I can fight any bull in the pasture, but it must be on my terms.  I lower my horns and charge and pray for the best that is to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany a noble steed has met their ending in the Game of Thrones.  Whether it was on a Belfast filming set or somewhere in the fictitious Westeros, there have been some awful deaths.  Don't get me started on the Dothracki and their antics.  Daernys and those dragons are cool, but Kal Drogo was pretty shocking to me.    I know I will survive to live, graze and even dance another day.  How do I know this?  I am an old soul, who has survived for centuries, traveling through the shrouded mists of time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you look in any film that features bulls, you will see the eyes of hooves.  In Hemingway's writing, I'm always there, nodding to the great man.  No boundary can keep me in.  I fly on the wings of the raven and I charge into the fray.  Aligned with the Stark family, I know that right and goodness are with me.  These traits will carry us through to tomorrow and beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I travel, I need no credit card.  My credit is in the wink of an eye and the low melifluous moo of my calling.  I bring peace to the countryside in my open face and steadfast ways.  You might think, at times, that I am a reviewing machine.  This is what I was meant to do, to write, to communicate with others via this modern day invention called a computer.  My hooves type like the wind as I convey my heart's deepest fears and wildest hopes and fantasies.  I will carry you with me to Ireland, to Westeros, to Broadway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am show tunes.  I am music and I write the songs.  Barry Manilow stole that from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes.  I am a one bull show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBravo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo not go gentle into that good night for I will find you and I will force you to do what is right and fair.  I see you with your pride that goes before the fall.  Do you know what that means?  I would not wave your banner so high and mighty in the face of adversity that comes from the hunger and pain of a noble family.  This is not Downton Abbey.  There is no Lady Sybil to campaign for what is right and fair.  There is only us, the lowly rabble to contend with.  We do everything we can to emerge victorious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am Lady Sybil.  I am Spartacus.  I am probably trying to combine every movie and Television show I've ever seen into this Interactive story, but it is my feverish imagination and it is original and it is fine.  I am Seinfeld.  How about that?  I am George Costanza, with his secret weapon of wishing for the opposite of what he truly wants.  My deductive powers are beyond imagining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI babble on in my feverish rantings, but the end is near.  I can feel the yoke of centuries being lifted from my haunches.  Things will work out for the Starks, or they won't.  If they don't work out, it won't be because hooves didn't give it his best.  Now, speaking of myself in the third person, I fear failure just like any other mortal bull.  We all fear failure and we all have our challenges.  Do your best and at the end of the day you can hold your head up high and sing show tunes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI won't dance right now.  Don't ask me.  Night has fallen and my song is through.  Maybe tomorrow my hooves will move with the grace of the faeries and I will entrance you with my dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count  = 1,032 Words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check5.png\" alt=\"*Check5*\" title=\"Check5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdded June 16, 2015</span></div></div>",

They were so excited and a little nervous. Most of the creatures that attended were bigger than they were and the heifer had wonderful if big hooves. He was light on his feet but they would need to make sure that little ones watched where they tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Teena and Tona had met Hooves in the pasture one day while dusting the flowers and clover.  They knew right away that he was no ordinary cow and had as sort of magic and imagination beyond others of his kind. Fairies like all creatures and can get along with most and it was no different with Hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked of many interesting things and shared concern over what was happening with the battles between the great castles and the destruction of pasture and woodlands. Humans tend not to think ahead in their press for glory and riches, or to protect what is theirs. Fairies like when everyone can play fair and all win. Fun and uniqueness is the name of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, when they met, Piper came along and played his flute. It was then the meadow came alive and they saw Hooves make his moves, dancing in the field. It was wonderful, the clopping this way and that in a line dance and then leaping like a ballerina and he did not even need tights!  Teena and Tona flitted and flirted around him until they all fell laughing on to the green clover bed.   A few passing onlookers from the fairy and animal clans clapped in delight. They had heard Piper's music and cam down to enjoy the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was awhile ago before the Great Houses went to war and the Starks swooped up the bovines and home and headed for safer place.  So when the word got round that Hooves was coming back (from travels to somewhere called Broadway} everyone was excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparations were being made for the dance already, but now they shifted the venue to a flatter piece of green , just outside the woods. The main buffet and sitting area was still in the woods, so if folks noticed anything and came to investigate, they could hide. and all they would see was Hooves, a grazing cow. They wanted Hooves to have lots of room to maneooover with the other creatures who would be dancing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper and the crickets, grasshoppers and owls were getting in tune. Tree sprites had coaxed the fireflies into the fairy lanterns to hang in the trees.  All of the animals brought a selection of foods as they liked and the rule was no one could eat each other. They had to get Bear and Moose to carry the bale of hay for Hooves' meal. Though he could graze all he wanted, they wanted Hooves to feel like a part of the family and a guest at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was setting and all was in readiness as the first creatures began to arrive. As the stars rose, they could see a shadow sauntering forward from the horizon.  Could it be Hooves? He was still a ways off but it definitely had his silhouette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the full moon rose, Piper began to play and fairies twirled around in the air.  Rabbit and coyote paired up for a Catch as Can dance, not wearing pants.  Bear rubbed a tree as he did the Jive. The deer and moose jerked their horns and heads in unison from side to side to the beat, getting ready for the chorus line Hooves would lead. Porcupines paired each other as no one else would and spun in the Quill and Spill dance they had created.   Raccoon did the Slide by himself, keeping on eye on the treats, ready to sneak some if he slid too far. Skunk and his partner kept a distance from the others in case he had an accident.  They enjoyed the Dance of the Two- toned Tails  while the ground hogs did the Boss A NOOOva . Ravens, crows and other bird friends went Hop Hop Bopping along while the Owl hooted with the fairy and cricket band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dance was in full swing when Hooves made it to the clearing. He was already moving his tail as he heard the music from afar.  Teena and Tona went to greet him and each sat on one ear, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music came to an end and everyone looked at Hooves with welcoming hiya's. They all stepped out to make a circle around the dance field and Hooves took his place with the Moose and deer to begin the chorus line.  Piper began a rousing tune and everyone began to sway and kick and flit and had a ball, even when feet kicked this way instead of that and tripping became a trick. Laughter, hoots, caws, grrs, gaffaws, were the order of the night.  They were glad they had moved the dance area away from the trees and food or injuries might have occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the music stopped, they sat and watched their guest Hooves perform his renowned  minuette with the fairies. Hooves happily danced without pants to his heart's content and when it ended, everyone applauded and wanted to join Hooves in another foot stomping hoe down song.  Everyone got in the swing, except Raccoon, who could simply not wait any longer and snuck away for a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, everyone followed suit and as the sun began to rise, the party broke up and everyone drifted off to their homes. The fairies stayed the night with Hooves in the pasture, and they all thought it was the best Dance Without Pants in the Moonlight Event ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n972 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">House Martell</span></span></div></div>",

Where the heck was he?\" he pondered as he looked around this strange place.  He was in a park so he recognized trees and grass and....sky...and that was about it.  Humans he saw but what weird looking outfits and ...well..really is that blue hair?  There must be wizards here.\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ruffled his feathers and hopped around on the grass to uncrease his body and being. He caught a bug while he was at it.  Might as well eat as he pondered what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hopped over to a seat made of metal and noticed a man, grubby as a soldier laying on it. A large scroll like paper was placed over his head.  Raven hopped up on the arm of the seat and peered at the scroll. A date caught his eye.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n2015!!  The future!  That stark creature has sent me ahead in time.?  No wonder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leapt from the seat and flew over to another stone statue--perhaps it was a gravestone.  Interesting . It was a man on a horse in some sort of outfit.  maybe a futuristic battle outfit. From there he could see even more outlandish things on wheels travelling faster than horses. and structures that were taller than any castle and blocked the sun.He flew up to investigate. He looked right in and whammed right into an invisible glass. It took him a minute to recover midair! CAAAAAWWWWW.! What magic is this?  He landed with a little thud on a very hard surface and was almost stepped on by a woman with spikes on her shoes.  He had to keep hopping around as people pushed by each other so fast  and if he went too far over, those speeding machines would run him down for sure.  Weren't there any other creatures here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruff, rufff, grr.\" oh great! He looked up. What on earth was that?  A tiny furry barking....carried by that woman in spikes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" A dog\"   a caw came out of nowhere.  Raven looked up on the tent over a doorway to see a Crow watching him with a smirk.  He flew up and joined him. \"Oh, really.  not like any dog I have ever seen.  More like a cat.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmm, new to these parts, are ya?\" Crow asked, giving him the once over and grinning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, yes, actually , just today. What is this place? Do you live here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, for years.  It is called Broadway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does not look broad to me. Narrow walks and buildings together. and too many people squished in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh it is the name of the town, not the space.  You get used to it and it is a great place for us to get good eats and you should see how it shines at night.  All the twinkles we crows are fond of.  Don't even need to steal them. They are there every night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really.\" Raven perked up. He did like shining things.  \"how..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they say the stars come out on Broadway. But they are not white like our stars. And You would not even know it was night sometimes with all the light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"is it magic?  Does a wizard make it happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't know about such things!  You are a strange one, you are.Where did you say you were from?\" Crow looked at him once more. \"The country probably, a hick no doubt.  So I suppose what you see here might be called magic.\" He did not want to think about that too much as Crows have long memories, and he recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"er..well..you might say that.\"  Raven considered his answer. \"I'd sure like to see the shiny things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hang around with me then. I am for a meal so watch and learn.\" Crow flew down and picked up a piece of food from a large tin can.  \"See. Easy.\"  Raven was intrigued and went over and peeked in.  Wow. It was certainly a variety of treats.  He snatched a piece of burger.  \"mmm! That will fill me up for a week. \" he cawed with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\"<br>\r\n\"We wait for night fall and you'll see. Let's rest in that tree for now. You can watch it all from there, safely.\" Crow suggested.<br>\r\nRaven sat and thought while Crow went silent. <i>What was he doing? he should be figuring out a way back--to his time.  Martell house needed him. There must be a way.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must you think so loudly?\" Crow interrupted his thoughts. \"I knew there was something odd, yet familiar about you.  From the past, eh? Some wizard trick, I  imagine. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  you knew....? \"Raven was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at first. Just thought you were a country bumpkin. I meet alot of them. Not much brain. But you seemed different and then when you mentioned a wizard...mmm.. not much talk of that any more.  So I thought I would just listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were feigning sleep?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart one aren't you?  You would  have known it too had you not been so busy being distracted here. It is how you lose who you are and forget....which is what that sneaky wizard would want to happen. so you never find your way back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a way back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"on yes, and lucky for you, I am here to show the way.  I have been waiting a long time, stuck here in this world. er..well I have enjoyed it. But we had more power and brilliance back then...in your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you...you are from my time?\"  Raven was amazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, likely before your time.  I too was transported by such a wizard . One other was with me.  I watched as he lost his way and became ordinary.  We parted ways. I was lucky to find the way back, but then had a dream.  About you.  And knew my calling was to remain and wait--for you are vital to the battle and must return. I believe all our times depend upon it.\"  he stressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...well, they tell a story of such a one as you but we thought it just a tale.\" Raven said. \"So you will help me get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and we begin now. See it is sunset and the twinkles are coming on. We must fly down to one of the play houses and watch a show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You mean like one of those travelling minstrel shows that come to the castle? Here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, but close enough. They do plays on stage and there is one show that has what we need. <br>\r\nWe will have to hurry and fly in when the door opens before that guard attendant shoos us. I will tell you what you must do in case we get separated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean these shows have guards as castles do? What are they protecting?\" Raven was intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not really like that. People pay to get in and they don't let creatures in or people who want to bother the performers, who are famous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the riff raff! I get it.\"  Raven said, happy to finally understand something about this world. \"but , wait,<br>\r\nwhat will happen to you? Will you return with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I doubt I can now, and would not want to. Life is harder there and I am aged. Still, we will see what fate has for us. A prophet rarely sees his own. You know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Raven mused. Was he not the one to \"see\" what others could not, yet in he walked to a trap! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" Crow motioned with his wing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven's eyes widened to take in the spectacular display of lights of all coloured signs that lit up the buildings. BROADWAY in neon flashes. \"Wow, it is so magical!\" I will always remember\" Raven murmurred.  \"but I am ready to go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow nodded and said. \"Then let's go!\" and flew down to the theatre now opening its doors---the back doors were the easiest.  It stood ajar and the doorman was smoking a cigarette a foot away from it.  it was just enough of a space for the two birds to hop up the step and into the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"whew! This way.\" said Crow , flying up to the rafters above the stage.  Raven followed and they both sat there watching the performers get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it.  You know what to do.  Near the end of the show, when they sing their last number, ....I will tell you when...I have seen this so many times and never taken the risk....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you come this time..?  You must feel so alone here...\"Raven left off, seeing Crow shake his head. \"I have done what I came to do , if you get home.   yet, maybe..\" Crow could feel Raven's pull toward home, the home he knew, but the home Crow tried to forget.  It would be gone now anyway. Still he felt a call to somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\" Crow cued. \"Good luck my friend.\"  Raven nodded. \"same to you.\"<br>\r\nHe flew down to the stage and saw Crow do the same,  just as the chorus sang the refrain of the age old song, full of the magic that would send him home....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Bye Birdie\"<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/music1.png\" alt=\"*Music1*\" title=\"Music1\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last chorus, people in the audience could have sworn they saw too black birds shoot low and disappear in to the lights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1590 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">Martell House<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Looking around , he recognized the woods where he fell in to the trap that took him to that future place called the Broadway. His memory was a little cock-eyed but he did know he flew into flashing lights.  <i>Yes, it is coming back now.</i> he thought.  I wonder where Crow went.\" He flapped and flew up onto a bush for a wider look.  <i>Not here, I see. I hope he went off to where he wished.  Safer than here.{/} he mused .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought, he flew back to the Martell Abode and right into the great hall where Princess Aqua was sitting, going over her scrolls, and scribing like mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, Princess,\" Raven said, \"I have returned from a fantastic place and....er..well that is a story for another time.  I just wanted to warn you there are spies and wizards with great magic who can make folks..well..me disappear.  Lucky for him, I met an ally in that other place and he gave me this---he pulled out a tiny orb of black and purple.  I guess I was meant to be tricked and Crow,  this friend I met, was meant to meet me and give us this.\" Raven was speaking so fast, as he was apt to do when excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that, raven. Slow down. I can't understand you.\" Aqua looked at the orb and took it in her hand. \" I know this gem. It has been our family stone for years, but there are so few pieces now. How did you find it.?\" she rolled it between her hands as if to take comfort. She had seen this very piece held by grandmother years ago, and thought it lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just told you. Crow gave it to me \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crow? Who is crow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know, except that he is from here and was sent there in a trap years ago. He stayed to help others get back home but he said I was the one he was waiting for and gave me this.  The talisman Orb of Martell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he now? Can I talk to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, princess.  We flew from there together but he did not seem to come here. He did mention a place ....but it was vague.\" Raven lowered his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, Raven. That it is home now is the important thing. It has magic, you know. It wards off..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wards of evil and negative vibes so you can see and hear the truth of a matter. Yes  yes I know.\" said Raven, not knowing how the heck he knew that.  Some kind of mindspeak , maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...\"\" Aqua was astonished. \"The story is old..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I,\" said raven,\" but I think in this case Crow might have given me the information as thought transference. I don't recall knowing so...it is possible for birds to communicate telepathically.  Humans too, though they do not know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" said aqua as her face lit up. \"I remember my grandmother saying this about crows and ravens. And about the orb.  and...\" she jumped out of her chair. \"She had a Crow!  Just like I have you! Could it be?  After all this time, it is the same crow?\u201d<br>\r\nRaven preened his feathers and pondered. <i>Could it have been?  Crow from this past---that long waiting to deliver a message\u2014that will affect the future?  He mentioned he too was tricked, but , then, the orb, how did he get it? There was something he wasn\u2019t getting here. He would have to think carefully about what Crow told him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRaven?\u201d  Aqua woke him out of his reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I don\u2019t know, princess, but it could be. He seemed to know about us and said he had waited a long time for me to come. He could have come back when he freed others who were sent there by magic, but did not.  He was quite comfortable there, if a bit sad at times. I will need to ponder on this. Meantime, you  have the orb and must decide what it means and how to best use it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I will search our histories and grandmother\u2019s journals. There may be a clue. Thank you raven.\u201d She patted his shiny head.   \u201cNow  back to battle plans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess.\u201d Raven said as he bobbed his head and backed away. He hopped up onto the ledge and lept out the window,  catching the breeze and cawed in delight.  Looking over the land, his land, his people, he cawed again, glad to be home, his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n778 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"> Martell House<br>\r\n</span></i></span></div></div>",

The dark veil of unconsciousness evaded her for several hours before it fell over her weary mind. She had no idea of the hour this happened but one thing was certain - she'd wiled every waking minute thinking of the Raven and the orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was apt that after however long, when she finally fell asleep she dreamt of the raven and his magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darkness of her mind turned into wings of midnight black which slowly drew away. With a jolt she realised she was the raven itself. She could feel her wings arching at her sides, the pull and thrust of every movement as she flew. This oddly felt too real to be dream, she thought as she soared into the sky, feeling the hot sun on her black feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the dream morphed again as she flew into an old mansion. The place was deserted like everyone had left there in a hurry. Everything seemed to be old to her eyes, everything with just a little hint of magic. It was her fascination perhaps that drew her further into the house. Silk draped the walls and thick woollen carpets adorned the floors. She could see chandeliers hindering her flight at every turn - huge crystal monoliths that sparkled fresh at every new turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as she flew through a set of carved oak doors, she expected the rooms to be empty as well. But again her dreams morphed and there was an abundance of people in the once empty room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong them, lying on the king sized bed of white draperies lay her grandmother like she'd last seen her. She'd been ill then, though now in real life Aqua knew she was prosperous. She didn't think she'd be noticed, but her grandmother sussed everyone else and bade them to leave her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly she reached her side, perched by her bed. She lifted her beautiful eyes up to her and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find that which has been lost, leave no stone unturned. For every magic is treasure and every treasure can be unlocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the princess felt herself fading away. She tried desperately to hold on but she couldn't. She felt herself sinking into the darkness again but she could've sworn she saw those violet orbs in her grandmother's eyes before she faded away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the princess spent the rest of the night in the dark solace and awoke that morning with a new puzzle in her hands.</span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">House Martell<br>\r\n423 Words</span> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

I have never seen my grandmother in my dream before. . . \" Princess Aqua sat up and a glint of light got her attention, it was in her own room. She glanced at her bedside table to find the orbs on them, all glowing pink-blue in colour. Just as she laid her eyes on them, they glowed even brighter, filling the entire room with spectrum light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah. . . \" Princess Aqua was mesmerized with the colourful scene but then she thought out loud, \"Wait, didn't I put the orbs in the dresser? I am sure I did. How come it appeared next to me, on my bed table? Are they somehow connected to the dream I had?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould someone had intruded in her room and placed them beside her? But why would they do that? And if there was someone in her room, she must have definitely heard it. Was it the Raven? No, Raven wouldn't do that, she was tired and she never entered my room, if there was anyone, I would have known. Crossing out all possibilities, Princess Aqua couldn't help but be even more curious and intrigued with the orbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at them and then moved her hand closer to them until she had all of them in her grip. She held them carefully and then placed them on the bed sheet, her hands still in contact with the orbs. Immediately, the orbs glowed so bright that everything around Princess Aqua turned pure white as if canvases of white paper and there was no knowing how long they extended or if there was any end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Is anyone here?\" Princess Aqua's sound echoed through the place like it was a hall but there was no reply. She turned around and took in the surroundings, there was nothing other than white and the only other colour was her yellow-orange Martell night gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called, Your Highness,\" there was an unfamiliar yet friendly voice that greeted her. She turned to see who it was and was greatly surprised to see that there was no one but the orbs floating in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, where are you and who are you?\" Princess Aqua was confused, did the orbs speak?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came an answer, the voice wasn't single anymore, it was like multiple voices speaking the same thing, just like all three orbs were speaking, \"We, the orbs, are talking, Your Highness. We vowed to help the Princess when she needed help and here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew anything about the orbs, I mean you. And why would I need any help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were not told many things, my child, they said that you should know when the time comes and now is the right time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Aqua prepared herself to hear whatever it was she didn't know for her entire years she spent as a princess.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n515 words</font> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

There was some talk and rumor of an affair, but I nevermore believed it.  I mean never believed it.  They were just \"friends\" as they told TMZ.  I remembered back when Brad Pitt and Devilina Jolie told TMZ they were just \"friends\".  \"Friends\" brought to mind a momentary glipse of Jennifer Anniston waiting alone for Brad Pitt to call home.  She cried all the way to the box office on her next movie.  Very sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to hooves headly demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence descended on the crowd.

His poor friend\u2014well,  long time friend-before these wars separated everyone, doomed to headless horror! Though he supposed he could get around better that way, see the unseen . Interesting that they hang around in a barn! He thought as scare everyone--er..well except those white wispy things. You think they could recognize one of their own undead, but no, it is because hooves didn't belong there.  He is a maverick.  That is why he got along with Ravens. But what could he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRavens and crows have long memories and know things others do not. They are familiar with the dark realms and light realms and fear them not. Raven was no different.  He did know people who might have answers for hooves' headless state. But should he intervene?  Would he be safer as headless? mmm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe read the letter again. What did hooves--er..hooves's head mean when he said he had powers? And not in the grave yet?  Well, that gave Raven hope as it meant his notion might be correct. Hooves could be recovered. That game changer guy could be right ...but timing is the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand , what?  How did he know about the unexpected trip to Broadway?  No one knows yet, not even people of Martell.  Does his form now have gift of sight? or did he dream it so did he see who plotted against us?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven rustled his tail feathers. Was he in on it or just bystanding heifer?  No, this was war and animals often innocent bystanders, who would rather stay home and chew cud and play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what did hooves want him to do?  He had the letter and he knew they couldn't communicate by dreams anymore.  He had no idea whose cronies those crows are?  None  he knew --soo....ah \u2026spies?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom whom? What have they seen? Does hooves know?  Are they spying on him?  the whitewalkers?  Did they see him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peered down to where hooves head was still bobbing around and still had no idea what he had in mind.  He thought a moment and thought he heard\u2026that broadway comment, could it be a key?<br>\r\nGive my regards\u2026mmm.   I wonder if his old pal Crow was still there or had he also transported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if this was a trick, a distraction to keep him off guard. Would hooves\u2019 masters be that crafty enough to use his headless  state to get my sympathy and lead me to another trap into the stark wizard\u2019s hand and cut him off again from his House!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he shook his tailfeathers.   She is headless now and sounds more like she wants revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are thinking way too much about this, you know. \u201c  came a small voice from the ceiling. Raven looked up and saw a colourful spider hanging by a silk thread.   Raven\u2019s mouth watered. He hadn\u2019t eaten all day and <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, mate\u201d Said a huge black Crow from out of the shadows. \u201cShe is a shape-shifter and would as soon eat your for lunch. I am Bracken.\u201d he put out a wing to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSunspear Raven,\u201d he did the same and the two touched wings. Electricity sizzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cah, You have been to Broadway.\u201d  Bracken said as a fact.<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know  that?\u201d  Raven cawed, shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been there too and there seems to be a trace of some sort, a spell or energy around those who have been off from here. She have been too. \u201c Bracken turned his beak to point to the spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t like it one bit,\u201d she almost spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracken cawed with amusement.  \u201cYou see, she was like us there,  no shape-shifting could  she do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what did she go as?\u201d  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was the problem.  She was a spider and people freak out at spiders there so she had to hide in corners and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d the spider spun closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracken paid her no mind.  \u201cWe hid out in a theatre and had to listen to the oddest assortments of sounds and shows.  One night we met Crow, and he showed us the key to get back home, but not without a price.  You see they needed some animals to play in a stage show, for effect and well, I got to play myself and she\u2026had to play a spider, a kind , soft spoken, friendly creative spider in a show called Charlotte\u2019s Web. It is the antithesis of who she really is. Quite a stretch for an actress, though\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. I told you to leave it alone. I don\u2019t want to remember that simpering pig and that soppy spider momma.  Bleck! \u201c  she shuddered at the memory , almost losing her web connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou actually got to act in a play? Wow!\u201d  Raven cawed.<br>\r\n\u201cAll the way through before the magic worked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe only had to sing one line and fly off. \u201cBye , Bye Birdie\u201d. He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe. .\u201d Bracken and the spider said in unison. \u201cI thought you were alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I say that?\u201d Raven sensed something not right here.  He didn\u2019t recall mentioning anything.<br>\r\n\u201cI met Crow, same as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Crow flew with away with you?  He is here?\u201d  Bracken cackled with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not that I know of,  anyway.  He did not return with me.   I did wonder at that.  He said he could not return here.  Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider looked at Bracken.  \u201cYes, that is what he told us too. So if he flew with you but not here, we have no way of knowing where he is.  And if any were to be caught in Broadway again, who would show them out.  That was his purpose.\u201d  She said, with a tinge of regret, which was different from her early gruffness.  She crawled up her web a ways to the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with her?\u2019 Raven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother time, mate.  We have more pressing matters.\u201d  Bracken flew to the rafter to get a better view of the headless wonder.  \u201cWhat to do about that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1011 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\nHouse Martell</span></div></div>",

She marveled at how nice the people were to him and how much a little kindness and consideration brought out the best in the bull.  It made her wonder about how would be so cruel to cut off his head and abuse him so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, hooves demanded movie star looks, but after hours of debate, Raven managed to persuade hooves that a Bull appearance would be best, but hooves insisted on a bull face that would bear a resemblance to that of his favorite author, Ernest Hemingway, or at least his favorite actor of the month, Kevin Spacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raven had an inside deal with Spacey's agent, so with a little finagling a head was purchased on the black market in Casablanca.  It happened in a dim cafe  called, \"Ricks\".  The raven wore blue and the Germans wore swastikas.  Scary times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a dim light, hooves would look a little like COWser Soze, his favorite character from The Usual Suspects and Spacey's first Oscar winning performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegotiations included a guest role in House of Cards for Netflix, which would have to be filmed during a downtime on Broadway when George Clooney would come in and substitute for hooves.  George agreed to the fill-in in exchange for some off the books special favors, to be determined later.  The raven shuddered at the idea of seeing George again.  It had been fifteen years or more, but still middle aged George looked to be as smirky and sneaky as young George had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHooves was very excited about having a new head and a new life, one that would leave behind those who ridiculed him and abused him.  It almost seemed to good to be true, to dream of being happy on Broadway, dancing and singing songs morning and night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 332 Words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Apparently Hawk---er hawk's cousin had absconded with the fare and not even given hooves the proper accomodation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you will have to wait!  We are not done raiding and to save up spoils for this amount will take time.!\"  Raven fluttered her tail feathers.  and hawk will get another earful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are not going to pay?\" the crow looked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just told you. You will have to wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..wait where?  You mean <i> here!</i> the crow shivered.\"with you in this place?

Stay or go and return when I have the fare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean go back and face Hoooves? without the cash?\" the crow cowered now. \"er..well.. I'd rather stay here, if you don't mind.  Hooves may be headless now but she has strong hooves that can stomp and rock the whole boat , let alone a little crow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooves won't hurt you.\" Raven said, 'though he might rock the boat.   I think he likes rock and roll.  You know.. \"Rockin Robin\".  she said as she bobbed to the tune in her head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Crow, cocking its head to one side to consider such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides\" Raven went on, \"he will be having fun on the lido deck and learning his lines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like, he'll forget about it\", Crow was hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh , no! Hooves forgets nothing. He is a heifer. Long memories and hold on....\" Raven explained. \"He just won't take it out on you. He is not like those GOT kings who chop heads. He is not into revenge and besides, who , on the boat would make a headless hooves leave?  And it IS the <i>LOVE</i> Boat, afterall.\" Raven laughed at her own quip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh, you could be right.\" the little crow nodded. \"Noone exactly said to bring the fare but I likely should go back , though I still don't think she likes crows.  Would you like to send a message back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven thought for a moment. She had already made sure Hooves got changes to lido deck and was sure he was having a ball---he did like to dance and was learning lines...but the crow was hoping for something to ease his way back to hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\"  she said. \"Tell Hooves..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a swoop caught their attention and Hawk appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey rave, glad you're here.

Staying out of trouble yourself uh? don't want another earful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, give a bird a break will you?  It's all good now. But I gotta fly! see ya!\" hawk leapt from the turret window and spread his wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go,\" said Raven, giving the fare in a note to crow. \"Now you can safely go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow was relieved and ruffled his feathers to release the tension.

He'd decided to take his friend, Mo and Mo's wife, Jo and Henrietta Heifer, his longtime girlfriend to the games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMo and Jo had been thrilled and mooed their appreciation, but Henrietta begged off a t the last minute, using dairy work as her excuse.  Hooves knew that Henrietta hated baseball, and he was disappointed that she wouldn't at least make the effort to be with him for a playoff game that he'd been looking forward to for years.  He knew that if he'd offered her an opera ticket, she'd have been certain to show up and moo.  Now, she'd ended up saying she'd try to make the last inning of the game, leaving Hooves with a ticket that many of his friends in the herd, would have been thrilled to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHooves sighed.  This was just one more disappointing episode in a relationship that was rapidly deteriorating due to their lack of mutual interests and geographical separation.  And then there was the fact that lately every conversation turned into an argument.  Just thinking about Henrietta Heiffer had become unpleasant for Hooves these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of Henrietta, Hooves felt happy on this particular Fall evening.  Now, the METS had a real chance of going to the World series for the first time since the 1980's, and while Henrietta could have cared less abou the METS or about what cheering for the team meant to him, Hooves realized he felt excited to be at the game, with or without Henrietta mooing at him and complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHooves deliberately stood next to Mo, leaving the area to his right vacant so that if Henrietta didn't show up, he wouldn't be on top of whoever might ease into the area on the other side of Henrietta's designated station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHooves immediately regretted this decision when he saw a petite cow wearing a METS cap mosey in from the other side of the row.  This cow, with her fetching ways, had the most beautiful, haunting eyes that Hooves had ever seen.  She smiled at him shyly as she took her place and Hooves' heart skipped a beat.  As of that moment, even though he didn't know it or realize it yet, Henrietta Hoofer was a thing of the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 400 Words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Welcoming the opportunity to change the subject now that he'd mentioned Henrietta Heifer, he introduced Mo and Jo to Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHooves and Josie spent the next two hours between innings mooing about the METS, baseball and life - his as a time traveling bovine warrior/writer/gambler and hers as a writer for a Farm News Gossip Column at the New Barn Times.  They soon learned that theyy had a lot in common, including a love of literature and the arts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie was able to relax with Hooves and be herself as soon as he'd revealed that he had a heifer of a girlfriend.  All the tension she'd felt at first had vanished as soon as she'd accepted the fact that this bull could have no romantic interest in her, a lowly cow reporter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn contrast, Hooves found himself falling head over hooves with the cow standing one slot away from him.  As the warm evening turned cold, he suddenly became aware of the fact that Josie was unprepared for the quick change in temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving attended Yale, Hooves and his friends were well supplied for the October night in New York with blankets and cover-ups.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie, would you like to share my blanket?\"  He mooed as he noticed her start to shiver and shake  uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie nodded.  \"That would be great.  Thanks, Hooves!\"  She mooed gratefully as he got up to unfold the blanket and move to the slot next to her.  He didn't notice Mo and Jo exchange gleeful looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Henrietta could get a load of this!\"  Jo mooed in Mo's ear.  \"Look Mo, they make such a cute couple.\" she mooed, judging her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 300 Words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Being a good sailor should have made for an enjoyable voyage, but hooves was troubled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many positives.  Hooves had enjoyed some great reading, met some awesome people and gotten reacquainted with some others who were some of the nicest people going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had to be said.  The \"game\" forced hooves out of his comfort zone and into the mix.  All good things.  All positive things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast year, when hooves cheered for another team, he was welcomed with open arms, hugs and lots of encouragement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis year, being a player on a team, the welcome mat was not there for almost three weeks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if he was expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The leader of the team was very positive, but it was the other members who at times gave hooves the cold shoulders.  If the truth were told, that had been the case since whenever, not just June.  Now that hooves had proved he was a worker bee, there was some luke warm respect, and even one intrepid interactive sweetie pie, but very little else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the team prided itself in helping and nurturing newbies, hooves wondered a little about this.  Do you remain insular when dealing with them?  He wondered about it some more.    But talk is cheap.  Show and tell takes time and experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for this doubt was that hooves was a newbie to the team this year.  Oh, yes he was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it is okay to not feel welcome or even wanted at times.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat can be a motivational factor that works to the good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegative reinforcement does not work on hooves.  It might work on the people on survivor, but hooves is not on survivor.  Maybe people have watched too much reality TV and they think you have to berate to motivate.  Breaking old hooves down to nothing, tell him he's a loser and motivate him to prove he isn't?  Sorry, doesn't work.  Hooves knows who he is.  He is a kind heart, who tries to do the right thing, but gets overwhelmed by temper tantrums when he is tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPositive reinforcement is the best teaching method there is.  If you encourage and nurture, you see positive results.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople talk a lot about a lot of things.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActions really do speak louder than words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhooves decided to turn the experience into something enjoyable by just being himself.  Sometimes, if that is not enough, then it is okay, too.    Hooves is fine with being himself and just trying to use the experience to....well.. maybe in some way pay it forward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis may take inventive thinking and ingenuity, but hooves has something to prove and it isn't to those who would kick him when he is down.  He has to prove that despite hearing he is behind all the time, he will not quit.  He will finish and there will be things he takes from the experience that are positive, whether or not he is liked or even wanted.  He has outgrown the need to be accepted by anyone.  That really doesn't matter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, what does matter is how we treat each other.  hooves may have whined at times, but he always tried to express the truth about what was happening.  No game strategy, just plain truth, hooves truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 584 Words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Guess what I saw? I was sitting in a tree yonder in Stark territory and minding my own business when I saw a mist rise out of nowhere.   It soon cleared and guess what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven stopped preening and looked at him. Crow had a knack for gossip but sometimes tasty morsels of news feel from his beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooves is back. I heard this Myst talking to her! something about her head and movies and Kevin Spacey. Wierd name! Does he space out or something.  Any way they mentioned your name so I thought I would come and tell you!\" he stopped now all out of breath.<br>\r\nHe hopped around on one foot and eyed Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She still has her Spacey head?  I  thought Kermit took care...uh, I mean...\" Raven stopped himself.  His realm travelling got confusing at times. So now it this time, Hooves still not in good shape but speaking with friends. Good, well the later part anyway. So why were they talking about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else did they say?\" he asked as he saw Crow pecking around for food.  \"Here\", he offered some worms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh , thanks. I get hungry with all this snooping.  er.. well something about you might know the secret to what' s wrong with hooves. Something to do with a movie by Spacey..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His movies?  Cawww!  He has done over 45  -hasn't he? -what do I know?\" Raven flicked his tail and paced.  \"The only two that I know are K-Pax and Pay it Forward! if that is any help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how come you are telling me this?  Did they ask you to send the message?  or Were they even going to send a message?\"<br>\r\nRaven knew that Hooves had her own means of communication but he did not Know the Myst.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uh, I don\"t know\" the young crow answered, looking around for more food.  As I said I was just passing but it sounded bizzare. What is a movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven pondered. <i>Oh boy, how do I explain this. Crow has not been to Broadway or time traveled the way Hooves and she had so..was not going to get this.  And he is such a gossip that if I show him, it will be all over the kingdom by night fall. Well maybe not quite and the sun was setting already.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a new kind of magic.\" Raven began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and it will help Hooves get her head back?\" Crow asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"er..yes, that's right. very hush , hush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,' cawwed crow, who had really lost interest. \"Any more food round here or do I need go hunt something up?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven laughed. \"Looks like you might have to as you have eaten all my stores\" <i>. I don't even have any popcorn left, for the movie.  What am I saying? I'd have to find a way to get back to Broadway and...didn't crow say they just needed a name of a movie.

It was odd occurrance for a dove to show up in these times so it must be of fair importance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, Raven,\" said Dove in a soft coo.  Very unlike Crow's Cawing cackle.<br>\r\n\"Hello, Dove, It is long since one of your kind has visited the kingdom.\"  she cocked his head and eyed her.<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I have a message that the battle will soon end and peace will reign once more.\"she blinked her gray eyes.<br>\r\n\"More importantly, you have no need to deliver the message you are pondering for all will be well with Hooves, without need of movies and spells and other charms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, how? We have tried so many things to restore him!\" Raven was both curious and puzzled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see,\" she moved a bit closer and ruffled her pretty feathers. \"the enchantment began with the magic of GOT and when the GOT is no more.  The spell breaks and all and everyone are returned to their former unique and wonderful selves.\" she coooed in a soothing tone.  \"Furthermore, Hooves own magic will dispell the charm further.  She naturally becomes Thing when the month changes so by the time Hooves returns, all former programming  not of the original creative Hooves will have been deleted.\" she smiled, as if dispelling the magic herself , in a different way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Programming...uh..what....oh , no . You have been to that future place called Broadway too. Should've known.  All the wise ones have been there.\" Raven hopped up on the window ledge, surveying this land, this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you, Raven,\" she continued. \"if you do not believe me.  You too will be changed back to the eyestar you were before, and Raven will be in waiting for another tour somewhere, sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I'll just be gone. Like that!  Why don't I know this? has it happened before then?  This GOT magic\" Raven raised his voice, astounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\"replied Dove. \"And likely will again. It is up to the Great GOT witch herself the hows and whens of it all. She created this reality and when she shuts the gates....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" he cawed as soft as a crow can. \"Amazing.  So it is like we are eternal! or doomed to return!  Depending on how I look at it.mmmm. Cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each time will be different, of course, than the one before.  Different battles, different House knights as folks mix and mesh as their time and life flows. Everything changes.\" Dove went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Raven will be there.

In fact, I have seen some saying their goodbyes already. And many happy endings.\"  Dove lifted to the ledge and turn to bow.  \"Until another time,\" she cooed softly and flew off, disappearing into the sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven sat there  in awe, reflecting on the magic and mystery of time and space and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven!\" cawed Crow, knocking him off his perch and out of his reverie.  <br>\r\n\"What now, Crow?\"  he demanded.<br>\r\n\"Well ,, you see I was just strutting on the grass , minding my own business, when she appeared. Right there in front of me, from out of nowhere.   I have never seen anyone like her. she wore funny outfit, nothing like what folks wear here.  Anyway , she spoke to me. Really! Just like that, as if she knew I could understand.  How did she know?  I just about flew away in case she put a spell on me.  But then , she mentioned you.  did I know you and stuff like that. She was nervous. Imagine being nervous of speaking to a crow!  Any way she said she had an important note for you and it had to be delivered before the GOT ended.  Got what?  I was so confused.   I started to hop away and I guess she thought I was leaving so she said to tell you her name was Tiggy and gave me this wierd thing called email. I took it and hightailed it out of there.! \" Crow was still shaking and out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Crow. It is alright.  mmm. Tiggy, you say..mm. I think I know that name but not sure how,\" he said , remembering his earlier blurb about eyestar.  maybe the GOT magic was wearing off. He marveled.<br>\r\n\"Where is the note?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow opened his claw and gave it to Raven . He held it with one claw and his beak and read, \"Raven of Martell, before the GOT ends please post this.  I know it is really you eyestar , so make it so Captain.\"  Raven laughed. It sounded like they had more fun in that other place called WDC<br>\r\n. <br>\r\n\"Well\" said crow, still a little shaken and confused. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"oh all is well my friend. You well deserve a rest and are welcome to my nest.  All will be forGOTten in the morning.\" he comforted.<br>\r\n\"Here ,have a snack. it is a new invention called popcorn.\" Crow scooped some up and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven looked out the window again and wondered how he would get the message out there, when he was still here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1443 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\nHouse martell<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lucky for him he was a frog and could hop a lot, which he did because his front foot hurt so much after tripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uh! Ribbit!\" he plunked down and picked up the skull . Holding it up to his face he began the monologue from Hamlet.  \"Alas poor Urich..\" before he really realized it was real skull, a real human skull.  \"Ahh!\" he dropped  and hopped up at the same time.  He looked to the left and then right and behind.  He did not recognize this place.  Where was his pond and the pretty rainbows?    All he saw was muddy field and several other skulls. <i> Where was he?  What happened here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n He hopped in a circle away from the skull and noticed something shiny in the mud. He plopped down beside it and yanked it out. It was partially lodged in clay. It was a shield, like a knight's shield. He spit on it and rubbed the metal and it shone like copper. He could just read the inscription: \"winter is coming\".  \"Uh? i hope not. I am a frog and there is not nice deep pond to sleep in!\" he spoke as if the shield could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich apparently it did as it spoke right back: \"too bad, winter is coming\".<br>\r\nKermit, being used to odd things like trash cans and monsters and birds talking, did not seem concerned that he spoke. It was the idea of winter that got him agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't come. Not while I am here. why I haven't had to deal with winter in years. I have a nice condo box and with my travel schedule, I avoid cold places all year.\" he flicked his tongue at a passing fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too Bad. Winter is coming\" the shield replied again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKermit hopped up and threw it down.  \"Now just stop saying that. It is a perfectly fine day...\" he was saying as he looked around and again noticed what he had not before---clouds were shifting gray and while the sun was out, it was none too warm. \"but it isn't winter. Can't be. At home it is a lovely spring day and ..... I am not at home!  So where am I? What is happening?\" he moaned in a croaking gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"too bad. Winter is coming\". the shield, from its place on the ground piped in .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really! is that all you can say? It is no help at all!\" He picked up the shield again and on the back it said House of Stark.  Nothing else. Kermit did not know what to make of it.<br>\r\nHe put the shield down and once more it uttered the fateful \" too bad. Winter is coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKermit shrugged his shoulders  and looked around again. <i>Nothing for it. I am here and here I am.</i> So he did the only thing a frog in this situation could do.  Hop a lot and break in to a song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are there so many songs about rainbows....only illusions...probably magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n527 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\nHouse Martel</span></div></div>",

Trying to shine up the shield to find out what the symbol on it was, he tripped again.  Hopped and flipped back, dropping the shield. He looked down to see a bow. As he brushed it off the words 'Unbowed, unbent, unbroken\" appeared on the wood.  He dropped it. \"Ouch\" he hopped on the other foot now. \"yet unbowed, unbent , unbroken\" said the bow.   \"Too bad, Winter's coming\" the shield said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh , knock it off!\" said Kermit as he shook his legs out. \"now I have a duet.\"  He picked up the bow on his left shoulder and lifted up the shield. He rolled his eyes. \"Croooaaakkkk!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe began to walk on the muddy field once more, looking everywhere for a pond or even a puddle.  As he approached a rocky outcrop he saw a splash of yellow and went over to  pick it up. It was a banner or flag with a stag on it, \" Ours is the Fury!\" a high pitched voice struck his ears.  \"Oh, no, not again.\" he cried while at the same time the shield said. \"Too Bad. Winter is coming\" and the bow sang \"yet unbowed, unbent unbroken\".  Kermit sat in wonder.  There was nothing for it. Now he had a chorus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKermit breathed in and wrapped the banner like a cape around his green body, took the shield in a hand and the bow on one arm and hopped on.  It was getting hot and he had no clue how to get back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was contemplating how it wasn't easy being green, a shadow appeared over head.  Oh that can't be good. he thought ,as it looked like a vulture---or maybe--gonzo??  No, it was way too big. He looked quickly around and saw a huge crater in the mud.<br>\r\nHe hopped in with all his gear and hoped the bird would pass by.  He didn't relish being dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was shifting around to get comfortable and wishing there was still water in the hole when something stuck him in the back.<br>\r\nHe hopped around to face the other way and saw a hilt handle sticking out of the wall of the hole.  He pulled it out. It was a dagger with an ornate dragon head as the handle.  On the blade read \"Fire and Blood\".  \"Oh goodie\" he said. \"that sounds dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yet unbowed, unbent, unbroken\" chimed in the bow over his left shoulder. \"Too bad. Winter is coming.\" boomed the shield.<br>\r\n\"Ours is the Fury\" sang out the banner.  Kermit waited for it. He knew it would come. He looked at the blade and cocked one ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you think the bloody blade is going to sing?\" A voice from above him asked.

I really need to get home or at least to some pond . I am a frog you see and ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know what you are.  I could eat you for dinner.  yet there is something strange about you and you have those tokens and not every one can handle a dragon blade, so perhaps I will travel with you, but not by you.  I will keep distance, camouflaged from sight.<br>\r\nFor we are \"blood and fire\". Too bad, Winter is coming!\"  \"Ours is the fury!\"  \"Yet unbowed, unbent , unbroken\"  the chorus sang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"unh..do you by any chance know what that is all about? he asked, indicating the battle tools. \"or what happened here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the dragon had already vanished. Kermit sighed and gathered up his gear and hopped out of the hole. He was getting weighted down now, with all these things. He wished the dragon had stayed. Maybe he could have had a ride. That notion gave rise to a song and he merrily sang \" Somewhere over the rainbow..\" as he hopped along as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they came to a wooded area with sparse , short trees, very dry and burnt out.  Beside one of the stumps was a helmet. Kermit picked it up and saw that it had a moon and bird crest with words inscribed. \"As High As Honour\"  a soft voice filled the air.<br>\r\nAnd Kermit knew what would come next.  \"Too bad! Winter is Coming!\"  \"Ours is the Fury!\" \"Unbowed, Unbent, unbroken\" chimed in the chorus at the same time a booming \"fire and blood\" came out of nowhere as the dagger vibrated. After sets of three chants each, all was quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKermit put the helmet on even thought it was warm and began hopping among the straggly trees and stumps. <br>\r\n\"There must be water, if there were once trees here.\" he spoke to himself as he hopped over to a shiny glinting object.<br>\r\nHe plopped down and picked it out of the dust. It was a medallion with a shine red fox on it. Reminded him of Fozzy bear. And as he shined it up, he heard a rush of water, \"We are of Bright water\".<br>\r\n\"Too bad. winter is coming\" piped up the shield. <br>\r\n\"Ours is the Fury!\"<br>\r\n\"Yet unbowed, unbent, unbroken.\"<br>\r\n\"Fire and Blood\"<br>\r\n\"As High an Honour!\"  toned in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKermit was getting used to choral chiming and wondered how it was accomplished and only at certain times. There must be a reason. He put the medallion around his neck and the fox began to glow.  In a split second an apparition of a fox appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stranger,\" it said, \"you must travel east and there bright water. Deliver the medallion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire and Blood!\" boomed the dragon, appearing over head. \"We will not follow this fox to our doom.\"<br>\r\nThe others all responded with their chants once more. Kermit and Fox ignored them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to Bright Water. The doom is no threat.\" With that the fox disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n553 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\nMartell House</span></div></div>",

I don't know what's going on and since you wont' say. I have no choice.  You can stay, if you want.\" He gathered his gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't, unless you leave the dagger. I am bound to it.\" the dragon admitted. \"But you can't leave it, for I fear who else may find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, it looks like we won't be breaking up a set then. So let's go. Maybe if you gave us a ride, we'd get there....\"  The dragon vanished again. \"Uh, no help at all.\"   He began hopping again and thought of another song where a dragon was of value. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puff the Magic dragon, lived by the sea....\"   It made him think of water , but then maybe here, thinking about a thing couldn't hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Kermit felt lighter and the landscape was changing. There were more trees and greenery and he swore he could hear running water.  He started hopping faster in the direction., though it was quite hard in his battle  gear.  He wondered what would happen if any one saw him decked out like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medallion glowed again and sang out \"we are of Bright Water\" in a rush of water tones. \"Too bad. Winter's coming!\" the chorus responded in line once more. \"ours in the fury!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKermit felt the pull of the medallion and followed til they came to bridge, over a fast moving river.<br>\r\n\"Water! Kermit was so excited, he almost jumped in with all his gear.   He plopped down on the bank and put his feet in and saw that it was fast indeed, not like his lovely pond and swamp back home, where one could relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't jump in , if I were you!  Be swept away for sure.\" the dragon stood beside him on the bank. <br>\r\n\"Yes, I can see that and was just thinking the same thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand you missed something back there, behind that huge rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?  I don't ....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go check and see!\"  prompted the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, CrroooooaaaaaK! \"Kermit balked as he had just gotten comfortable.  But Frog that he was, curiosity got the better of him and he went, lugging all the gear with him , in case they decided on another direction. he did want to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe backtracked to a large rock and just hidden behind it he found a metal  grey chest plate embossed with a flaming tower and as he held it up, a voice sparked into the air \"We Light the Way!'  It was a happy sort of voice to which the others responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad. Winter is coming!\" snarled the shield.<br>\r\n\"Yet, Unbowed, unbent, unbroken\" sang the bow.<br>\r\n\"Ours in the fury!\"  chimed the banner<br>\r\n\"Fire and Blood\" boomed the dragon of the dagger<br>\r\n\"As High As Honour!\"\"  rang the helmet.<br>\r\n\"We are of Bright Water\" whispered the medallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do with you all?\"Kermit was still at a loss.  He looked at all the pieces and saw a knight's battle gear minus a few pieces.<br>\r\n\"so was there a battle then? How terrible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you just getting that now?\" the dragon was surprised.<br>\r\n\"You were no help!  Where I come from we may play act but not for real! and our costumes don't chant.\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put everything on so he could carry it and went back to the river.  A sign North to Bright Water. Another sign south to Hightower.<br>\r\nThere was a tower on the breastplate so he decided to go there.  As he hopped along in that direction he began to feel lighter, as if the objects he had were not as heavy. He couldn't explain it but thought it was good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun set he came to a beautiful wood and beyond a shining tower. He hopped faster and soon was at the gate.<br>\r\nA guard peered down and asked: \"who goes there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as Kermit was about to answer all of the pieces of gear chanted in unison! Kermit shook his head.  This was getting as bad as trying to get a Muppet show put together.  The guard shouted, \"Who? What is all that gibberish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Kermit, uh, sir and ..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"kermit, what is a kermit,?

They entered into a room in which there was a long table with several men and women sitting, looking at him oddly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is him?\" the one man with the gray tunic with a wolf on it. The others were curious too about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" A raven spoke.  'It was prophesied that an out worlder would come , gather remains and reunite the kingdoms at High Tower. The light has shown the way? \" As she spoke, she spun round and transformed into a woman in a radiant white gown. \"this is the one!\" she waved her hand for him to come forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKermit hopped on the table at the place she indicated. \"Now,\" she looked at him. \"sir...\"<br>\r\n\"Kermit, I am just Kermit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kermit, show us what you have brought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought it odd that she knew about him, but did as he was bid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst he put the shield and bow down, then the breast plate and banner, and finally, the medallion and dagger.  Where the dragon was he did not know. As he brought them out, he heard gasps and questions from the council. \"How can it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see you are confused, little Kermit. Permit me to explain.  You were on the battle field, yes?\u2019<br>\r\nKermit nodded.<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed there was a battle and many perished.  But there was also magic at work and those items you have found are the keys to peace among us.  For each resonates with the spirit of one of great leaders, who, out of their transformation and seeing so many others fall, will now be changed, so they will find ways to co-operate and not compete.  Indeed, it is within all of us, this craft, and it is a new world that must be created so that future ones may thrive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what have I to do with it? Why me?\u201d Kermit asked in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are the most kind, caring, creature with a positive outlook.  Hooves was so right in referring you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHooves? I knew it!  Wait, she is from here!  I met her in\u2026! Never mind.  Does this mean I get to go home now?\u201d He hopped in hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoon. First you must undo the magic. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?  Me?  I don\u2019t know how to undo the spell. I just found these things and had to listen to them chanting every time one spoke. It \u2018s like a darn chorus!  I mean, at first it was like, you know, barking at each other all vying for their song but then as more were added, they  got more in harmony. Even the dragon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasps came from the council.  \u201cYou mean you have seen our dragon?\u201d one of the Targaryeons   asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, he said he is bound to the dagger and is its song.  I imagine he is around here somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore gasps and people looking around and at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo matter \u201c the raven woman said. \u201cIt is the magic and the prophecy said that an outworlder would bring the peace.  What were you doing when you came to be here Kermit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cer\u2026um..well I was sitting in my swamp and croaking a song and then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA song?  That\u2019s it.  What song? Sing it now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cum well,  it was about rainbow connections and\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSing it!\u201d an urgent voice from a child rang out.  \u201cHush, dear, \u201c said an older woman, who took her on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Kermit loved to sing and was a master so he took a breath and began:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does everyone believed in rainbows and\u2026.\u201d He sang  in his gentle way to the end.  Nothing happened. <br>\r\n\u201cNothing happened.  This is nonsense,\u201d one of the Stark knights barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cshh.\u201d The raven woman spoke.  \u201cThat must be the song that got you here.  Do you know another?<br>\r\nSeek here\u201d she came over and laid her hand on his heart. \u201cIt is where most magic lies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKermit looked at everyone and at the items on the table, which possibly held the spirits of real people, those who fought each other without trust.  Then he thought of all of his friends back home.  Yes, he knew a song\u2026maybe\u2026if wishes can come true\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was silent and as Kermit opened his mouth and began to sing, all of the chants rose together with him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWinter is coming.\u201d Unbowed, unbent, unbroken\u201d, \u201cOurs is the fury!\u201d  \u201cFire and Blood!\u201d  \u201cAs High As Honour!\u201d  \u201cWe are of Bright Water!\u201d  \u201cWe Light the Way\u201d and one last chord from the Raven\u2026\u201dNight gathers and my watch begins\u201d.   The harmony flooded the room and then silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKermit continued, <br>\r\n \u201cIf just one person  believes in you<br>\r\nDeep enough, strong enough believes in you<br>\r\nHard enough, long enough<br>\r\nBefore you knew it<br>\r\nSomeone else would think<br>\r\nI f he can do it<br>\r\nI can do it<br>\r\nMaking it two\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the song rose in the air, a mist rose in the room .<br>\r\nAs the song drew to an end, the mist dissipated and in the place of the items form the battle field<br>\r\nStood a happy  gathering of:<br>\r\nPrincess Aqua_mantis of Martell,   Queen Hannah of House Stark,  Queen Darleen of Baratheon,  Lady Lyn of House Florent, Lady Elle of Hightower,   Lady AJ Lyle Of House Arryn,  Lord Matt of Targaryeon, <br>\r\nMinara of the Night\u2019s Watch , all wearing their colours, and emblems like a sparkling rainbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room rushed to greet their lost leaders with tears and whoops of Joy, and sorrow at lost comrades.  Right there, the eight great houses signed treaties to have peace which would affect the next generations of earth.  Even the dragon lord promised to share dragon lore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKermit stood to one side in awe and then in sadness as he had not yet gone home.  The Raven woman was gone and no one seemed to pay him mind now.  Though he was responsible for this magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, \u201c a booming voice said behind him.  \u201cJob well done and you are still here.\u201d The dragon looked in the direction of the party. \u201cHumans!  Short attention.  Short memories.   Lucky you have me, and I too have need of your song.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou , but you are a dragon!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNan a nooo! Just like you I am stuck here in this form and this place, but if you get the right song , we can be home in no time. You to your swamp, or band and me to my pasture where I can\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHooves?? Is that You? All this time?  Why didn\u2019t you say and how did you get me into this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t, as it was part of the spell to get this done.  And I get to have my head back. So do this right!<br>\r\nYou know the one. It is your favourite!\u201d Hooves the dragon encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean I get to sing\u2026 wait\u2026do you think we should do it together---in case\u2026..\u201d Kermit looked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Why not. It will be just like old times on Broadway.  Er.. oh wait. That was with Raven. Oh never mind. Let\u2019s rock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKermit laughed and was happy that Hooves was getting his head back and this would make a cool story to tell his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kermit began his favourite song <br>\r\n\u201c Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what\u2019s on the other side\u2026\u201d <br>\r\nHooves joined in and as they sang , the landscape changed and they found themselves  at a cross roads between the swamp and the farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the song ended, Hooves was back to gorgeous heifer self and  Kermit, well , he, as always, was his sweet frog self and so  happy to be home, he really did hop over a cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1344 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\nMartell House<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unlike the slow moving, plodding bovines, Baron was fleet of foot, and sharp witted. He knew a nice, fat, juicy hare lived nearby under the hedges. He had seen its floppy ears and quivering nose poke out of a hole near the black berry bush. Baron had shed his human master long ago, back when he was a wee pup and knew he was destined for greater things. He didn't even think they missed him, way back six seasons ago. Now he was in his canine prime of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twitch from the bushes and a cautious June hare hopped forward. Baron didn't move a whisker. He didn't want to spook the quick creature. He knew he was down wind, and chose a spot in the field where he could blend in with the fallen woods and bracken. The clouds were covering the sun and a cold breeze made it feel more like November.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron's stomach growled. He had been living on field mice and what his friend Kinney called 'leftovers' in the village and really was looking forward to sinking his teeth into the warm flesh of a hare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clouds parted and the sun streamed down for a minute, before a shadow blotted out the sun again. The hare, startled, bolted back into the bushes and Baron snorted a sound of disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron stood up and shook the dirt from his body and gave one good last scratch. The clouds were back,and whatever caused the big black shadow was no where to be seen. In fact, there was no longer any bird sound at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron's fur stiffened and the thick protective cuff of fur around his neck raised. A sharp smell reached his sensitive nose. It wasn't man or beast, at least it wasn't anything he had detected before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt smelled like blood left out in the rain, like mashed mushroom under the porch rotting, like Kinney after a good rut with the local bitches. It was an interesting smell, complex, multilayered, but not anything he could pinpoint, and Baron had the best nose in the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trotted forward, a sleek twenty pound mass of canine muscle and steel determination. Nothing was going to ruin his potential dinner. But nothing was to be seen or heard in the field. He scanned the air, still no birds, No shadows, no rustling grasses, just the bouquet of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he spied a subtle movement on a low hanging branch of the sycamore tree. A blending of greens, grays and browns were hiding a being made of grays and browns, a being not familiar to Baron, and one that put the fear of Odin in his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature was watching the same berry bushes Baron had been watching. It had two arm like appendages, with something between fur and feathers in an intricate pattern between them. Baron thought he could see two gray eyes with something else behind a bush of tangled brown rasta braided hair. Was it human? Bird? Tiger? Baron couldn\u2019t tell. Maybe it was a species of carrion bird he wasn\u2019t familiar with, except it didn\u2019t have the perfume of one of the clean up crew. With one of the creatures long nail like endings of the appendages, the creature pressed something on a leash like item on its wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shot of light flew from the creature and lit up the bush below. The hare bolted and the creature turned its device towards it and lit up the hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron froze in place. All that was left of his potential dinner were burnt bones and melted led from where a careless hunter had shot the hare a year ago. Nothing else. Baron heard a rumbling from overhead, similar to the noise humans called laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature touched a red spot on its gray face and a human like voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be what the earth crawlers call a dog. Well, dog, I cooked your supper for you, maybe I went a bit to far. Sorry, buddy. If you don\u2019t want the same fate as the hopping thing, you better come with me. I heard from the other dogs you have the best nose on this planet. Come, oh black nosed one and join with me. My name is 7n89hiphkjkp, but you can call me 7. I need you to find a certain fungus for my shipmate. 8 has turned green around the gills from eating a short red haired human last night. If I land on the ground, here, in front of you, you have my permission to ride my back while we circle the lands looking for the fungus. Well?\u201d the creature growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron was shocked. He could understand the creature as well as he could one of his canine friends. It spoke dog fluently, but what was it? Baron was a smart dog, and knew he better play along with the creature until he could figure out a way out of the area. He thought he would at first test the mettle of the creature to see if it was bluffing. Baron was brave like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not a truffle dog,\u201d he spat. \u201cI am a pure bred schipperke, destined to do great things and rule the fields and oceans. I am no one\u2019s bitch (well I am male, so I guess I am not) and do no human\u2019s bidding. No one is my master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature did the laughing sound again. \u201cI don\u2019t want a slave, I want a partner. I am always on the look out for a quick thinker, a loner, someone who knows what they want and doesn\u2019t accept their place in this world. How do you think I landed here on your blue planet with nothing but my trusty friend 8 and a tin can?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron came closer the creature, now landed on the ground in front of him. The ground was steaming and the grasses near the creature turned brown. But the smell from the creature was what he had noticed earlier and it was like heaven to a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nword count: 1017 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

She questioned her fate, given her best at controlling the situation, close to admitting defeat.  She could not fight it forever.<br>\r\nShe was beginning to accept her present impossibilities, deciding that the shore was not meant for her- yet<br>\r\nElusive in gray, it was never there.<br>\r\nHere in the fray was where life was.

The dance. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe boat was near full of water. Wind and waves were against her. Yet , she was not against herself as when she first became aware of her lot. It was with  a strength and a will that she finally dove into the waves of discovery, somehow knowing the death she fought against  would not be as she expected; the safety she sought to hold was not the healthiest of goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to swim through the foamy sea, she had no clear sense of direction. Where this would bring her, but she had a sense of excitement now, acceptance that if she strove forward against that which she feared, that life would arise.  She stopped fighting herself. Amazingly, the more inner peace she manifested., the calmer the sea became and the clearer the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill tired, she kept swimming, motivated by the now visible shore, not of pure gray stone, but of soft sand, rock outcrops, lush greenery, blue skies: a land full of promise, a sign of reward.<br>\r\nAnd it was not that far away. The distance  between the jump and this new shore was very short  compared to the stone beach and her craft, when she was wrapped in veils of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the waves now aided her to the sandy haven, the trees whispered soft welcoming songs. All was serene, new and brimming with adventures to discover.  She was enthusiastic to move forward now to life here.  Although she had a sense now, that even this sojourn would be impermanent, she could accept it more easily, and hoped to be ready, less trapped by fear, for the next move in the dance of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n642 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></i></span></div></div>",

Together, we can get to my house and I will look at your ankle in better lighting than this.\"<br>\r\nSabrina whimpered again as she grabbed a hold of her Mother's arm tightly. \"Ow...ow..\" <br>\r\n\"Sabrina, it is not necessary to be a drama queen, cease with the whining!\"<br>\r\nThe wolf ambled along slowly beside the two women, he didn't dare leave Sabrina in Morgana's company alone. His mind was racing on what he needed to do next. Maybe he needs to reach out to his mate, but he hates bothering her with her new cub. There are so many enemies already in the village. His mate speaks very highly of Josette maybe he should go directly to her, she might be able to help Sabrina. So much to consider and so risky to leave Sabrina even for a minute with Morgana.<br>\r\nThe house is visible now, the wolf has never been allowed inside before. \"Oh Sabrina, I must act quickly before Morgana can cast her evil magic but what??\"<br>\r\nMorgana had been silent, studying Sabrina and the wolf, mulling over her suspicions. That wolf knows too much and if he can actually speak everything I have done will be at risk. I can't allow him to leave, but what excuse can I use to lure him inside. He will be instantly suspicious if I invite him to my house. I should simply kill Sabrina and make it look like the wolf did it and then kill him so everyone believes I did it to protect my daughter. But her father will know the truth, he has this uncanny knack of seeing me when I do things with Sabrina. Sabrina has lived this long because of his sixth sense about me. Dang, its life was so much easier before this all started, now I am in way over my head and the Shadow Beast will never let me out of our agreement.<br>\r\nIt\u2019s bad enough more and more archers from the other Houses are not taking up the challenge to destroy all threats to their run for control of the games.<br>\r\nSabrina stole a glimpse at the wolf and gave him a nod, assuring him that she would be fine. He needed to make his move to assure her safety and his. She could sense Morgana\u2019s thoughts which surprised her. She never had the ability before to read people\u2019s minds, let alone one of the evil fairies. Sabrina wished she could let the wolf know that she was reading Morgana\u2019s mind and she knew her plans. She feared Morgana could read her as well, so she needed to keep her as blank as possible. <br>\r\nSabrina asked to stop to rest before going into the house with Morgana, outside, she could see this strange green glow surrounding her but where did it come from. She looked again at the wolf and noted he spotted it too.<br>\r\nWhere did the glow come from, she did not have it before. Oddly, Morgana did not appear to notice the new coloring around Sabrina. This weird sensation that her father was near suddenly came in to her. What the heck, Sabrina pondered I did not tell my father where I was going or that I would be with my mother. How does he know these things?  Wait a minute, if I can read my mother\u2019s mind, can my father as well? Is that how he always knows when I have snuck off to see her. That would explain a lot, no wonder I can never get away with anything. <br>\r\n\u201cMorgana, my dear wife, how are you this fine day? I see Sabrina has come to visit you again against my orders. That child is defiant just like you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Sir Knight in Shining Armor Not, you have impeccable timing as usual. I should have known that I didn\u2019t need to get Sabrina back to my house, you would have appeared to rescue her again.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI am loving her father!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHumph!\u201d<br>\r\nThey continued to bicker back and forth to Sabrina\u2019s relief because she saw the wolf slip off into the woods. Phew, that was too close for comfort. Now, she was going to have to face the music with her father again. At least, now she knows that her mother is not to be trusted. Maybe this mind link will not end and she can use it to her advantage.<br>\r\nSabrina\u2019s father knelt over her studies, her ankle.  \u201cLooks quite swollen, can you move it?\u201d<br>\r\nSabrina gingerly moves her ankle from side to side and then up and down.<br>\r\n\u201cGood range of motion, any sharp pain?\u201d<br>\r\nSabrina shakes her no.<br>\r\n\u201cYou were lucky this time, looks like it is simply sprained. When I get you home I\u2019ll wrap it in a bandage to keep the swelling under control. You, young lady has to stay off that foot for a few days and let it heal.\u201d <br>\r\nSabrina nodded grudgingly. Meanwhile, Morgana\u2019s thoughts were racing on how to prevent him from taking Sabrina out of her reach. <br>\r\nMorgana offered to let Sabrina rest with her, they could all stay at the house. It\u2019s large enough for everyone.<br>\r\nSabrina\u2019s father immediately and rather harshly said, \u201cNO\u201d Then, seeing Sabrina\u2019s expression, he quickly said, \u201cshe will more comfortable in her own bed at home.\u201d With that he swooped Sabrina up into his arms and strode away from Morgana\u2019s domain.<br>\r\nMorgana fumed and paced back and forth. Then she noticed that the wolf was no where to be seen. Curse! Outwitted again, she was furious. Several other creatures in the woods scattered away quickly, avoiding Morgana\u2019s wrath.<br>\r\nSabrina safely tucked in her father\u2019s embrace dozed off against his chest, listening to the rhythm of his heartbeat. The wolf silently followed them, making sure they made back safely without any interference from the other houses. Then he was going to seek Josette and see what plan they could come up with to protect Sabrina from Morgana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1028 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He went to the village that Josette resided seeking her for assistance. In every direction, he discovered spies from the other houses were lurking making his mission difficult. He feared leaving Sabrina alone long with the spies from the other houses getting bolder and bolder.<br>\r\nHouse Martell boldly bragged of controlling Queen Hannah, and there were rumors that House Night Watch had the castle surrounded allowing no one in or out. House Stark has made it quite clear the baby has to die to pay for the wrongs against their house. Redalf was worried the most about House Hightower, they have become more and more secretive. He must protect his beloved Sabrina from the evil in every direction, the worse being Morgana. She will allege with the devil to destroy Sabrina.<br>\r\nRedalf reached out to some of his allies in the woods asking their assistance in getting a message to his mate and Josette. This was the only way he knew to foil Morgana, before she turned the tables of good and evil.<br>\r\nRedalf hurried back to Sabrina\u2019s house only to discover Sabrina had disobeyed her father again and fled the safety of his home. Youth are so passionate and headstrong, but often too quick to react without thought. Upon reaching the meadow, he picked up Sabrina\u2019s scent and that of Devay. He sighed deeply, relieved that Sabrina was not alone. As he kept tracking them, he lost Sabrina\u2019s scent, but steadily had Devay\u2019s, this worried him immensely. Her scent did not simply disappear into thin air. Something must be wrong, he rapidly increased his pace to reach Devay.<br>\r\nYes, he could finally see them ahead. Sabrina was riding on Devay\u2019s horse, sitting sideways on the stallion and Devay was leading the horse. This concerned Redalf, something must have happened while he was seeking his family. He hoped his friends would find them safely.<br>\r\n 331 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had this sixth sense that things were not like they appeared. Morgana was acting way too concerned, she offered to put this cream on Sabrina's ankle that would magically cure her, Radalf whispered so only Sabrina could hear him pretend to sleep. Sabrina did as her friend suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana fell asleep too, And Devay snuck off laughing, to join his fellow spies. He was very happy that he had both women out of the way. Radalf helped Sabrina out of the cottage just in time to see his mate and cub lope into the clearing. They rubbed each other, and caught each other up on the what they had over heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then they overheard Morgana cursing and calling out to someone. She wasn't at all the same, she was furious and threatened to kill everyone in her path. Vengeance was hers. The witch appeared and they began planning as Radalf and his family with Sabrina slipped away to the nearby cave. They discussed the situation but Radalf's son was impetuous bolting out of the cave when he heard Josh Davis singing IN MY LIFE. Radalf followed him to see his son caught up in a powerful net, the cub was struggling to get free. Radalf could hear men's voices in the distance so he slipped back to warn the others in the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRadalf's mate was weeping inconsolably the cub was her baby, Sabrina paced back and forth trying to decide what to do. We can't just let them take him, nor can we let Morgana slip away and begin her mission of murdering. We need numbers, we can't do this alone. I know he is your son but we must get to Laura and Steven or even Josette so we can put a plan in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRadalf's mate made the decision for them. You and Sabrina seek the others, I am not as known her in this parts, I will stay out of sight with our son so we know where he is being taken. I will not risk myself unless there is no choice but nor will I idly stand by and see my son killed for sport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRadalf reluctantly agreed with his mate that this would be the best possible situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean while, Devay appeared in the clearing with the cub, he studied the cub intently. He knew this was not Radalf, he wanted Radalf not this cub. Devay and his allies whispered among them selves trying to decide what was next, they needed to kill Radalf so they could easily get to Sabrina. He needed Sabrina it was his playing card with Morgana just in case the cream wore off before she took out all of his enemies. This was so good, she commits the murders, he gets what he needs and the path to the throne becomes less encumbered. That weak king would never see this coming especially with his noted weakness for Morgana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRadalf's mate heard the last of the conversation, she should let Radalf know what she overheard but maternal instinct told her that her son was still in jeopardy. She would linger here to see what would happen next. Devay threw a noose around her son's neck with the dang net still around him and hopped on his horse dragging her baby behind him. Her son's eyes were moist with tears but he did not make a sound, trying to be brave. They weren't moving at a fast pace which bothered her, they must feel mighty comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe discovered a squirrel friend and sent him off with a message to Radalf and Sabrina. Then proceeded tracking her cub just far back enough not to be seen. They didn't go far just as she worried. Soon they were in surrounded by House Arryn archers and the Night Watch archers. Great, the two houses have teamed up to over throw the kingdom.  Her baby was dragged to the center of the camp and left by the horses. The horses whinnied uncomfortably with the wolf beside them but finally settled down when one of the campers brought grain for them and water. The cub was so thirsty but no one offered him any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n711 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Wait a minute, she sought several of her squirrel friends and asked them to chew the ties of the horses so they could wander freely and untie her cub once the horses were free. The squirrels set off into camp, enjoying pulling the wool over those humans with there fancy weapons. Once the cub was free, she howled and the horses bolted and her son charged to his mother. Off they scampered in a hurry before the archers could take aim, while the squirrels chucked nuts at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey paused briefly so her cub could drink and then continued to join Radalf and Sabrina who were tracking Morgana and the witch. Predictably, Morgana and the witch returned to the village where she had all the children hostage. Sabrina promised to get them free once before but then things happened with Devay's arrival and she got side tracked. They probably won't trust her now but she is going to try. <br>\r\nThe witch pauses briefly, and nudges Morgana to wait. Damn it, Charlie! You scared us, we thought it was Radalf and Sabrina they slipped away again. I swear that girl has more lives than a cat does.<br>\r\nThe witch cackled, not when I am done with her.<br>\r\nharlie asked them if they had heard the news about a new king. The same council of brainless toads but a new king on the throne.<br>\r\nWhat?<br>\r\nWill he be easy to control?<br>\r\nMorgana spun glaring at the witch, No man has resisted me yet!<br>\r\nDamn, this changes everything now, we must focus on the kingdom, Morgana, we don't have time for spells and trapping that dang loose wire daughter of yours, if she is even yours? Even Josette is using powers that were bestowed on her to save the kingdom. And from what I heard your husband is riding with House Florent archers at this minute to protect the kingdom . If that isn't bad enough, the houses Martell, Hightower and Stark have allied in this last raid and dominated the games while you were prancing around  the countryside with Devay and your daughter.<br>\r\nThe witch had enough of Chuck's blatant rudeness to her Queen Morgana, she muttered something and when Charlie tried to speak again all he could do was ribbit, ribbit. <br>\r\nSabrina had to cover her mouth, she was about to burst out laughing. Radalf and Sabrina quietly backed up so they could whisper without being heard. <br>\r\nMy father has joined the games, I knew he could not resist once he felt the momentum of change happening. Now if only Calvin and Mitch had felt it too. They abandoned us this last weekend in the raids nor did they do the surprise reviews. What happened to hey, Lyn I can't get to it, then I would have covered the reviews at least we would had the points. I'm sorry Radalf I had to get this off my chest,  What part of team work is confusing? All I can say is thank goodness Cubby, Shelly, stepped up to the plate to help Joy, Cheryl and me. Come to think of it not a word from Shelleya either.<br>\r\nDo you feel better Sabrina?<br>\r\nNo Radalf but at least I have said my piece. What are going to do about the new king, and how do we free the children and stop Morgana.<br>\r\nWe are within a mile of the village, we could go there directly and then catch up with these three.<br>\r\nJust then Radalf's mate and cub joined them, Radalf lapped his son's face and then rubbed noses with his mate.<br>\r\nWe don't have time now to ask what miracle you pulled off. There is a new king, we must stop Morgana, the witch and Charlie.<br>\r\nCharlie, how did he get back into this, I swore house Arryn or was it Night Watch took him out of the game.<br>\r\nSabrina suggested that Radalf's mate and cub get to the village and set the children free while Morgana and the witch were out of the picture while they continued after Morgana and her crew. Maybe, we'll find my father in time and our house can score the victory after all. Look at out numbered we've been from the start and we shoved our way into third, anything is possible if you dream big.<br>\r\nRadalf nodded his nuzzle in agreement, nibbled his mates ear gently and then did the same with his son. Off they cantered to the village, while Sabrina and Radalf began tracking Morgana. Thankfully, they hadn't gone far because Charlie was ribbiting and hopping all over the place it was slowing them down. Morgana was heatedly arguing with the witch to turn him back into a human. But she was resisting! One thing for sure when witch got an idea in her mind she was letting it go for nothing.<br>\r\nRadalf and Sabrina silently followed them at just enough distance so as not to be seen or heard. Course as loud as Morgana was bitching that wouldn't require much effort on their part. <br>\r\nAt the edge of the woods, was a camp set up with.. Morgana was furious because she recognized his damn banner, why is her husband always in her path. She would have to think about what to do next.. The witch, Charlie and Morgana sneaked off back into the woods again.<br>\r\nSabrina nodded her head in excitement, her father's banner wove proudly in the air, and just to the right was House Stark's and on the left was House Hightower's banners, hmm Sabrina wondered what that was all about because the last she had heard it was everyone was in it for themselves.  Course, she also knew her father could be quite persuasive if need be.<br>\r\nRadalf nudged Sabrina out of her thoughts.\" I'll follow Morgana and crew, while you talk to your father and tell him what she is up too. When it is dark, I will find you. Make sure your father does not try to kill me again, please. \"<br>\r\nSabrina gave Radalf a huge hug, tousled his fur and then walked into camp. Immediately, she was surrounded by Martell archers, she put her arms up in the air. They led her into camp where Queen Aqua sat talking with her father. As she approached she saw House Martell's banner. Four houses together something must be going to happen soon, there is no way they would just hang on with so much at stake.<br>\r\nSabrina how did you get here? I was told you were dead by your Mother's hand!<br>\r\nNot even a hug beloved father, an the inquisition began, Sabrina was used to her father screaming and pacing in circles, the other houses were not. They watched him intently because normally he is a very quiet soft spoken man.<br>\r\nSabrina put her hands on her hips, clearly ready to do battle with her father if need be. She let him work himself out, venting, cursing and finally he threw his arms around in a bear hug so firmly her feet did not touch the ground.<br>\r\nSpeak child, tell me what happened to you?<br>\r\nMorgana has tried to kill me several times, Devay captured me and tried to woo me from House Targayen but Morgana intervened disrupting his plans and then some messengers from House Arryn appeared and he set a trap capturing Radalf's cub but then we separated and Radalf's mate rescued her son from Devay while Radalf and I tracked Morgana. She is not far from here, hell bent on \"killing the new king. Radalf is tracking her right now, he will be joining us at dark.\"<br>\r\nYou and dang wolf, I thought you called him Bo not Radalf.<br>\r\nNo actually Bo was Charlie, the witch turned him into a wolf cub to lead me into harm's way but Radalf rescued me. He really is loyal to the crown, you have to stop trying to kill him.<br>\r\nQueen Aqua asked where is Charlie now?<br>\r\nOh, no worries the witch got mad at him and turned him into a toad, all he can do right now is hop and ribbit.<br>\r\nThat amused Queen Aqua and Queen Elle immensely but not Queen Hannah.<br>\r\nWhat about the witch, tell me what she looks like?<br>\r\nSabrina thought for a second there are moments when she emits a shade of blue when she is angry or challenged.<br>\r\nQueen Hannah looked at the others, I believe that we all know who that really is!<br>\r\nSabrina, did Morgana ever call her by name?<br>\r\n\"No she always referred to her as witch. Come to think of it that usually irritated witch but she would sputter under her breath.<br>\r\nJust then the archers appeared with another wolf, a cub wolf and raggedly dressed children of all ages. They looked famished and exhausted but once they saw Sabrina. The circled her laughing and thanking her for not forgetting them. <br>\r\nQueen Hannah recognized one of the children, my sister's child. It can't be,...\"is that you child?<br>\r\nFetch Lady Leah, tell her to come quickly. <br>\r\nYes, mistress it is I. I am Rhianna.<br>\r\nLady Leah came scurrying into the group of archers and children and the leaders excitedly because the archer told her it was urgent that she appear.<br>\r\nRhianna stepped forward, Momma!<br>\r\nLady Leah could not believe her ears, her beloved daughter was here. It had been three years since she was stolen from House Stark. Other house members began searching among the children in hopes to find their own children while Lady Leah held Rhianna firmly in her arms weeping.  <br>\r\nCough, cough... Sabrina's father asked, \"where have you children been?\"<br>\r\n Morgana made us work in the mines, she fed us once a day scraps, we had not way to escape with the guards always there.<br>\r\nHow did you get free now<br>\r\nThe she wolf attacked several of the guards and the others ran off. The cub here led us out of the mines during the scuffle. The she wolf has several knife wounds but the cub is fine. We did not stop until we reached her, we've been following Sabrina's and Radalf's scent.<br>\r\nOne of the archers noticed the she wolf was bleeding profusely, he asked Queen Aqua, Could I get the medicine man for the wolf.<br>\r\nQueen Aqua looked at the others then gave consent. The cub stood with Sabrina not knowing what else to do. <br>\r\nSabrina stroked his fur and reassured him everything will be okay. Your father will be here soon. The cub laid down at Sabrina's feet falling promptly asleep much to the others amusement. The crowd was dispersing children were being led away to be cared for and it was just the leaders and Sabrina now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 1816 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Taking off the many layers of socks, she packed some snow into her hand, and pressed it against her foot. \"Ahh.\" a sigh escaped her lips.  The coldness of the snow felt good against the throbbing heat her injury was emanating.  <br>\r\nA shadow appeared at the entrance, less than ten feet away from where she was sitting.  Green eyes glowed, and Sabrina sat stark still when she saw the shadow.  A low growl came.  \"Hey there.\" She whispered.  Smiling at the shadow, she extended her hand forward, slowly.  \"I'm not here to hurt you.  Look!  I'm hurt myself.\"  Her ankle had begun swelling, and she muttered some expletives to herself.<br>\r\nA figure slowly came out, dark and looking defensive.  <br>\r\nSabrina stayed on the log.  Rummaging in her bag, she found a piece of stale bread, and broke off a large part of it for the newcomer.<br>\r\nHolding the bread in her outstretched hand, she watched as the figure, now fully emerged, slowly advanced towards her.  It was the wolf.<br>\r\nIt growled again, but she didn't flinch.   Stopping a foot away from Sabrina's trembling hand, the wolf dipped its head, as if to tell Sabrina, \"drop the bread.\"<br>\r\n\"You want me to put the bread on the ground?\"<br>\r\nThe wolf dipped its head again, as if nodding.<br>\r\nSabrina did as she was told.  <br>\r\nThe wolf snapped up the bread in one bite, munching and crunching on the stale slice.  Satisfied that it was not poisoned or compromised, the wolf crept slowly up to Sabrina, close enough so she could touch him, but far enough so she knew he was not planning to hurt her.<br>\r\n\"May I touch you?\" she whispered, her breath coming out in puffs.<br>\r\nAs if in agreement, the wolf raised its head, so its fur touched Sabrina's outstretched hand.<br>\r\nThe girl gasped in amazement, slowly bringing her hand down to touch the wolf's head.  Sliding her hand down the front of his face, she stopped at his nose.  \"May I name you?\"  She asked softly.<br>\r\nThe wolf got up and stepped closer to Sabrina.  He sat down and began licking Sabrina's swollen foot.<br>\r\n\"Hey, that tickles!  Okay, boy, I'm going to name you.\"  Thinking for a moment, she proclaimed, \"Rendalf.  You are my wolf protector, wolf shield, so you will have a protective name.\"  Looking down at her foot, she noticed the swelling had noticeably subsided.<br>\r\nRendalf kept licking Sabrina's foot, and Sabrina stroked his head lovingly.  <br>\r\n\"I don't understand why people don't like you, Rendalf.  I think we're all just misunderstood.  People want to kill you because they think you want to kill them.  But in reality, you just kill them because they want to kill you!\" She exclaimed.  \"It's just an endless cycle of death, bloodshed, and violence.\"  Her voice dropped down to a whisper.  \"All because of a simple misunderstanding.\"<br>\r\nRendalf whimpered, finding Sabrina's discarded footwear and dragging it back towards her foot, as if signalling for her to put it back on.  <br>\r\nShe hadn't noticed, but the wolf had long stopped licking, and her foot's size was back to normal.<br>\r\nRaising his head to nestle against Sabrina's stomach to get her attention, Rendalf nosed his new female companion.<br>\r\n\"Aww, you're not violent.  Not at all.\" Sabrina hugged his head.  \"You're actually a very sweet wolf.  So protective of me.\"  She reached down and arduously began putting back on her socks and shoe.\"I wish Father understood that.\"<br>\r\nRendalf's ears suddenly pricked up, as if sensing danger.  He bounded away from Sabrina's embrace and growled at something Sabrina couldn't see.  He followed the path Sabrina had taken from her place, and continued growling and barking at some invisible aggravator.  <br>\r\nSabrina couldn't help but wonder why Rendalf was suddenly so defensive.  Who or what was out there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 652 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

I know you're out here somewhere!\" It was Sabrina's father.<br>\r\n<i>Oh crap</i>.  Sabrina thought.  <i>It's Father.  I'm going to be in so much trouble.</i><br>\r\n\"You'd better not be with the wolf!\"<br>\r\n<i>Busted.</i>  Sabrina heard Rendalf growling and barking at her father.  Half tempted to call him off and half tempted to disappear into the woods, Sabrina sat on the log while she decided what to do.  <i>Disappear into the woods forever and live there, as a rebel?</i> She mulled over the thought in her head a little too long, because Rendalf's growls and barks became louder, she realized her father had found her.<br>\r\nRendalf bared his teeth at Sabrina's father, snapping his jaws ferociously while trying to guard Sabrina.<br>\r\nSabrina reached out and stroked Rendalf, soothing him and calling him off of her father.  \"Hey, Rendalf.  It's okay.  Shhh.  Hey boy, hush.  It's just my father.  He's just my father.  Not someone to be afraid of.\"<br>\r\nSabrina's dad went from angry to incredulous.  \"You caught and tamed a wolf?\" he asked his daughter.<br>\r\n\"More like he came to me when I was in distress, and we made friends.\" replied Sabrina.  \"Wolves aren't all bad, you know.\"<br>\r\n\"And you named it.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  His name's Rendalf.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever.  You're coming back with me, Sabrina.\" <br>\r\n\"No I'm not.\" This was the first time Sabrina had openly tried to defy her father, and it was not a pleasant feeling.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes you are.\"<br>\r\n\"Not without Rendalf.\"<br>\r\n\"That thing will eat everyone alive.\"<br>\r\nSabrina glared at her father.  \"I'm eighteen, a legal adult.  I can do what I want.  I'm not going back with you.  I'll go back when I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n\"Like hell you'll go back when you want.  Consider yourself lucky I didn't throw you out of the house the moment you turned eighteen.  Either you come back with me now or you try your luck and come back when the gates open again.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, hmm.  Hard decision.\" Sabrina remarked sarcastically.  <br>\r\nHer father crossed his arms, waiting for her answer.<br>\r\n\"I'm staying with Rendalf.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine.  Don't expect me to come out when you realize you miss home.\" Her father warned.<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Sabrina knelt down and hugged Rendalf.  <br>\r\n\"How do you expect to survive out here?  You have no bow, no arrow, the ground is frozen over...\"<br>\r\n\"Look, I appreciate your worry, but I'll be fine, okay?  Weren't you going back home?\"<br>\r\n\"You have no meat.  No food.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine, Dad.\" <i>Ahh, crap.  Dad's right.</i>  her mind said, though she would never say it out loud.  \"I can live off snow.  That'll turn into water.  I can live longer without food than I can without water.\"<br>\r\n\"You will need food eventually.\" He pointed out.<br>\r\n\"And I will find it\" she replied stubbornly, refusing to give in or compromise unless her father suggested it first.<br>\r\nSabrina kept stroking Rendalf, who, at the moment looked like an oversized lap dog, lying on Sabrina's lap.<br>\r\n\"You're spoiling it.\" Was all her father said before shaking his head and turning away.<br>\r\n\"Whatever, Dad!\" Sabrina yelled back.  \"Well, Rendalf, looks like it's just us two now.  What do you say we go find some meat and food?  I don't want to steal from others, so I think we could venture into the forest a little bit and see what we can find.\"<br>\r\nThe duo set off through the opening in the woods where Rendalf had gone out.  The wolf led the way, careful to choose paths that would be easier on Sabrina's foot, which at that point, he knew, was not completely healed yet.<br>\r\nRendalf kept his nose towards the ground, sniffing out possible prey.  <br>\r\nSabrina, following the wolf, kept her eyes open for anything far off in the distance or up in the air that Rendalf possibly did not see or hear.<br>\r\nTogether, Sabrina thought, they made a good team, searching for food and trying to survive in the winter's snow.

Rendalf howled. Sabrina laughed. Just then a tree limb fell and she it hit her ankle. Same ankle she had just hurt. Sabrina groaned. Rendalf came back to her and removed the branch off her ankle. That felt better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Rendalf.\" Rendalf licked her face. Sabrina giggled. Rendalf put his big paw on her ankle and massaged it. She didn't even feel the other pain now. She tried to get up but couldn't. What was she going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they heard a horse and Sabrina's blood ran cold. A beautiful black horse with a knight was on the horse. Rendalf ran up to the knight and the knight petted him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is your female friend?\" The knight asked. He had jet black hair, medium build and a big smile. Sabrina had never seen a man so handsome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sabrina. You know Rendalf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rendalf? You named him. I am Devay and I am your knight in shining armor.

I'm Sabrina!\"<br>\r\nA little bit of recognition showed in Jennifer's face, but Tyler still looked as confused as before.<br>\r\n\"I used to play with you when we were younger.  Before... this.\" she gestured around to their surroundings, and pointed at the hut.  \"That.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?  We've always lived here.\" Tyler spoke up.<br>\r\n\"No, you used to live in the village.  With me.  With Samantha.  With Kyle.  With Frederick.\"  Sabrina named a few people who also used to play together with them.  <br>\r\nJennifer slowly began nodding, remembering the names, but not who they were.  <br>\r\nTyler just shook his head.  \"No, I don't know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\nDevay smiled, satisfied.  This was exactly what he was planning, and everything was falling into its place.  All he needed was an argument to spark the fire.  <br>\r\nJennifer shook Tyler, trying to make him remember.  \"Samantha.  The short, really skinny girl.  Right, Sabrina?\"<br>\r\nShocked that Jennifer suddenly remembered, Sabrina nodded.  <br>\r\n\"Black hair.  Very long.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"<br>\r\nTyler closed his eyes, trying his best to remember.  <br>\r\n\"Kyle.  Kyle Kyle Kyle....\" Jennifer also closed her eyes, squeezing them shut, as if that would conjure up the image of the boy.<br>\r\n\"Tall.  Taller than the rest of us.  His hair was a mop.  He had freckles and red hair and everyone thought he was cursed.\" <br>\r\nJennifer's eyes flew open.<br>\r\nSabrina's jaw dropped.<br>\r\nTyler opened his eyes again.  \"Was I right?\"<br>\r\nSabrina nodded emphatically.  \"Yes!  That was him!\"  Probing them both more, Sabrina asked, \"Do you remember Frederick?\"<br>\r\nJennifer frowned.  \"The name sounds so familiar....\"<br>\r\n\"He had blonde hair.\"  Tyler said, his eyes closed.<br>\r\n\"Go on...\" Sabrina encouraged.<br>\r\n\"Fast.

Very short.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\nSabrina nodded, excited her friends remembered.<br>\r\nDevay muttered a string of choice words, frustrated that his plan was now shattered.  \"All right, visiting time is over.\" He ushered them back into the hut.  \"Sabrina, follow me.\" he commanded.<br>\r\n\"Where?\"<br>\r\n\"Stop asking questions and just follow.\"<br>\r\n\"I think I have a right to know where I'm going.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine.

Sometimes, she wished that she was back home with her father but his new female friend she didn't trust. She was hoping that her and Devay had a future.

The games are intensifying now that The Keeper of the Realm has disclosed the standings. Time is narrowing now, and it is any team for themselves to the end. Sorcery, lies and misdeeds will rule the course ahead for Sabrina and her loved ones. <br>\r\nMorgana does not know yet that Sabrina can read her mind. Morgana has thrown her cards in with Martell, thinking with Aqua's youth that she will be able to control her easier. Hightower's Elle is older and more worldly wise and Morgana didn't think she could manipulate her as easily.  Sabrina knows Aqua is stronger than Morgana believes, she will not relax her guard, but Elle she doesn't know what to think. Darlene thrives in the dark world, she is the one that Devay says not to underestimate, she rises like a blood moon when you least expect her.<br>\r\nRedalf was tired from trying to find his mate, his mate while Sabrina rested at her home from her first ankle injury, but he didn't find her to his frustration so instead of leaving Sabrina alone, he returned quickly only to discover that Sabrina had disobeyed her father and had become injured a second time with a tree in the woods. Thankfully, he discovered her before Morgana or one of the houses archers. He moved the tree and was helping her when they came across Devay on his horse. Perfect timing, Sabrina could ride on Devay's beautiful Morgan stallion with its flaming red mane and lovely braided tail with House Florent's colors.<br>\r\nRedalf wanted to disclose the rumors to Sabrina but hesitated to let Devay know he could speak, only Sabrina knew his cautiously guarded secret. Luckily, Devay had also heard the rumors of a baby discovered in the woods by a wolf. This baby allegedly held the key to the games and Morgana was intent on claiming the baby as her own.<br>\r\nRedalf hoped the baby was found by his mate, she would assure its safety. He left messages with some of the wooded creatures to have Josette come to meet them at Devay's cottage. Josette would know how to reach his mate. They must find a way to work together to bring down House Martell and Morgana for Queen Hannah. <br>\r\nWow, he hadn't thought about his beloved queen in some time, he missed the times she would caress his fur and whisper I love you's in his ear. Sadly, Redalf looked at Sabrina and Devay feeling the struggling emotions surrounding them both, each afraid to declare their true feelings with so much at risk. <br>\r\nThe cottage with the lovely trellises of grapes and the flower gardens reminded Sabrina of pictures she had seen in France's countryside.  The cottage had white shutters with wrought iron hinges. The cottage was painted a lovely sky blue with a Fieldstone walkway and a stone wall surrounding its garden. There were oversized benches randomly places among the blooms and a basket lying on a bench with grayed worn lace gloves.  Her father talked of building them a cottage like that before things went sour with Morgana and he became more involved in the court politics, Queen Hannah has a way of captivating men. Course, from what Sabrina heard from the villagers when she was last home about the hags really slapping the heck out of the queen in a frenzied fury over latest ruling against the villagers. Queen Hannah had her hands full with the villagers, she didn\u2019t have time or the backing to prevent the houses from over throwing her castle if they struck.<br>\r\nDevay helped Sabrina down from his trusty steed and shyly took her hand, leading her slowly to the bench in his mother's garden before she passed away. The roses were lusciously blooming, the aroma intoxicating. Sabrina smiled at Devay with her haunting green eyes, her blond hair streaming down her back sparkling with the suns caress. Devay swallowed nervously, but did not speak only nodded to the bench. Sabrina sat and patted the bench next to her for him to join her. <br>\r\nRedalf laid down just outside the trellis, he wanted a clearer view in case any of the spies were near by. His ears were perked and he turned his head skimming the wooded area with his eyes intent on their security. One of the rabbits hopped out into sight and began nibbling on the grass beside Devay and Sabrina. Redalf growled and the rabbit quickly scurried away.<br>\r\nSabrina gently scolded Redalf reminding him that all the creatures need to eat. Redalf sighed longingly thinking of his mate, and his own son.

She hated her home. So did her mother. Devay held Sabrina's hand and they went into the cottage. The furniture was fancy. Blue velvet winged tip chairs, a red velvet love seat, the walls were decorated with unicorns, fairies and flowers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This cottage is a gift from the King.

Sabrina's grandmother had warned her many times about the dark. And it had worked because Sabrina was afraid of the night, especially after she and her dog Bo had gone into the woods years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank the stars, her fairy mother Celine had protected her dog from being pounced upon and shredded up for stew. But now her mother was dead. The wolf had killed her, so she heard. How does one kill a fairy? Besides, there was no proof. But Sabrina was determined to find out for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wished Bo was still alive. He'd been an old dog when she was little and died shortly after the incident in the woods. Her father promised she could have another dog, but he never followed through. She loved animals so much. And she still thought about the wolf in the woods and wondered if he could be tamed. Perhaps he'd been cursed by an evil witch and there was an antidote to remedy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina's father said she would never amount to anything because she was too kind and giving and always found the good in people and animals. He had told her the world was full of evil people who would just take advantage of her.

The ribbon was a gift the day you were born, Sabrina; a token of our first girl child. He was so moved by you, my love. And he does like you...

Tell me, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the stranger left, your father told me to go to his home where you would be, and bolt the door. And not let anyone in,\" Bonnie continued. \"He also told me to give you his love and he was sorry for not being kinder to you since your mother... disappeared. He never said where he was going, but I just bet it had something to do with that man with the glowing eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder...\" said Sabrina. \"Have you heard of Arwod the Sorcerer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie jumped back, eyes bulging like saucers. \"Shush, child.

He'd just stepped out from the tavern door, appearing ragged and in need of sleep, but he looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sabrina...love... y-you shouldn't be here,\" he stammered, eyes glazing. \"Go back home, b-before it's too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, we need to talk,\" Sabrina told him, taking his arm and leading him to a nearby bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not here,\" he said in a low voice. \"Follow me. Quickly.\" With renewed strength, he led his daughter down an alley way then pulled her into a vacated room smelling of must and filth. An old mattress lay on the floor with a single blanket, threads barely keeping it together, and with holes worn through. The scent of urine lingered in the air from the pot in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father... do you... stay here?\" Sabrina managed, trying very hard to breathe with shallow breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"At times, yes, daughter,\" he said. \"It's a hide-a-way, you might say. But no matter. It's safe enough to talk now. Speak quickly. Time runs out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina handed her father the pink ribbon and strands of her mother's hair. \"Mother said to show this to you and you would believe me... that I've seen her.  Today, Father. I've seen Mother today in the woods...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his hand up for her to stop talking, while swiping a tear from his cheek with the other. He pressed the ribbon and hair strands to his heart. \"Can it be so? Celine lives? Your mother is truly alive, not dead by the monster wolf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's true,\" Sabrina told him. \"And she rides the wolf, Father. They are friends, she and Koal. He's kind, unlike the rumors, and only attacks those who attack him or are a threat to Mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she still cursed?\" he asked, though he knew the answer because she was not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but she sends a message to you,\" Sabrina told him gently. \"She loves you very much and says one day you'll both be together again, once we find a cure to the curse, of course. And that's why I'm here, Father. To find a remedy to the curse. Do you have any clues, or do you know where Arwod the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUSH!\" he shouted, though regretted it right away. \"Do not say his name in case his spies linger near. They would jump at the chance to take you away to the evil sorcerer. Apparently, one has noticed you entering the woods, and has threatened to take you once he finds you. Bonnie was supposed to keep you bolted in, safe from harm. I see she has failed my request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my fault, not hers,\" Sabrina admitted. \"She tried very hard to keep me there, but I have a mission to accomplish. I want my mother back and I want my parents to be happy and together again. Is that too much to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not, child,\" her father said, though he should not have called her child. She had grown lovely and delicate, graceful and beautiful, just like her mother. It was painful to look upon her at times, reminding him of his loss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what shall we do?\" Sabrina asked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must not act hastily,\" he warned. \"In fact, we must not act at all, till just before dawn. The spies should be asleep by then, tired of watching for you to escape, and we will slip away. I know of a cave, well hidden, where we can spend tomorrow deciding our next move.\" He lifted the ribbon and hair. \"There is magic in this, Sabrina. Did you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"No. Mother said nothing about magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps not magic in the woods, but the hair from a fairy holds special powers, though I'm not sure what they are. We will find out soon enough, daughter. Now we must rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina glanced down at the filthy mattress. \"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" he said, reading her thoughts. He opened a closet door and pulled out another blanket, along with a pillow. \"Here,\" he said. \"The floor is hard, but these are clean at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[692 words] <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No words were spoken between the two travelers as they headed for rocky hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Sabrina felt they could speak, at least at a whisper. \"How much further?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you're tired, Daughter. We've a ways yet. I'm surprised...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father,\" Sabrina interrupted. \"I'm not tired, I'm hungry. I haven't eaten since breakfast yesterday, and only a wee bit of cheese and stale bread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" her father reached in his pack and pulled out a very bruised and shriveling up apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina decided not to complain. She buffed it up the best she could to make it look more inviting, though it hadn't helped much. Food was food, at this point. At least there were no worm holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" she whispered even lower than before and crouched down along with her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced around, but saw nothing. \"We'd best keep low,\" he said. \"We'll pick our way through the larger rocks till we reach the passageway. The cave is just past there, high and overlooking a valley no one inhabits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not, Father?\" Sabrina was curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many say it's evil. But we need to pass through it. Keep your fingers crossed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping low to the ground, father and daughter at last made it to the passageway, where they stood up and stretched, feeling safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cave's over there.\" Her father pointed to a hidden crevice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Father, look!\" Out from the cave came a giant wolf. It stared their way, frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have nothing to fight a wolf with,\" he told his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fairy hair, Father! Use the fairy hair tied up in Mother's ribbon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up the small bundle and the wolf stood, and slowly approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not working,\" he said, backing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is working,\" said Sabrina, smiling. \"It's Mother's wolf, Koal!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But the wolf did not smile back. Instead, he seemed to be changing shape. He stretched his neck like a pipe and howled. Immediately two big horns appeared on his head. Then he stretched his paws and his nails started growing until they were ten inches long. Then he opened his mouth and growled, as his fangs grew the size of a grown-man\u2019s arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Sabrina said, knowing she had no escape, but her only way out was to use her head. \u201cOh, how wonderful! Just how did you do that?\u201d Hadn\u2019t her fairy of a mother told her in a dream that even the wildest of beasts could be tamed by a loving and gentle hand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf seemed to be taken aback. He stared at her with--what seemed to Sabrina as- love-starved eyes. As Sabrina looked back into the beast\u2019s eyes faking bravery, her mother\u2019s relentless, demanding voice whispered in her ear. \u201cRemember your fairy blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairy blood? Now what was that? She drew in a ragged breath as her flesh prickled cold and damp with perspiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Sabrina, Sir,\u201d she said in gentle voice, but without letting her eyes hold any deference in the least. \u201cThe daughter of Celine, the fairy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s eyes\u2019 lofty arrogance in their intense yellow brightness paled then, and he sat on his haunches, still staring at Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCeline,\u201d he moaned. \u201cOh, that Celine! She broke my heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard my mother was wasted here in the woods,\u201d Sabrina continued. Surely, she didn\u2019t want to say \u2018you\u2019d eaten her.\u2019  That would give the beast new ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA fairy is never wasted or eaten, little Halfling,\u201d the wolf said. \u201cFact is, she had had it enough with her mother-in-law and the man she called husband, in fact, the entire humankind who neither respected nor understood her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Sabrina was truly surprised. Had her grandmother and father not told her the truth? \u201cShe is still\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she still is here living in the woods in the fairyland with her kind, but as much as I\u2019ve chased her, and I am using the word chase metaphorically, she wouldn\u2019t even look at me. My stalking her annoyed the queen of the fairies, so she gave me this shape. Anytime I approach someone I like, I turn into a beast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShucks,\u201d said Sabrina, taking a deep breath, \u201cThat means you like me. I like you, too. In fact, I like all animals and all life. It\u2019s not fair what has been done to you. Just because you liked someone\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh to be so na\u00efve! I had sensed that about you, little Halfling. But life is never about fairness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish it were,\u201d said Sabrina. \u201cAfter all your mistake was loving someone. As far as the reality of justice is concerned\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeings like us make their own reality, little Halfling. We love for reasons even unknown to our own selves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, whatever the reason, still it is not fair. I am still young but I always think of love to be the hardest thing to find and keep. Love can make the worst things, the most unimaginable things, tolerable. I think it is even better than hope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope, yes,\u201d intoned the beast. \u201cNow looking at you, I am finding the hope. The hope for this curse to be lifted of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo there is a possibility, you say, as hope means possibility,\u201d said Sabrina. \u201cCan you tell me what you hope for? Maybe I can help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you can, but I don\u2019t want to tell you what, because if I ask for the cure from anyone, it undoing of the curse won\u2019t happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean, I have to figure it out for myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, exactly. And yah! Spells are fought with other spells.\u201d The beast smiled now, baring sharpened fangs that looked fatal to Sabrina, and she wondered if the beast was eager to sink them into her. \u201cYour fairy blood,\u201d the invisible Celine whispered in her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour smile hides your pain and tears, and what your outward appearance now shows to the world is only a cover that conceals what\u2019s inside. I respect that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am lined with scars and wounds that go all the way to the foundation of my existence,\u201d sighed the beast. \u201cBut no one sees the real me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but I do, and I think you are a wonderful\u2026entity. Very lovable, in fact. If you would only let me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast\u2019s eyes suddenly shone as if stars from the night sky had fallen into them. \u201cI would let you do anything you wish, anything you\u2019d like to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I, then,\u201d Sabrina swallowed her next breath\u2026\u201dstroke your fur and hug you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast nodded his eyes tearing up. <i>He is such an emotional beast! Maybe all beasts are really very emotional, and we don\u2019t understand them,</i> thought Sabrina. She believed now that she was in no danger. This beast could, would not, harm her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stumbled momentarily toward the beast, losing her stride, but regained her balance almost immediately, approaching him with unobtrusive steps. With a modest smile, she reached to his powerful neck and put her arms around it. The beast growled, but Sabrina kept her arms tight around the beast. Then she bent her head and put her lips on the smelly, rust colored fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast let out a first rasping, then a bubbling sound. His body quavered and his eyes rolled in their sockets. The horns on his head, his claws and fangs retracted, and his size grew smaller. Now he was a small wolf, not the ferocious one Sabrina had first encountered, and definitely not a beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf turned and licked Sabrina\u2019s face, just like Bo used to do. \u201cThank you, Little Halfling friend of mine,\u201d he yapped. \u201cYou are a brave one. And you broke the curse. I will be in your debt, forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did I do that? I don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d Sabrina was amazed at the change in the beast, but more shocking was the fact that she was the one who had caused it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou loved the unlovable,\u201d the wolf said. \u201cBut come to think of it, I think you are a glutton for punishment. This could go either way, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI trusted you, Sir,\u201d Sabrina said. \u201cAnd even in your beastly state, I loved you, truly loved you, as you have something gentle about you like my Bo had once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, my Halfling Friend,\u201d said the wolf. \u201cLet\u2019s cut through the chase. First, please stop calling me sir. Lofty titles are difficult on one\u2019s shoulders. Give me a name, so you can call me with it or just call me Friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina thought she should name her wolf as\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1120 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is just a word but it came out of your lips in loving kindness. I\u2019m Adolfo, then, from this day on. What a historic moment this is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Sabrina. \u201cHistoric it is. I have never seen anything like it. The question is, where do we go from here and is there anything else you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf licked her face again. \u201cI should be the one to ask you that, after everything you did for me. But I think if not the whole good thing you did for me, I can at least pay you back a little bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pay me back or anything.

You, of all creation, sensed how the fate of the curse worked. There was no changing of it. You didn\u2019t know it consciously, true, but the inner you did. And that made all the difference.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me, Adolfo,\u201d Sabrina said, \u201cWhy should a friend feel indebted to his friend just because of a little favor? You really shouldn\u2019t feel this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese words just show how gracious you are, Sabrina. You chose love, the dignified kind of love; knowingly or not knowingly, it doesn\u2019t matter. As there is also the fake kind of love that ruins and destroys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can only feel one kind of love,\u201c Sabrina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is good and mighty in itself, but not all beings respect that. You have much to learn, my friend.\u201d The wolf stood up on all fours. \u201cI have much to teach you. Let me show you the art of the fight. I know it better than anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t like fighting,\u201d Sabrina said. \u201cI don\u2019t like wars. I don\u2019t like hurting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue. Wars do not make one great. But at least you should learn about keeping your distance from the frightful stuff. Besides, knowing how to fight doesn\u2019t mean you actually have to fight. It is important for those who want to hurt you to know that you can fight. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes a bit of sense, but starting down that shady path may not be a solution for me,\u201d Sabrina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t use the might, ever, if you don\u2019t want to, but having the enemy know you have strength gives you an edge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may have a point, there, Adolfo.\u201d Sabrina finally settled into an accepting state of mind. \u201cI may just learn what you can show me if not for fighting but for anticipating the next move of the other person.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, too,\u201d the wolf said.

They heard the wolf howling and the children hadn't been seen in a week. Sabrina's father asked her if she had disobeyed him. She told him she had and how she was recued by the fairy Celine. Sabrina's father knew his daughter didn't lie. Why did the fairy protect Sabrina and her dog and not the Owens children? Why indeed? The fairy was Sabrina's mother and the wolf had got her but now she had power over the wolf and she would make sure that wolf never got her daughter.

He gathered the children around him and knelt in front of them. <br>\r\n\"The storm will only get worse, young ones.\" The three children's eyes widened with terror. Redalf reached out and rubbed each small head in turn. \"Worry not, children,\" he said. \"I will protect you.\" <br>\r\nAll around Redalf and the three children the wind blew. Trees bent, flying leaves filled the air, and the rain fell sideways. The children shivered and huddled together. <br>\r\n\"Come, we must try to get back to my cave before the storm worsens,\" Redalf shouted to be heard over the screaming storm. \"Hold hands,\" he said and watched as each child grasped the hand of the child next to him. \"That's it, now hold tight.\" <br>\r\nRedalf stood and his gaze scanned the area. The track he had taken to get here had nearly been hidden by the falling leaves and debris. Just then a patch of sky opened above him and he could see the golden rays of sunshine and then he knew.<br>\r\nHe took the hand of one of the children and turned. Pointing, he shouted, \"That way. Hold tight to each other and we shall be safe.\" <br>\r\nAs Redalf led the children into the forest, he heard the shriek of terror. \"That's a wolf,\" he mumbled, but the wind took his words away before the children could hear them. \"Hurry, children,\" he said as he picked up the pace. <br>\r\nRedalf held his open hand above his eyes so that he could better see where he was going. It wasn't too far to the cave where he had left Sabrina asleep, safe in her bed. Before the thought left him, another piercing howl filled him with fear. But a new fear now weighed heavily in his stomach as if he had swallowed a rock. <br>\r\nSuddenly, Redalf stopped and cocked his ear in the direction of his cave. \"Helllllp!\" The word carried on the wind and set Redalf on edge. <br>\r\n\"That's Sabrina, children,\" he shouted. \"We must hurry, my Sabrina is in danger.\" <br>\r\nThe children senses Redalf's fear and began to pull away from him. <br>\r\n\"No, no,\" he shouted. \"You must remain with me, or surely you will perish.\" He knelt and gazed into the blue eyes of a young girl. He had to try to calm the children, Sabrina's life might depend on it. <br>\r\n\"What is your name, little beauty?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"I'm Daisy,\" the little girl said shyly. <br>\r\n\"Okay, Daisy, I need your help.\" Redalf let his gaze scan the other children's eyes. \"Do you think you can help me?\" <br>\r\n\"I'll try,\" Daisy said, as she placed her thumb into her mouth. \"What should I do?\"<br>\r\n\"Hold my hand tightly, Daisy,\" Redalf said. The small soft hand slid into his palm and it felt like a bird's wing instead of a young girl's. \"That's right Daisy,\" he said. \"Now take the hand of the boy behind you and then tell him to take the hand of the boy behind him.\" <br>\r\nRedalf watched as each child regained the hand of the child in front of him. He understood that his plan had worked. Seeing Daisy's courage to move forward gave the boys courage also.<br>\r\n\"Okay, we much hurry.\" <br>\r\nThe small line of children followed Redalf as he made his way toward his cave as quickly as he dared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe storm seemed to slow, as Redalf and his young charges reached the edge of the mountain where Redalf's cave sat hidden by layers of branches. For a moment there was complete silence. <br>\r\nI'm too late, he told himself as fear ripped through him. But suddenly he saw movement inside the cave. It wasn't more than a shadow, but it told Redalf that someone, or something inside the cave was alive. <br>\r\n\"Sabrina!\" he shouted. When there was no response, he shouted again, \"Sabrina!\" <br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Redalf, Sabrina could not answer him because she was locked in battle with the biggest wolf she had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina picked up a rock lying at her feet and threw it at the beast's head. Her eyes widened when she watched it bounce from the wolf's head with no harm done. The wolf shrugged and a sinister smile widened on his face. His mouth opened revealing two rows of large sharp teeth. A dark, viscous liquid dripped from the wolf's black lips. <br>\r\nThe wolf growled, it's foul smelling breath billowing over Sabrina, knocking her to the ground. <br>\r\nAs the wolf approached Sabrina, she saw the glint of metal on the other side of the cave. But the wolf snatched her by the hair and lifted her off the ground. Holding her up to his eyes, his slimy tongue slid along his lips, a hungry look etched itself into his glistening eyes. <br>\r\nSabrina tried to pull away, but the wolf's hold was too strong. She watched in terror as the wolf's mouth began to open. Slowly, ever so slowly, more and more teeth were revealed as the wolf prepared to eat Sabrina. Just as she felt herself being move to his mouth, in fact the point of one tooth had begun to penetrate her skin, she felt the wolf shudder. His eyes glazed over and his grip loosened. <br>\r\nSabrina wasted no time in scurrying into a dark corner and watched the wolf. He seemed to be injured. But how? she asked herself. She hadn't been able to hurt him. She had no weapon. She had been resigned to be eaten. <br>\r\nSuddenly a shadow passed over her. Sabrina looked to the cave entrance and saw a large body silhouetted against the grey sky outside the cave. <br>\r\n\"Sabrina!\" <br>\r\nSabrina recognized the voice. She was saved. <br>\r\n\"Redalf?\" She shouted. \"Is that you Redalf?\" <br>\r\n\"Where are you, Sabrina,\" Redalf shouted. \"I can't see you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n976 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

But the wolf must have realized what Redalf was doing, because he quietly rose to his feet and slowly, quietly, made his way to where Redalf stood. The wolf's head still stung from where the big rock that Redalf had thrown hit him. Bright spots circled inside his vision, and there was a distinct ringing in his ears. <br>\r\n\"Sabrina?\" Redalf called. <br>\r\nSabrina heard her name being called, but she was still in shock, and the word sounded filtered, as if it was coming from far away instead of just a few feet from where she stood. She tried to clear her head, she wanted to find out who was calling out to her. It might be some of the children calling her, and she definitely didn't want the wolf to get anywhere near the children. <br>\r\nSabrina felt a presence move past her. She couldn't see it, but she felt it, and she could smell it. The memories of the last two days flowed through her, and she tried to place the odor that now filled the air around her. Suddenly her eyes grew wider.<br>\r\n\"The wolf,\" she said. Even in her dazed state of mind she knew the wolf was nearby, she could feel him, she could smell him. <br>\r\nSabrina placed her palms flat on the ground and pushed herself into a sitting position. She looked around and in the darkness she could see the dark shape of the wolf as he slowly made his way to the cave entrance. <br>\r\nYou have to stop him, she told herself. But how? She used her hand to search the darkness around her. A rock, a tree limb, a heavy tool, surely there was something she could use to protect herself and Redalf.  She sighed when she found nothing. <br>\r\nIn the dim light coming from the cave entrance, Sabrina could just make out Redalf as he stood. He wobbled and had to use his hands against the cave walls to steady himself. With the wolf only a few feet away, the last thing Redalf needed was to fall down. <br>\r\n\"Redalf,\" Sabrina called out. \"Can you hear me, Redalf?\" Sabrina gazed around the darkness of the cave but saw nothing. <br>\r\n\"I'm here, Sabrina,\" Redalf finally called back. \"Are you alright?\" <br>\r\nSabrina felt her emotions soar when Redalf's friendly voice found her. She hoped it was not premature, but her fear began to slip away from her.  Renewed by Redalf's presence, Sabrina also found new strength. She stood, holding the wall with one hand to steady herself, and peered through the darkness.  <br>\r\nTentatively, Sabrina took two strides in the direction of the cave entrance, but suddenly there was a dark form blocking the way.<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" Sabrina said, worry once more edging its way back into her voice. <br>\r\nIt happened in an instant. Sabrina didn't notice the quick movement, but the breeze created by the wolf's quick movement blew some strands of hair off Sabrina's face. <br>\r\nThe moving air cooled her, but when she realized she was now blocked from reaching the cave's entrance, fear again gripped Sabrina. <br>\r\n\"Redalf?\" Sabrina paused, waiting for Redalf to reply. When he didn't, she called him again. \"Redalf... Redalf? Are you alright?\"  As Sabrina turned the corner of the cave, she could see that the wolf had blocked Redalf. Sabrina's heart sank like a stone in water when she realized she was now doomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sabrina could retreat, Redalf used his hand to indicate that she should back away. It appeared to Sabrina that there was about to be a horrendous fight, and she didn't need to be in the middle of it. <br>\r\nThe two massive beasts circled each other like two crazed animals. The wolf grunted, a viscous fluid dripped from his teeth, and a bright light shone in his eyes. The wolf's pointy, sharp claws glistened in the dim light of the cave. <br>\r\nAcross from him, Redalf circled in the opposite direction. It was as if the two antagonists were dancing. but it would be a dance to the death. As Redalf moved into a shadowed corner of the cave, he disappeared. When the darkness spit him out, he stood in the dim light and Sabrina saw the large sword in his hand. The wolf saw it too. <br>\r\n\"Hold on a minute here,\" the wolf said. Confusion had extinguished the angry light that had been in his eyes. \"A sword?\" he asked Redalf. \"And where di you get that?\" <br>\r\nRedalf chuckled, his laughter menacing, dry, and hateful. \"I had it hidden in my leggings, but it doesn't matter.\" <br>\r\n\"Why doesn't it matter?\" the wolf asked. The wolf seemed ready to talk now that he had seen the sword. Where before he was all about hate, hurt, and annihilation, he now sought to quell the anger building in Redalf's eyes. <br>\r\n\"Maybe we should take a minute to talk about this,\" the wolf said. He held his glistening claws up to his eyes, and said, \"my claws are no match for that sword in your hands.\"'<br>\r\n\"Too bad,\" Redalf said. <br>\r\n\"Give me a chance, will you?\" the wolf was obviously scared now. With each step to the side he now took, he also took a half step back.<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Redalf said. \"My mother once told me that God didn't make everyone physically the same.\" Redalf smiled shyly. \"But he did make equalizers.\" With that Redalf held the sword up high where the sharp metal edge glinted in the dim light of the cave. <br>\r\n\"Can't we talk about this, Redalf?\" the wolf asked as he backed away from Redalf.<br>\r\n\"Talk?\" Redalf scoffed. \"Talk is for sissy's.\" <br>\r\nRedalf let out a grunt of surprise, and then stepped forward to where the wolf had stood only a minute before. \"Where did he go?\" Redalf asked no one in particular. He turned to Sabrina, and said, \"Where is he?\" <br>\r\nSabrina looked around the cave. It wasn't a big cave so if the wolf was there he would e easy to see. He would be easy to smell. But Sabrina saw nor smelled anything. <br>\r\nRedalf let the sword fall to his side and he entered deep into the cave. His steps echoed against the wet walls. <br>\r\n\"Look here, Sabrina,\" Redalf said, the excitement now returned to his voice. <br>\r\n\"What is it, Redalf,\" Sabrina asked as she reached where Redalf stood. <br>\r\nRedalf pointed with his sword. \"Look, a trap door.\" <br>\r\nSabrina followed the sword to its tip and then saw the crease in the rock. \"Is that what that is?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, and it's well hidden too.\" Redalf smiled. \"I guess the wolf didn't want a fight afterall.\" <br>\r\nFrom some place far back in the cave, the voice of the wolf echoed and moved forward. The words stiffened Redalf's back with resolve.<br>\r\n\"I will live to fight another day!\" The wolf's words riled Redalf. But he knew he could do nothing about it. The wolf had managed to escape again. \"Drats!\" Redalf said. \"Now the children are in danger again.\" <br>\r\nRedalf tossed the sword aside and turned to Sabrina.<br>\r\n\"It's time we left this place.There is nothing for us here. The wolf is loose again, and we must protect the children.\" <br>\r\nJust then the sun rose high enough that its rays flooded the cave with yellow light. Sabrina followed Redalf to the cave entrance and squinted when she stepped into the sunlight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1246 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

In the early morning hours, the sun would slowly awaken the life in the forest.  As the sun made it\u2019s slow arc across the sky, the rays would pierce the denseness of the woods and strike the face of the chimney and burn geometric shapes into the stone surfaces.  <br>\r\nAs Sabrina turned her face to the sun, she would be wide awake standing in the gardens of her home staring at the forest.  It was time.  The whispers of the forest would lead her to the hallowed ground.  Sabrina breathed in the dank and heady scents of the forest.  She honed her senses to the musty scents of the untamed, and listened carefully for the soft rustle of the forest creatures who were either her guide or her enemy.  <br>\r\nThe fox with the golden eyes blocked her path.  She allowed the fox to circle her and take in her scent.  The sly one pranced to a point several steps in front of Sabrina, stretched the forward paw in front and the other bent as if to bow his loyalty to Sabrina.  <br>\r\n\u201cThank you, faithful one.  I command you to lead me to the hallowed ground.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt is my honor to obey.\u201d  The fox wheeled and darted into the center of the forest.  Sabrina labored to keep up.  The rivulets of perspiration soon saturated her garment, causing her tunic to cling to her body slow her footsteps.  <br>\r\nThe fox leaped as high as he could, catching the shelving of the stone wall and using it to launch himself over the stones.  Sabrina ran to the other side, but the fox had disappeared.  She collapsed against the coolness of the boulders, resisting the desire to allow fatigue and sleep to overtake her.  She whispered into the darkness that surrounded her, \u201cKeeper of the Hallowed Ground, I am here to claim the powers that are to be entrusted to me.\u201d<br>\r\nThe moonlight took that moment to brighten to reveal the enchantment of this place.  The smallest of creatures one by one presented their gifts to Seer Sabrina.  As each paw touched the hem of her tunic, her strength, knowledge and joy increased.  <br>\r\nMorning broke, allowing the jeweled pattern of the chimney surface to reveal itself.  Sabrina recognized the pattern.  During the night, Sabrina was aware that the wolf of her youth had been circling.  She could feel it\u2019s hot breath near her neck.  \u201cWolf, bow to your master!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNever!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCease!\u201d<br>\r\nWhile the wolf remained frozen in mid-attack, Sabrina, pressed the jeweled stones in the order presented in her dreams.<br>\r\n[word count:  448] <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each revealed the secrets of the ages that gave her insights into the coming troubles that would present in ensuing days.  She feared them not.  It would only be short-lived.

Her hair would be the source of her foresight and would need to be protected from those seeking to harm her.  She next released the bands that would be placed at her wrists and ankles.

We must establish a sanctuary in the village.  The fairies must be protected and that cannot happen if the alter remains here.\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cThe aerie of the Thunderbird is close.  They will bring the Gristalka with them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThose are demon creatures!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo.  They are not.  Their appearance may give that impression.  They use their horns for carrying large objects.  They use their hands for hunting and gathering.  They use their hooves for rapid movement.  They are well muscled and large body for battles and the hunt.  They do not seek to cause harm, but they will protect themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIn other words I need the Thunderbirds because I cannot find the Gristalka without them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou are wise, Seer Sabrina.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet.  I just know that time is short and this must be completed quickly.  Call the Thunderbirds.\u201d<br>\r\nThe fox stepped forward with some hesitancy.  \u201cThe Thunderbirds will feast on the fairies.\u201d<br>\r\nSabrina snapped her face to the wolf to allow him to refute the accusation.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Seer, they will have to be bound by your commands.  The fairies must hibernate while the Thunderbirds are active.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou are to keep no secrets from me.  What shall I call  thee?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRonan.\u201d<br>\r\nSabrina looked at her fox.  \u201cWhat be thy name, fox?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFareed.\u201d<br>\r\nSabrina eyed the fox and knew he did not speak truth.<br>\r\n\u201cFareed is the name my mother gave me.  Others use a different name for me.  Please do not address me with those names.  They are displeasing to me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFareed, send a message to the fairies to cover themselves until the Thunderbird and Gristalka have completed their duty.  Ronan, go to the land of the Thunderbirds and summon them to this place.  Go, now to complete that which you have been tasked to do.\u201d<br>\r\nSabrina lowered herself on the hearth and arranged her skirts around her.  <br>\r\nIn time each of the woodland creatures brought a gift of nourishment for Sabrina.  She accepted offerings of berries, herbs and acorn cups of water.  She did not need these, but acceptance of the offerings would form the bonds needed in the coming days when her leadership would be tested quite consistently.<br>\r\n  [word count:  604] <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was chilled and ached from sitting in the same position for an extended period.  The only thing that brought her to sleepy wakefulness was the chatter of the squirrels flying and scampering above her, and the hail of acorns being pelted at her.  She scratched her head where the netting was fastened to her tresses.  The scrolls were correct.  When she touched her hair, she could see future events.  In this case, it was a huntsman approaching rapidly.  <br>\r\nSabrina clicked the gold bands at her ankles.  She noted the highest branch that would support her weight and within a moment had transgressed several feet and ten feet off the ground.  The woodland creatures were seeking cover in the various hidey holes and brush that they could find.<br>\r\nSabrina wrinkled her nose.  How could one person give off such a stench?  As surreptitiously as possible, she moved a cloth over her nose to block the foulness emanating from the huntsman.<br>\r\nThe huntsman dropped his crossbow as he approached the stone structure.  He recalled it as a chimney, now it looked more like a sacred cache.  His band would be sorely disappointed that they were not the first to discover the trove of valued items.  He turned in a complete circle and caught the scent of woman wafting on the breeze.  Whoever she was, she was close.  <br>\r\nHe examined the stonework more closely.  Running his finger over the mantle, his fingers drifted over a strand of long dark hair.  As he held it up to the sunrays he could see it curl and reflect the light of the sun.  He could also tell where the maiden had secreted herself and the valued treasures she had close to her person.  He would not be able to win an honest battle against this one, but fairness was not his strong suit.  <br>\r\nHe took his pouch from his leather waistband into which he deposited the newest treasure for safekeeping.  His brethren would be pleased that he knew the identity of the new Seer.  They would have to be a little more careful in capturing this Seer.<br>\r\n[word count:  364] <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sabrina was not inhaling deeply, but she did need to compose herself before entering the village square  The villagers would recognize the symbols of her leadership and want to celebrate.

Sabrina stepped with firm feet upon the hearth of the chimney to await the gifts.  She plucked the jeweled stones from the mantel one by one, allowing each new power to be released into her spirit. The final stone, released the wolf from his trance.  <br>\r\nUpon turning, she acknowledged the wolf\u2019s four-point bow and allowed him to touch the hem of her garment.  <br>\r\nThe presence of the evil one would soon be upon the village.

The wolf moved to the hearth of the chimney to let out his mournful howl.  The woodland creatures stopped in mid-activity and shuddered at the wolf\u2019s howl.

The irregular ground was covered in wolf scat, making an already slippery surface even more slippery. <br>\r\nNo one knew how many wolves lived in the cave. But cave was a misnomer. Lair was the word that better described where the wolves lived. <br>\r\nBut then Sabrina pranced out of the lair, her dark eyes shone like black marbles as the sun reflected from them. Her paws, small but hiding powerful claws, grasped the wet, dank rock as sure footed  as any animal that ever lived. <br>\r\nAs her dark gaze scanned her surroundings, Sabrina hunted for the fairy princess Celine. But Sabrina knew that the princess of fairies lived high in the canopy. Turning her gaze skyward, Sabrina tried to locate Celine. She would befriend Celine, given the chance, but only to serve her own purposes. <br>\r\nSabrina shook of last night's dew and took a few tentative steps out into the verdant field. She looked around at all the surrounding beauty. There were the beautiful and mighty oak trees. Their roots spread twice as far as their widest branches, she had been told. And then there were the streams, brooks, babbling and non-babbling, as well as the rivers with their swirling, twirling waters. Sabrina loved it all. But she most loved that so many other wolves were at her back and call. <br>\r\nYes, she told herself, there were definite benefits to being the queen of the lair. Isn't it wonderful, she asked herself, that because she was queen she could get a hairstyle without waiting in line. And wasn't it wonderful that she didn't need dinner reservations at any of the popular restaurants. All she had to do was show up and she would be shown to the best table in the restaurant. Yes, she told herself, being queen had its advantages. <br>\r\n\"Life is good,\" Sabrina shouted and listened to her words echo across the glen. \"Yes,\" she mumbled to no one in particular, \"Being queen was definitely more beneficial than being one of the worker wolves, the ones who got their paws dirty hunting for fresh gazelle, hyena, or the occasional elephant. <br>\r\nSabrina yawned with a feminine groan. \"I should prepare myself for my morning nap.\" <br>\r\n\"But you just woke up, Princess Sabrina,\" Maurine said. \"The canopy fairies are going to think you're lazy.\" <br>\r\nSabrina gaze a short wave of her hand. \"Let them think what they will,\" Sabrina said. \"I don't have to answer to any of them.\" <br>\r\n\"That's true, Sabrina,\" Maurine said. \"But you know, appearances are important.\" <br>\r\n\"Appearances?\" Sabrina said, shocked. \"I don't have any appearances.\" <br>\r\nMaurine shook her head, and said, \"Maybe you should go lie down, after all.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, I think you're right,\" Sabrina said and headed back inside the wolf lair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count 471 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

High above the canopy the sun shone in it's relentless pursuit to turn everything hot. Ray of sunshine bore down on the thin, and not so thin, prickly leaves covering the tree tops. But it was that very warmth that kept life in the canopy in operation, and operating at its best. <br>\r\nSome people thought the jungle was too hot, and for animals and insects that were indigenous to the colder climates like Antarctica, the north pole, Alaska, and some parts of northern Canada, life is the canopy would be difficult, if not down right deadly. But the creatures living in the canopy were not from Antarctica, the north pole, and nor were they from northern Canada. They were from right there in the canopy. <br>\r\nLizards, spindly creatures, some crawling, some spinning a web to hang from, others slithering along the leafy growth. <br>\r\nBut all of the life in the canopy came to a stop when a giant shadow dimmed the sun. Every insect, every animal, every living creature, no matter where they hailed from, knew not to be noticed by the princess of fairies, Celine. <br>\r\nCeline was not a dangerous ruler of the canopy, no, she loved the world up high where she could see for leagues in every direction. She liked that she could look off to the west in the early mornings and watch the mountains be silhouetted by the rising sun behind them. She would watch as steam rose from the verdant mountainsides as the sun's warmth turned the early morning dew into vapors. <br>\r\nCeline liked looking towards the south as well. She could make out the outline of the canopy as the sun rose and revealed the natural beauty of the canopy. But Celine also loved the view to the east, where the ocean waves slipped ashore with a whisper, before washing back out to sea, leaving a lattice work of foam in its wake. But it was the view to the north that Celine loved the most. <br>\r\n\"Everything wonderful and beautiful can be found in the north,\" Celine would tell anyone willing to listen. \"From the north comes the very things that keep the canopy rich and vibrant,\" she said to her assistant fairy this morning. \"Look, don't you see it?\" Celine pointed her dainty finger in the direction of the tall trees dripping with life. <br>\r\n\"But I fear the cold, princess Celine,\" her assistant Maurine said. \"And the cold can harm us.\" <br>\r\n\"Not if we are prepared, Maurine,\" Celine said. \"Gloves, hats, heavy, fur lined boots and ear muffs,\" Celine said as if reading from a shopping list. \"those are the things that protect us from the cold.\" <br>\r\n\"But we have no means of warming our dwellings, princess Celine,\" Maurine said. <br>\r\n\"Must I think of everything?\" Celine said, annoyance edging her voice. <br>\r\n\"But,\" Maurine said and smiled. \"Didn't you say that handling all of the canopy's problems is why you were paid,\" her smile widened, \"The big bucks?\" <br>\r\nPrincess Celine smirked. \"Don't make me mad this early in the morning.\" She turned and looked north. \"You wouldn't want me to spend the day with ruffled wings, now, would you?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course not, dear princess Celine.\" <br>\r\n\"I remember once,\" Celine said, \"When I had to spend the entire day wearing wrinkled fairy wings. OMG, it was terrible. The prince, you know how he is, well, he was so upset.\" <br>\r\n\"What did the great prince do to the great princess?\" Maurine asked. <br>\r\n\"Don't you think that question is a little personal?\" Celine asked princess Maurine. <br>\r\nMaurine gazed at Celine for a long second before answering. As she waited for the right words, Maurine wondered how this ditsy blond had become a princess. Maurine knew of so many fairies that would gladly take Celine's place at the throne. Fairies that were pretty, well coiffed, and would love to show the prince a good time. And some of those pretty fairies would make wrinkled fairy wings the last thing the prince saw when they stepped into his presence. <br>\r\n\"It wasn't a personal question, my princess,\" Maurine said with more than a little sarcasm in her voice. \"I wasn't asking about THAT!\" <br>\r\n\"THAT?\" Princess Celine queried. \"What THAT are you referring to?\" <br>\r\nPrincess Maurine shook her head, almost violently, trying to dislodge the thought that she had herself voted to make princess Celine the most trusted, most pampered, most loved of all the fairies of the canopy. <br>\r\n\"What was I ever thinking?\" Maurine said just under her breath. <br>\r\n\"What?\" Celine asked. \"Did you say something, Maurine?\" <br>\r\n\"Nothing important,\" Maurine said. <br>\r\n\"So what was your question, anyway?\" Celine asked.<br>\r\n\"I was wondering what the great prince has to say about the fact that you had wrinkled fairy wings all day.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Celine said. \"That's not a personal question at all.\" <br>\r\n\"You are right,\" Maurine said. \"As always.\" <br>\r\n\"Are you being sarcastic, princess Maurine?\" Princess Celine asked. <br>\r\n\"Why, princess Celine,\" Maurine said. \"I don't even know what that word means.\" <br>\r\n\"Sarcasm?\" Celine asked. <br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Maurine said. \"I have no idea what that means.\"<br>\r\n\"it's simple,\" Celine said. \"It means, biting, cutting, mordant, bitter, derisive, ironic, sardonic, maybe even cynical.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Maurine said. \"Then maybe I was being sarcastic.\" <br>\r\nPrincess Celine glared at Princess Maurine for a short minute, the crooked a finger at her. \"Come with me, princess Maurine.\" <br>\r\nThe two princesses, Maurine and Celine ducked under the canopy and disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count: 922 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One night, Sabrina was feeling particularly sad about her mother.  \"I do wish she was here right now!\" She sobbed to Bo.  Winter nights were the loneliest for her, especially because sometimes her father had to help with night patrols, leaving Sabrina at home all by herself.  She wrapped herself up in her blanket and rocked back and forth.<br>\r\nBo, sensing Sabrina's sorrow, scampered over and whined softly.  Prodding his head under Sabrina's blanket, he nuzzled the girl's leg.<br>\r\n\"Aww, thanks Bo.\" Sabrina hugged his neck.  Patting the bed, she invited him up.  \"C'mon, boy!\"  After Bo leapt up, Sabrina cuddled him until she began drifting off to sleep.  She dreamt of years past, when her mother was not a fairy, and still alive as a human.  <br>\r\n\"Sabrina, you must help your father find out who took the Owens children.  Once you find them, you will find all the other missing children.  Hurry, before it's too late.\" Sabrina dreamt her mother had come back and visited her.<br>\r\n\"But what do I do, Mother?\"<br>\r\n\"Your father has joined the night patrol; he is helping others find the children already.  However, he has an idea that he believes nobody else will listen to, so he keeps quiet.  You need him to voice his idea to you and leave the night patrol.  Together, you and he shall set off to find the missing children.  His plan may be right; he just needs to voice it.\" Morgana prophecied.<br>\r\nSabrina woke with a start.  \"Daddy?\" she cried out, rubbing the sleep from her eyes.  She listened as her voice echoed through empty halls.  Daddy was not back yet.<br>\r\nHugging Bo tighter, Sabrina lay down, and sleep overcame her as she waited for her father to return from the night patrol.<br>\r\n\"Time for school, Sabrina!  Bo, you should know you're not allowed on the bed!  Down, boy!\" Sabrina's father's voice softened when he saw Sabrina hugging Bo as she slept.  Patting the dog, he apologized.  \"Sorry, Bo.  I should've seen that it was Sabrina and not you.  Sabrina!\" he shook his daughter's shoulder.  \"Sabrina, time for school, my little one.\" <br>\r\nSabrina moaned softly and stretched out.  <br>\r\nBo licked her face before jumping down.<br>\r\n\"Bo!\" Sabrina giggled.  \"Not nice!\"  Sitting up in bed, she hugged her father.  \"Good morning, Daddy.  How was the patrol last night?  Did you find anything or anyone yet?\"<br>\r\nHer father sat on the bed, where Bo had been lying just a moment ago.  \"No, sweetie, we haven't.  I have an idea for what we could do, although it doesn't seem like the team finds it a good idea.\"<br>\r\n\"What's your idea?\"<br>\r\n\"I believe it's the wolf taking our children, and so I would like to offer a meat sacrifice to the wolf.  Once he comes out, and eats the meat, we'll follow him back into his dwelling, where the children ought to be.  The Owens siblings, too.\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds dangerous, Daddy.  Can I help in any way?\" Remembering what Morgana had said in the dream last night, Sabrina thought this would be the perfect way to follow her mother's advice.<br>\r\n\"It is dangerous, Sabrina.  Which is why I will not be letting you help!  The best way you can help right now is go to school and do well in your subjects.\" He stood up, signalling the end of the conversation.<br>\r\nSabrina hung  her head.  <i>So close!</i> \"Yes, Daddy.\" <i>How am I going to make him let me help?</i> She wondered. <br>\r\nThat night, when her father left for the night patrol, Sabrina slipped out of bed and out onto her balcony, to watch her father meet up with the rest of the night patrol.  She couldn't hear what they were saying, though she saw her father talking, and everyone else shaking their heads.  Morgana suddenly appeared next to Sabrina.  \"Try again tomorrow, Sabrina.  If he gets frustrated enough, he might take you.  For now, follow his instructions and be a good girl.  You need your sleep if you want to have energy to hunt a wolf.\"<br>\r\nThe night came and went, and when Sabrina's father woke her up the next morning, she pleaded her case.  \"Please let me help, Daddy.  I promise I'll be an- an-\" Sabrina stumbled as she tried to find the right word. \"-an asset.  And I will follow your directions.  I'll do whatever you say.  And I won't complain.  I promise.  Just give me a chance.  Please?\" <br>\r\nHer father sighed.  \"I know I will regret this, but, grab your warmest clothes and pack them, because we'll go hunting together.\"<br>\r\nSabrina lit up with delight, and rushed to pack her warmest clothes.  <br>\r\nShe and her father left the house in silence, her father grabbing some meat from the meat house, and placing it far enough away from the house so the wolf would not attack them when he came out.  \"Now, it's just the waiting game.\" said her father.  \"We have to wait for the wolf to come.  And when he does.  Make sure you do exactly as I say.  Otherwise, it could lead to disastrous results.\" His voice was stern and serious.<br>\r\nSabrina nodded, sensing the gravity of the issue.  Settling down next to her father, she began to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count: 872 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sabrina sat with her back against the tree trunk, and felt the rough bark press into the soft skin of her back. Her father had found a pile of branches that he used to create a small area protected from view. When the breeze blew, dried, brown leaves that still clung to the branches shimmied and made a soft whispering noise. If it wasn't for the danger of their situation and the cold, Sabrina would have thought she was on a great adventure. But then, she told herself, this was a great adventure she was on. Sure, she knew that the wolf would be dangerous to deal with if it turned up, but her father was a big, strong man who knew how to deal with danger. She took a long, slow inhale to settle the butterflies roaming around inside her stomach and settled back against the tree trunk. <br>\r\nThe air was dry and cold, and although Sabrina had put on her warmest clothes, she wished she had brought a blanket with her. She shivered.<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Sabrina?\" her father asked without turning to look at her. His gaze scanned the woods, and occasionally he sighed. <br>\r\n\"I'm find, daddy,\" Sabrina replied. \"I'm just a little cold, that's all.\" <br>\r\n\"I told you to wear your warmest clothes,\" her father said, impatience beginning to seep into his voice. \"Maybe you should have listened to me and stayed home.\" <br>\r\n\"No, no, daddy,\" Sabrina said quickly. \"I'm fine. I can take a little cold, it's not like I'm some kind of sissy.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay,\" her father said. \"But remember what I told you.\" He scanned the ground again, and his silence put Sabrina on alert. She shrugged up onto her knees and sat back against her heels.<br>\r\n\"Did you see something, daddy?\" She asked. She followed his gaze with her own but didn't see anything that she thought would cause alarm. Her father had not answered her, so she asked again. \"Is everything okay?  Did you see something out there, daddy?\" <br>\r\n\"Shhh,\" her father said. He put his hand out and placed it on her shoulder. \"I thought I heard something. It's probably nothing, but lets keep quiet and see if we hear anything.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, daddy,\" Sabrina whispered. She reached out and covered her father's hand with her own, causing him to turn and smile at her. What he didn't understand is that she needed that contact with her father. Feeling his strong hand beneath hers, his fingers like thick rope, his wrist felt like it had been carved from a great big oak branch. It was his strength that would make her feel secure. She smiled back at her father and then turned her gaze outward to follow his. <br>\r\nThe sound came from their left. <br>\r\nSabrina and her father heard it at the same time, and they turned in unison to try to locate the source. Sabrina smiled inwardly. Daddy probably thinks that if he sees whatever is making that noise then he'll be able to hear it better. A moment later Sabrina realized that her thinking was a bit flawed. It was things like that that made her father treat her like a little girl. I better not let him know that I'm thinking like that, she told herself. Or next time he won't let me come with him. <br>\r\nSabrina and her father flinched when the sound of a low growl reached their hiding place. <br>\r\n\"Daddy,\" Sabrina said with a shaky voice. \"Did you hear that?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes I did,\" her father replied. \"But you have to be quiet. If it's the wolf we don't want him to know we're here.\" <br>\r\nSabrina closed her eyes and moved closer to her father until she was pressed against his side. She could feel his warmth, but it was his strength that made her feel better. It almost made her feel safe. But not quite. <br>\r\nSabrina heard soft taping. It almost sounded like heavy raindrops slowly hitting the bare ground. The growling stopped, but she thought she could hear something breathing. It was as if the sounds were coming from everywhere. <br>\r\n\"Daddy,\" she whispered, \"are you sure there is only one wolf?\" Her eyes grew wide as she looked around the clearing where they hid. <br>\r\n\"It is possible he has a family,\" her father said. His voice sounded far away, as if he was considering many things other than his daughter's voice. \"But don't worry,\" he picked up his rifle. \"I have this and there are plenty of bullets in it.\" <br>\r\n\"And you know how to use it too, daddy,\" Sabrina said with a hint of pride in her voice. <br>\r\n\"Okay, sweetheart,\" her father said. \"Remember to be quiet. If that is the wolf we are hearing then we need to make sure he doesn't hear us. We have to surprise him, not the other way around.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll be quiet,\" Sabrina said and made a motion on her lips like she was locking a lock, turning the key, then tossing the lock away. <br>\r\n\"Good girl,\" her father said when he noticed what she was doing.<br>\r\nSabrina's father knew that sounds traveled more clearly in cold, dry air then it did in hot, humid air. The sounds he was hearing, a low growl, soft taping on the ground, and a  whisper of what sounded like breathing, could be coming from someplace not too close, like in the woods, or it could be coming from much closer than he thought. He needed to concentrate on what was happening, but he didn't want to spook Sabrina. He wished now that he had insisted on her remaining home. <br>\r\n\"Too late for that,\" he mumbled. <br>\r\n\"What did you say, daddy?\" Sabrina asked. \"I couldn't hear you.\" <br>\r\n\"it's nothing sweetheart,\" her father whispered. \"Let's just be quiet for a minute. <br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Sabrina said softly.<br>\r\nThey sat quietly in their secluded little spot beneath the tall, stately oak tree. Heavy, thick branches reached out over their heads, and on a summer day the spot would be in dark shadow. The kind of place anyone would hope to find on a hot summer day. But it was winter, the branches were devoid of leaves, and Sabrina was thankful for the sunlight that made its way to the ground around her. She was cold, shivering actually, but she knew she would be much colder and much more uncomfortable if the sun wasn't shining on her. <br>\r\nSabrina noticed that her father's breathing had slowed, and it had also become more quiet because of that. Slow your breathing, she told herself, even though she had no idea about how to do that. But then she remembered the first aid class she had taken last summer at summer camp. Someone from the Red Cross had come out to the camp and gave a class on how to resuspe... no, that wasn't it. It was respective... No, she told herself, it was a word that sounded like that, but that wasn't it. She scolded herself; daddy had enough confidence in me to let me come along this morning, the least I can do is help in any way I can. If slowing and quieting my breathing will help, well then that's what I'll do. Suddenly she remembered. Resuscitate! Yes, that was the word, resuscitate. The Red Cross worker had given the class on how to resuscitate someone, like if one of the kids had fallen into the lake and couldn't swim. She hoped she would never have to use the mouth to mouth method she had been taught. The idea of touching a dead body grossed her out enough, but actually putting your mouth on the mouth of a dead person would give her nightmares. She was happy that by the time summer camp was over, no one had fallen into the lake. She shivered at the thought.<br>\r\n\"Are you still cold?\" he father asked when he felt her body shivering against his. <br>\r\n\"No, I was just thinking about kissing dead people,\" she said softly. <br>\r\n\"What on earth made you think about something like that?\" Her father turned and shot her a quizzical gaze. <br>\r\n\"I was thinking about a class I took in camp last summer,\" she replied. \"They taught us how to re-susa-<i>tate</i> someone who stopped breathing.\"<br>\r\n\"But it doesn't look like they taught you how to be quiet in the woods.\" His small smile let Sabrina know that her father was joking with her. Teasing her. <br>\r\nIt had been a long time since she had been teased by her father, and she missed it. She missed her father's teasing. She missed it because it made her feel loved. She had overheard her aunt Gertrude talking to someone a few years ago. Aunt Gertrude was listening to her friend tell her that she was sick and tired of being teased. <br>\r\n\"Who is teasing you?\" Aunt Gertrude had asked the woman. <br>\r\n\"My husband,\" she had replied. \"He's relentless. He won't leave me alone. He teases me all the live long day.\" <br>\r\n\"Be happy that he does, Flo,\" Aunt Gertrude had advised her friend. \"Men only tease women they love.\" <br>\r\n\"Do you think so?\" the woman had asked. <br>\r\n\"There's no doubt in my mind about it,\" Aunt Gertrude had said. \"Take my husband, Herbie. He never teased me, never even told me any jokes, dirty or otherwise.\"<br>\r\n\"So, what of it,\" the woman had remarked. \"Some men are just serious thinkers. You should count yourself as lucky to have a husband like that.\" <br>\r\n\"But that's my point, Flo,\" Aunt Gertrude said with a frown. \"My Herbie? He never teased me, and after twenty five years of marriage he up and left me.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, Gertrude, I'm so sorry to hear that,\" the woman had said, shocked. <br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter anymore,\" Aunt Gertrude said. \"Herbie died a year ago, and my new husband, my Seymore? Oh, he is forever teasing me.\" <br>\r\n\"He must really love you,\" Flo said.<br>\r\n\"Yes, he must,\" Aunt Gertrude said. She had slipped a green M&amp;M into her mouth and sucked it until it melted. <br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Sabrina's father said, surprise in his voice, and pulling her from her reverie. <br>\r\n\"What was what?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"That sound,\" her father said. \"It sounded close.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sabrina said and pulled her father's arm over her shoulder. \"I'm scared!\" <br>\r\n   <br>\r\nword count 1720 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

I know what I felt.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" her father said. \"I'll go take a look around.\" He crawled over to the edge of the little blind they had built and peered out.<br>\r\n\"You're not going to leave me here, are you daddy?\" Sabrina said as she wrung her hands. <br>\r\n\"I won't go far, I promise,\" he said. \"I just want to take a look around.\" <br>\r\n\"I want to go with you,\" Sabrina said. <br>\r\n\"No, I can't be worrying about you while I'm out there trying to find whatever it was that touched you.\" <br>\r\n\"But I don't feel safe in here, daddy,\" Sabrina said. \"Especially since I know something touched me.\" <br>\r\n\"Some <i>thing</i> did touch you, I'm not denying that,\" Sabrina's father said. \"But I don't think some <i>one</i> touched you.\"<br>\r\n\"Why don't you ever believe me when I tell you something?\" she asked. <br>\r\n\"It's not that I don't believe you, sweetheart,\" Sabrina's father said. \"It's just that you're young, excitable, inexperienced, and just a little na\u00efve.\" <br>\r\nSabrina glared at her father. \"Exciteable! Naaiiiievvv?\" Sabrina's breathing was coming in angry gasps. \"I can't believe you would say something like that.\" <br>\r\n\"Look, sweetheart--\"<br>\r\n\"Don't sweetheart me,\" Sabrina said and pouted. She crossed her arms over her chest stared at the ground as she spoke. \"Go ahead, go out there and search. You don't think you'll find anything anyway because you don't believe me.\"<br>\r\n\"I do believe you, sweetheart,\" her father said. \"And I'm going to search around and find out what it is.\" <br>\r\n\"Now you're patronizing me!\" <br>\r\n\"Where did you learn something like that...patronizing?\"<br>\r\n\"In school, where else, daddy?\" Sabrina leaned back against the tree, her lower lips pushed out in a pout, her arms crossed tightly across her chest, her gaze glued to the ground. In this position she watched her daddy crawl out of the blind and disappear on the other side. <br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and tried to listen for any sounds her father, or anything or anyone else would make. She slowed her breathing and listened. <br>\r\nThe sounds of birds chirping and calling to each other and the whisper of the breeze through the bare tree limbs quickly lulled her into a dream state. She thought about being in school and Mr. Lancaster telling them about being patronized. Mr. Lancaster was a very popular teacher and she was glad when she was assigned to his home room. He taught the students a lot of things, and the students loved him. As it turned out, he loved his students as well, and one student in particular. <br>\r\nOne day when Sabrina entered her home room expecting to see Mr. Lancaster, there was another teacher where Mr. Lancaster should have been.\" <br>\r\n\"Where's Mr. Lancaster?\" she asked the stranger.<br>\r\n\"I'm a substitute for him, miss,\" the substitute said. \"And what's your name little miss?\" <br>\r\nSabrina had dropped her school books noisily onto his desk and leaned in toward him. \"My name is Sabrina.\" She spoke with the kind of anger usually reserved for adults. \"I'm not miss, or little miss, or any other little weirdo names you can come up with because you're not smart enough to learn the names of your students.\" <br>\r\nThe substitute stood there, mouth agape, and the look in his eyes said that he knew he was in for a hell of a day. <br>\r\nWho was it that suggested that I substitute teach? he asked himself. When I remember who it is I'm going to kill him.<br>\r\nSabrina had given the substitute teacher a final glare and then picked up her books and walked quickly to her desk. The substitute teacher watched her, his mind searching for the name of the person who had told him that subbing was a good idea.<br>\r\nThe students never saw Mr. Lancaster again, but the rumors flew around the school campus.<br>\r\nMr. Lancaster's wife was having a difficult pregnancy so he had to stay home and help her.<br>\r\nMr. Lancaster's mother was in town and he couldn't leave her alone with his wife or she would kill her mother in law.<br>\r\nMr. Lancaster was sick. But the rumor whose origination came from a conversation overheard coming from the teacher's lounge was that Mr. Lancaster was spending twenty-five to life in the state penitentiary. <br>\r\nWhatever, the students never saw Mr. Lancaster again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina's ears perked up at the new sound, and the butterflies in her stomach took flight again. Someone, or something, was sniffing around. Sabrina knew that wolves sniffed, it's how they located food. Thinking of herself as food brought on a new fear in Sabrina's stomach. The sniffing sound grew closer and closer. Sabrina back away from the side of the blind where the sound was coming from. She put her hands on the ground and using the heels of her boots, she scooted back away from the sound. Sabrina's eyes widened when she saw the tree limbs she and her father had piled into a fence begin to shimmy around. She tried to push herself further away but her back was against the wall of heavy branches. She wanted to call out to her father, but that would only alert the wolf...if it was the wolf. <br>\r\nSabrina watched as a dark, wet nose poked through the leaves dangling from the branches. A long snout followed, then a pair of dark eyes pushed through. <br>\r\nSabrina screamed. \"Bo!  It's you!\" she shouted. Bo scampered to Sabrina and buried his nose in her hands. <br>\r\nOutside the blind, Sabrina's father heard a sniffing sound, and because he heard his daughter call out Bo, he thought it must be Bo who was sniffing around. Sabrina's father stood and walked to where the noise was coming from. As he turned past a large tree trunk his eyes grew wife. <br>\r\n\"You're not Bo,\" he said. <br>\r\n1055 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Oh no, I can hear it,\" Daddy,\" Sabrina said. She tried to control her shaking, she didn't want her father to know just how scared she way. But try as she might, she just couldn't stop her body from shivering. <br>\r\nThe sound had gotten louder. The growl had morphed into panting, but the sound of something making contact with the ground softly, like the sound a fat raindrops would make when they hit the ground, grew closer. <br>\r\n\"It is coming from behind us,\" Sabrina's father said. \"Keep down and don't say a word. <br>\r\nSabrina watched as her father slid into a prone position on the ground. He crawled along the ground until her was positioned to see behind the tree that hid him. Sabrina couldn't understand why, but when she saw the dirt that her father had ground into his pants as he crawled around made her think about how hard it would be to get the stains out of his pants. She recognized these strange thoughts as a defensive mechanism that her body used to keep from going into shock, or to keep a person from panicking. <br>\r\n\"I can see something moving in the woods,\" Sabrina's father said. <br>\r\n\"Is it the wolf?\" Sabrina asked, her eyes growing wide. \"Is it?\" <br>\r\n\"I can't make out exactly what it is, so I better not shot it yet.\" Sabrina's father put the tip of his forefinger in his mouth to wet it, then touched it to the front site of the rifle. <br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\" Sabrina asked.<br>\r\n\"Do what, sweetheart?\" he replied. <br>\r\n\"Wet your finger and then put it on the tip of your rifle.\" <br>\r\nHe looked back over his shoulder and shot her a thin smile. \"That's not the tip of my rifle, Sabrina.\" <br>\r\nSabrina felt fear rise up in her belly. She knew now that there was, in fact, something to fear. Her father never called her Sabrina unless he was angry, which he wasn't right now, or when he was nervous or scared, like he apparently was now. <br>\r\nThe best way to keep daddy calm is to keep him talking. She had learned about things like that from watching Miami Special Victims Unit. A hostage had kept the bad guy talking, so that he had to pay attention to the hostage, but he had also had to keep an eye out for the cops who were surrounding the bank building where he was. She remembered how the cops praised the woman for keeping her head and talking the guy down from his agitation. Sabrina knew that talking her daddy down would keep him calm. But she also knew that her father had to keep his concentration in case the sound they had been hearing was the wolf. The growling, the panting; it could all be sounds made by an animal--especially a wolf. <br>\r\n\"Daddy, I have to ask you a question,\" she said. <br>\r\nSabrina's father looked back at his daughter. \"What is it sweetheart? I'm a little busy right now.\" <br>\r\n\"I know, but I don't know what I should do.\" <br>\r\n\"About what?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, on Miami Special Victims Unit, the police captain praised the woman who had been held hostage for talking to the bad man, the one who had held her in the bank even though she had to leave because she had a date wit ha guy and--\"<br>\r\n\"Sweetheart!\" Her father interrupted. \"What is your question? I'm a little busy right at the moment.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, I was wondering if I should keep talking to you to help keep you calm,\" Sabrina said. \"You know, to keep you from panicking and doing something crazy...\" <br>\r\n\"Doing something crazy?\" he said. \"Sweetheart, why don't you get to the point?\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm trying daddy, I really am.\" She closed her eyes and wished her father would stop interrupting her. She let out a long noisy sigh as she opened her eyes. <br>\r\n\"So, should I keep talking to you to keep you calm?\" she continued. \"Or should I be quiet and hope you don't lose it.\" <br>\r\n\"Lose what?\" he asked, perplexed.<br>\r\n\"You know,\" she said. <br>\r\n\"No, sweetie, I don't know.\" He stared at her. \"Lose what?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Ummm, your shit!\" she frowned. \"I'm afraid you'll lose your shit.\" <br>\r\nSabrina's father stared at her with narrowed eyes and a deeply furrowed forehead for a short minute before he responded. But when he did his whisper sounded more like a hiss, as if a tire had sprung a leak. <br>\r\n\"I'm not going to lose my, my, uh, my shit!\" he said. \"Unless you keep talking. Then there's no telling what I might lose.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, that answers my question, daddy,\" Sabrina said shyly. \"From now on I'll be quiet.\" <br>\r\n\"I would appreciate that no end, darling.\" Sabrina's father turned his attention back to whatever was prowling around in the trees. <br>\r\nThe sound of distant thunder made Sabrina gasp. \"Was that lightning, daddy? she asked. <br>\r\n\"Sounds like it,\" he replied. Sabrina's father looked up at the sky and frowned. <br>\r\nAbove them, dark clouds began closing over the blue sky. To Sabrina's father it looked like piles and piles of dirty bed sheets. <br>\r\n\"What's going to happen if it rains?\" Sabrina asked. <br>\r\n\"I guess we'll just get wet.\" <br>\r\n\"But what about the wolf?\" <br>\r\n\"If it rains hard, the wolf will find his cave and get in out of the rain. They don't like rain, them wolves.\" <br>\r\n\"So that means we can go home?\" Sabrina smiled in anticipation of getting out of the cold. <br>\r\n\"Yes, that's what it means.\" <br>\r\nSuddenly, the sky turned dark and the sound of thunder cracked almost directly over their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nword count 942 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once her father left the room, she quietly slipped out of bed to put warm clothes on over her sleep clothes and stuck her head out the window.  \"Charie?\" She whispered, looking around to see if the fairy was still there.  <br>\r\nThe fairy flitted back.  \"Are you coming or not?\" she demanded.<br>\r\nBo emitted a low, deep-throated growl when the fairy came back into sight.  <i>Don't go.</i> He seemed to say.   <i>It's dangerous out there.

And no, I've never heard of that.  But I wouldn't want to kill any cats because I was curious!\"  Sabrina frowned, but obediently followed Charie, until the fairy led her to the edge of the woods.  <br>\r\nCharie didn't hesitate before flying into the darkness of the trees.  <br>\r\n\"There's <i>wolves</i> in there, Charie!

She kept seeing Charlie being carried off by the wolf, and it made her wonder if her mother was really her mother or not.  Daddy had taught her to be nice to everyone, no matter what.  Reflecting on the incident, Sabrina became more and more sure that what Morgana had done was not nice.  Opening her mouth to address her mother, Sabrina closed it again, realizing she didn't know how exactly she should address this new person in her life.  <br>\r\nMorgana's voice pierced Sabrina's thoughts.  \"Okay Sabrina, you may open your eyes now.\" <br>\r\nSabrina followed Morgana's instructions, and when she opened her eyes, she saw seven people- all around her age, and all emaciated almost beyond recognition.  \"W-Wh-what's going on?\" Sabrina's eyes grew wide with fear.  Looking closer, she realized two of the people were the Owens children, with whom she used to play with before they disappeared.  \"Sam?  Jenny?\"<br>\r\n\"Sabrina?\" Jenny choked out.  \"What are you doing here?  Get out before the witch turns you into one of us!\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, but what do you mean?\" <br>\r\n\"Go!  Now!\" Sam cried out.  \"she'll starve you and work you.  You'll become the wolf's slave.\"<br>\r\n\"No, that can't be true.\" Sabrina frowned \"Morgana's my mother!\"<br>\r\nEveryone gasped.  \"She's <i>what</i>?!\"<br>\r\n\"My mother\" she said simply.  \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\nCries rang out through the cavern.<br>\r\n\"She's evil!\"<br>\r\n\"She's a witch!\"<br>\r\n\"She's in league with the wolf!\"<br>\r\n\"She'll starve you half to death and make you work until you're dead!\"<br>\r\nOthers nodded in agreement at the last one, and it set off another chorus of exclamations.<br>\r\n\"She'll make you work for the wolf!\"<br>\r\n\"And if you aren't good, she might feed you to the wolf!\"<br>\r\n\"Once you're too weak, you're no good anymore and no use!\"<br>\r\n\"then it's off to the wolf with you!\"<br>\r\n\"She's not the Morgana we used to know.\" Jenny explained sadly.<br>\r\nSabrina's head spun with all the voices surrounding her and bouncing off the walls.<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the voices stopped.  It was so quiet that nobody could hear anything.  Everyone went back to what they were doing before Sabrina had arrived.  <br>\r\nTwo hands landed on Sabrina's shoulder.  \"Ahh, so I see you've met my little ones.\" Sabrina looked up, seeing Morgana behind her.<br>\r\n\"That's Sam and Jenny Owens.\" Sabrina said, not knowing what else to say.  \"They were my playmates at home after you left.  Then they disappeared.  Why did you disappear?\" She turned around to face Morgana.<br>\r\n\"They are indeed, Sam and Jenny Owens, Sabrina.\"  Morgana replied.  \"Would you like to say hello to them?\"<br>\r\n\"Why did you disappear?  And why am I suddenly here with you?  I don't even know what to call you or address you.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, you can call me 'Mother'.  or Morgana.  everyone here does.\" Morgana shrugged nonchalantly.  \"I prefer Morgana, though.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.\" Sabrina's face fell  She thought she would have a special name for Morgana- she <i>was</i> Morgana's real child.  She stumbled forward as Morgana pushed her back.<br>\r\n\"Now go say hello to your friends.\"<br>\r\nSabrina unsteadily stumbled forward a bit more.  <br>\r\n\"Don't trust her, Sabrina.\" Sam whispered, just barely audibly.  \"she'll turn you into one of us.\"<br>\r\nJenny added on \"You'll become one of us.  Unless that's what you want.\"<br>\r\nBravely, Sabrina whispered back, \"I'll save you.  Somehow.

She had been saved from the forest and the wolf once, and had been told several times not to go into the wood. Hadn't she learned <i>why</i> she'd been told that? That wolf had been terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm on the edge of the forest</i>, she thought. <i>I can see my house</i>. Sabrina twisted to look over her shoulder to make sure of that fact. Yes, she could see her house, the light shining like a safety beacon in her bedroom window. She could even just make out Bo with his paws up on the sill. <i>Surely, there can't be any danger to me here. I'm not in the woods.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light suddenly flashed in front of Sabrina's face and she let out a shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well?' the fairy asked, impatiently, stamping a foot in the air. 'Are you coming or not?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um, I...' Sabrina took a breath. 'Celine told me to stay out of the woods, and Bo... he didn't want me to come. I'm gonna go home.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're what?' Charie demanded, her glow brightening like a flame with more oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina drew up. She might have been just six, but she was bigger than the fairy. 'I'm going home,' she said. 'I can't come with you tonight, Charie.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Celine's in trouble,' the fairy said softly. 'Would you really...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't believe you.' Sabrina looked down her nose at the fairy. How amazingly easy it was to forget or simply ignore the fact that she had disobeyed her father to follow Charie not too many minutes ago. She shivered, realising she was out here in her pink pyjamas. 'It's too dark in there anyway,' she added. 'I'd lose you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I promised to keep you safe,' the fairy wheedled, realising the child was about to ruin the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina shook her head and backed away. 'I'm going now. If you want me to follow, come back at lunchtime.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina turned on her heel and then sprinted for the house as if her life depended upon it. Behind her Charie flared bright green and her wings momentarily frizzled to black smokey feathers. The girl didn't see this transformation and even if she'd turned instantly, the fairy was far quicker. Charie may have lost her tonight but her guise was still holding up and she might just come back tomorrow at lunchtime. She'd be hungry then, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharie watched the child fleeing toward the house like a banshee was after her, and then come to a skidding halt at the base of the tree outside her bedroom window. Would the girl try to climb it? She watched Sabrina looking up at the tree, saw the blasted dog hanging over the sill, sniffing the wind. The tree was climable - downward but not up, not easily anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would Sabrina do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(490 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sabrina stared up at the tree. It hadn't been that difficult to get down, just slow, but going <i>up </i>might be a different matter. Well, no matter how difficult it was going to be, she would have to try it. There was no way she could knock on the front door. Her father probably wouldn't even open it since he wouldn't be expecting visitors and visitors never came at this time of night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd anyway, how would she explain her sudden appearance outside when he'd left her snuggled up in her bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina's imagination flew off into many types of punishment she might receive for her disobedience, and that made her all the more determined that she had to climb the tree. Her nocturnal, external journey had to remain a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced over her shoulder briefly, turned back when she spotted the glow by the wood. The fairy was watching her. <i>Bet she doesn't think I can do it</i>, she thought glancing back up the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that tiny bit of a challenge, Sabrina walked around the tree eyeing the bark and the nodules where limbs had been severed years and years ago. The biggest issue would actually be having the height or wingspan to grab hand-holds above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she got <i>down</i>, didn't she? Didn't break any limbs or rip her pyjamas in the descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina heard a soft bark from Bo but didn't try to talk to him; that would only encourage him to be louder and having her dad find her half up a tree wouldn't be good. She sucked in a breath, walked around the old trunk once more and decided on where to start. Fortunately, and with great serendipity, the light spilling out her bedroom window lit the branches from above, making them quite easy for Sabrina to see and to consider which to take hold of and which to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree was pretty ancient; it had stood longer than the house had. It had always looked strong and barely suffered any damage when the storms came but sometimes rotten branches did fall. And always they were the ones that had seemed solid. Sabrina closed her eyes a second, heart fluttering at the thought of finding one of <i>those </i>branches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny normal child might have thought to just take whatever punishment would be meted out, but Sabrina had always been courageous, determined and precocious. Her disobedience would remain a secret, and that was just how it was going to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another breath, Sabrina got herself together. She knew the tree well, having talked to it often from her window, had always been nice to it and she didn't think it would let her down now. She reached for the next nodule, a split in the bark that she could wedge her fingers into and pull on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInch by inch, the six-year-old child climbed the tree. She didn't look over her shoulder again to see if she was being watched (she was, but not by the fairy), kept all her concentration on the climb, on carefully selecting branches to hang onto and branches to stand upon. The higher she rose through the tree, the more branches she had to choose from and the effort to climb became a lot more easy. Sabrina still climbed with great concentration though; it was a bumpy ride down if she should lose her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear Bo growling above her, probably thinking there was an intruder so she got out in a loud whisper, 'Sssh, Bo, it's just me!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat broke a growl in half and cause a bark to sound. To Sabrina it sounded a little like 'Sabrina, you're alive, yay.' If she wasn't already flushed from the exertion, she might have flushed at how silly she felt thinking that. Then again, Bo hadn't wanted her to leave the bedroom, that much <i>had </i>been clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo continue to give happy barks, but softly so Sabrina didn't think her father would hear and investigate what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached level with the bedroom window, Bo hanging over the sill, Sabrina let herself relax. Her legs and arms were trembling and her fingers and toes stung. She probably had dozens of splinters but she still had a couple of fee to go, out on a sturdy limb - before she could really worry about what scrapes she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina had sat out on the limb before - it was plenty large for a child - but this time she inched across it so slowly she wasn't sure she was even moving. She was so close to safety and to secrecy that fear had her move like a turtle to ensure she didn't make a hash of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo strained over the sill, tongue hanging out. She ordered him to get back, fearing he'd become excited and knock her off as she was climbing over the sill. He obeyed like the wonderful animal he was and Sabrina clenched both hands to the sill, using the strength in her arms to pull her lower over over and into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasping cry she hit the floor and lay still, trembling. Tears of relief, of late fear, of all sorts of things filled her eyes, and then a long raspy tongue slobbered over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina flung her arms around Bo and hugged him close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(901 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sabrina considered the tree. Surely she could climb it? But as she walked around it once, looking for hand and footholds, she found that the trunk was quite smooth at her level. There was no way she could leap for a branch.She thought for a second on how she'd gotten down the tree. Couldn't she go back up the same way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot an option. She'd managed to scramble down through the branches but near the bottom she'd had to take a bit of a gamble that she wouldn't break any bones by leaping the rest of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina bit her lip. There was nothing for it but to knock on the front door and suffer the consequences for being out of bed and out of the house after the express warnings not to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved around the tree, back to the front path and up to the door. Solid pine, at least two inches thick with brass bands crisscrossing the face, and a big iron door handle with knocker. The door was made to keep things out. A shiver raced up and down Sabrina's spine and she glanced over her shoulder. There was no light any more from the fairy but that didn't mean she wasn't still there watching; that's usually what a shiver meant - someone was watching you. Sabrina swallowed. She wasn't in danger here, she wasn't in danger here.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina all but leaped onto the stone threshold and banged the knocker with all the strength her six-year-old arms could manage. Not a great deal, since they were sore from climbing down the tree and not a little bit numb from the chill air. But the crashing sound was echoing through the house and she was sure her father would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe he wouldn't. He wouldn't be expecting anyone at this time of night. Maybe he wouldn't even come to the door to see what was going on? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina edged right up to the handle and called through the lock, 'Papa, it's me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doubted her father would think it was someone else making her voice, but... what if he wasn't within earshot of the door? Sometimes, when you were at the back of the house, or even upstairs, the sound didn't reach that far. Sabrina crashed the knocker against is iron plate again, and this time when she called for her father it came out as rather more a shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sabrina?' she heard faintly from within the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let me in, papa,' Sabrina called. 'I'm stuck out here.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What are you doing outside, child?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I... I fell out of the window.' Sabrina winced, that was a stupid reason!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe it wasn't; she heard footsteps hastening and next thing the latch across the small barred window scraped out. 'I can't see you,' came her father's muffled voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of insisting she was who she said she was, Sabrina took two steps back so she could be seen and so her father could see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard what sounded a lot like a curse and then the latched scraped shut. Momentarily Sabrina panicked that that was it, but then she heard the big bolts being pulled. Then the door unlatched and swung in half a foot. Sabrina's father peered around it, looked over her shoulder, and then made \"hurry up\" motions with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina darted forward, yelping when the hand grabbed her shoulder and yanked her through the gap. The bolts all shunted home to make an impregnable barrier once again, and then Sabrina felt the weight of her father's stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'For someone who fell out of a window, Sabrina, you don't look very hurt, or very dirty.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew her father didn't believe a word of what she'd said; this was his way of telling her to come clean before she was made too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The fairy made me,' she blurted before she could stop herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The what?' her father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina swallowed. 'The fairy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(662) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check5.png\" alt=\"*Check5*\" title=\"Check5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, back at home, James Tanner stood in front of the fire place staring at the small painting of his late wife. Dead two years now, taken by who knew what. Rumour abounded that it was the beast in the forest but James wasn't so sure. They'd found no trace of his wife, of a struggle or anything that might indicate the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd deep down in his heart, where he went in his greatest need for peace, he was sure the wolf wasn't involved in Morgana's death. A vicious death hung around, like a sliver in a heart that couldn't heal. James didn't feel that; he just felt a void as if his wife had simply vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey said she was dead because she'd never been found but James was sure he'd still feel something even in her death. There was nothing inside to connect him now, just the sense of her being missing. Sabrina was always going on about fairies and how her mother had been turned into one. James always pooh-poohed that nonsense, for Sabrina's sake. Other folk already looked at her slightly askew - they had before Morgana's death and they hadn't stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't because James was raising her on his own, it was because Sabrina would happily tell her friends about her fairy mother or how she saw a fairy yesterday or two fairies the day before. Some of the townsfolk thought she wasn't quite right in the head, but - for god's sake - she was only a child. Children believed in fairies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina believed in them more than most, which was the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd James... well, behind his daughter's back he had a little bit of belief too. Maybe not quite to the point of believing Morgana was now a fairy, but he was aware of magical auras and a few charms and spells. For example, the brass bands criss-crossing the stiff wooden door carried an old charm that prevented witches from crossing the threshold. Witches hadn't been seen in years but the charm held strong (at least, he expected it did.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the black ring he wore on a leather thong around his neck kept him abreast of when anyone was nearing the house - magic or otherwise. The door knocker heralded visitors remarkably well but the ring would start to vibrate faintly whenever any one passed the fence boundary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sighed at the portrait. Sabrina carried her mother's beautiful features and dark hair, was going to be an absolute beauty when she hit her teens. As long as she'd stopped talking so much about fairies by then, she would probably make a wonderful love match with someone. He ran a finger over Morgana's hair as if he could run a finger through it like he used to. 'If you are out there, Morgana,' he whispered, 'please keep watch over her.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA log collapsed in the fire, sending out a rush of heat and shower of sparks and ash. James' heart leapt and for a split second he saw that as a sign from his lost wife. Then he chuckled to himself, got down on his knees and sorted the fire out. The log had burned through and collapsed of its own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen James straightened, he moved to the front door to double check the bolts were in place. The lock held no key but that hung safely on the hook just under the window latch. He didn't lock the door at night because the bolts were better strength in keeping the door closed. As he did most nights before he headed up to bed, he bent down and peered through the lock, down the path to the picket fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt glowed abnormally in the dark, until James realised that the glow came from an upper window and there was only one window on that side of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's probably reading still</i>, James thought, and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina read everything she could get her hands on, which James was very proud of, but not tonight. Sabrina had a big day dawning tomorrow and if she didn't get enough sleep tonight, tomorrow was going to be a disaster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(699 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James trod the quiet stairs, proud of the fact that for over stairs over one hundred years old they did not creak or squeak or groan. Sometimes their quietness was an issue; Sabrina had a tendency to be able to sneak downstairs pretty easily on those occasions that she'd been grounded to her room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside her door, he gave a half knock and was startled by a muffled WOOF and scratching. Bo knew his tread and normally didn't react in any manner to his arrival - whether Sabrina was awake or asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames rushed into the bedroom and stopped dead. The bed sheets were thrown back to reveal a smooth white under sheet and no daughter. He glanced around but she wasn't sitting at her little princess desk, nor on the floor by the toy cabinet. The Labrador barked and nudged James knee, and he crouched down for a second, gripping the dog's head. 'Where's she gone, Bo?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog held still just a second, then broke free and moved to the window, and that's when James realised it was wide open. He knew the curtain had been back, because that's how he'd known the light was still on; it had been shining on the fence. He strode to the window, leaned on the sill and gazed out. The ancient tree blocked a lot of his view out over the field to the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside him Bo set his paws on the sill and gave another bark as if to say 'she went that way'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames drew in a breath. Lord, had Sabrina climbed down the tree? She'd been known to sit on the big branch that reached the window sill but he hadn't ever seen her get into the tree with the intention of climbing down it. She was just six. Precocious, certainly, and determined to do a lot of the things that the boys her age did but this tree was a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames muffled a curse against a hand and straightened up. If she'd climbed out, then something was up. She'd been restless, he remembered, when he'd said good night to her early. Something about fairies again. Not her mother this time, but a guardian or something-or-other. <i>Damn, child, not tonight!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new year of school was starting tomorrow and a half-asleep child wasn't going to make a good impression!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames hauled the sash window down and latched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he moved back down the stairs, gathered up his knife and shoved a smaller on inside his boot once he'd laced them up. Bo had followed him and he stood for a moment regarding the dog. Not much of a defence animal, but he'd be able to find Sabrina easily. That meant James could get away without taking a torch (sometimes it was best to be wandering about in the dark truly in the dark!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecision made, James pulled on his heavy oil-proof jacket and attached Bo to his leash. 'Come on, Bo, we've got a wayward child to find.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames took the key from the hook, and drew back the bolts on the door. It swung quietly open on well-oiled hinges and latched with a click behind them. The key turned in the lock and then found a temporary home in a pocket of the jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina's father took a moment to ensure his jacket was done up entirely, even though the night was not yet freezing, and then started up the path. He was going to have to ground Sabrina for a month for this; the child had to learn obedience. She was a good student, but if she spent nights in disobedience she wasn't going to be very attentive during the day and would end up either falling asleep in class or making silly little mistakes that could see her dropped from the school. He could not afford to send her to school if she didn't make an effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that puzzled James because Sabrina liked going to school. Or had. Perhaps the month off over the first spring month had changed her? James grimaced; he and Sabrina were going to have to have a long chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, he needed to find her, and he had the ever growing suspicion that he had little time to do so. Bo was pulling at the leash and only wanted to go in one direction - toward the wood. She'd been told so many times to stay clear of the wood as much as possible but something always pulled her that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames broke into a trot, would have had to even if he'd not chosen it himself, because of Bo. He wanted to yell out but night was silent apart from his steps and Bo's puffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(words: 791) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moon, though just a sickle, put out enough light in the cloudless sky to reveal the woods. Well, to reveal a huge black shape that stretched for miles and seemed oddly high in any case. James couldn't make out individual trees in the blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that universal darkness, like he was staring at an absolute nothingness, allowed his eyes to pick up the tiny flicker of green a hundred yards off. He stopped still, causing a half yap from Bo, getting out a low 'sshhh,' in response. He settled a hand onto Bo's collar and the dog fell silent. But he wiggled beneath James' hand, signifying he'd seen the light too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames strained his hearing but nothing came to him in terms of voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green light was moving about. James might have thought it was just a firefly or other some such creature that emitted a phosphorus glow from the moon's light, if it hadn't been for the type of green. A bright green that looked ill. In other words, poison green. Whatever was making that colour wasn't good. <i>And my daughter's out here!</i> James thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe element of surprise was his, he thought, so he started moving closer, keeping his hand on Bo's collar so the dog knew to stay at heel and stay quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden he heard 'I'm not afraid of you' delivered in a belligerent voice. A childish voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sabrina?' he called, unable to stop himself, hurrying forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Daddy?' came the return cry. 'Daddy!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, in the darkness they probably would have run passed each other, if Bo hadn't been present. He yanked out of James' gripped and took off into the darkness with a bark. James didn't even get out the dog's name before he heard a squeal of delight and muffled barking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames came across his daughter and dog in a tumble on the ground, and for a moment thought to join in. Then he was sure he saw the flash of green again - not close, but whatever it was was obviously still around. 'Alright, young lady,' he said, grabbing his daughter's arm. 'Time to get you home and into bed. You have school tomorrow.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped his words and tone and Sabrina's resultant 'oh, do I have to?' would put the green thing off, think that it remained unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames noticed how Sabrina didn't try to disengage him, nor pull back, but moved with quick step. The dog stayed right by her side, ears alert as if he kept on guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed for the house in silence and James refrained from speaking even when they came into the patch of light made by Sabrina's window and he noticed she was just in pyjamas, with bare feet. Grounded... the only option, after a stern talking to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house, with the massive bolts drawn and this time the key turned in the lock, James sat his young daughter in the rocking chair in front of the fire and frowned down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've so many things to say,' he said, 'that I don't know where to begin!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sorry, daddy.' Sabrina looked at her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames swung loose the blanket from over the back of the rocker and fitting it around Sabrina. 'If I go and make a hot chocolate, will you promise not to move?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina nodded, tucking her feet up under the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames waited just a second before heading to the kitchen, reflecting that Sabrina hadn't seem scared at any time on the walk or even now. Surprised, first, and then a bit relieved but not really scared. A fact that he was both proud of and worried about. Children were fearless because they didn't think there was anything to fear. That made them incredibly (and occasionally) bold and liable to get into a whole world of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut perhaps the green thing hadn't been bad? James felt a prickle down his spine, for a second wondered if it had been Morgana. No, he shook his head. The poison green was a give-away. <i>Nothing </i>good carried that colour. And his wife sure as heck wouldn't!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hot chocolate made for both of them James returned to the lounge room and handed a mug over. Sabrina mumbled  a small thank you and buried her face in the cup, as if she might think that'd get her out of answering questions. James shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sabrina, why did you climb out the window? Why did you disobey me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I didn't mean to,' Sabrina said quietly. 'But I was curious, and it was insistent.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The fairy,' Sabrina answered, looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The green thing?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina's brows rose, her lips parting in surprise. Her dad saw... But didn't he always say fairies were just tales?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames crouched in front of the chair. He pulled the black ring from down his shirt and let it dangle. Sabrina had seen it several times, had always just thought it was something from her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This tells me whenever someone has passed through the front gate,' he said quietly. 'It heats up.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina watched the ring twist slowly on the leather thong. 'Daddy,' she whispered, 'you do believe...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes,' James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(words: 869) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sabrina stared at her father. He'd told her so many times to stop talking so much about fairies, to stop telling people her mother was one; she'd been sure he had no belief in these things at all, even about the beast in the woods. She'd always thought it was just a ploy parents used to make their kids behave. Now, he dangled a ring in front of her and told her it was magic. And - way more important - he'd just said he'd see Charie (well, 'the green thing') and that he <i>believed</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth and he said, 'Sabrina, this is still <i>my </i>question time.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh right, trouble first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do you mean, the fairy insisted?' her father asked. 'That you follow it out of your room?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina nodded. 'It said that Celine was in trouble, that only I could help her.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who is Celine?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Another fairy,' Sabrina whispered to her hands. Then looked up. 'My guardian angel. She saved me from the beast once, when I was in the forest.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father's brows rose one at a time and she knew he was trying to think of a time when she'd been in the woods with his knowledge. Not many, but far more without his knowledge. Eventually he said, 'you've been disobeying me quite some time, I gather.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, father,' she admitted quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was curious,' Sabrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There's a time and place for curiosity and inquisitiveness, Sabrina,' her father said, 'but it does not involve that forest at any time.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is the beast real, then?' Sabrina asked, even though she'd seen it briefly with her own eyes. She remembered it as a giant wolf but sometimes wondered if that was something Celine had 'made' her see so that she could cope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father rose, flexed a knee, then turned to the fire for a moment. But he wasn't looking at the flames, instead his gaze was on the painting of her mother. He was silent so long she prompted him with, 'daddy?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started, as if he'd forgotten about her, and turned back. 'Sabrina, when I tell you not to do something, there is always a reason behind it. Why would I tell you to stay out of the woods if there was nothing dangerous in there?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina remained quiet. Her father nodded as if that answered his question. 'So tonight,' he continued, after a short moment, 'a fairy told you that your angel fairy was in trouble and that you had to help.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a question, but Sabrina nodded anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And you didn't stop to think that other fairies would have been more helpful than a human child?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina opened her mouth to say something about 'other fairies' (he hadn't sounded like he was having a laugh) and then realised the latter part of the question was quite sound. She hadn't thought of this at all. She shook her head but said, 'why would a fairy lie about that sort of thing?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fairies are not all good, Sabrina,' her father said. 'And <i>nothing </i>that shade of green is good - fairy, food or otherwise!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina coloured. 'I was afraid for Celine,' she said. 'She helped me; all I thought about was helping her. Charie said she might die.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Charie?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The green fairy,' Sabrina said. 'And she didn't always show that green. I noticed it mostly out by the forest, that's when I started to think... well, started to believe her.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She wanted you to go into the woods?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, and she said as long as I was with her I'd be safe, but if I didn't go then who knew what would happen.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I heard you say you weren't afraid of her,' her father murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I wasn't,' Sabrina said, puffing up a bit. 'I was bigger than her, and I wasn't in the woods. I didn't think anything could get me, and I could see my window.' Now that she said all that out loud, she realised she might just have been lucky about all this. If the fairy could cross out of the woods, then maybe other things could have too. Sabrina kept her spine straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father shook his head just a tiny bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mother would have done the same,' Sabrina said, indicating the portrait with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father didn't turn, just gazed at her, let out a silent sigh. She apologised for worrying him. When he raised a brow, she added an apology for disobedience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're grounded for a month, kiddo,' he said. 'I'll take you to school, and I'll pick you up, and every moment outside of that you'll be here in the house.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina held her tongue. Arguing would be silly right now, she understood. She changed the subject just a little. 'I thought mum gave you that ring.' It rested on the outside of her father's jacket, occasionally catching the fire light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked it up, ran his thumb around the edge. 'She did,' he responded in a thick voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did she... she knew what it does, didn't she?' Sabrina pushed herself forward in the chair to peer more closely at the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, she did,' her father admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And she gave it to you before she... disappeared,' she ended. She'd been going to say 'became a fairy' but wasn't sure she should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father gazed at her. 'What makes you say that?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because you didn't need it when she was around,' Sabrina said. 'Did you? There was always both of you here, looking after me. But then just you... Daddy, she knew she was going away, didn't she?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father seemed stunned at the thought but also sort of relieved. Sabrina had never thought her mother was dead but tried not to bring that up much because she knew it upset her dad. But know that she'd spoken, the more she thought she'd spoken true. Her mum had meant to go, or at least had known something was going to happen and had made sure her husband was prepared. Tears pricked Sabrina's eyes. 'She's not dead, daddy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know,' he whispered and gathered his daughter in his arms. 'That doesn't mean I think she's a fairy,' he added after a moment, 'but she is not dead. Of that I'm certain.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(words: 1047) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'How could I reveal that to you? You're just six years old.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not a baby,' was her first response and then she grimaced. She'd just sounded like one! 'Daddy, mum gave you the ring, didn't she?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded. 'Not long before she... left.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She isn't dead,' Sabrina whispered. 'Not really dead, anyway.' She waited but this time her father didn't speak. She hugged her mug to her chest, then took a drink before speaking again. 'You don't think she is either, do you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames spent a long time looking at the black ring as it flickered in the fire light. How could he tell his child what he thought? She seemed very open to these ideas but thus far everything she 'knew' was just made up. Could he really reveal what was going on in the world, or in the woods? He looked up. Sabrina was gazing at him with a direct look, and James felt a tiny smile twist onto his features. His daughter had often acted beyond her years!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a gulp from his own mug and then rose, set it on the mantle next to Morgana's picture. Even at six, Sabrina resembled her closely. He blew out a breath, waited, but his wife gave no sign about whether he should continue or not, so he made the decision himself. Turning he said, 'Sabrina, your mother isn't dead, not in the sense that she has been buried. I would feel that. Or - I would feel nothing at all, like something has been cut from me. I don't know where she is, or even <i>how </i>she is, but she's still here somehow.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina sucked on her lips, somehow managed to not say that she was a fairy. To be honest she suddenly wasn't so sure about that anyway! Not with her dad suddenly being so serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't believe she is a fairy,' her father said. 'I know that's what you'd like, but I'm sure I'd sense that. And I don't.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did you sense Charie?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Charie?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The fairy,' Sabrina said. 'The one I followed.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shook his head. 'No, I didn't, but even out there by the woods I just saw green, Sabrina, barely any shape.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina's mouth turned into an O.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'By the way,' James said and let his voice tighten, 'let's get the punishment sorted before we go too far.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina pulled a face; had been hoping somehow her father might have forgotten about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames hid a smile in the shake of his head. 'You are grounded for two months. I'll take you to school and I'l pick you up. Outside of school you'll be here in the house. And I will cut that limb so that you cannot climb down the tree.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina clutched her mug, so many arguments trying to escape. But her father didn't really use this tone with her much; she knew he was truly angry and scared. 'Sorry, daddy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm glad to hear it, Sabrina,' he said gruffly. 'That was a silly, silly thing you did tonight. Your curiosity could have got you seriously in trouble. It could have gotten you killed!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But I wasn't in the forest, daddy,' Sabrina felt the need to say. 'I stayed outside.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sabrina, the beast can leave the forest,' James said. 'There's nothing to stop it, but an old wives' tale.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, Sabrina felt rather miffed but it wasn't her dad's fault so she smiled timidly at him. He arched a brow and shook his head. 'Why <i>didn't </i>you go into the forest?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because I didn't like how she pushed me,' Sabrina said, and straightened in her seat. 'She was bossy and I didn't like that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames tried hard not to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And she said I'd be safe if I stayed with her, but not if I didn't. I didn't think that sounded right.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wish you'd thought that at the beginning, Sabrina,' James said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She said Celine was in danger,' Sabrina said. 'I had to go.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And who is Celine?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina stopped a moment and thought how to respond. Her father seemed to be taking things reasonably well right now. Would talking about a Guardian Fairy change that? She bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sabrina.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Guardian Fairy,' Sabrina blurted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right,' she thought she heard her father mumble. Then he looked at her. 'Explain, child.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Sabrina told him what Charie had said, why she felt she had to go with her, what Celine had done for her. Her father remained silent the entire time, which made her a little nervous. He might have some strong beliefs but fairies seemed to be down his list. When she fell silent, her father remained so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I had to go, daddy,' Sabrina insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, I'm sure you felt you did,' James responded softly. 'Sabrina, did the colour of the fairy not shout a warning to you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The colour?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Poison green,' he said. 'Nothing that shade of green is good. Nothing!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, she wasn't always that colour,' Sabrina said. 'Not until at the end, when I said I wouldn't go with her.' Sabrina tried to remember other colours Charie had been but couldn't, but she was sure on the green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How many times have you been in the forest?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina winced. The interrogation was set to be a long one, and she wanted to know what her father believed! 'Not many,' she said, hoping that would satisfy him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich told James that she'd been in there a decent number of times. He sighed and shook his head. Then he changed tack a little. 'The best is real, Sabrina,' he said. 'Did you see it the day you claim Celine saved you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I saw a wolf,' Sabrina said quietly. 'He wasn't so big.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her father asked for a description she gave it, and judged by his expression that what she had seen wasn't what everyone else knew about. 'Celine still saved me,' she pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes,' James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It wasn't the beast, was i?' she ventured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father only shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Daddy, why don't you believe in fairies?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I never said I didn't, Sabrina,' was his response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited but he was regarding the ring again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(word count: 1061) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James headed for the woods because, unfortunately, that seemed the logical place to find his daughter. If she was disobeying him tonight, then she'd be going all out - and entering the woods was the biggest no-no rule he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's because it carried the biggest danger, and yet no matter what he told Sabrina she seemed to think it was all just part of a great fairy tale. Well, that had some truth but she'd think again, he was sure, if she saw the scars down his back. He'd always been very careful to never let her see them, even on those piping hot summer days when he worked in the garden. Never shirtless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames growled to himself. Perhaps he should have shown her! Shown her that the fairy tale had claws, revealed the stories around her mother's disappearance. Morgana wasn't the only person to have simply disappeared, presumed dead. If it happened (at least twice a year!) and young children were involved then the townsfolk followed a plan. A parent (or sibling) was dead but it had nothing to do with the woods or the beast within. Sabrina had been just four. Though she'd been extra in touch with fairies and magical things even then, James knew her thoughts about Morgana being a fairy now herself related to her own feelings, not because she'd heard anything around town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames ensured no one fed her hocus pocus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he regretted it somewhat. Children were too bold by half, not afraid of anything, and especially not of stories. If he'd shown her the scars and related their arrival maybe he wouldn't now be out on a barely moon-lit light trying to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fault, as usual! And he muttered to himself, because his daughter's inquisitiveness and stubborness weren't his fault. That's just how she was, and he was sure that even Morgana wouldn't have been able to curb it! As earlier, James made a silent wish for Morgana to be watching over their child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo log crashing in the fire answered him this time. It was just he and Bo moving towards a wall of blackness, even blacker than the night sky and that was barely light at all. The moon was a sickle but he couldn't see any stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nights had been like that for a couple of weeks now, and everyone was unsettled. It meant something but no one knew what, and none of the annals in the town's tiny library revealed any past occurrences. Rumour abounded though, that the beast was stirring - more so that usual because that rumour was often used to keep children in line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wish it worked for mine.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames slowed his steps as he got nearer the woods. He couldn't make out outlines of trees; indeed the mass of the forest seemed to have coalesced into a solid wall and it gave off an intense air of foreboding. His grip tightened on his knife, other hand clenching around the leash. Though the dog might not be a great defence animal, James was thankful he'd brought him. Bo would find Sabrina no matter how dark it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment though, while Bo was continuing to strain forward he seemed more out for a run rather than a 'seek' trip. He occasionally sniffed the ground but didn't seem, to James anyway, to pick up anything that made him more alert. But, nor was he acting as if something was terribly amiss. He had, in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames momentarily wondered if that was because Sabrina hadn't come this way at all. Damn, he should have walked around the house first. Made sure, even, that she wasn't in the tree! Though, surely she'd have spoken out then. James stopped; did he go back and check? He glanced over his shoulder, saw the patch of light from the window half shuttered by the tree. He couldn't make out the shape of anyone lingering in the bare foliage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames crouched, hugged Bo to him. 'Do we continue on?' he asked the dog in a whisper. 'I only have a knife, no torch.' He glanced at the deepness that rose above him like a sudden mountain range. The beast didn't have the forest to itself; there was more than one thing in here that could make his night very nasty. 'Shit,' he said. He was under prepared, but then again he hadn't expected not to find Sabrina out here somewhere. It could only have been a half hour at most between telling her to go to bed and now. How far could she have gone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried not to think of the fact that once Sabrina had got to this point, something else might have helped her along. Except, it was very rare that anything actually left the veil of trees. If you stayed outside the line, you kept a decent amount of safety. James had to work hard to convince himself that his daughter had some intelligence in her. Believe the stories or not, surely she wouldn't have gone into the wood - not in the middle of the night!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stared ahead of him, straining to see the outline of <i>any</i>thing. But it was just blackness; truly like a void, like nothing was there at all. Maybe that's what it was at night? A void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft chuckle startled him before he realised it was his own. God, he was starting to imagine things! He dug his fingers into Bo's soft fur for a reality check, and received a slobber over his face. 'Okay, old boy,' James said. 'Do we go in, or do we check outside?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(words: 943) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Knowing Sabrina she would have just marched straight on into the darkness. The child was fearless, terrifyingly so! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd disobedient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shook his head. His daughter had always been wayward, seemed more so now that Morgana wasn't around. But what could he do to rein her in, bar chaining her to the house! Which he'd never do because he appreciated Sabrina's free spirit. He just wished, sometimes, she wasn't so free with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scars across his back seemed to tighten. Tonight of all nights! There was barely a moon in the sky and certainly no stars. It felt thick out here, this darkness. As if there was more to it than usual. But that was probably James himself making it so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't been into the woods in a number of years and he had done his darndest to keep Sabrina away. He sighed; he should have been open with her, told her what he knew, what he <i>believed</i>. Told her about the scars across his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHindsight....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that wouldn't find his daughter! 'Right, Bo,' James said with more nerve than he felt. 'Let's get ourselves in here and find Sabrina.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her name, Bo gave a bark and started sniffing the ground, as if he knew he needed to play a role here. James was grateful he'd brought the dog. Not big on defence, but his hearing and sense of smell would be very helpful once they'd stepped over the threshold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames glanced over his shoulder briefly, back at the house and the light shining from his daughter's bedroom. Perhaps he should go and get better weapons? Perhaps he should contact his neighbours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, any delay now could be disastrous. Might already be, but he tried not to think of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo tugged at the leash. James drew in a tight breath and let the dog move him forward, across the invisible line and into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeirdly, the night was even more silent within the forest and it hadn't exactly been noisy outside! There should have been night creatures moving about - voles, mice, lizards even, owls. But James heard nothing that sounded like life outside of himself and Bo, not even a breeze moving the bushes. And the darkness was complete; he couldn't see his hand in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt Bo press against him and he murmured a soft encouragement. He had to keep thinking encouraging thoughts too, since in reality he might have entered the woods in a totally different place from his daughter. Damn, he should have brought a light! How on earth did he expect to be able to find his way let alone his daughter in this darkness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf danger lurked (probably <i>no </i>'if') he wouldn't see it before it found him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames' breath was a little on the short side, and his nerves weren't helped by the fact the scars were starting to sting, as if by some weirdness they were raw again. <i>Don't  be stupid</i>, he thought, <i>that can't happen!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis spare hand fumbled for the black ring Morgana had given him just before she left.<i> Keep this with you, always, my love</i>, she'd said, and he had never taken it from around his neck. He clutched the ring now, cool under his touch but seeming to grow warmer. <i>Just my hand</i>, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he'd have sworn he heard his name spoken, and he stopped dead, ears straining. Bo leaned against him but didn't appear to be reacting at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>James</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames went rigid, as still and as silent as the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>James!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who's there?' he rasped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh blast, I forgot. Your human eyes can't see me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nearly choked on the shock of hearing the voice out loud, and not too far away. He looked down and had to reach out to reassure himself that Bo was still with him. The dog was, and yet he wasn't growling or making any sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scratching sound came from the right and then a faint blue glow appeared. James struggled to withdraw his knife, held it out in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Put that away, James,' came the voice. Female? He wasn't sure. 'I'm not here to hurt you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who are you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My name is Celine.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Who are you?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I am your daughter's Guardian,' the voice said. It seemed to come from the blue light which hadn't yet attained a shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sabrina? Where is she? What have you done with her?' James edged closer to the light, scars pulling at his back making him feel stiff. Why did the name sound familiar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'James,' Celine said calmly, 'do not worry, she is fine. I have her in a safe place now. She thought you might find she was gone from her room, and worried you'd come looking.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course I'd come looking,' James cried. 'She's my <i>daughter</i>!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue flared brighter, making James shade his eyes, and when it faded a young woman stood there. James' jaw dropped. 'Morgana?' he croaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shook her head. 'I am not your wife, James.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But...' James staggered, nearly fell to his knees. Bo snuffled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I appear to people differently,' she said softly, calmly. 'You miss your wife, and though you don't believe your daughter with her tales about Morgana being a fairy, you still wish it were so.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames rubbed his face and when he looked up this time, the young woman was certainly not his wife. He let out a sound that might have been a sob. 'Take me to Sabrina, p-please.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course,' Celine said. 'Come this way, stay close.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why is she out here?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She followed Charie,' and the tone was anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A fairy intent on nefarious things,' Celine said, 'but do not worry, James, Sabrina is safe.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sabrina is a sensible child,' James heard himself say. And intelligent; surely she wouldn't just <i>follow</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You can get the story from her,' Celine said. 'I'm sure she has quite the tale to tell. Resourceful child.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last came out softly and James was certain he heard pride. He shook his head; resourceful or not, his child was going to be grounded until she turned eighteen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do those scars bother you much?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames jerked. 'What?' And then, 'how do you know?' His grip tightened on the knife again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm a guardian,' Celine said. 'It's my job to know.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't care for the cryptic answer, but before he could speak, Celine added, 'I can see you are in pain, and I can sense the mark of the beast upon you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't really have a comeback for that. He got out stiffly, 'they feel like they are fresh.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The forest does that,' Celine said softly. 'I have some salve you can use that will prevent the pain.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wasn't sure he wanted anything from the fairy apart from his daughter, but he didn't say so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(word count: 1152) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

He kept Bo's leash short, and kept the dog on his right - next to the forest. Bo would see and hear things moving there before he could, even if his eyesight was adjusting to the deep dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo put his nose to the ground and sniffed, let out a little yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do you sense Sabrina?' James asked, hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo usually did have a good sense of where his daughter might be or had been, but out here he could have found the trail of a mouse as easily as his daughter. The dog didn't look up, but kept snuffling the grass. James jiggled the leash and took a step, the Labrador following as if the grass hadn't been so fascinating two seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sucked in his lips, and broke into a trot. He had two sides of a forest to check and he didn't want to take all night. The air was chilled and the lack of stars was distinctly uncomfortable. He found his spare hand snuck into his jacket and curved around the black ring. It wouldn't do anything here but he felt just a little bit closer to Morgana. He hoped that wherever she might be, she was looking out for their daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't lose her too.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames picked up his pace again, into a jog. No point in doing this slowly; he'd be here all night and the need to fight his way-ward daughter was getting stronger by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames yelled our Sabrina's name, hearing it echo over the wide expanse of field. From the forest came no response at all, no growling from animals, cackling from birds, not even any sounds within the trees themselves. Yet it wasn't a still night, a soft breeze lifted James' hair and ruffled Bo's coat. The forest was its own living form, or in some cases 'dead' form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest was silent, and so was the field in front of him. No response from his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran along, James started to hear his name. He shoved his hand over his ear a second, then released it. No, he still heard it. James stopped still, holding his breath. Beside him, Bo pricked his ears forward - not toward the forest as James feared but further out into the field. And then the dog started growling low in its throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames held still, trying the locate the name caller. He sounded familiar but sound travelled oddly out here sometimes. No, wait... wasn't that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'James, James, is that you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Richard?' James got out in the direction of the voice, sure he could now see an outline against the faint lights of the next house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, it is you, thank the heavens.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes Richard came to a stop in front of James. 'What are you doing out here? I just tried to reach you at your house.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?' James said surprised. 'Why?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You haven't heard?' Richard got out. 'The beast, James. It's been seen out of the forest.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?' James cried. 'When? Where? My <i>daughter's</i> out here somewhere!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sabrina? What? No, James, she's at my house,' Richard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames couldn't even respond verbally this time. Richard looked at him, concerned. 'You didn't know?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames slowly shook his head. 'Seems she climbed out the window.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Heh,' Richard said. 'I caught my Lara doing the same thing. Said she was off to meet Sabrina. I gathered your daughter up as soon as she showed up. I came to tell you that too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I better come and get her,' James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And stay for a while,' Richard said. 'We're holding a meeting. If the beast is leaving the forest, we need to have a plan.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(word count: 639) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll have to get you a pair of boots like my own if you're going to live here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette stopped in her tracks. \"Live here? W- wait a minute. I never said I would live here! I was just going to come see your house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDezric just grunted and walked on. Josette muttered under her breath and started walking again. To keep her mind off the constant tearing of the thorns at her legs she concentrated on Dezric in front of her. His clothes were entirely black and he wore a jerkin made from the same strange, scaly leather as his boots. His undershirt was badly patched and mended at the elbows. His hair was a shade of dark blonde and curly at the ends that dangled just below his ears. The bow he carried was made of a light colored wood and traced with strange carvings that were stained dark red. The fletching on his arrows were the same color, and his quiver was stitched all over the same carvings on his bow. One carving stood out in particular. It looked like a strange, twisted tree with three circle of different sizes entwined in the braches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a strange symbol. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dezric stopped in his tracks. \"Stop talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count: 387 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

What did I say?  One more peep from you and you're staying here.  Understood?\"<br>\r\nJosette nodded.  What else could she do?  If she ever got back to the village, she would make sure to tell everyone about Dezric and his wolf pack.  <br>\r\nThe wolf cub opened its eyes, and seeing Josette following Dezric, mewled pitifully.  <br>\r\n<i>Aww, look at you.</i> Thought Josette.  Dezric's warning rang clear in her head.  <i>No talking</i> she told herself.  <i>But I can think.  He can't let me not think.</i>  Slowly, Josette reached out a hand to touch the cub.  <br>\r\nThe cub stretched its neck out, making a mutual effort to let Josette touch her head.  <br>\r\nGasping silently upon contact, Josette pet the head.  The fur was so soft, so warm.  She could see why villagers liked to use wolf's fur for clothing, though now it seemed inhumane to her.  <br>\r\nSuddenly, Dezric stopped.<br>\r\nJosette, paying more attention to the wolf than to where Dezric was going, bumped into him.<br>\r\n\"Watch it, little girl!\" he scolded.<br>\r\nJosette hung her head, an apology waiting to escape her lips.<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to say sorry?\" he nagged.<br>\r\nJosette shook her head, and mimed out something along the lines of \"You won't let me talk, how can I say sorry?\"<br>\r\n\"Ahh, yes.  That's right.  You're not allowed to talk.  I remember that now.  I remember it very well.\"  Stopping to examine her plump but exquisite face, Dezric looks her up and down.  \"How old are you anyways?\"<br>\r\nJosette considered lying about her age.  By being younger, perhaps he would take pity on her and be nicer.  She held up six fingers.  <br>\r\n\"My God, you're only six?\"<br>\r\nShe nodded.<br>\r\nDezric looked thoroughly worried now.  \"I thought you were at least nine or ten!\"<br>\r\nIn reality, she was eight.<br>\r\nDezric's facial expression turned from worry to delight.  \"No problem.  Six is a plenty good age to start training.  The younger the better.\"<br>\r\n<i>Training for what?</i> Josette wanted to ask.  She wanted to know what she had gotten herself into.<br>\r\n\"Now, be a good girl and follow me, okay?\" Dezric was much nicer than before, as if talking to a petulant child now.<br>\r\n<i>Am I allowed to talk now?</i> Wondered Josette.<br>\r\n\"well, looks like you've almost mastered the first step of training: Obedience.  Obey me, and nothing bad will happen.\" Dezric turned around, and Josette quickly put her arm back by her side, as if she had never reached out to pet the wolf.<br>\r\nShe nodded and curtsied.<br>\r\n\"Good girl.  I see your parents have taught you your manners well.\"<br>\r\nAfter he turned back around, Josette stuck her tongue out and waggled her fingers at him.<br>\r\nAs they came through another clearing, they came across a stream.<br>\r\nDezric turned around to Josette.  Before you formally begin your training, you must be cleansed of all impurities.  Take your clothes off and go bathe in the stream.\" he commanded.<br>\r\nJosette's eyes went wider than saucers.  She had been taught it was never proper to bathe in front of others.<br>\r\nDezric saw her hesitation.  \"Go.\" he commanded.  \"Don't make me undress you.\"<br>\r\nJosette ran behind some foliage to undress herself so Dezric wouldn't have to touch her.  Once she entered the stream, Dezric approached her, watching her bathe.  \"You'll be needing this.\" He gave her a bar of soap.  \"Also, undo the braids in your hair.  Wash your hair, too.\"  Examining Josette's various layers of petticoats and dresses, he shook his head.  \"You won't be needing all this clothing when you start wo- ahem- training with me.\" he said.  Going into his bag, he laid out a simple peasant boy's outfit for her: a tunic and pants.  He then took Josette's clothing and stuffed it unceremoniously into his bag.<br>\r\nJosette pouted as if to say \"My clothing!\"<br>\r\n\"Now, don't be a vain little girl.  All those dresses would simply get in the way of your work when you train.  These clothes will suit you much better.\"  He was still watching her bathe, making sure she covered every part of her head with soap before rinsing off in the stream.<br>\r\nJosette's uneasiness did not leave, but she forced herself to continue on as if nobody was watching her.  <br>\r\n\"Now, little girl.  What did you say your name was again?  You may talk now, by the way.\"<br>\r\n\"Josette.  And if you please, Dezric I would appreciate it if you didn't watch me bathe.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't please.  So I will watch you bathe, you insolent little girl.  Come over here.\"<br>\r\nJosette didn't move.<br>\r\n\"Now.\"<br>\r\nJosette stood frozen in her spot.<br>\r\nDezric reached out and yanked Josette in, grabbing the soap bar and forcefully lathering it all over her face and hair, then dunking her into the water.<br>\r\nSpluttering as she came up, Josette pouted.  \"What was that for?\"<br>\r\n\"For not following directions.  Now, rinse off and put on your new clothes.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Looks like you'll need a bit of breaking in.\" Mutered Dezric.  \"Come on, hurry up.  We don't have all day, Josie.\"<br>\r\n\"it's Josette.\"<br>\r\n\"I will call you what I please.  Now, it is Josie.  Remember, rule one is obedience.  Listen to what I say and do as I say.  Then you will stay out of trouble.  Yes?\"<br>\r\nJosette was beginning to highly regret her decision to go along with Dezric, but she took a deep breath and nodded.<br>\r\n\"Good.  Now, the house is just over there, beyond this set of trees.  We should reach it before sundown if you hurry.\"<br>\r\n\"What about my shoes, Dezric?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't have any that will fit you yet, so you'll have to go barefoot.  It's not that bad.\"<br>\r\nSighing Josette followed Dezric and the cub until they reached a small hut at the edge of the next clearing.  There, she saw something she had never seen before.  \"Whoa... What is this?\"<br>\r\nDezric smiled at his new recruit's wonder.  \"Welcome.

Dezric gave the wolf pup to her, strung an arrow on his bow, and waited, listening. Something large moved through the trees. The movement of its body sent tremors through the underbrush. Josette held her breath and stroked the wolf puppy's head to keep him quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden a giant grizzly bear leapt out of the brush running madly towards Dezric, but he stuck two arrows into its head before got close. It fell to the ground with a giant thud and a groan. Josette peered up over the brush then stood up once she thought the coast was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! That was close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye.\" Dezric slung his bow back over his shoulder. \"It was.\" He walked over to the bear's corpse to inspect it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's odd isn't it?\" Josette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he charged at you.

He's fallen under the Black Curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- what is that exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a sickness that has befallen those living in these woods. It turns good thoughts into bad ones, love to hate, and dreams into nightmares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette gulped. \"Does it affect humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Dezric took another look at the bear. \"It is a pity.

There was a little vegetable garden there though full of weeds and not very well kept. Still, there were edible things to be found growing there. Josette looked up at the sky expecting to see the sun, but, to her surprise, a few stars already twinkled in the early evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My it's already late isn't it? Funny. I didn't think we had been walking that long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time passes quickly in these woods. You'll grow used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow used to it? I do not intend to grow used to it! I am coming to your home then I am going back to my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDezric didn't answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked out of the clearing back into the woods. A sound to her left made Josette jump. A wolf came running out. Before she could scream it jumped on her, knocked her over, and pinned her to the ground with its pause rested on her chest. IT bared its teeth and growled into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Digger! <i>Mawrrgoth</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf whined and gently crawled off Josette. It slunk over to Dezric with its tail beneath its legs and its ears pulled back. Dezric set patted it on its head then set the new wolf pup down. The big wolf sniffed at it then howled as if welcoming it. Dezric looked at the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Graougul</i>,\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf made a motion similar to a nod and with its snout ushered the little pup away following after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Josette stood up and brushed herself off. \"You can speak to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That was Digger one of my first trainees. She understands the most out of all my wolves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What language do you speak to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There own. All animals talk to each other. I talk to them in their language. It has no name that you would understand, but it uses the same sounds just more gruff and deep. Digger is taking the wolf pup to the rest of the pack. I will go and see it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is fascinating. Can you teach me how to talk to a wolf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps.\" Dezric started walking again, and Josette followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they came to a hut. It was low to the ground and blended into the foliage. It had a sod roof with plants growing on it and rough hewn boards for siding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this your home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDezric nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, uh, charming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not much to look at, I grant you that, but do not judge things by their outward appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette followed Dezric inside. Indoors certainly did look better than outdoors. There was a small stone hearth with dying embers still glowing in it, a low table with a bench pulled up to it, and old trunk nestled in a corner, and a lean-to jutting of the back wall with a cot inside. An elk horn chandelier hunk from the ceiling covered with candle wax drippings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is much nicer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Now, I'm going to make dinner. Why don't you go ahead and rest a bit.

In an underground den next to the hut the wolves welcomed the new pup and prepared him for a life of both freedom and service. With the black curse in the forest the wolves were grateful for the aid Dezric provided. He fed them medicines, healed their wounds when they were injured and kept the curse from them and so in return they served him willingly. This is what they told the pup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDezric knew he and the wolves had a symbiotic relationship and Josette's question about wanting to learn how to speak to the wolves made him smile. He had chosen wisely. Not all children are drawn to the cries of wolves. He had seen Josette earlier and watched carefully. When the pup's mother had left him alone he had gambled and put the pup within range of her hearing. And his gamble had paid off. If he was careful, and the wolves hopefully understood the need as well, they would all have a young apprentice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(235 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

It was chillier than it had been before so she walked over to the fire and leaned over it to warm herself up. She wish she had her shawl with her, but it had been so pleasant in the forest yesterday morning that she had not thought to bring it. Her stomach growled.

Well, Josette couldn't say she was surprised he was gone, but she was still worried. she hoped he hadn't brought her into the woods to desert her. She sat down on the bench and tried to think of reasons why he would be gone. Perhaps he was hunting for something for dinner, or maybe he was out feeding or tending to the wolves. That was probably it, but then, where was Josette's dinner? There was nothing cooking over the fire, the table was bare, and there were no signs that any food had been prepared.

Either they had a historical or cultic significance or Dezric was some sort of tailor or interior designer and favored this design. No matter, they didn't mean much to Josette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to lift up the cover of the trunk but found it heavier than it looked. With a look of determination on her face, she spit on her palms, set her jaw, and gave the biggest heave her little arms could manage. To her delight, the trunk flew open sending a puff of dust into the air. Josette coughed a looked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drats! No food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something of interest inside. There was a small pair of boots similar to what Dezric wore, a short staff with a crystal orb attached to it on top, a child's black cloak made of the scaley leather, and silver circlet. Josette, attracted by the silver's shine, picked up the circlet and examined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a breathtaking piece of jewelry. Ten strands of silver, similar in appearance to slender vines, intertwined to form a complex system of knots and symbols. gently sloping down in the back. On the front a single, dark ruby was set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Josette felt guilty for looking inside the trunk.

But something told her Dezric was not to be trusted. What if he had poisoned it or put something else, something more dangerous in the food? In a flash Josette snatched the other plate from Dezric's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take this one, thank you. It has, uh, less on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDezric looked coyly at her. \"Suit yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette sat down on the bench, and Dezric pulled up a stool and sat opposite her. Dezric pulled two spoons out of his pocket and handed one to Josette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scooped up some of the dinner, smelled it just in case, and shoved it into her mouth. It tasted quite good for such a simple dish, though she didn't think she had ever had the meat the hash was made out of before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDezric must have known what she was thinking. \"It's wild boar. I skewered one last week. I had to use the dried out stuff to make this so it's a bit tougher than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette shrugged and continued eating. All the time she ate, Dezric watched her with a hawk's eye only taking an occasional bit from his food. Obviously, Josette's appetite was more important to him than his own. He only stopped watching her when she had scraped her plate clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"Was it good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, very.\" Josette yawned. All of a sudden she felt extremely tired. Strange considering she had just slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to hit the sack again?\" Dezric stood up and cleared off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know where the cot is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word Josette stumbled back over to the bed and fell asleep as soon as she laid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dreams were very strange that night. <i>She saw muddle images of the forest, and she was wandering blindly through it. Suddenly she heard a fierce roar. She tried to run, but her feet felt stuck like glue. Nothing came at her, but her head swam with visions of her town on fire, people screaming, a huge beast storming over everything in its path, yet the image of the beast was veiled as if she was being kept from seeing its face. She screamed as the beast started charging towards her, but then a dark figure cloaked in red and bearing a shining staff stepped between her and the beast and yelled out in a strange tongue. The beast halted as if unsure of this new foe. It began to charge again when another figure, a woman this time, with a shining stone at her forehead appeared next to the red magician. The red one spoke this time in English:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My magic grows weak. I cannot defeat the beast alone. You must help me.\" He did not speak to the woman but instead held out his hand to Josette. </i>That's when she saw his face and woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jolted upright in her bed panting. Dezric sat next to her staring intently at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have a nice dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You- you're a- a- a magician!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how you can talk to the wolves, and that's why there are strange red symbols everywhere, and that explains what I saw in your trunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDezric's eyes grew wide. \"You looked in my trunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette gulped and looked down. \"Yes,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" He paused. \"Well, what about your dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know I had a dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I made you have it. You see, I put dreaming powder on your food. This certain powder can make you dream what images I put in your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I ate your plate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I offered you mine because I knew you did not trust me enough to take what I offered you. I expected you to take the other one. I can be sneaky like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But- but- I don't understand what I saw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understood some of it. You found out I was a magician, and you must have seen the beast. That is my fight. I am the protector of the woods. It is my job to save the woods from the Shadow Beast and the Black Curse it is brewing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette's spine tingled. \"Shadow Beast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It will wreak havoc on the forest and everyone living within its reach if I do not act, but I cannot do it alone. I need an apprentice. Will you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Me? Wh- why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I watched you in the woods today. I noticed something different about you. I cannot be sure exactly what it is, but I know you are destined to do something great. Everything you saw in that trunk was made for you.

Once confident no one was there she unbolted it and ushered her children outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets were ablaze with light as the village burned like a huge bonfire.

But there were days when she was tired from her never-ending list of chores and starving from the manual labor, and Bran, who had lain in the cool house all day, was still given the best and largest cut of meat. Josette's stomach growled even now at the thought of the fat, juicy pork chops her mother, father, and Bran enjoyed for dinner last evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't that her parents didn't love her. She was given delicious bread and cheese to feast upon, so she was not deprived. Girls were just less valuable than boys who would carry on the family name and bring honor to the household. Even among the peasant class, marriage was meant for social gain. Josette would be paired with the son of the blacksmith, while her parents would search far and wide for a girl worthy of their Bran, hoping that he lived long enough to produce an heir for their family farm. Josette would move to town and assist with the Blacksmith business while Bran gain the entire family home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the way of life and there was little use in harping. Instead, Josette sought adventure where she could find it, and today, these woods held a great adventure for her and her young brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much further?\" Bran wheezed. His lungs not nearly as strong as they should be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette reached into her sack and handed him a sprig of mint leaves. Bran chewed obediently, though with a grimace on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This stuff is terrible!\" He complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, it helps your lungs and you can breathe again,\" Josette interjected, settling them both into some soft moss near a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just tell me what's back in the woods like you used to? I don't think I can make it all the way back.\" Bran's breathing wasn't improving and Josette's heart raced. What had she done? Had she intentionally brought Bran here knowing what would happen? Couldn't she have just told him about the cub?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breaking of a branch to their left startled the two and Bran let out a scream. \"Shush\" Josette said, clamping her hand over his mouth. \"We have to get you home,\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBran's eyes were wide and Josette could see the fear in them. If they were caught in these woods...  Josette shivered in understanding of the terror. She knew. Something was tracking them in here. Josette wasn't sure how she knew, but now that they were silent and listening, she could feel the eyes on her. She realized that those eyes had always been on her. She had put her brother into danger and it was up to her to make it right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette hoisted Bran onto her back, remarking at how light the boy was. She'd carried feed sacks heavier than her current load. Her heart pounded as she situated him and it made her clumsy. Three times she came close to tumbling onto the ground and throwing her passenger. It was only through sheer will that she remained upright and Bran stayed fastened to her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Josette had righted herself and was prepared to slip out of these terrible woods, never to return when she turned and stared up in to the face of her father. She had never seen him that shade of red before and the dread washed over her entire body. Suddenly the beast hidden within these woods didn't seem nearly half so terrifying as the hulking man standing before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, father turned and walked toward the house. Josette hung her head and followed. Bran was silent on her back as well. It was the first time she had ever wished that a walk would go on forever. She had suffered her father's wrath in the past for lesser discretions and  was sure that she had just committed the mother of all sins in her father's eyes. She didn't want to know what awaited her at the end of the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a noise in the bush to their right called all three of their attentions. A solid black figure with dark red eyes emerged and lunged for father. Bran screamed into her hear and for a few moments, Josette couldn't hear a sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n819 words<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Get him out of here!\" Father yelled as he wrestled with the monster. The beast's claws were sharp and the creature attempted to swipe them across Father's neck several times already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette heard the words, but terror would not allow her to move. What would happen to Father? What had she done? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie, run!\" Bran urged from her back and it was the wheezing in that noise that  gave her feet the courage to leave their post. She took off toward the edge off the woods as fast as her feet would carry her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne quick glance showed back her that Father had removed his sword from the hilt and he and the beast were locked in a death dance. She hoped that he would return to them. She sent up several prayers under her shaky breath that he would defeat the hideous beast. But she held little hope. Father was an expert swordsman, but that beast was more ferocious than any many within the realm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother awaited them as they emerged from the treeline. \"Josette, what on earth!\" Mother began, but was stopped by what she saw on her daughter's face. \"Where is your father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette set Bran down onto one of the boulders the children often used as seats and collapsed onto the ground. She was spent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josette!\" Mother's voice was shrill from worry. Josette pushed aside her fatigue and stood, head bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mother,\" she mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is your father, Josette?\" Mother grabbed Josette's shoulders and squeezed, leaving nail prints in the fragile young skin. Josette raised her face to look at Mother. She had never seen her in such a state and guilt gnawed her gut because she knew this was all her fault. She should have never dared venture into the woods. She should have never taken Bran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's...\" Josette began, and then like a dam releasing it's hold, something burst within her and tears flooded her cheeks. \"I'm so sorry, Mama,\" she sobbed and hiccuped. \"I only wanted to show Bran the cub. I thought he would like the cub. But, he couldn't breath and so we started back and then Father came and then....\" Her voice trailed off and her body shook with sobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beast.\" Bran whispered from his seat. His voice sounded stronger and the wheezing had ceased. He turned and looked up at them both, his eyes as big as dinner plates. \"Father is battling the beast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother covered her mouth with one hand and gasped. With the other hand, she searched for a place to steady herself, settling for the rock where Bran currently sat. She guided herself down onto the other side of the boulder and settled in next to her son. Bran placed his hand on her shoulder in a comforting gesture. Mother smiled at him, but her eyes never left the treeline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette set herself on the ground at Mother's feet, and the three held vigil in this position throughout the day. There would be time later for punishment and guilt. This time was to be spent in wait. As the hours passed, they continued to sit, none daring to even shift positions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours of waiting, Bran's stomach growled loudly, a reminder to them all that breakfast had been many, many hours ago. Mother wiped her eyes and patted Bran on his knee. \"Let's go get you some food,\" she said and marched toward the house. Her eyes avoided Josette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette felt the weight and the accusation of her mother's actions sure as if the older woman had screamed it into her face. She brought her knees to her chest and rested her head on them. Why couldn't she just be an obedient child? What was wrong with her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBran wrapped his arms around Josette and she took some comfort in the embrace, though she knew that she did not deserve the affection. She had just killed the boy's father, so how could he stand to touch her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother set out breads and cheeses for supper, along with a warmed broth soup. She was not focused on the children, instead her eyes fixated on the tiny window. She barely looked at Josette the entire evening and didn't speak to her at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette nibbled some of the bread, but it felt like rocks inside her stomach. Bran seemed to be the only one of them with any appetite at all. He ate and chattered about how brave Father was and how he would come home at any moment with the nasty beast's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more he chattered, the more guilt Josette felt and the more sullen mother became. At one point, mother simply stood and walked into the bedroom. Josette set to work clearing the leftovers and wrapping them for the next day. She then prepared Bran for bed, all while he chattered away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she tucked him into bed, the constant noise from him became too much for her to bear. \"Shut up, Bran!\" She snapped at him. \"He's not coming back. Don't you see that it's dark outside now? Don't you realize Father is dead? I killed him because I disobeyed.\" Josette laid her head in her hands and wailed. \"I should have died, not Father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBran laid his hand on the side of her face and Josette looked up at him. His eyes held such love and compassion. \"This isn't your fault,\" he said to her. Words that were wise beyond his five years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother blames me.\" Josette said plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother is hurting. We are all hurting. But you will see. He will come back to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette stretched her lips into a grimace and patted Bran's hand. She stood and walked to her pallette on the floor. She wanted to hope that Bran was right, but she was afraid. What if Father didn't come home. What if the beast had killed him. She needed to know the truth, but she didn't dare enter the woods with the sun vanished from the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe settled in and spent the night in restless slumber with dreams of Father battling the beast and then her battling the beast. The last thing image before she woke was that of the beast. \"You will come to me and I will release your father to your family.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 1051 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">Josette trembled as she woke. Her body overcome by tiny spasms of fear at the beast's words to her. The gravelly voice played over and over again in her mind. \"You will come to me and I will release your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what if it wasn't true? What if it was only a dream and she was walking to her own death in the woods? A tear slid down Josette's cheek as she considered her options. And in her mind, the beast's visage was replaced with her mother's sad eyes, downcast and unable to look at her. Josette wasn't sure she could live with those eyes for the rest of her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore tears followed and, fearing she would drown within them, Josette pushed herself into a seated position on the blankets. She stared around the room at the orange light of dawn that attacked the darkness. Her eyes landed on Bran and she thought of the life the boy would have without their father in it. The boy had already suffered so much with his affliction; how could he be expected to carry on without his father too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette had always known that Bran was the preferred child. Boys brought value, strength, and the carrying on of family names. They were prized within their small village and the birth of a boy was celebrated town wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls, however, were seen as burdens to be endured until the day they were married off. On a girl's wedding day, her father walked her to her new in-laws, paid them an agreed upon sum, and then proceeded to escort her to her awaiting groom. The wedding was more a sale than a celebration. From then on, the girl belonged to her husband and his family. It was expected that she would produce sons to carry on their traditions. The more sons a woman produced, the higher she ranked in the village. And the heavens help her if she only had girls. A man could legally leave his wife if she failed to produce a boy after their second child. It was horrible and the woman with her daughters was sent to live on the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette shuddered as she remembered her walk to the blacksmith's shop so that he and father could agree on her bride price. She saw them; so many of them huddled in corners and hiding in dark alleys. Their eyes pleading for help, but their hands afraid to reach out for it. They were the forgotten. The nobodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would happen if father didn't come home? Surely mother wouldn't be able to pay Josette's bride price and the wedding would never happen. She would end up on the street with the forgotten. She would be cold and hungry. Death was better than that. Father would be able to talk to the blacksmith. He would explain that the beast had gotten his daughter. He would make it all right, just like he had always done. Just this once, Josette would be his savior. She would be the hero in her own story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of her mourned her choice. Jack had kind eyes and he would have made a wonderful husband for her. But, there was no point in thinking of what could never be. She had made her choice when she took her brother into the woods the previous day. She needed to make this right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep sigh, she set to work dressing and preparing for her adventure. Mom and Bran slept soundly in the early morning light. Josette moved as silently as possible for fear of waking them. Bran would try to stop her. He would beg and he would plead. Not even the thought of getting their father back would deter him from his mission of keeping Josette near. Her mother, on the other hand, Josette doubted she would care. Those eyes still haunted her thoughts. And it was the image of those eyes that sent her out into the morning dew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette could see her breath as she walked out into the chill and she considered going back inside for a thicker shawl. But the noise of Bran stirring inside kept her where she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tear caressed her cheek and she mentally said goodbye to her family. She steeled her shoulders and walked toward the tree line, determined. She would rescue their father. She would make right her mistake. Bran needed his dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready,\" she whispered, though she wasn't sure to whom, and stepped into the cover of the trees. </span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>759 words</i> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josette's body trembled as she came upon the tall tower in the middle of the glen. This place seemed so very close to her house and yet so far away. It was the first time she had ever been this deep in the woods. She circled the tower searching for the entrance, but had no luck. How could she save Father if she couldn't get to him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespondent, she flopped onto the ground and burst into a puddle of tears. 'I'm am a failure,' she thought. 'Bran will grow up without father and Mother will never forgive me for what I have done to our family.' Her stream of self pity flowed until the tears ran out, and then she sat there, red-eyed and dead inside. She had nothing more to give. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy! You!\" A hoarse voice called from the trees. \"What are you doing out so far in the woods? Don't you know a beast lurks around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette nodded and looked up at the stranger as he emerged from the woods. He was rugged and handsome, and his chiseled cheeks reminded her of Jack. She longed for Jack in that moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you talk?\" The man's voice softened with concern? \"You look ill? Are you ill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette recoiled. How dare he. Sure she hadn't slept and she had just cried out every drop of water within her body, but one never asked a lady such things. Although, truth be told, she was not a lady. Commoners never were ladies. She lifted her chin and replied, \"I can speak. I know of the beast. He took my father. I am here to ask for his release.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Josette could have sworn that the handsome stranger's eyes glowed red, but it was gone before she could be totally sure. \"And just what do you think you have to barter with that such a mean and vicious beast would want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette looked down at her hands and began to panic. What did she have? She was simply a lowly girl of sixteen, barely able to keep house to her mother's satisfaction, and more trouble than her father had time to deal with. What could she tell this man? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Josette's spine stiffened. Who was this stranger and how dare he question her abilities? She raised her chin and set her lips. \"I hardly think that's any of your concern,\" she scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man surprised her by laughing and Josette jerked. \"That's the spirit!\" he gaffawed. \"I was beginning to think that you had no spunk at all. Come, I will take you to the entrance of the foul beast's castle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" Josette looked up at the tower and back to the man who was now walking away. She looked back to the tower again, afraid to leave this spot. What if the door opened and she could get in? She had to try to save her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not in there,\" the man called over his shoulder. He stopped and turned to face her. \"Well, are you coming or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette sat still looking between the man and the tower for a moment more. Father wasn't in there. Then where was he? This was the only dwelling she knew of inside these woods and it had always been rumored that the vicious beast lived inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" The man asked impatiently. Josette jumped to her feet and followed obediently behind him. Though she couldn't for the life of her understand why she did so. She didn't know this man. And the flash of red, had that been her imagination? What if he was taking her someplace to kill her? What if she would be sold into slavery? Josette's mind whirled a tornado of thoughts and doubts. This was crazy. She should go home, back to mother and Bran where she could be of some use, not wandering these woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are.\" The man had stopped in front of a small cave opening that looked barely big enough to fit Josette, let alone the body of a large beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are for what?\" Josette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The entrance to the lair of the beast. If your father is alive, he would be in here. The beast may trade him for you. You are pretty and young and could be quite useful to him.\" The man brushed a stray hair from Josette's cheek and she flinched back. He laughed and the sound both infuriated and pleased her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have to go in there?\" she whispered, and a shudder ran up her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so.\" The man replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette stood indecisive. She was afraid. It looked dark and small inside that cave. And what if this was to be the last day of her life? What if this was all a trap and Father was already dead. How could she know what to do? She needed his guidance to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to the man who stared at her with an odd expression on her face. \"I never did catch your name,\" she said a bit brazenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man winked at her and Josette's heart gave a little flutter in response. \"It's Killian,\" he said giving a grandiose bow. \"And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josette,\" she said, feeling suddenly shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man took her hand and kissed her fingers lightly. Josette's heart went wild with dancing at this and her cheeks flushed red. She had never had her hand kissed as if she were a lady before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he let her hand go, though, the spell was broken and Josette stood still unsure of what choice to make. \"Tell me Killian,\" she said staring at the opening, \"would you go in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillian was quiet for a long time and Josette looked back to make sure that he was still there. He lowered his head. \"The beast is my master,\" he said in a voice so low Josette could hardly hear him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your what??\" She screamed. \"I knew it. You brought me here to kill me. Where is my father? Is he dead already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillian shook his head. \"No, your father is safe inside. The beast will make the trade, but you must go in willingly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what happens to me when I make the trade? Do I forfeit my life?\" Josette's voice trembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will not kill you.\" Killian said softly. \"He has watched you as you venture into these woods. He is fascinated with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillian looked at her with an odd expression. \"Of course with you,\" he said. \"How can you not see...ahhh, but I get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get what?\" Josette demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can talk more later. Now you must decide. Your time grows short. Will you enter and make the trade or will you flea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette stared back at the entrance. \"I don't know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1139 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

With his one arm, he motioned her to move further away.<br>\r\nHe stood over the beast, still howling in such pain that sorrow struck his heart. He remembered from a time when he too was a different form, not chosen but taken and how the compassion of another had given his life a new path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He reached into his leather pouch hidden under his shirt and took out a pinch of stone powder, a vial of violet liquid and a tarnished silver medallion.   He knelt down a little ways from the beast, who was writhing still.  He put the powder  into the carved markings on the medallion and poured the liquid on it. The medallion turned shiny and a violet aura of smoke rose from it. The archer moved closer to the beast and with a knife in one hand and the medallion in the other, he knelt down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke in a low voice,\"calm now. I will not harm you more.  I can remove the arrow\" and grabbed the arrow to pull.  At the same moment, he placed the medallion face down on the beast's heart space and spoke in a strange tongue, not heard for a long age.<br>\r\nHe yanked the arrow and as the beast screeched a violet mist arose around them both, clouding them from view. The archer spoke more of the ancient words and light pierced the cloud. When it had faded, the archer stood there much as he was before, but on the ground was a young man of about 30 years old. He was breathing and looking rather bewildered. His one eye had a cut and he had some bruises but he was very much alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what happened? How?\" he asked. He shook his head.<br>\r\n\"The beast is no more\". He is vanquished from your soul and its entity has returned to dust. The spell on you is finished.\"<br>\r\n\"I ..I  have small recollection of being human but only of a thing of hunger, hate and fear.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, much memory is lost but you are returned to your self,and not quite, to begin again. To pay the debts.  No one but I and this girl know of what you were and many will wonder what has become of the beast.  You will not speak of this.  Nor will she.\" He turned to the little girl, Josette, who had fallen asleep. <br>\r\n\"I don't know what to say. How to thank you. You could have killed me. I would have done so to you.\"<br>\r\n\"Call it a boon passed on--and I would ask one of you.  Look after this girl and use your senses now to know what's true. A new path lies before you--it is a gift---and a choice.\"  he turned to retrieve the now tarnished medallion and placed it back in his pouch.<br>\r\n\"We may or may not meet again, so be at peace now,\" he said as he turned and walked back into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n507 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

I was a creature that hurt people, but now I vow to help them whenever I can.\" As the two walked down the street they saw a man on horse back coming towards them.  David grabbed Josette's hand and told her to not stare at the man.  The man was a large frightening looking person who was dirty and unshaven his hair and beard were long and matted together.  As he came closer to them David began getting an uneasy feeling about what might transpire with the man.  As he approached he spoke to David, <br>\r\n\"Who are you? and Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm David and I'm looking for a home for this little girl.\"<br>\r\nThe man spoke again,\" I need water do you know where any is?\"  \"no\", stated David \"we have not passed any type of stream or lake or anything yet but our journey is just beginning.\"  Josette, being a child and not knowing better ask the man was he looking for a pond to bathe in because he surely smelled bad.  <br>\r\nThe man just grunted at the little girl. David squeezed her hand as to let her know to keep her mouth shut.<br>\r\nThe man ask David where he was coming from? but David had been not himself for sometime and he really did not know where he was coming from nor did he know where he was going.  David looked at the man and asked if there was a town near by.  The man told him there was one called Winstown about fifteen miles<br>\r\nto the east.  David Thanked the man for the information and then he told the man he must be on his way.  David and Josette walked towards the east and Josette started singing a lullaby she had remembered from earlier, her mother would sing it to her before she was killed.  \"Who do you have what about your father asked David?\"  They walked for miles they were thirsty they only had one canteen they had been given when he was changed back.  The two of them had to share the little bit of precious water that was left.  Josette heard a noise and when she told David the two of them walked over into the woods and they found a single horse all by itself. \"Who's horse is that?\" asked Josette.  Well there is no one around , perhaps it got away from someone or something.\"<br>\r\nAt about that time David saw a hand lying palm up on the road when he moved the branches and brush it was a body of a man, who had been killed, someone had shot him and he bled to death.  \"I have to bury him,\" stated David. It is the right thing to do.  So he took the gear the man had lying beside him and in it was a large knife like a bowie knife, he began digging a shallow grave with the knife it took him hours of hard work but he finally got a whole large enough to fit the man into.  at that time it was dark again and he told Josette they would have to camp for the night. He riffled through the dead man's gear and found much like food, in the form of beans.  and canteens of water.<br>\r\neven a blanket.  it got cool that night and while Josette was asleep David took the blanket and covered her he did not want her to get sick.  He barely slept perhaps an hour or two then at day break he woke Josette.  The two of them were really becoming good friends they talked all the night until she fell asleep. She talked about what it used to be like when she had parents and how they treated her kind.  David you can start calling me Jo for short that is what mommy used to call me.  Ok Jo, lets get going we've got to find your father.<br>\r\nThey walked and talked and he would kid around with her she would run and hide from him and he would look for her.  the two had a wonderful trip they now had a horse to ride and food to eat, water to drink so they should get to town pretty quick on horseback.<br>\r\nWe should reach Winstown before dark.<br>\r\nThey sit peacefully on the horse until they started seeing the trees being more sparse, and they began seeing horses and people riding up and down a street.<br>\r\nThey knew they had arrived at Winstown.  \"We've got to get you cleaned up and we need to find your pa.\"<br>\r\nThe two of them went to the sheriffs station and told him that they were looking for the little girl's father .<br>\r\nWho is he asked the sheriff, at that time Jo spoke up his name is Randall Mcgovern, do you know who he is.\"  \"Well let me think\", said the sheriff, \"there was a man passed through here a few months ago with a name like Mcgovern but I can't remember if it was a Randall.\" \" What does your father look like little girl?\"<br>\r\nHe has dark hair like maybe black and he is a handsome man he is tall and always wears a cowboy hat, he never goes anywhere without it.\"  \"Well that could be the man I saw. But he was in a hurry to get out of town I think someone was threatening him or something.  Because he left in a flash.  No one knows where he went or why he left so abruptly.\"  \"Did he ever say anything about having a daughter?\"<br>\r\n\"come to think about it he was looking for someone but I never knew who.\"  Jo looked at David with her big sad eyes and asked him was he just going to leave her here in this strange place all by herself.\"  <br>\r\n\"No you are staying by my side until such time as we find your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 1045 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While scouting out he noticed some people near by so he went over to them and asked them if they knew of Jo's father, There was a man and a woman, \"No, I don't think so, unless it was the man who was killed last week by some kind of wild animal.\" said the man.  David's eyes got big because he knew of his history, surely to goodness he did not kill her father while in the state he was in.  \"How can I find out about this because I've got to find the little girls father,\"<br>\r\nsaid David.  \"You could ask the sheriff in town, your only about five miles from Buttermore, you can't miss his office.  He went back to his campsite after leaving the people.  by that time Jo had finished her bath and was dressed.  David told her to take a nap while he took his bath. She had no trouble going to sleep as the horse ride really made her tired and sore.  David quickly bathed and then dressed himself he then woke Josette up and told her there was another town up the road a piece.  So they loaded up and road the five miles to the town of Buttermore, it was a very small town of a sparse number of residents.  When they arrived David went right away to a diner, and ordered Jo something to eat.  \"Aren't you going to eat David? asked Jo. \" Yeah, but I've got a quick errand to run you stay here and eat and be a good girl.\"  With that being said David took off to look for the sheriffs office and sure enough it was just about three doors down from the diner.  He walked in and there sat two men in uniforms, he immediately asked the older man if he was the sheriff, and he was. \" Listen I have a little girl traveling with me and I am trying to find her father , I was wondering if you might be able to help me?\"<br>\r\nSure what is his name,Randell McGovern I think.\" said David.  Did you say McGovern? asked a surprised sheriff. \"Yes do you know of him\".  \"And you say you have his daughter with you?  \"Yes I took custody of her from a man back a few days ago to look for her family.\" There was a McGovern and I think his name was Randall here for a while but he was killed last week by a wild animal.\"  Oh my dear, where is his grave?  \"He is laid to rest on Poppler Hill.\" said the sheriff.   \"Do you say you have his daughter with you?\"<br>\r\n\"yes!\"  Well sir I'm afraid your going to have to find another relative of the girl's.  David finished his conversation with the sheriff, and he went back to the diner to meet jo.  \"Jo have you already eaten ?\" Not all the way done yet, I'd sure like to have a piece of pecan pie.\" \"Anything you want.\"  David ordered his food and gulped it down quickly he was trying to think of an easy way to break the news to Jo about her father.  \"We have some place to go when you finish your pie.\"  \"I'm finished \" she left the crust and ate all of the middle of the pie which is customary for children to do.  They went out, got on the horse and rode up to Poppler hill, where David and Jo got off their horse and walked up to the top of the hill,  \"What are we looking for?\" questioned jo.  Just follow me.  Jo may have been a young child but she was not dumb, she knew they were there to find someone's grave because David was looking at the names on each headstone.  Finally all the way to the top there was a freshly dug grave the dirt still had the earth smell to it where it had been turned over.  On the Headstone it read Randell McGovern,  Jo followed David up the hill and when she arrived at the top she was shocked to find her father's name on the stone.  \"Oh my God!\" she exclaimed. \"That is my daddy's name on that stone.\" Yes dear it is I'm afraid your father met with an accident last week and was killed.\"  \"What kind of accident?\"  David was hesitant to tell her because he knew that he himself had been wild last week.  and he feared that he could have been the beast to kill the man. She asked again,\" why did he die?\"  \"It would seem that he was attacked , but that is not what you need to concern yourself with We must find you some one to live with.\"  Jo began to cry, she was angry that her daddy died and her mother had died earlier, now she had no one and she cried even harder.  \"Don't you fret child   I'll be here with you until we can figure something out.  The two stayed at the graveside a little longer and when she was calmed down he told her they must be going they would go to the next town and try to see if he could find someplace for the girl to go.<br>\r\nthey left off the hill and were starting out of town when they heard a woman scream.  David ran to see what was happening and when he got there he saw a beast running away into the woods.  The woman who had screamed lye dead on the ground.  <br>\r\nHe is relieved that he was not the killer of her dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 1038 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

I wanted the village people to know that you cannot occupy yourself with the trivialities of our every day lives. I meant nothing more than that.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, then,\" the thunderous voice lowered its volume. In a conversational voice, it said, \"I'll let you off the hook this time.\" The cloud finger pointed again at Jalal. \"But don't piss me off again or it's curtains for you!\" Apparently, the great one wanted to emphasize his point and so a great wind blew through the village. Hidden in the trees, the village people gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloud slowly drifted until it reached the edge of the jungle and stopped. Slowly, it transformed into a face. A high forehead indicating great intelligence swept above a set of huge, dark eyes with purple iris's. A small nose resembling a ski lift jutted above a wide mouth, it's nostrils flaring and settling, then flaring again. When the face spoke the mouth opened to reveal two rows of large, sharp teeth. In the center of the top rows of teeth, two gold teeth glistened in the sunlight. <br>\r\n\"Stand up!\" The voice demanded. \"Do you dare to fear you God?\" <br>\r\n\"We're afraid,\" a small, disembodied voice rose from the jungle. \"Your ears are so big.\" <br>\r\n\"All the better to hear my subjects,\" the voice said. <br>\r\n\"But Master,\" the small voice replied, \"Your eyes, they are so big and all seeing.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, they are,\" the booming voice said. \"All the better to see you my subject.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, I can see how that works well for you, Master,\" the small voice replied. \"But your mouth, Master,\" the voice said meekly, \"It is your mouth that causes us the most concern.\" <br>\r\n\"As well it should.\" The cloud face stretched its mouth wide, releasing a foul smelling wind. \"But it is so big so that I am able to eat more of my subjects when they defy me.\" <br>\r\nJalal stepped between the cloud and the cowering people. \"Stop intimidating my people,\" oh great one.\" <br>\r\n\"You think you can demand of me?\" The mouth opened wide, its teeth glistened in the sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait,\" Jalal said meekly. \"It's just that these people love you. They respect you. They would do anything for you.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, okay, then.\" The mouth closed releasing a green mucus spittle that fell to the ground at Jalal's dirty bare feet. Suddenly there was a great roar as the mouth once again yawed with a great creak. <br>\r\n\"Please, don't hurt me,\" Jalal shouted and crossed his arms protectively over his head. But instead of feeling the God's jaws close around his body, its teeth sinking into Jalal's tender skin, a great sound bellowed.<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha ha,\" the great voice said jovially. \"Scared you, didn't I?\" <br>\r\nJalal moved his arms away from his head, his eyes searching the cloud for a sign that he was not to be eaten. Seeing the wide smile that remained on the cloud's face, Jalal let his arms fall slowly to his side. His shoulders sagged as he relaxed, now feeling safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call the people from the jungle, I want to see my subjects,\" the God's voice was now friendly, cordial, low in volume. <br>\r\n\"If you call them, oh great one,\" Jalal said, \"they will obey and come out of hiding.\" <br>\r\n\"I can't call them, Jalal, that is why I commanded you to call them.\"<br>\r\nFrom the jungle a disembodied female voice shouted, \"Keep your hands to yourself!\" The words were followed by the sound of a palm against the skin of a face.  <br>\r\n\"But why, oh great one?\" Jalal looked back over his shoulder and caught glimpses of faces peering from the wide leaves of the cuckoo bushes. \"You are their master, you can call them out of hiding.\" <br>\r\n\"I can't, Jalal, I told you that.\" <br>\r\n\"But why?\" Jalal's voice was filled with confusion. <br>\r\nThe cloud face turned a shade of pink that indicated embarrassment. \"My throat is too raw from all the shouting.\" The cloud returned  to its pale white color. \"Are you daring to refuse me?\" <br>\r\n\"No, no, no,\" Jalal said quickly. \"No, I wouldn't dare to deny your every command.\" <br>\r\n\"Good!\" the voice said. \"Call them from their hiding places.\" <br>\r\nJalal turned and faces the dense jungle. Although he knew all of the village people were concealed in the dark jungle, he could see almost no one. He cupped his hands over his mouth and called. <br>\r\n\"Everyone, all of you, man, woman and child. Old, young, firm and infirm, every swinging--\"<br>\r\n\"Enough, Jalal,\" the God's now soft voice commanded. \"Let's not get carried away. <br>\r\n\"You're obviously right, oh great one,\" Jalal said. Then to add to his kissing up, he said, \"As always, oh great one.\" <br>\r\nSlowly, ever so slowly, the jungle came alive as people rose from their hiding places. Slowly they came forward. Women wearing brightly colored sarongs, flowers placing color in their long, straight dark hair. Men stood, their animal skin loin clothes the only covering. In the midst of all the movement a young man rose slowly, and he attempted to use his hands to hide something beneath the loin skin, and a great red hand print covered his left cheek. <br>\r\nThe people moved forward until they stood as a group facing the great God. <br>\r\n\"Wow,\" the God's voice came from nowhere, from everywhere. \"You guys look great.\" The cloud shaped itself into a finger again and it pointed at a young female. \"What's your name, toots?\" <br>\r\nThe young girl backed away, but Jalal put his hand against her back and pushed her forward. He whispered into her ear. <br>\r\n\"Have you ever heard of the virgin sacrifice?\" <br>\r\n\"No, I haven't,\" she said indignantly. <br>\r\n\"Well, that's probably because we haven't been able to find a virgin to conduct the ceremony with.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, too bad then,\" the beautiful, pretty young girl said. \"Because your search has still not ended.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean your are not a...\" His words slowly ended.<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" the young girl said. \"What do you expect with all of the women running around with nothing above our waists covered, and the men sauntering around wearing only loin cloths.\" She looked at the young man who still wore the red handprint on his cheek. \"And some of the young men around here are bored, and aggressive.\" <br>\r\n\"Enough!\" the great one said. There are other villages, other village people.\" <br>\r\n\"What now, oh great one?\" Jalal asked, hoping to keep the God's thoughts focused on the problem at hand. His ability to stay concentrated is one of the reasons he was voted at the village's spokes person. <br>\r\n\"I've given this much thought, Jalal,\" the cloud said. \"And here's what I am ordering you all to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count 1385 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check5.png\" alt=\"*Check5*\" title=\"Check5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The beast preferred to defile the poppies, but today, it held back and was careful not to leave a feather or a scrap of fur in the area for a victim to be wary of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast was ravenous. It hadn't eaten a good meal full of juicy meat and crunchy bones for at least three moon cycles. What was drawing the delicious smelling humans to the area was not something the beast cared about, only that they were near by, and noisy; therefore, its prospective meals were not aware of the danger they were walking into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't walk, hop or fly, rather, the Shadow Beast oozed around the trees and grasses, smoothing out a bed of sweet poppies, placing flat, sun warmed rocks in a pretty pattern to encourage rendezvous or resting. Only a dark, cold, prickly sensation was in the air, enough to scare the rabbits away and the snakes to go back deep into their woody holes. The very light of the sun seemed to fall into the Shadow Beast, like a dark hole swallowing small galaxies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the area was prepared, the Shadow Beast: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nword count: 279 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Not the Fire Beast for sure. For the Shadow Beast is so evil and the nights so black. \u201d He let his gaze wander slowly about the tower room, in which there had been no change since he had last been in it, a year ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recalled the thoughts that had been in his mind then. The contents of this room were fixed in their way, as was the silver forest with its thick shrubbery and dense branches of its tall trees. No change should come in here, and for the better. Any change meant contamination. He had advised the powers that be to have the people who entered the place take off their shoes, wipe their feet, dust their clothes, and wash their faces and hands as thoroughly as they could. Anything to prevent any evil spreading. One never knew what to expect from shadows, especially when those shadows could turn to be a beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes grazed the brass andirons that stood as if they were monuments of order and stability. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you search the place with your eyes?\u201d The Realm Master asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Majesty, contamination is more to be feared than the Shadow Beast, as contamination is a forerunner to him. In other words, Shadow Beast goes where contamination is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would mean the entire realm,\u201d a council member said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said the Alchemist. \u201cThat is why this room in the tower should be kept meticulously clean of contamination, so at least the governing body can come to right decisions, without the Shadow Beast affecting the minds.\u201d He turned to the council. \u201cShadow Beast must be afraid of your strength,\u201d he advised. \u201cStrength always can mask what\u2019s brittle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother council member blinked, shaking his head. \u201cCan that beast do that, I mean affect the mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alchemist nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Realm Master looked away in deep thought, focusing on the lights coming from outside, at their glittery allure. When he turned to the Alchemist again, his voice carried great concern. \u201cTell me: What is the Beast\u2019s purpose in creating such havoc?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat I can\u2019t exactly say, Your Majesty, but I can guess it is the same as any other beast: To bring desperation to his environs so he can hide his own desperation.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExperiencing a ripple in his mind, the Alchemist\u2019s face crumpled; another time, another place, people wasting away, rivers drying, forests burning, beast and man in fierce wars with themselves and one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecurity, safety. What was that? After that time, he\u2019d never felt safe, not truly, not even while in the dungeon changing copper to gold or training dragons, no matter how strong he had made himself to be or how strong he\u2019s let others think he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas anyone ever strong enough? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jerked about, coming to his senses, and saw the Realm Master watching him with concern. He bent his head and looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me,\u201d the Realm Master talked slowly. \u201cWhat is making you so agitated, so worried?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling why he was summoned to the tower, he tried a smile, an absent smile without the consent of his soul. He pulled himself together, forcing the noise in his head cease, and faced the shocked silence of the room as the council members who had been murmuring among themselves had quieted totally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe experience I had at another time and another realm,\u201d said the Alchemist, \u201dI recalled that. It was too disjointed, too frightful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Realm Master waved a hand. A servant brought a glass of water to the Alchemist. He gulped it down. He was dripping with perspiration, although he was used to the heat of the dragons and this room was cool in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the realm is not in such danger, or is it?\u201d asked the council member who had first spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No.\u201d The Alchemist shook his large head. \u201cAt least not yet. What I had momentarily was the sudden surfacing of an emotional trauma with roots in a distant past. I beg your forgiveness for it, Your Majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to look so alarmed, Sir,\u201d The Realm Master said. \u201cThe council understands. As long as this problem of yours does not interfere with your present operation, disturbing your work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlchemist knew that stress should never be an issue, but to have witnessed such sorrows and not be affected was out of the question. The memories hurt so much\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe relaxed his stance. \u201cI\u2019m only a little jumpy, Sir, informational overload, possibly. Anyhow, I do have an idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPray tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alchemist thought for a second and pinched at his chin. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is different from my usual work, but here it is:\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n811 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

She saw anger, disbelief, and resentment. A proud people, they did not care to ask for help much less have to pay so dearly for it.

Good, they are starting to understand. Very bad things happen when Dragons do not get their way. They do not have the same sense of \"fairness\" as do the villagers, and so reasoning with them would be of little use. They wanted easy meals for the next ten years, and would hunt and destroy the Shadow Beast in exchange for those easy meals. The wise woman thought the village had gotten off easy, truth be told. It could have been far worse. There must be something more in it for the Dragons that the easy meals and the repayment of a small debt to the villagers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd had streamed outside at the first sound of a Dragon cry.

Usually, the Queen came to her for advice, but this time the Wise Woman felt she needed to warn the Queen of impending problems. Forewarned was forearmed, anyone knew that. She made the trip up to the royal castle, walking slowly as she pondered the current events, and what might go wrong. Surely, there were plenty of things that could go wrong, but the Wise Woman knew that the feel of the disturbance had an undercurrent of treachery to it. The problem was going to be figuring out who and what exactly they were up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she made her appearance at the castle, she was automatically ushered up to the Queen\u2019s chambers without uttering a word.

Those that should be on our side are going to do something very foolish, and endanger us all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen had learned the hard way to trust Reebahkah\u2019s \u201cfeelings\u201d. She was never wrong, and she never \u201ccried wolf\u201d over inconsequential things. \u201cWho are they and what kind of foolish thing are they going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Queen, I do not know. I would have to say that it has to do with our bargain with the Dragons. Many of the villagers did not think we got a fair deal, although they have no idea how easy the Dragons were on us. I am afraid some of them are plotting to cheat the Dragons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be very bad, indeed,\u201d the Queen agreed. The Queen was not a young woman, and had been ruling all of her adult life. She was a keen student of the land\u2019s history out of occupational need. She understood what the Dragons were capable of doing if they were angered. An involuntary shudder ran down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy were the Dragons easy on us in the bargain?\u201d asked the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is an excellent question, Your Majesty. I feel that they must have some stake in this battle as well. Dragons never show their full hands in any negotiation. The Shadow Beast must be a threat to them in some way we are unaware of at this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nword count 486 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Warriors become more fearsome adversaries. Merchants haggle cutthroat prices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd nobles jump for the chance at the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe wait in the throne room, the only room in the old castle large enough to hold all the assembled nobles without smothering them in their unmitigated anticipation. Tables have been arranged against the outer walls, providing refreshments for those who feel peckish and opportunities for political maneuvering for those who possess a different thirst. The throne holds silent court above us all, drawing the desirous gazes of those who for a moment forget that they are supposed to at least pretend they hope the King recovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels like ages have passed since the news spread throughout the city that the King had been attacked. A midnight assassination attempt, one apparently more successful than most. Now, we wait to hear if the healers at work on the King can save him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI briefly wonder if I should do something. The assassin escaped -- could he not be in this very room, plotting with the rest of us? And if he was, what could I possibly do about it? I am just a minor noble, the overlooked lord of a small farming hamlet. I'm only here because I was going to beg extra coin from the King's coffers. I certainly wouldn't be able to recognize an assassin if he stared me in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I head toward one of the refreshment tables to drown my running thoughts of hidden assassins, I hear it. A bell tolling from the castle's belfry, slowly, solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nobles stop their chattering and listen, confirming that it is in fact the death knell before becoming more energized. I see a few smiles from nobles who once claimed to be the King's dearest friends. One man begins walking up to the throne, prompting a handful of others to attempt to intercept him. It quickly devolves into a fistfight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe side doors open, sending a gradual wave of silence across the nobles. A finely-clothed official walks in, carrying a folded black and red silk robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe makes his way through the crowd, subtly glowering at those who try to approach him. He stops, not before anyone important, but in front of me. He unfolds the robe and lays it across my shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm too shocked to stop him, but as he pulls away, I grab his hand. \"Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He named you before he died. He did not have a chance to say why.\" He pulled his hand out of my grip and stepped back, allowing the others nobles a better view of me while I come to terms with my fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am Tyrl Keravin.

Several other nobles come to my defense.  Some king I am, I just stand there like an idiot, like I am watching all of this happening to someone else.

Attempted assassination of a king is punishable by death but ultimately, the decision is mine to make.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nI mutter that I will reach a decision in the morning.

His wizard had gone off somewhere. Sinclair didn't even mention where he was headed or why, the poor man seemed shaken to his core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking my head, I came back to the issue I was dealing with, what to do with the noble. I had to be strategic in his every move from now on. I had to show that I was strong, executing the noble might start a war but not if I set an example for others of what is coming for them if they set down this path of bloodshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, I woke up earlier than expected. A servant brought a message to me, my decision will be announced in the Execution Chamber in the basement of my castle. Skipping the morning breakfast, he made his way to the Execution Chamber. Just before entering the room, he heard whispering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think he'll do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, execute him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, he won't do that. He doesn't has the right to the throne and yet he's the king. Killing the noble, Michael, will only decrease his allies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I care, everyone knows he's going down no matter what, it's in his bloodline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it, everything was a mystery, at least about me, it was. No one told me why I was selected, what is in my bloodline, how were my parents. . . nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings men, what are we talking about?\" I looked at two of the guards and a noble standing with, I didn't let them know I heard their conversation just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Highness, morning. We were just talking about what a nice weather it is this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guard squirmed and the noble fidgeted. I wonder who calls scorching sun a nice weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's get this over with, bring him here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was tired in chains and his appearance looked worse than it was yesterday, he had dark circles on his face, dirt smudged on his clothes, hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, the highness is here himself, eh? So what's your decision?\" He spat, his face disgusted, I think at my sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are to be executed. I will bear no misbehavior at this important time, I want everyone to know where their fealty lies and who is their King. Take him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guards took him away, I had to do the second job, stop everyone else from rising against me, I turned to the noble man left, Cleven,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell this to everyone, all the people, all the guards, all allies, everyone should be aware of it. Tell them I executed Michael and tell them what had happened, no lies, no secrets, expose everything.

Bring Michael back.\u201d<br>\r\nI stepped back into the Executioner\u2019s Chambers and pulled my sword. The steel sung out. I let the sound pierce the air with no other word. The boots clattered on the broken stones of the Beastmaster\u2019s dungeon, and the clanking of chains and manacles echoed against the ancient stones as the guards returned with the condemned man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light in the chamber was ghostly with graying shadows walking across the circular walls. Sinclair, my wise counselor, materialized out of the damp gloom and knelt before me.<br>\r\n\u201cI am glad you have decided to execute justice for the sake of your people my Lord,\u201d Sinclair said, his words falling out on my boots. It was such a soft communication; no one else seemed to hear.   \u201cIf I may rise King Tyrl, I have something more suitable for this moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye \u2013 rise old man \u2013 what is this you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard rose and met my gaze with eyes that smoldered, stoked by an inner vow to serve the demons that tormented his soul. His gray beard hung like tangled moss off an old oak. He pressed his crooked body to its full height to stare into my eyes.  He huffed as he seemed to find what he was looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. What I have will be more suitable for swift justice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped into the shadows and drug out a sword whose length came to the wizard\u2019s cheek.  Its honed steel edges appeared to be on fire as they reflected the dance of flames coming off the torches. Its quillon and pummel sparkled with onyx, emerald and rubies, disclosing the weapon\u2019s royal heritage. Rather than hand the sword to me Sinclair lay it at my feet. Only one other pair of hands had known its killing power. It was more than a gift the old wizard had lowered to the stones in front of me it was a challenge to take the kingdom of the legitimate heirs now dead \u2013 all lost except for Lord Kriesmeer\u2019s sword \u2013 the dead king\u2019s sword. <br>\r\nSinclair nodded towards me as though I should know what to do. I stared at the great sword daring my inner strength to come forward to meet this challenge. I knelt down and clasped the handle and tested the weapon\u2019s weight.  It felt right. I rose to my feet, my hand directing the sword\u2019s point towards the ceiling as the guard pushed Michael forward. The executioner stepped forward his gaze barely meeting mine. I waited for his eyes to lock on mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are excused from your duty today, Strok,\u201d I said, bringing the sword to rest by my side. He bowed slightly and stepped to the wall. Sinclair too stepped to the wall as the guards pushed Michael down to rest his head on the oak stump.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Michael\u2019s eyes dart about the room, but he did well at cornering his fear, a warrior accustomed to facing death daily, he became still as I raised the sword above my head. I felt my center giving way at first, and then I was aware I could not focus straight ahead. I took a step back to recover and change my assessment of the sword\u2019s weight.  An arrow, from an unseen archer, ripped past where my shoulder had been just a blink of an eye before. As I moved away from the arrow\u2019s path, Michael lashed out at my legs with his chained hands. They caught my boots and footing gave way. I fell into the wall keeping the sword firm in hand and anchored to my front. The next arrow hit the steel blade. It glanced from my sword upward and nicked my right ear. I wanted to clasp my ear with my hand but resisted with all my might every urge to yield to the wound\u2019s demands. I bit back my urge to scream as well. I felt my blood trickle down my neck.  At last I saw the archer as his shadow betrayed the swift motion of his setting another arrow. I saw his fingers release the string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Michael at last found his feet and lunged for my throat. His thick form momentarily blocked my view of the assassin. The arrow struck his heart as it pierced his back. He fell dead at my feet. The guards once too slow to react finally cornered the archer and sliced his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere my Lord,\u201d Sinclair said ripping a piece of fabric from one of his inner robes, \u201clet me put this on your ear.\u201d Sir Cleven and Strok helped me to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly the moment of justice I had hoped for,\u201d I said grimacing.  Pain seared the exposed areas of my wound as the wizard bandaged my ear.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAn archer does not kill a king of his own accord my Lord,\u201d Sinclair said, his eyes so close to mine I could feel the heat in them. \u201cand I doubt that Michael was the leader of this ill-conceived plot to take your life. By that I mean you will have plenty of days to execute justice, my Lord Tyrl, and not just from outside your castle walls.\u201d The wizard pulled away the bloody cloth and pressed it into my hand. \u201cThis is the first blood. Your blood. And it is only a trickle because of the sword you now own. And should you wonder to long and too hard, it was the sword that saved your life.  It will want for blood soon.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While I waited for the noblemen to come to the chamber, I watched a heavily loaded raft, limp up the River Mirsey, against the force of snow melt pushing down stream. A dray horse and an old man latched their lives to the vessel and trudged their way northward towards Bethembly.  I wanted to shout at them for employing themselves in such a stupid endeavor, but at the moment my soul was heavily invested in as stupid an endeavor. In reality I should have donned some peasant clothes and yoked myself with them as the sweating trio of fools on the river's path - inch by futile inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noblemen will soon come to tell me that while I am King, I am a vassal. A slave more-or-less, to the house of the Seven. I am a King in name only, and probably this alone by the distinction that my subjects willingly pay all of their taxes to the stronger houses and the nobles have never lifted a finger to intervene. They too feel the sting of the heavy levies placed on us.  To which house? It varies. It depends solely on the house that is the strongest at the moment. They become our protector for a while as we feed them beef, venison, mutton and fish with the occasional bounty that comes from our soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy simple kingdom of Dimbersmere was never worth conquering, and the \"kings\" always capitulated and made bargains to keep from being slaughtered. As time went by, many of our citizens grew in their wealth as merchants and craftsmen. While this is a great accomplishment for the people and has won accolades for my hapless predecessor, it has nearly given us a prize status. Too poor we would be left to die - too rich? Could lead to some severe consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only mystery in the counsel of nobles is what guilds are aligned for autonomy and which ones want to bargain for another alliance. Either way, the price is going to be too high.<br>\r\nSir Cleven is the first to arrive and I am glad.  He comes to the window and chuckles immediately. Ie instantly grasps the significance of the what I see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be back to being your jovial self, my lord,\" Sir Cleven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not every day that one is nearly assassinated while attempting to execute a traitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did not need to be in harm's way. You could have left Michael in the hands of the executioner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would have been the logical way,\" I said, leaving the window and taking my seat at the head of the counsel table.  \"I suppose I had a notion. Foolish I suppose but I wanted to send a message to all traitors in my realm that I would be the one to mete out justice. And I guess by way of defending the realm in this small way I actually felt for a moment like I was king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will have plenty of opportunities for demonstrating your hand of justice.  There is a discontent rising between the classes of Dimbersmere. You've heard. You can almost smell it if you can't hear. The poor want a justice that won't come by a sword or any future alliance. Get into the midst of that struggle - that will prove your aptitude to hold the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that your counsel for me today Cleven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleven only smirked at me and closed his right eye as if to wink, but it was only his quirky way of dealing with his own inability to hold secrets tightly.  I knew there was a lot more he was holding back. Not for conspiracy reasons, it was just his way to never tell everything all at once. I would eventually get his full counsel. He would wait until all the nobles had spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three remaining members of my counsel arrived together. Each of their faces were grey granite, and though never distinguished by fain countenance or handsome features, they were as ugly as death today. I motioned for them to take their seats. All eyes averted meeting other eyes. Throats were cleared as if preparing to speak. Silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I learned at my mother's feet about such moments was that  it was a good time to take stock of who was with me.  I never pleased her. And tired of constantly scolded me she would instead punish me with long draughts from conversation and a sour face to peer into. This, unfortunately for my mother, whose beauty had faded quickly after I was born, became her method for dealing with everything that perturbed her in life. I found contentment in her grim displays of temperament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Sladhok at my immediate left hand was most like her. His eyes were red rimmed as though he had been crying for hours. He wore a tunic that bore the colors of his guild of merchants. They were merely butchers, but in a land that doesn't go to war, it gave him a very high rank amongst my other lords. It was the Sladhoks who had discovered Dimbersmere's great gift for growing meat. Lots of good, wholesome beef, venison and mutton. But above all that was the pork. Pigs flourished everywhere in the land and even the poorest of my subjects had herds of the foul beasts. Sladhok kept his watery eyes focused at some point far on the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from him, to Cleven's right sat the massive Tome. Having no title, Tome felt no need to make one up. He was a nobleman by the distinction of being able to turn raw materials into beautiful practical wares that commanded high prices from the Lords of the Seven Houses. A burly man who always dressed in black woolen shirt and trousers, felt most at ease when his massive chest and belly were covered by a black leather apron. His gray hair clumped in snake-like coils cascaded down around the ears that formed the most promminate outcrops from this boulder head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTome's eyes seemed to focus at last on Sir Nascar Kirwin who seemed oblivious to being the odd man in the bunch. He was the only true nobleman at the table, myself included. His great-grand -father was a Lord in the House Stark.  When Dimbersmere became allied with that powerful House, Sir Adele Kirwin was made Lord Protector and First King of Dimbersmere.  He was a benevolent king who allowed the Clevens and the Sladhocks to lead their various communities in any direction they pleased. His son, Sir Stephen Kirwin, abdicated his right to the throne as he went slowly mad after his third son Nascar was born. Nascar whose abilities as a musician and whose love of music and the arts made him odd in all other aspects of life, eventually did bring him notoriety throughout many houses. He became a collector and a broker of art and ancient writings. He had recently become a sought after agent for musicians and theater groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let the silence between us grow.  I looked hard at each man and Sir Cleven followed my lead. I couldn't help finding a peace in this bit of control I seemed to have over these \"lords\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count 1211 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The eyes that had studied the air around them suddenly locked on Sir Cleven. He nodded his head and all the eyes went to Sir Nascar Kirwin. I too was compelled to look on the Lord of Arts and Letters. I broke the silence with my own nod.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cThe floor is yours, Sir Kirwin.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nHe lifted himself from the chair and looked from counsel member to counsel member and then finally at me. He seemed as tall as a redwood sapling and as trim. His beard was groomed into a tidy triangle that still covered his thin lips. The blue velvet tunic he wore over a white linen shirt was decorated with the coat of arms of the Kirwin house -  A red shield that pictured a knight in golden armor astride a white stallion prepared to launch into battle.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nGiven Sir Kirwin\u2019s love of the royal parlors, I nearly laughed at the sight of so genteel a Lord adorning himself. Still it was important to observe my manners, despite the fact he was not my image of the dragon slayer his house used to represent. Frankly, I was surprised that he would wear anything that esteemed violence. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYou have called a counsel Your Majesty, I believe, because the seven houses that have vied for allegiance in the past will once again determine our fate.  If you will agree that we are a nation, then I will say those words. They will demand our allegiance once more as a nation.\u201d<br>\r\nKirwin\u2019s voice was heartier than I could remember, and while taking the long way around to his point, I could bare the weight of his journey. And I did not interrupt.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you do not disagree, then I will say it more clearly. We are the nation of Dimbersmere. We were formed to live autonomously from all other powers. Our forefathers were hunters and warriors who prepared for the generations to come, a land where we can live in peace and happiness.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nSir Cleven nodded at Tome and Sladhock and they both uttered a sturdy, \u201caye.\u201d I\u2019m sure my face betrayed by my soul\u2019s appreciation of the comedy that was unfolding before me. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cAs we know,\u201d Kirwin continued,  \u201cLord Afertyson, has wanted an alliance between his landholdings and our nation. He of course has no more strength against any aggressor than we ourselves possess, however he does have one thing that we do not and that is a powerful alliance with House Lassiter.\u201d  Sir Kirwin paused to let this news sink in.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nThe alliance between Lord Afertyson and House Lassiter was well known to me and I\u2019m sure Sladhock, Tome and Cleven had been discussing the worth of such an alliance for some time. But besides holding no love for the other Houses, Lassiter was in no way on common ground with Dimbersmere. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nAs if reading my thoughts Kirwin said, \u201cLassiter has of course, less favor with the other houses than we do, and they tend to be more accustom to fighting than diplomacy, but they are feared by the other houses because of their violent nature and with some increase in economic fortune they could re-arm themselves and become a powerful protector for both Dimbersmere and Lord Afertyson.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nTome was about to say \u201caye\u201d when I stood from my chair.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are suggesting we try to gain favor with this grissly friend of Lord Afertyson by re-arming them I would bid you consider a different course immediately. They are not a house to be trusted, especially if they are well armed.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nTome, his shaggy beard getting grayer by the minute, rolled his saucer eyes and grunted towards the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t worrby \u2018bout does prospects Mi Lord,\u201d he said pushing a cloth against his lips to dry them. \u201cWe\u2019ve nuffin Lassiter can use except our food. None of us affordin\u2019 no army now. But they are a feared bunch, I say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Kirwin blushed and nodded at Tome. \u201cHe is right your Majesty. An able bodied army fully armed is out of our reach\u2026for now.\u201d Naskars eyes widened and seemed to become bluer. What is called for, and is the most important thing I can say to this counsel, is a marriage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA marriage your grace,\u201d Sladhock interrupted, \u201cwill help the merchants in every one of the villages. The merchants doing well will help the farmers and hunters and craftsmen to have buyers for their goods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sir Clemens rose to address me, Sir Kirwin raised a finger and lay it carefully beside his nose. \u201cPardon me Lord King, for just one moment,\u201d he said, \u201c Will be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hand went involuntarily to my forhead and I rubbed the furrows that were forming without permission from their Lord. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe proposition is dependent on how badly you want to have a kingdom that will be a legacy for our children,\u201d Sir Cleven began. \u201cYou will eventually need a Queen, My Lord or your legacy will die right here and now.  Consider a Queen now and all of the possibilities of being in servitude the unholy seven for the next hundred years begin to fade.\u201d<br>\r\nI closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I looked each of my counsel members in the eye. Tome\u2019s black saucers seemed sympathetic and warm. Sladhock\u2019s eyes were steely and gray and narrowed. Cleven\u2019s were smiling and jittery. He blinked several times and I felt the smirk underneath his gaze that challenged mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door burst open and Sir Kirwin led two servants into the counsel chamber carrying a large picture covered with a black curtain.  Another servant came in with an easel and the picture was put on display before the counsel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a gift your Majesty,\u201d Sir Kirwin said, laying a hand on one of the lower corners of the curtain.  \u201cBehold \u2013 the dutchess of Afertyson.\u201d Naskar\u2019s hand swept the corner of the curtain upward and over the picture frame revealing the newly created painting of Lydia Aftertyson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment my breathing stopped as my heart pushed upwards past my throat. All the air around me was alive with the heavy sighs of men longing to be young again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1029 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check5.png\" alt=\"*Check5*\" title=\"Check5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her eyes locked on mine. A soft violet, the painter had captured within those eyes some tremendous luminous magic that made them sparkle. Her full lips were those of a child. Like rose petals responding to the sun, they parted slightly into a smile, gracious and alluring. Her face was round framed in long dark waves of hair of silk and burgundy wine.  <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI felt drawn to reach out for the image before me. I could have sworn some magic spell had been cast on the picture to entice men from their sanity. I was aware that even Sir Cleven was stunned by what the artist had captured on the canvas, though I had the feeling that he had probably seen it before.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nLydia had posed for the painting in a sitting position and her slender arms, delicate and white were bare. Here figure was enhanced by a blue velvet dress that gave the painter inspiration to focus on the flesh of her bosom that pressed upwards into full view above the tight bodice. <br>\r\nIn her elegant hands she held a pure white Persian cat that was obviously content to live on Lydia\u2019s lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAware of the long moments of silence, Sir Kirwin broke into my fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has her mother\u2019s beauty and her father\u2019s quiet demeanor. Beautiful isn\u2019t she?   The painter, Laoudra, has captured her perfectly, though there is no way he could fully appreciate the Lady\u2019s charm.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a fine girl,\u201d was all that Sladhock could say. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cMakes me wish I were the king,\u201d said Tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is more your Majesty,\u201d Sir Kirwin said laying a soft hand on the shoulder of one of the servants. \u201cBring in the next.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nSir Cleven, smiled and turned towards me. His eyes were dancing in a way that I had never seen before and I now knew that he was more invested in this presentation than how he had at first tried to appear.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nSladhock\u2019s paunch pressed hard against the wood table as he strained to see more of the girl in the painting. Lydia. What he was searching for I could not fathom, but the spectacle of a market ruffian being effected by the sight of pure, innocent beauty was amusing. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cAs you know Sire,\u201d Kirwin continued,  \u201cLord Afertyson\u2019s daughter is an accomplished rider and horse trainer. She is a brilliant manager of her own household though she is only,..\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cFourteen?\u201d I interrupted, remembering all to well the twelve year old Lydia and her ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to say 16, MiLord. Seventeen in three days actually.\u201d  <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI think you are mistaken,\u201d I said regaining my composure from my unfortunate outward display of lust and desire,\u201d It was only two years ago that I visited Aftertyson. And she was helping her mother make preparations  for the Solstice Celebration.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you at Aftertyson at that time?\u201d Cleven asked Sir Kirwin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I was Sir, and Lydia had turned fourteen that summer. It has been nearly three years and not two and when you see these\u2026Ah yes lads put those pictures there and help me mount the next one,\u201d Kirwin directed the servants.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll see King Keravin,\u201d Tome said, \u201cThat she is more than a pawn in a scheme of alliance. But truly a prize for the sake of the people of Dimbersmere. She will become a source of goodwill from your throne to your beloved subjects. I don\u2019t know that a king could ask for more than that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps, but that will be little solace when we are overrun by Stark and Baratheon pagans taking their taxes out of our flesh as well as our treasuries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook!\u201d Tome cried, as the next painting of Lydia was unveiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not contain my gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, uhumm, ummm, uhumm,\u201d Sladhock hummed his jowls loosening up as he took a drink from a jug that appeared from nowhere.<br>\r\nThe painting was of the Merlot haired Lydia, straddling a war saddle on a ebony colored charger. The thin mail links of gold glittered from the round tip of her chin over the thin garment that covered her chest. Her healthy woman\u2019s figure was probably exaggerated by the artist, but the obvious power of Lydia\u2019s slight frame was reverberating off the canvas into my soul. Her violet eyes were fierce as she contemplated some enemy of Aftertyson. The short sword in her child like hand was ready to be swung. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was charmed and amused by the painting that I supposed was to superimpose itself over my doubts of surviving what Stark would consider a \u201csuppression-of-a-Dmbersmere-rebellion.\u201d Why Aftertyson would give his daughter a certain death sentence troubled me. Why my counselors expected me to enter into such a rebellious liaison seemed nearly treasonous. Which one of them would benefit the most from my execution I wondered?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Clevens moved from his position next to me to stand before the painting. \u201cShe may not be a true warrior,\u201d he declared, \u201cBut look at how she could be the symbol of freedom and liberty for your people. Lydia the Hope of Dimbersmere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye,\u201d signified Sladhock, \u201cA vangord for justyce she be like!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Kirwin clapped his hands and pointed to the next painting. The servants quickly covered \u201cLydia the Vanguard\u201d and set the next piece in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Kirwin\u2019s hand toyed with the edge of the curtain a moment. \u201cBefore I remove the cover on this next image of your queen, your Majesty, I just want  to prepare you for the exquisite representation of heavenly womanhood that is revealed in it. The paint fades away quickly so watch over your heart with due diligence.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could attack Kirwin\u2019s disregard for my position, he lifted the curtain up and away from the easel. I blinked back a sudden surge of something moist within my eyes and grasped my chair. I knew my knuckles would be white, but I didn\u2019t care. No one could see me grasping for control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO mi sweet mother...,\u201d Sladhock groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt Cleven\u2019s eyes on me, burning through my heated face. As I met the pretty girl\u2019s gaze I knew instantly that Cleven dare not look at the goddess immortalized on the canvas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was painted into a scene from one of my childhood fantasy picture books where fairies and pixies  fluttered about in serene woodlands. In the scene painted before me the fantasy creatures were all around Lydia who sparkled with their own divine light. Lydia\u2019s hair was laced with red and yellow flowers and her eyes carried a sultry message that aroused my desire for her. She had engaged the help of the woodland creatures to prepare for a bath in a mystical pool, shimmering with ethereal light. The forest trees blazed with the cranberry, apricot, and squash colors of autumn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was Lydia\u2019s white - lily white - face, arms, neck and shoulders that grabbed my eyes, as the crimson robe appeared to be slipping away. It  was some helpful imps prancing about the hem of her garment who appeared to be her genteel valets. A kiss was forming on her lips and I was suddenly ashamed that I was viewing her in such an intimate setting, especially with the crude louts who were my counselors.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough Kirwin. Cover her up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirwin bowed slightly and motioned for the servants to remove the painting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1224 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> My head was bowed to my chest in deep meditation as I cooled the desire that had burned in my chest.  But there was no way to erase the image of the young Lady of Aftertyson preparing to disrobe. I wanted to end this meeting. Perhaps all meetings with these Dimbersmere rogues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThere is one more painting, your grace,\u201d Sir Cleven said. He paused, letting his words sink into my troubled heart. I even heard what sounded to be a dare in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a song as well,\u201d Kirwin said, and with those words a minstrel walked into the middle of the counsel chamber carrying a lute, a scroll and an unlit candle. He was dressed in black leather pants with a white linen shirt with puffed out sleeves.  He wore a flat leather beret with an orange feather two feet long jetting out from one side.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTome and Sladhock chuckled, but pushed their amusement back when Sir Kirwin cut them a stern look shaking his head. My mood was growing more sullen by the moment and I could not reason why I had tolerated this show thus far. <br>\r\nThe minstrel began plucking the strings in a soothing manner as Tome lit the candle. The air was immediately filled with the smell of lilac and roses as the flame touched off bits of scented wax.  I closed my eyes and let the melody and fragrances flow over me.  I sensed that my demons were making peace within me and in a moment this odd assault on my newly acquired throne would soon become history. I looked forward to going back to my private chambers and contemplate how I could curry the favor of the houses who protected Dimbersmere. And do it all without upsetting our friend Lord Aftertyson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is alright Rodney,\u201d Sir Kirwin said, speaking to the minstrel, \u201cSing Lydia\u2019s song for the King.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney rolled open the scroll so that he could read the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minstrel\u2019s voice opened softly.  His voice was full, and strong, but kept light with a breathy restraint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI am a foundling,<br>\r\nBut I am yours, my Lord,<br>\r\nI have prepared myself for you<br>\r\nAll my love, all my heart, <br>\r\nAll my soul are yours<br>\r\nPlease say you will love me too.<br>\r\nPlease say that you will love me too.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded along with the melody, entranced by the words and their message of love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rodney began to repeat Lydia\u2019s beautiful refrain, I slowly opened my eyes. Except for the minstrel I found myself alone with another extraordinary painting of her. My intended. My betrothed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could now discern the difference in an artist\u2019s style. An artist\u2019s view. I rose from my throne to get closer to the child\u2019s  image, as her song continued to grow in the chamber and in my heart.<br>\r\nRodney began a verse,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My hope you are<br>\r\nMy life will be<br>\r\nForever yours<br>\r\nTil Eternity<br>\r\nGive me a throne<br>\r\nAnd love me until<br>\r\nEvery ligt is all gone<br>\r\nAnd our heartbeat is still\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began the refrain I knelt before Lydia\u2019s picture and drank in her glorious sensual youth, her peculiar fidelity and her endless vitality.  \u201cYou are an amazing girl,\u201d I said in a whisper.  My soul ached to touch her. Oh how darling and sweet she appeared to be. I wondered about the artist who painted this work. Blumethal was his name and he captured a part of Lydia that drew me to her yet in other ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Unlike the other paintings the background on this one was opaque, suggesting people and things were present, but they were in a light that caused everything and everyone to fade away except for her. Eyes closed, her black eyelashes laced her cheeks and seemed to flutter a bit with each strum of the lute. In the curve of her delicate arm was a golden harp that she strummed casually with her slim fingers. Her dainty lips were parted to let the words of her song meld with that of the cardinals and robins gathered around her delicate feet. Her feet were bare and in every possible way they were <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked my eyes hard to clear the brine that washed across them. I fought the tears that begged to be released. \u201cYou poor child. What\u2026who, could bring you to this sad end? You are too fair and pure to end your brief  life in such a grievous way. Lydia, Lydia, Lydia, you speak of love like a romantic babe, as though you know me, but you do not. There are demons within me that would cause your love to soon turn bitter and cold. I could worship you \u2013 you probably know that. I could even make you my most prized possession. But you see my poor little dear - you would wither and become a river of scorn before I could ever love you the way you profess to love me.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarriage would only be a curse, sweet Lydia\u2026only a curse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music stopped and the flame of the candle was snuffed out. The scent of roses and lilacs was replaced by that of burnt iron and coal. I heard the scroll roll up. I buried my face in my hands as the minstrel left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI allowed the tears to splash to the rocks and wept for the destiny that was before me. I was afraid to die. Perhaps because I had never really lived. My bravado at being able to take the life of an accused traitor was long gone. I shivered to think that the arrow that was meant for me had imbedded itself in his heart. I unconsciously rubbed the arrow wound on my thigh and brought to full light within my soul what it would mean to die. The end.  Even to die for a noble cause. Death was final. No negotiation for more breaths, more sunlight, kisses or love. Death was the end of all things. I was too much of a coward to face death. \"To much of a coward to love you my dear sweet child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised my burnt eyes once more to Lydia\u2019s serene face. Pity the child. Pity the father who sells her so cheaply. She would be better spent given to a nobleman of a lesser house than the fool king of Dimbersmere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1060 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have had just a few days to rule your people. How does it feel?  Are you as much a King as Lydia is a Queen?\u201d<br>\r\nWithout looking up I knew I was addressing Lord Aftertyson. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cSo you would give up your daughter even though she will die a martyr\u2019s death?\u201d  I raised my eyes to once more look at \u2026.\u2019s painting.  I staggered a step on my weakened leg as I stood to my feet.  I lowered the black curtain over Lydia\u2019s image. \u201cWhat has my court promised you in return for making her Queen of Dimbersmere?\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nMy eyes still burned but I turned them on Aftertyson.  His head appeared to be that of an ancient tiger. Two scars formed an \u201cx\u201d between his eyebrows. The left eye seemed lazy and that same side of his face was sliding. His mouth drooped a bit as well, giving the aging tiger a place to rest his tongue when he was not speaking.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nHis clothes were laced with gold and silver brocade and accented with gold trim. His boots were polished black leather that reflected what meager light remained in the counsel chambers.<br>\r\n In his left hand was a black walnut walking stick, the knots of which protruded in every direction. No doubt it served double duty as a weapon. It was certainly better than a club and served the purpose of a cane very well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn my house, a female of 15 is still a girl. At sixteen she is a woman. At seventeen she is a Lady. Lady Lydia has been running my household since she was fourteen and has hosted most of the wealthy lords of all the houses in this part of the world.  I have received eight marriage proposals and one bonafide job offer for her to be made the Dutchess of some independent state far, far away to the south.  I\u2019m not exactly sure why, your grace, but she wants only you. Apparently you had some effect on her on your visit to Aftertyson.\u201d  <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYou approve of her choice?\u201d I asked, preparing to hear a deliberate annihilation of my character. <br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps I should second guess my original enthusiasm, but you have just survived an assignation attempt and your counsel was none too subtle in their pushing Lydia on to you, but it was I who commissioned the paintings, chose the scenes, and promised you to my daughter. Perhaps once you have a daughter of your own, you will understand the devotion of a child and the desire to give her everything she wants.\u201d<br>\r\nI knew I was smirking at the poor man. What a fool.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps you should consider accepting another of those proposals. Dimbersmere, if I follow the brilliant counsel of my learned Lords, will soon be crushed under the hooves of a thousand war horses.  I see ruble and destruction ahead. And whatever my court has promised you I assure you it won\u2019t be worth the price.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nAftertyson laughed. It was a roar that came from out of a cavernous place.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cAll I asked for was that I might be given a home here, preferably over- looking the river. Your Lord Sladhock has in fact given me his villa that is in the shadow of the south end of your castle.  I want to be close to my daughter and my grandchildren when they come.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nIt was obvious Aftertyson was out of his mind. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cSo my Lord, will you make a marriage? Will your nation be bound to my meager estate and my fortunes? I offer you my most cherished posseion \u2013 my daughter and with her a possible peace with your enemies for a hundred years.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI studied Aftertyson. Could madmen be so sincere that one would slip into their fantasy?  Why were his words drawing me away from my resolve? I must ignore my counselors and broker a sepearte agreement with the house Lassiter. I knew it in my bones. And yet? <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is Lydia now Aftertyson?\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cShe is probably at this moment a day or so away. She is on a barge coming up the river Mirsey. I prefer she have the comforts of home whenever she travels. She loves the river. She will arrive with her entourage tomorrow afternoon.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI could have run him through with my blood thirsty sword for the insolent smirk that was crossing his tiger-face. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cSo you have presumed that I will meet your Lydia, fall under her spell and marry her. Your presumptions would be enough to say no to your proposals. And no amount of engagement with your fair daughter will change my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nAgain, Aftertyson roared. His whole body shook. I felt the disdain and pity radiating from every part of his being. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cThere will be no engagement King Keravin.  As I have told your counsel. Your court. There be no engagement formalities. I have given you all I will give. You have the proof you of Lydia\u2019s charm in song and art. Is that not more than enough?  As this throne of yours is my witness, what you have of her thus far is all you will know of her before the wedding. If  you agree to this alliance you will marry her on the day she sets foot on Dimbersmere soil. If you do not marry her on that day, I will indeed leave you to a fate before your enemies.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYou are insane, Aftetyson!\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nThe tiger face softened and it appeared the old lord was about to burst into tears.  He leaned hard on his walking stick and shook his head, as if to fall down dead before me.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cAye - Believe me, I would prefer that she take any of the other proposals. So, yes I am insane. But I will give her what she wants. And because she wants a King in one of the most vulnerable pieces of land in the world, I will find some way to save you so that she does not perish. You have the word of a madman on that score. Just marry the girl. Then I\u2019d say you will have saved your pitiful little nation and no one will ever know what a coward you truly are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words stung deep and I began to forget the notion of being a king. I had not had the throne long enough to appreciate my powers and authority. I was not prone to do anything but yield. Yield to my court, yield to my meager alliances. Announce my pending marriage day after tomorrow and lose my life and yet live it. For that\u2019s what a marriage to a Queen would mean wouldn\u2019t it? Lose my life. Would I not be better served if I were run through with a sword? My subjects would not save me from this fate as most of Dimbersmere did not even know I was their king. Even if they knew, the fools would only rejoice that their monarch had found love. Divine love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo. King of Dimbersmere. What will it be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI limped back to my throne and eased my self onto the fringed cushions, pushing my weight back hard to suppress more of the ire rising up from my wounded soul. I stared at my adversary considering everything that had occurred in the last hour and put on as noble a countenance as I could conjur up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would prefer to announce my decision with my counsel present as witnesses. As your co-conspirators in this ambush, they should at least be present for my verdict.\u201d<br>\r\nLord Aftertyson\u2019s usual roar was stifled and came out as a lame chuckle as he rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVerdict milord?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pointed to the door and waved at him, the fires of rage well stoked to this point melted the last of my patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo! Go get your accomplices and return with them \u2013 and please \u2013 take your time.  I will announce my decision when you return. Now get out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1424 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u201cLydia is dressed in her wedding gown, your majesty,\u201d Sir Kirwin said.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI had been staring at the bride\u2019s barge below for and an hour, wondering what kind of girl she was. Who was the girl I was actually going to make my queen.  An artist could have easily falsified her beauty or exaggerated it in any number of ways. Though there had four different artists, so it wouldn\u2019t be likely that they were all hired to deceive me. She was probably just as beautiful as her portraits indicated her to be.  <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI have your wedding clothes prepared,\u201d Kirwin said, \u201cand your valet will be here in just a few minutes to help you into them. I think you will be pleased at how regal you will look. And this\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI turned to see that Kirwin as holding a new crown.   I had several, most of them plated with gold, but I found myself drawn to this one.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cThe counsel had this one especially made for you,\u201d he said. The light from the southern windows made the large opal, set boldly in the front, shimmer.  As I moved to examine it more closely I could see that there were horses etched into and all around the crown. Their slihouettes were formed by hundreds of diamond chips.  They glittered and sparkled with a kind of magic that I found pleasing, though I could not imagine why.  <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cThe future queen has been given a similar crown as a gift from you,\u201d Sir Kirwin said. \u201cIt conveys your love for her in a most practical way, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cLook Sir Kirwin,\u201d I said, \u201cHow I feel at this moment is not the business of you or my counsel or the people of Dimbersmere. This a marriage to consummate a dubious alliance and probably put an end to our nation as we know it, so while I will put up with the counsel\u2019s interference to my life\u2019s plan, what I think about gifts, brides, crowns and new clothes will remain my own last secret concerns.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is my sword by the way?\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYour valet\u2019s have it, your grace,\u201d Kirwin said. \u201cAnd here they are now.\u201d <br>\r\nSars, my valet entered my chambers leading three other men dressed in the uniform of Dimbersmere royal service. I did not recognize the other three and took it to mean that the counsel had been hiring new staff to accommodate the future queen and her entourage. <br>\r\nSars carried in my wedding garb, another was assigned my shoes, another my belts and the last carried in my sword. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nThey all bowed before me and waited for Sars to speak.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cMay we attire you my King?\u201d Sars asked. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI nodded my assent and took a seat on the red velvet cushion that topped the cedar chest at the foot of my bed. The valet assigned my boots jumped to my feet and tugged each boot off, laying a towel over the granite floor so that my stockinged feet would be cushioned from the rock. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n My day to day garb was removed and my new clothes were methodically put on me.  I sat for the highly polished boots to be installed on my feet and when I stood,  a valet stood on the cedar chest and draped a scarlet cape over my shoulders.  Sars jumped up on the other side of the chest and placed the crown on my head.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nSir Kirwin clapped his hands and I felt the frown for my face bend part of my jaw. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYour Majesty looks absolutely handsome and regal this special day.\u201d  He bowed low then snapped his fingers. Sars and the valets bolted from the room leaving the sword in Kirwin\u2019s hands.   <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cSurely you won\u2019t need this weapon on your wedding day sire.  May I put it with the other weapons in the hall?\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. I will take it with me to the barge and leave it with one of my guards, but I do not want it far from me today.\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nWhatever confidence I had given to Sir Kirwin was now gone.  I did not want to give him any more fuel for thinking I was coming unglued. But the fact was that there was an entity still at work that wanted my life. My guards, when they were conscious were able to put down any kind of demonstration, but a skilled assassin would be no match for their lethargic methods for keeping me safe. But I didn\u2019t want the overreaction of the counsel that would have sent another hundred guards to surround the wedding party.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cMay I lead the way then milord? If you are ready.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n We walked through the passage ways of my wing of the castle down into the lower court yard.  My horse was prepared and I climbed up the ramp to mount so that I could master the long sword, my lack of mobility because of the arrow wound in my left thigh and my lack of enthusiasm. I heard the snickering from some of the stable boys, but at this point I didn\u2019t care. It was four miles down to the river Mirsey and I wasn\u2019t about to walk that distance. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n At the moored barge of my bride to be, my guards assembled around the entire landing. As I had feared, many more guards had been added to my entourage.  I eyed all of them carefully, not at all sure that one of them, might be the one to make the next assassination attempt.  <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nThe ride had caused my wounded leg to throb and I could see dismounting my horse with no platform was going to be difficult.  I handed my sword to one of the guards.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cPlease take care of that until after the ceremony,\u201d I said.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYes.  Of course your majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI slid off my horse and as my feet touched the ground  searing pain sliced through my thigh. I grimaced and shook as tears tried to fill my eyes.  <br>\r\n Sir Tome and Sir Cleven were suddenly at my side but waited to touch me.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cAre you all right King Keravin?\u201d Tome asked.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course I am just fine,\u201d I said, \u201cBut please help me when we step aboard the barge.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nThe place the Aftertyson barge had moored was surrounded by towering maples and sycamore trees aflame with the radiant colors \u2013 orange, yellow and reds \u2013 of autumn.  The evergreens, pine, fir and cedar added a depth of green up and down the river Mirsey from Dimbersmere Landing.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nAn organ played from somewhere deep inside the barge and Lydia\u2019s members of the wedding marched onto a platform that overlooked the river.  My party included Cleven and his wife,  Sir Sladhock, Lady and Knight Kirwin and Sir Tome and his wife and two older daughters.  I followed them up the platform to the arbor that formed the groom\u2019s side of the makeshift chapel. <br>\r\n\u00a0 <br>\r\nThere were few guests. Mostly Aftertyson and family. The people of Dimbersmere would be informed of the marriage later and a possible re-enactment of the solemn ceremony would probably occur later for their benefit. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nThe music grew louder as the doors that contained the sound were thrown open. Lydia floated in on the trumpeted notes, her delicate feet gliding along the deck. She was dressed in a white gown, with a heavy white veil over her face.  In her hands was lain was a bouquet made up of six hydrangea blossoms of white, pink and purple. I tried to capture this serene moment in my mind so that if I should become an artist someday, I would be able to recreate the moment on a canvas. Lydia was perfect adorned in her white wedding gown.  <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nAs the music faded away and I stood shoulder to shoulder with the new love of my life, the official of the wedding began.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWho gives this woman to be married to this man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1318 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A servant bowed low and offered up a red velvet pillow. In the middle of the pillow was a simple gold band. I placed it on Lydia\u2019s finger while her eyes stared at me.  In moments the official took us through the contractual agreements of our pledge and vows until with both said our \u201cI do\u2019s\u201d. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI now prounouce you husband and wife,\u201d the official said. \u201cYou may kiss the bride.\u201d     <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nThe kiss. It was all too fast. The vows, the ring, the future the past. A marriage, a queen. What was next cohabitation, children, bondage \u2013 forever?  But a kiss. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nHer violet eyes, velvet smoke, softened and seemed to fill with tears. Her lips were parting and she leaned towards me, giving me the sense that her love was mine forever with just one kiss. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI placed my arms around her and I could feel for the first time her strength and power. She was not at all as delicate as she had appeared in the paintings. But everything about her was firm and full. My lips finally touched hers and she pressed into me so that I could feel all of her body. The kiss was warm, sweet and inviting. I felt the warrior in me at last surrender.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cMembers of the wedding,\u201d the official said, \u201cPresenting the King and Queen of Dimbersmere.\u201d The barge rattled with the stomping of feet, applause and a band of fiddlers.  Seven flaming arrows went up high over the river and moments later the bells of the Dimbersmere chapel were ringing, clanging out the message that a marriage had taken place. Messengers would soon be every where in the land announcing to the citizens of my kingdom that they were blessed with a new queen.  Queen Lydia of Aftertyson would soon be a beloved symbol of peace and tranquility throughout my realm and over night my success as a king would be assured.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nLord Aftertyson was the first to come and bow before us.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYour grace,\u201d he said to me turning immediately to his daughter, \u201cyour majesty, may your lives together prosper and your reign last a thousand years.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cThank you father,\u201d Lydia said, and her hand reached out in one of the most regal poses I had ever seen. Aftertyson took her hand and kissed it lightly. He turned to me and pushed me along the ramp to shore, while Lydia struggled with her dress\u2019 train. It appeared to anchor her to the ramp. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations King Keravin.  You have made an excellent marriage. Now if you will excuse me, my lands require my immediate attention.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI looked hard at Aftertyson.  He appeared to me more calm, relaxed and at peace than I had ever seen him.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for your kindness and counsel, Sir Aftertyson,\u201d I said, \u201cbut won\u2019t you please stay for the celebration. Your south Dimbersmere villa is all prepared for you and your party. Anything that is lacking I\u2019m sure we can immediately remedy. Do please stay.\u201d Afteryson managed to smile as he blushed and coughed back a bit of a laugh.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI felt the tension rise up in Lydia though she was now standing several feet away working with some ladies to free her train from the barges\u2019 ramp. Her hands worked the fabric with such ferocity that I wasn\u2019t sure her anger was because of the dress or something that had been said.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t misunderstand my urgent need to return to my holdings. It will take me three days by carriage and I am already negligent in overseeing the harvest and making sure my workers are compensated. You and Lydia have a new life together that should not be influenced by my presence, and it would be better for both you and my daughter to have as much time together as possible, especially the next few months.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI offered my hand to my father-in-law and he grasped it firmly. His carriage pulled alongside us and with no further farewell, he was gone.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI could hear Lydia\u2019s sigh as the carriage vanished, and watched as she motioned to the guard who was holding my sword. He drew near to his Queen bowing occasionally as he approached her.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYes your Majesty?\u201d he said.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cGive me that thing,\u201d she said pointing to the sword. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nHe handed it to her hilt first and she swooped it up as if it were made of tin.  \u201cStand back,\u201d she ordered the ladies attending her train. As they did she stabbed twice at the cloth imbedding the sword in the planking of the ramp. She pulled her dress onto the razor edge of the sword and slowly turned causing the blade to slice the ivory white satin cloth of her dress. As the train and dress fell away it became clear that underneath she wore a pair of leather riding breeches and black leather boots. Her footwear covered her legs up to her knees and clearly two inches of her height came from the sharp heels of her boots.  <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n She strode through the ranks of guards who were still mounted on their horses until she came to an animal that seemed to please her. She turned to me and batted her eyelashes, her pretty face lit up like that of a precocious child.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cMay I have this one, MiLord?\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nThe guard looked at me dumbfounded by the Queens request.  <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI pointed to him.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cGet down off of your Queen\u2019s horse,\u201d I commanded.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI thought for a moment the poor man was going to cry as he slid off of his mount. He lingered a moment hugging the animal\u2019s neck. I couldn\u2019t believe it true, but it seemed the poor horse was about to cry as well. He nuzzled a farewell into his former owner\u2019s side.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nLydia ignored the tender moment she bounded into the saddle with one leap. As she yanked the horses head to attention she drove her boot heals hard into its flanks. The horse bolted through the crowd of guards and members of the wedding sending men and women sprawling to the turf. The laugh from my bride as the horse flew across the meadow towards the south end of Dimbersmere Castle, sent a chill down my spine.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nThe heartsick guard approached me humbly and in a barely audible voice he said, <br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s an amazing horsewoman your Majesty. I am glad that mihorse Misty<br>\r\nIs now hers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI nodded to the poor man. \u201cNever mind all that now. We\u2019ll get you another horse, even better than your Misty. In fact you keep a look out and let Sir Tome know the one you choose and I will make sure that it is yours.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nPeople began to crowd around me their eyes wide with wonder in the wake of my Queen\u2019s unexpected departure. They opened a walk way to the gangplank of the barge. I stiffened my spine and strode to the planks to retrieve my sword. I secretly cursed Lord Aftertyson and contemplated putting an end to the day\u2019s celebrations. My subjects, pitiful in so many ways, needed this celebration. It would be a time to toast the monarchy, as unstable as it was, and a time to find a reason to be proud to be a citizen of such a glorious kingdom as Dimbersmere, even if that was a dream.<br>\r\n\u00a0  <br>\r\nI turned to go back to my horse only to discover that I was elevated enough to be able to see the entire congregation before me and that I had their complete attention. It seemed and appropriate time to make a proclamation.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cDearest citizens of Dimbersmere, on this grand and glorious day, may I invite you to proceed to the celebration of our new Queen \u2013 Queen Lydia Keravin. I am sure she will join in the celebration when she returns from trying the wedding present I have given her. Please eat, drink and have a merry time. I will join you in a few moments.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0 <br>\r\nThere were cheers from the wedding party and the crowd of people laughing and smiling ambled towards the tents.  During the disbursal Sir Kirwin and Sir Sladhock rushed to my side completely disregarding protocol they were each pressed in close to me to whisper their concerns.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cAll of our guards along the roadways have not seen her,\u201d Sir Kirwin began. \u201cEveryone has reported in to my messengers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cAb yo ideas wher she\u2019d be?\u201d Sladhock hissed.<br>\r\n\u00a0 <br>\r\nI shook my head no, but of course if she had not been spotted on any of the roads in and out of the Dimbersmere Castle, then there was only one place to the south of here where she could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1442 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the last mile to the Aftertyson villa, the drama that was the last two hours replayed miserably in my head.  I heard the cheers as the celebration was announced, the looks of utter disappointment, as I entered the celebration on my own. I plastered a look of happiness on my face and tried to enjoy a dance and then a toast to the King and Queen and then finally an exit, a half hour ordeal perpetuated by well-wishers and panderers.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI had not rode my horse more than a mile in over a month, not withstanding the short ride that morning. I felt every movement of my mount below me and though he was pressing to break into a full gallop I was not confident enough to do more than a frantic saunter.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n At the livery behind the villa, I left my horse with the stable boy who was still working with Lydia\u2019s horse. I limped towards the main house and was greeted at the door by a footman I had never seen before and then a maid, who was a surprise to me as well. They nearly fell to the floor trying to bow sufficiently, obviously not schooled in the fine art of serving royalty.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cAre you in service to Queen Lydia?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n\u00a0 <br>\r\n\u201cYes your grace,\u201d answered the maid.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWell it is not necessary to observe the customs afforded royalty while you are in service here. Do your assigned tasks, speak only when spoken too and we will get along famously. Do you understand?\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nThey nodded and bowed only slightly and made their exit.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI entered what I thought would be Lord Aftertyson\u2019s parlor to find my bride lounging in front of the massive stone hearth.  Her hair shone brightly with a recent brushing and she had changed into a loose fitting green satin gown.  She hummed a tune as she gazed into the flames.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYou disappointed a lot of people this morning Lydia?\u201d I said. \u201cAs the newly anointed Queen of Dimbersmere the members of your court wanted to have a first glimpse, before they share you with your subjects at large.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nShe did not look my way. Two fingers found a lock of her burgundy colored hair and slowly twisted the strands.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cDid I disappoint you too my King?\u201d she asked her voice much deeper and more sensuous than I would have expected. She turned towards me her eyes a violet dance filled with mischief.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI bowed my head not wanting to draw near. It seemed that rejection was close at hand and I could not bear to be discover how much I disgusted her. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cNo my queen. I don\u2019t believe you could ever disappoint me. Perhaps though you could tell me why you are here and not at your celebration.\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d Lydia teased, \u201cYou are disappointed in me. Well really\u2026umh what should I call you? Tyrl is not a good name for you. Keravin might be too much. You are cute, for a king, maybe we should think of some pet names.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nShe pouted a bit with a pleasant blush covering her face. The pinky of her right hand traced a portion of her lower lip. I felt seduced and yet sure she had no idea what she was doing. Her eyebrow furrowed. Flexed. She smiled at me at last and went on.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway King Cutie,\u2026oh that is awful, we\u2019ll work on that. You know I love my barge. I\u2019m sure Aftertyson told you, but it was three days of nothing but that barge. I had enough confinement to last a life time. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I know it was rude and ill mannered to take that poor man\u2019s horse, but the thought of being a hostage to a bunch of gawkers was more than I could stand.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nAnd there she was. The beautiful Lydia of the paintings. Soft, endearing, fully woman, enchanting little girl.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI am glad we are married, darling\u2026oh my goodness, that will never do. It\u2019s funny I didn\u2019t think of what to call you the whole time we were engaged.  You honestly don\u2019t look like a Tyrl, what was it I called you when you came to visit that time?\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI remembered her name for me perfectly, but I hated to remind her. It seemed an ancient moment when I was not charmed by her, but spent my visit at Aftertyson avoiding her. I could feel her eyes on me, but rather than look at her I gazed at the flame behind her letting my disinterest in this conversation be apparent. She lifted her arm from the velvet sofa using her hand to beckon my response. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cPrince Rude,\u201d I said.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cOh mercy, yes\u2026\u201d her laugh was warm and invited me to laugh with her. There was a growl rising in my throat instead. She was going to say it and I knew was coming. Not malicious as back then but filled with something I had never seen in a woman before. <br>\r\n\u00a0  <br>\r\n\u201cThat is it. Prince Rudy. And because we couldn\u2019t say it fast enough it was shortened to Prudy. Even Aftertyson thought that was funny, so we kept it up because it made that poor man laugh so much. Prudy, Prudy \u2013 why are you so rudy?\u201d  The prickles started from my shoulders and went to my legs. I wanted to itch them and yet show my careless concern for her immaturity. Still, hearing her rich contralto sing the song was not unpleasant. But I needed to make her silly game end.   <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cNow are you disappointed in your bride my Lord?\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0 <br>\r\nI shook my head and walked to the chair by the hearth. \u201cNo of course not Lydia,\u201d I lied.  \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just call me Ty?\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cTy love? Love \u2013 that\u2019s nice isn\u2019t it? It sounds so hopeful. I know you don\u2019t love me now, but I will eventually win your love. I know you are drawn to me like all the men of this world. Even Aftertyson grew to love me after a while. You\u2019ll see. My love will become your love and eventually we\u2019ll have a family. A family of love.\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nShe stood at the foot of the hearth and looked down at me. Without the boots on I now saw that she could not have been more than five three or five four. The gown she wore was loose enough to hide her figure, but I was now fully aware that it was not possible for her to be nearly eighteen. She was still a little girl.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYou remember when we found out you could play the piano forte, but you wouldn\u2019t do it for us? That Sir Kirwin who is always hanging around told us that you played beautifully and could read the music we had. But would you help us do our song for the harvest celebration?\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cNo. You kept saying you forgot how to play. That\u2019s when we started calling you old old Prudy.\u201d She closed her eyes and for the moment seemed sad. I didn\u2019t remember the incident, although I remembered the children calling me old, old Prudy.  Why would she want to tell him about something so sad?<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t that old,\u201d I said.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYou were twenty-seven. Not old for a man of the court I suppose. Old for the farmers and the knights and the politicians Aftertyson wanted me to marry.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYou were just a child then, everyone must have appeared to be old to you.\u201d  I waited. I am sure she had no guile or shame or cunning. She would say it.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI was thirteen,\u201d she said and then bit her lip. I nodded my agreement letting her know I knew the truth.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that was three years ago, wasn\u2019t it Lydia?\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cIt could have been I suppose.\u201d her gaze was half playful \u2013 half serious. What was I to do with a child bride. She would be sixteen in what? Twelve days.  Sixteen. I was thirty and growing older minute by miserable minute. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cSo what did you get me for a wedding present?  I hear that in Dimbersmere it is customary for the groom to give his bride something special. A treasure.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\"I did give you a very valuable horse. He was certainly treasured\"<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cOh that. I would not want to keep that poor man\u2019s horse. No matter what you give him in return it would never be enough to make up for the loss of his dearest friend. Besides I chose that as a momentary prize. Surely you must have scoured your entire kingdom to acquire for me an everlasting treasure to cherish the rest of our days together. Something that would declare your undying devotion to me\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nWhatever my feelings for Lydia before this moment, I began to know of her true worth in this precious moment before the fire. No matter what game, plot or political expediency drew her into this odd relationship with a strange man, she was a virtuous child, acting on behalf of a family she obviously was loyal too. Why else would she be here \u2013 so vulnerable? I smiled at the thought of giving her something special. It certainly would the first step in let her understand my appreciation for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1540 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I had not prepared a gift for my bride, wrestling as I had with the whole notion of marrying Lydia. I had three days. I had in that time seventy hours of wresting with all the ideas around marriage to her and two hours to pick out a gift. I was not bound by tradition of course, but she was of an age when a gift was actually the perfect bridge between the two islands we were in this arranged marriage.  I admired her calm with me.  If I were her I would be terrified of what a marriage to a potential tyrant would be like.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a gift for me do you\u2026Your Majesty\u2026Ty,\u201d she said. I felt she was teasing as much as feigning disappointment.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you should tease me about that, Lydia. But, I\u2019m not going to lie to you and say that one of my Lords is holding it for you back at the celebration or that I have it in my\u2026our chambers in Dimbersmere. I will always be honest with you. No I don\u2019t have a wedding present for you that I scoured my kingdom for.\u201d  The image of Lydia wielding my sword as though it were a four foot long match stick flashed through my thoughts. \u201cBut I do have a present for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nLydia\u2019s eyes widened and danced and she took another step closer to me.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYes, now that I think about it, I have the perfect gift for you.\u201d I carefully  got up to avoid contact with my bride and slipped out the door. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nAfter a quick trip to the stable I approached Lydia. The light seemed dimmer in the room. It cast a warm glow on her pale skin. She held her hands behind her back. She stood on her tiptoes trying to peek at the object I held behind me.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI quickened my step so that with one motion I knelt before her and lifted my sword, its hilt in one palm of my right hand and the razor edge cuffed carefully on the sleeve of my leather coat.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my wedding gift to you my queen,\u201d I said looking steadily into her velvet soft, violet colored eyes.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nHer hand covered her mouth and helped to stifle her gasp.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does this mean, King Keravin?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI am giving you my sword; my grandfather\u2019s sword actually. He was a great warrior and protector of the people of Dimbersmere. Today, you have sacrificed yourself and in some way that I don\u2019t understand, have rescued the people of Dimbersmere. Your courage and self sacrifice alone would entitle you to my Grandfather\u2019s sword, but I offer it to as a symbol of your power and authority as Queen of my humble nation.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI bowed my head and raised the sword up to where her dainty hands could take hold of the ancient, deadly weapon.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nInstead of taking the sword, her hands caressed my head. Her fingers threaded their way through the strands of my hair. I wanted to pull her to me and embrace her forever. I was glad and it was good that there was a merciless blade between us.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nHer hands found my chin and raised my head and her warm lips kissed my forehead. She was tender and yielding but I dare not over ride my sensibilities as I was tempted by her budding charms. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYou do surprise me my King,\u201d Lydia said, \u201cYou surprise me, but I now know that you are not at all that Prince Rudy anymore. You have always been a distant wish in my heart, I think, and I will cherish this gift and pray that we will never need to use it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nHer right hand gripped the hilt of the sword. And again with the agility and strength she displayed at the wedding, the heavy elements of the weapon lightened and sailed upward at the command of her elegant hand, wrist and arms. I was in awe of her energy transfer into that deadly instrument and watched as she propelled it before her to the mantel piece. She masterfully found a home for it there. I was grateful for her acceptance of my gift and grateful that the sword was no longer mine or my responsibility. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI rose to join her as she stood admiring her handiwork. I rested my arm lightly around her waist wanting to infer nothing more than respect and honor to this beautiful child.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cAre you glad you married me?\u201d  she asked.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course Lydia,\u201d I said. \u201cThe only question now is what to do with you until you are the proper age. I suppose you could live here with your father, and kind of be like the Lady of South Dimbersmere. Not that you wouldn\u2019t be the Queen, it\u2019s just you would still be a part of your father\u2019s house until you are the proper age to really be married.\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nLydia slid gently away from me. A cloud of something from inside her darkened the pretty features of her face.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cThen you honestly don\u2019t know?\u201d she said, seating herself at the edge of the sofa. \u201cThey didn't tell you that my father is dead. I haven\u2019t been a part of his house since I was eleven.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Something had been odd about our earlier conversation and even her presence in Aftertyson\u2019s villa seemed peculiar, but with these words I felt I was nearing something I didn\u2019t want to examine. Especially not after pledging just a bit more of myself to her troth. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Aftertyson left the wedding party just minutes before you did. We both were there, we\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cAftertyson is not my father,\u201d she said with a nervous laugh. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, he didn\u2019t tell you? No, of course he didn't tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI tried to control my shock and anger and confusion, but I was not good at such things. I was a poor politician and I would have been a horrendous ambassador. I went to the sofa and took a knee before her, worried that I was at last being drawn into the intrigue I was trying to avoid, the plots that would mean the ultimate destruction of Dimbersmere. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cAftertyson is my adopted father. Well not even a father really. I am more of a ward to him.  He was deeply in love with my mother and so when my father died, he attempted to win her love. And I think she did love him as well, but the issues surrounding my home were too complicated.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply sorry for your loss, Lydia, I had no idea. I can't imagine why Aftertyson didn't tell me the truth.\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u201cWell that was nearly five years ago now. Perhaps he does think of me as his child. When you came to visit Aftertyson, I was still grieving. Not just my father, but also my mother. I didn't understand it all at the time and I\u2019m still confused by what happened, but I was told that my mother had become gravely ill and that I was being sent away to a friend who would watch over me until my mother got better. As time went on I was aware that she was not getting better and that the people around her were concerned about things that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYou could never understand,\u201d a familiar voice came from behind us, \u201cat least not yesterday, but you will understand everything very soon.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI was appalled by the intruder's presence.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord County = 1257 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

I had never noticed how old and crooked he had become until that moment standing next to my child bride. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve come milord to tell you and your wife a lovely tale, which as you may have guessed, Lydia, has already begun.  You of course don\u2019t know the whole truth or you probably would not have come\u2026or would your Majesty?  You seem to love your King Keravin. Well I don\u2019t know, maybe in the end you would have had no other choice. Your Lord Aftertyson saw to that, driving off every decent offer from every other house.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re mistaken about my benefactor\u2019s intentions, sir. I\u2019m sure all of his talk about suitors was just to make me feel better about losing my future in the House of Lassiter. There were no such prospects I am sure.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nLydia\u2019s words pierced me and I physically flinched and while I believe I didn\u2019t make a sound, both Lydia and Cleven both stared at as though I had belched out some obscenity. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cLassiter?\u201d I turned enough to block out my view of my duplicitous counselor and faced Lydia, my hands shaking. \u201cYou are the daughter of King Mernel Lassiter?\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but I thought you knew, your grace \u2013 honestly thought you knew.\u201d  The terror in her eyes communicated well the thoughts that she had lost me, and in a way she had. She was innocent of course. A prop or a dupe like me. Adornment for a future battlefield we would sit on the mound and watch the brutality from a far. But our fate was sealed.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI set Lydia free from my scrutiny and turned to my advisor, my confident, my soon to be council of war \u2013 \u201cAnd the Queen, Cleven?\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps not in front of the Queen, your grace,\u201d Cleven said.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI am not weak, sir,\u201d my Queen said, \u201cQuite the contrary, I think I know what you are about to say. It has been hinted at enough by Aftertyson, though he was too ashamed to name it.  How about you? You seem to be as bold as you are fool hardy, care to talk about my mother?\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nA laugh actually came bounding out of me as I saw Cleven both cringe and blush. His arrogance would be a barb that would make him an eternal enemy of my wife and I would have warned him but I was the one trapped and being goaded. I knew there were dank, nasty cells in my castle that would have suited his rodent nature.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry your Majesties, I meant no offense,\u201d he said with as much abasement he could muster. \u201cI just meant to report as you have requested your Majesty that the Queen of Lassiter is in repose for a season while she recovers from some undetermined malady. While the house of Lassiter is anxious for her recovery, they are pragmatic. Simple people really, they just want a King and Queen who can rule and still be a symbol of vitality to the people.\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying, Cleven?\u201d I said.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI am saying\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with my mother,\u201d Lydia said, her tone was menacing and I was surprised how quickly she closed the distance between her and Cleven. I could see that it was hard for him to hold his ground.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI remember some of what people around me were saying about her before I was sent away. But it was all lies then and it is all lies now. They have her locked up in some tower I suppose. They would dare dungeon a queen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps you had better leave Cleven,\u201d I said. I wasn\u2019t sure what Lydia wanted, but I was certain of what was to come and I did not want to hear it.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lydia said, \u201cyour knight has something to say, let him say\u2026no, make him say it. Make him say the truth and then I never want to see his face again.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYour mother aside your Majesty, and I assure you she is being attended to with the utmost kindness, the news I bring is not at all bad. In fact I believe news is wonderful in that what has been done has bestowed a great honor on you both and will be a tribute to your mother and father my Queen and to your grandfather my King.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nSir Cleven appeared unable to go on and left his pending announcement dangling before us. It was Lydia\u2019s retreat from him that softened his manner. She took the daintiest of steps to stand on the hearth, pressing in close to me. My arm naturally went around her waist. I felt more like a brother than a husband, though I had never had a sister, I knew that I would be her protector no matter what was to face us in the future.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cThe Counsel of Lassiter sends you their greetings and their congratulations,\u201d Sir Cleven said, opening a scroll. It was obviously new parchment and each end of the spindles had a carved head of a bird of prey attached to it. Cleven\u2019s hands were steady as he loosened the ties that bound the rolls in place.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, King and Queen Keravin,\u201d he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease accept the congratulations of your humble servants, the High Counsel of Lassiter on your marriage. We declare today, King and Queen Keravin of Dimbersmere that we would be honored if you would take the throne of our House and rule as King and Queen forever. Queen Lydia is the only remaining heir to the throne as her mother is retiring. In marrying a long time ally of the House of Lassiter the throne should be hers by the rights of succession. Please take courage and know that the people of Lassiter will be gladdened by the news of your return and will celebrate the news that a Lassiter remains on the throne of our glorious house.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nCleven looked up from the scroll and lifted it towards Lydia and I. \u201cIt is signed by every member of the High Council of Lassiter. It was delivered to me by messenger just a few moments before I came to see you.\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYou do know what this means, my King?\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI think I do,\u201d I said. \u201dThank you for delivering the news so quickly. Odd, don\u2019t you think?  That the House of Lassiter could conjure up such a proclamation and send it over one eighty miles so quickly?\u201d <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n \u201cNews does travel fast. I suppose they had some foreknowledge of this blissful union. And maybe they drafted the proclamation before your wedding. But just the same, it  is good news and the people of Dimbersmere will at last have a protector that does not ransack their goods and consume all their food and drink.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWell they have certainly given me something to consider on my honeymoon with my Queen,\u201d I said, waving my hand at my ex-counselor. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI am sure that the High Counsel of Lassiter is anxious to hear your answer your Majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m certain they are. And I am certain that you told them that they could expect a swift response with the King of Dimbersmere in full compliance with their wishes.\u201d My grip on Lydia\u2019s waist grew tighter as my furry began rising up into every muscle in my body. I would have gladly summoned an archer to pin Cleven\u2019s treacherous heart to the door post, but no page was in hearing of my voice. Pitty.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think of your poor pitiful subjects my Queen? Have we been the ones to have disappointed you? Have I at last disappointed you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nI felt her hand gently caress mine as she eased away from my embrace. I sensed her strength rising as though she were the eagle taking to the wind. The long dark tresses of hair bounced as her strongest hand gripped the hilt of the sword just above her head. She swung it to the front of her and she directed the tip in Cleven\u2019s direction.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cOn you knees, messenger!\u201d she said. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nCleven clung to something wolflike that came out some primal instincts until he probably realized there was no one around him to back him up. At least that\u2019s what I surmised from the wild look of panic that flashed across his face. He looked at me for some direction. Unfortunately for Cleven my fury had quickly turned to amusement as though I were watching a cat corner its prey.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d the old knight stammered. Again hoping for some direction from me.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d take a knee, Cleven. If I were you I\u2019d get on both knees and pray for mercy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nHe did as I directed as Lydia glided across the room, the point of her sword now aimed steadily at Claven\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nAs she began to speak her voice thrilled my ears with that sensous contralto tone that I had learned only seems to come when she is deeply wounded or anxious. She let the tip of the sword rest on the saggy skin under Cleven\u2019s chin for a moment.  <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI want you,\u201d said Lydia, \u201cto give this message to those nasty toads of Lassiter. I want my mother here now. And she had better be unharmed. I know she has to come by carriage or barge, but as fast as that proclamation was contrived and sent I expect my mother to be just as quickly released and on her way. Let them know that tomorrow will be soon enough.\u201d  Lydia looked back at me.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWhen she has had a day to rest and recuperate here, then we\u2019ll send out a messenger,\u201d I said. \u201cOnly then, will we send a messenger to the house of Lassiter with our answer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1644 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why we go and watch these dreadful sights, I know not. We are told if we are not there, there will be five years of hardship for our family - so we are there under duress. I do not want my children seeing such atrocities. I have brought them up to be kind to their fellow man. It's a sorry reality that our royalty do not share the same morals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The palace courtyard was heaving with fellow, scared souls. Other families here to see their King murdered. I believe it is murder. The battle over who should reign over us continues like a flowing river - there are dams, there are times of flood and drought, yet somehow it never ends. They do not care the lengths they go to. If they gain blood on their hands on their way to the throne, it seems to heighten their power. I would much rather live my simple life away from it all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   We live by their dictate whoever leads us. It makes no impact. The new King will still demand high taxes from his people. He will still demand percentages of our crops - and still demand our first born son travels to the palace to become a guard of the King. It is their power over us, and we feel it squeezing our necks every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Our first born son has to leave for the palace, the new royal family, and the new King, at first light. As the sun rises, his mother, my treasured wife, will have tears in her eyes as he leaves to be a soldier-guard. He will risk his life from the moment he steps out of our village. Objectors of the King lie in wait. They know that hundreds of young men from across this valley will soon be their enemies. If they can murder our sons before they reach the palace -they will be one step nearer to killing the new King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   We are not celebrating the new King. We are not mourning the old King. We cannot let these views be known All my wife and I are concerned with is - the loss of our son. We know he will not return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 390 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

I walked out to the palace garden to get some fresh air and clear my head. To kill or not to kill? That was the question, but I found myself doing much more pouting than thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI never really wanted to be king. I mean, yes, the thought of wearing a crown and fancy robes and being able to tell everyone what to do would make any man drool for power, but I've found the endless wealth, social rank, and glory of being king are far outweighed by the responsibility and stress that come with the job. I even plucked a grey hair from my head yesterday. It made me shudder. There was no way I was going to grow older faster for the sake of a throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the peasants? Bah! What of them? Simple, stupid minded people. More like cows than people actually. And they smelled like cows too. They didn't need a king. In fact, I don't think anyone really needs me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought back to the lunatic who tried to kill me. I found myself wishing he had succeeded. The executioner waited for my decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast decisions! I hate them so. All they do is add wrinkles to a man's forehead. Why not let someone else decide? Why not just... end it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my dagger at my side. It would be easy. Just a little plunge into my chest. It couldn't hurt that much could it? I thought long and hard about the decision. I was pretty sure I'd go to the good place beyond death if there even was one there. It would certainly be better than this crummy kingdom right? Should I kill myself and end it all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count: 302 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Sunlight streamed over the gardens before my terrified eyes and my body trembled. If I died, I would never see things like this again. There wouldn't be a second chance. No. I couldn't do it any more than I could make a decision about the man. I didn't want to die, and a promised after life... though I had been taught to believe in one, I couldn't risk everything yet. I'd been made king, and I didn't want to be one, but there must have been a reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Besides, even if I couldn't do it there was still an assassin out there. If I didn't watch my step I might meet death anyway. Hopefully in my sleep. If not, at least I could come before the gods with a clean slate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Footfalls thumped behind me and broke my morbid chain of thought. I turned, my hand still on the hilt of my dagger. I wasn't quite that ready to meet an assassin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Your Majesty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  How could I forget the endless chain of duties being king would mean? I shuddered inside. I still wished I knew why I'd been chosen, but they were expecting me to make a choice. I had to make one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Everyone is waiting for your decision, Sire,\" the nobleman told me, breathless. \"You must hurry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  I needed to stop myself before I pouted again. Somehow I didn't want to ruin my already unstable position, but I hadn't come to a decision other than not killing myself. I followed him back, but my steps were leaden with dread and I steeled myself against it. A fragrant scent of roses brushed through my senses as if a beckon from the wild and I glanced towards it. The man's back was to me, and the archways to my immediate left. What if I didn't want to make a choice? What if I just ran away? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But if I did, would the assassin get the crown and this mantle? Did it matter? I didn't have much time to think about it. I either ran now, or made a decision that could put me back in danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 368 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Rarely do any of my council members enter. Fearing I might ask them to read from the scrolls or write something. It seems a skill most of them lack, but are very quick to tell me they have high intellegence handed down from their ancestors who served the kings before them.<br>\r\nIn the large seat behind a heavy table, I wonder what to do next. Do I have the suspect killed or not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabinet at the far end of the room slowly slides open and a familiar figure steps into my room. \"About time Grindle. I have no idea what to do and you do not even have the respect to come to me in council.\" Standing behind the desk I lean my knuckles on the smooth top. <br>\r\nThis man who has no age glide toward me. His face is smooth where the other wisemen wear long beards seeming to vie each other with the ornate weaving and decorations. As he nears the other side of the table I feel his power and stand erect, tense with expectations of what he will tell me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have fools for council, I don't know why you don't feed them to the lions.\" Grindle moved to the sideboard and poured a glass of my favorite drink. One he invented. He swirled it in him mouth making his cheeks pulse in and out before swallowing, He held up the cruet and the glass, \"Very good batch if I do say so. Who would have thought a drink made from a root could taste like a beer with no side effects.\" He held up the glass examining the dark liquid, \"Aha it will be called Rootbeer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir! I don't have time for this nonsense! I have a life and death situation. There has been an attempt on my life. The culprit is now in my custidy. I need to know what to do with him. If I kill him in public it will solidify that someone out there wants me dead. If I let him go he will just gather more followers and return. If I kill the father in secret, then offer my hand in condolences to the son, I gain his trust and defuse the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why call me? It sounds af if you have made the decision already?\" The older man continued to eat from the repast provided on the sideboard. Valar shook his head at his friend. the dirty vest had pockets that seemed bottomless. The amount of food Grindle stuffed in them could feed an army. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't call you. You kust showed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did even if you didn't speak the words.\" The response now muffled around the bread and meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValar paced the area behind Grindle. \"What do I do? I don't want to kill the man. I'm not really the king. What if someone finds out and kills me in retribution?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What other options do you have?\" The question did not convey there were no options, rather to begin to assume there may be. \"Where might you send him so he wouldn't return yet not be dead at your hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValar rubbed his chin and pulled on the ring inserted in his earlobe. \"Ouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot I had to get my ear pierced. It hurts. My servant keeps dousing it with some painful liquid that burns worse than the act itself. Grindle will it disappear when all this is over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Back to your problem. We are not far from the coast, though you will need some reason to pass this man through Randall's port. We could cut off his tongue so he can't speak and put him on a merchant ship to work his way across to another country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if he jumps ship and returns?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, there is that. I will put a spell on him that will remove all memory of this place and time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will you do that?\" Leave it to me.  I will take care of it. When the deed is done, you will go to his son and offer your support as long as he is with you not against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days later there is an escape from the dungeon and the next day a servan finds the man's cloak ripped apart with meat inside chewed. Its brought before the King who proclaims the man dead and calls for his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValar meets the man on the steps of the palace in front of his people. \"I have forgiven this man's father for his attempt to kill me. His father is dead. Killed as he escaped the palace jail and attacked by some animal.  His son has proclaimed his alligence to me.\"  From the crowd a roar is heard. Valar holds up his hand for silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are a peaceful kingdom. We will work to bring peace to all who live here.\" One of the guards rushed forward knocking Valar to the ground as an arrow zings past the very place he stood. There is chaos while the court soldiers rush into the crowd to find the culprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValar is shaken but gets to his feet looking to for an enemy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Valar.\" The son of the man who tried to kill him stepped foreward, \"You are greatly mistaken if you think you can smooth over your past. That is just a warning. Rokin was not my father. He was my brother.\" With that he turned on his toes and sprinted to the wall and flung himslef over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValar didn't bother to see what happened to him. His eyes narrowed at the noisey crowd. He whirlled and entered the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 991 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Every self-preserving thought screams at me to shrug of the mantle I have been bestowed and run until I have left the Kingdom.

Too many sharp edges and even sharper eyes in mill about.  Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man beside me stands well over two heads taller than my six feet of height.  He wears the clock of the King's Guard.  I recognize him as the Captain, but his name eludes me.  I stare at him like a lost child in the Stagmar Swamps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must insist we move or I will be forced to lift you upon my shoulder in an undignified manner.\"  His voice is soft but urgent in my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--- can't seem---\" The thought of being hauled from this room like baggage has an appeal to me.  I would be given a moment to  let this all sink in.  I am King.  Ludicrous.  Preposterous.  The King has died and I have been named the new King.  This must be a dream.  No, a nightmare.  The King was assassinated by an unknown person... or persons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg you! Come with me now!\"  The King's Guard Captain's grip tightens on my elbow and his voice is truly the tone of a desperate beggar.  \"Don't make your first moments as King be such a display of -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let the unspoken word hang.  I struggle to fill in the blank.  A display of panic?  Of wishy washy worm-like worry?  Of unworthy behavior?  Of cowardice?  I stare into the Captain's eyes.  I need the strength and resolve dancing behind his stern gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead on...  What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain shoves me forward and whispers, \"Nigel.  Sir Nigel Gray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stumble forward a few steps then slowly steady my gait as we cut through the onlookers.  I see no faces.  I hear only Sir Gray's breathing in my ear.  A thought slams into my brain as we approach a chamber door.  It stiffens my legs while turning them to jelly.  I collapse to the floor.  The room spins.  I am lifted and dragged from the room.  The thought blackens my vision and I drift away wondering if Sir Nigel Gray could be the assassin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords:430 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I feel calm and breathe in the night smells as all of the forest creatures prepare for rest.  I cannot remember a time of when I felt so at ease and so comfortable.  The ground beneath my body hugs me in a gentle embrace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stare at the sky.  Purples, blues and reds streak across the sky like a child's haphazard painting.  I hear footfalls of some sort moving through the forest.  I attempt to rise, but I am unable.  The ground - the oh so comfortable ground- refuses to release its hold on me.  I struggle.  More footfalls are heard. And growling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize a cloak is about my shoulders and around my neck.  The cloak holds me to the ground.  It pulls me to the earth.  The more I struggle the tighter it wraps around my throat.  A wolf howls.  Many other answer in kind.  I feel the warmth of my urine soaking my garments - soaking the cloak.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel the wolves breath on my skin, but they remain unseen.  I scream.  The cloak pulls tighter choking off my cries.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy urine soaks into the earth, becoming a part of the land.  The dirt soaks into my flesh, becoming a part of me.  The wolves, unseen, circle about me snapping and nipping at my exposed flesh.  My breath is almost gone.  I am losing myself to the land, to the cloak, and to the fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am King,\" I rasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only while you live,\"  The wind whispers.  \"Kings become ash and dust as easily as peasants - especially unworthy Kings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears flow, dripping in the earth.  \"I am worthy?\" I cry to the trees and the sky, looking for affirmation.  \"Do not take over my body, dear earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A true King must be bound to the earth - to land he rules - to truly be worthy of the crown,\"  the crickets sing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes snap open.

You mustn\u2019t fret so much, as I was saying, or you\u2019re going to die, my King.\u201d  The darkness hides his face but I swear I can sense a smile behind his words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill of absolute fear circles my spine causing screams to form in my lungs.  I clamp my mouth down with my hand.  I must not make a fool of myself.  This mysterious man could be exactly who he says he is, and I have no real reason, other than the madness of being named King and a potential assassin running about the castle.  I am King.  I cannot believe it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure beside silent stares as I try to compose myself.  \u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shifts closer to me.  \u201cMy name is Jonathon Verch.  I am a King\u2019s Guard.\u201d  His hand grips my shoulder. \u201cBe calm, sire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh like a kettle on my mother\u2019s stove seeps between my lips.  I let myself relax.  \u201cI cannot believe all that has happened today,\u201d I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand tightens on my arm. \u201cYes, it was shocking to learn that one of the lesser nobles was named over more legitimate claims.  Have you any idea why the King named you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrug away from the iron grip on my shoulder but the hand remains clasped like a bird of prey on a rodent\u2019s broken neck.  I shake my head at his question, but realize he probably cannot see me in this dimly lit room. \u201cI have no idea.  It was as much as a surprise to me as anyone.  Have they located the King\u2019s assassin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurely there must be some reason for the King to name one such as yourself as his successor.  Were you and the King confidants in secret?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panic in my chest blossoms again.  I notice he ignored my question.  The insulting nature of his words should anger me but fear is my only response.  I have never been a brave man.  My mother always said I would do best finding a strong-willed woman to bolster my passive nature.  My mother always said passive.  I always heard coward.  Cutting through the fear is a longing for my mother to know that her only son has been named King.  The very thought makes a tiny chuckle roll through my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I say something amusing, sire?\u201d Sir Jonothon growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I was just thinking of -\u201d  I stop myself.  I am King.  I do not need to explain myself to a mere guard.  As a mere noble, I would never have tolerate such insolence from a servant, so as King I surely do not need to take this from a guard. \u201cI am tired.  I wish to rest.  Please leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard makes no attempt to move.   His hand remains locked upon my shoulder.  His entire body tenses and  I can feel his eyes on me, burning into me with malice.  I suddenly have no doubt that this man means to harm me.  \u201cYou are no King.  You do not deserve to be King.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Nigel!\u201d  I cry out to my Captain sleeping in the chair. \u201cHelp me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Jonathon turns toward the still figure in the chair again.  This time he chuckles before turning back to me.  \u201cSir Nigel will not be helping you, Keravin.  He died quietly and unspectacularly as he lower you into the bed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knife point touches my chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was so determined to protect his new King that he forgot to check his back as he entered the room carrying your useless body.  Why were you named King?  I must know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears well up in my eyes.  My thoughts go to my mother.  I remember as a boy he used to call me a Prince.  It was a term of endearment, or so I thought at the time.  I never knew my father and my mother was a beautiful woman.  Was it possible the King and my mother\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the thought that I died with.  The assassin swiped across my thought and I could feel the warm blood pooling beneath my neck and head.  The last words I heard were  \u201cYou were never to be King.  Whatever reason the King had for naming you does not  matter. He may as well have cut your throat himself.  I want you to know that\u2026\u201d  The words faded and a lightness came over me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed out loud as I thought of my reign as King being a footnote in history.  My only significance will be the shortness of my time on the throne.  What throne?  I never had the chance to even sit my ass in my new throne.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around blurs and swirls.  I am swimming in air and feeling truly free of all worry and fear.  I am never to be King - he said, but I was - I am King.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mother is at my side, holding my hand, and behind him stands the King.  I know instantly that he is my father.  He gazes at me with eyes that speak of sadness and pride, and also anger.  He pulls me in close and pats my back.  My mother kisses my cheek and tells me how proud she is.  I am happy.  I never wanted to be King but I am glad I had the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King looks into my eyes with a steely expression.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t over my son.  No.  We have the means and the cause to carry on.  You shall be King.  You shall be avenged .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 975 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

He lay back down as he realized he had had another King Tyrl dream.  These dreams had haunted him for as long as he could remember. The waking from them were always difficult and had to convince himself that he was just plain old Jack - A skinny fifteen year old boy who was a guard in the small town of Col Ti\u2019er..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived in Col Ti\u2019er when he was eight with little recollection of his past other than a horrific fire and his repeating, as real as life dreams of being King Tyrl Kevian.  I am Jack.  I live in a small room above the Black Dragon Inn.  The owner is Taylor, a kind, lovely woman who allowed me to live here in exchange for simple chores.  He was not a nobleman named King of the realm.  He was a guard who had been looked after since he was a boy by another guard, Aric, until Jack was old enough to become a guard himself.  He was not a King and assassins didn\u2019t seek to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother of those dreams, eh? I can always tell by that faraway look in your eyes.\u201d Aric said and slapped Jack gently on the cheek.  \u2018Time to wake my King and take up your duty as a mere guard.\u201d  . Aric was a very large man with short, black hair. \u201cGet your arse out of bed and into your gear, boy.  You\u2019re with Jasper today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack flung himself form the bed and donned his leather armor, his dagger and his bow and quiver. \u201cLater, Aric.\u201d Jack said with a wave as he went in search of his fellow guardsmen.  He found Jasper in the common room of the Black Drogon Inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper greeted him with a wave and a nod. \u201cWe are on the east gate today.  You ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Jasper walked side by side through the small town.  As he walked, Jack noticed a group of men dressed in heavy armor and dangerous weapons.  They looked dangerous and out of place in Col Ti\u2019er.  \u201cWho are they?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Hunters,\u201d Jasper stated, avoiding eye contact with the group of men. \u201cBest leave them be.  They are a vile lot and I\u2019ll be glad when they have moved on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunters?  What do they hunt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t hunters.  They are The Hunters.  They hunt whatever or whoever they are paid to hunt.  They are murderers and cloaked in a mystery of origin and purpose.  No one knows much about them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dream came back to him - the fear of the assassin.  \u201cThey sound like assassins or mercenaries to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever you mind, Jack.  Stay clear of their lot until they have moved on.\u201d  Jasper gently shoved Jack up the road toward their post at the East gate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard shift was uneventful and Jack spent much of the time practicing his archery skills.  The remnants of his dream as King had faded by the time Jasper and Jack were returning to the guardhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am starved and can\u2019r wait-\u201d Jack stumbled forward as a man collided with him and ran down the street.  \u201cHey!   That was Milburn, the butcher.  What is his problem?\u201d Jack turned and looked where the man had come from.  Voices could be heard from an alleyway.  \u201cCome on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper protested but Jack ignored him and entered the alley.  One of the men Jasper had called The Hunters jabbed a blade into a man, who Jack didn\u2019t recognize.  The Hunter smiled as he placed his boot of the man\u2019s chest and shoved the injured man free from the blade.  The man collapsed, blood gushing from his wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Jack demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand gripped his shoulder. Jasper whispered, \u201cLeave it alone, Jack.  This is The Hunter\u2019s business.  Let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack watched the life leave the injured man\u2019s eyes as blood pool around his body.  Jack tensed and put his hand on his dagger.  \u201cYou murdered that man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper grabbed Jack\u2019s wrist.  He gripped it so tightly pain shot up his arm. \u201cListen, boy.  Look around you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack did as instructed.  Five other Hunters were moving up from the other end of the alley toward them, and the one who had gutted the unknown man had turned to face Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper stepped in front of Jack. \u201cWe didn\u2019t nothing.  Leave us be and we saw nothing.  Let\u2019s go Jack.  Now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared at the dead eyes.  \u201cNo,\u201d he whispered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and now!\u201d Jasper shoved and the grabbed and dragged Jack from the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack offered little resistance.  The sheer number and menacing nature of The Hunters told Jack to follow Jasper.  \u201cWe are not going to arrest them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper grabbed Jack\u2019s shoulders and faced him directly.  \u201cThese Hunters are bad news.  They\u2019ll kill us all and I\u2019m not going to incite that kind of situation.  The Hunters will dispose of the body.  Stay clear of them, Jack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded and walked back to the inn, wondering just who these Hunters were and what sort of power they wielded over the town of Col Ti\u2019er. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC:862 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack slept fitfully that night.  The image of the slain man invaded his dreams, waking with a sinking guilt-filled pain in his gut.  These Hunters were a nasty sort and Jack felt he should have done something more for the dead man.  Sleep evaded Jack for the remainder of the night until finally he gave up all hope of rest and dressed for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack wandered down to the public room of the Black Dragon Inn and tossed a log on the glowing embers in the hearth.   The view from the street-facing window showed the night had brought a light fog with it.  Jack hoped it also brought some cooler weather.  He fetched a kettle from the kitchen and exited the rear door of the inn.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe water well was situated next to the Inn\u2019s stable.  Jack could hear the horses restlessly scuffing and shuffling, in particular, Graywash nickered and snorted nervously.  Graywash was a beautiful Friesian who had arrived at the rear of the inn one morning and refused to leave.  Taylor, the innkeeper, had asked around Col Ti'er and some of farmers in the outlying area but none could claim him as their horse, though some certainly tried.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNardst, the stable manager and Taylor\u2019s brother in law, adopted the magnificent animal.  Many fights and arguments can be attributed to the ownership status of Graywash.  Taylor wanted to sell him at the market but Nardst had said you don\u2019t sell a fine gem at a brothel. Graywash, Nardst claimed, was the most intelligent, fierce and powerful horse he had ever encountered. He once, in a heated exchange with Taylor, claimed Graywash had the ancient soul of a noble knight and to sell such an animal would make them no better than the cursed slave-traders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe horse\u2019s whines seemed out of character so Jack passed the well and eased next to the closed stable doors.  He had instinctively adopted a cat-like stealth, holding the kettle away from his body, and peered between the wooden slats that formed the stable walls.  Graywash was in the back stall shifting from leg to leg and fluttered his ears.  Jack\u2019s hand was reaching for the door latch when he heard the man\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we waiting on?  That is the beast.  Slice its throat and be done with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJack\u2019s hand froze and he slowly lowered the kettle to the ground.  He slid away from the door and around the corner of the stable, stopping at a wooden cask.  He listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cConfirmation is required.\u201d It was a different man\u2019s voice. \u201cThe initial dat-patch indicated capture was the preferred recourse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA gruff huff sounded followed by a sound so strange to Jack his body jerked.  It sounded almost like a bird chirp but was definitely not any bird that lived in these forests.  Jack glided onto the cask then slid onto the stable\u2019s roof, his movements fluid and absolutely soundless. He moved across the top support beam and noiselessly dropped to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBelow him Jack could make out three large men, obviously Hunters \u2013 the same Hunters he had encountered earlier.  One of them had odd, tiny flames of red, green and yellow in his right hand, at least he thought they were flames, but they never flickered nor gave off smoke. The mystery bird chirped again and the colorful flames extinguished themselves with no indication of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOrder confirmed.  Capture is the preferred recourse.  Let\u2019s remove the horse in the native fashion until clear of inhabitants.  Hunter Onyx, grab a bridle and lead for the beast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraywash neighed loudly and kicked the wall of the stable.  Bridles, brushes and tools clattered to the floor.  Jack watched from above as the horse reared up and smashed the weak stall door to bits of wood. The black, massive horse charged into the main aisle of the stable and bowled over all three Hunters.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJack leapt to his feet and dropped to a crouch.  He really wasn\u2019t sure what he should do.  He had no weapons and begrudgingly admitted to himself he was slightly terrified of both Hunters and horse.  Jack decided getting off the roof was his best choice when a loud crack of a splitting timber erupted into the night.  The support beam he was standing on listed toward the front of the stable.  The Hunters cursed.  Graywash whinnied furiously. Jack\u2019s surefootedness failed him for only an instant as the support beam jerked from beneath his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheap lumber of the stable roof gave way to even Jack\u2019s thin form.  Jack\u2019s hands snatched a rope hanging from the dangling remains of the stable\u2019s vertical support beam.  He felt the slack in the rope tighten and wrapped his legs around the swaying beam to prevent the rope from jerking clean from his hands.  Jack hugged the hanging, broken timber and looked down in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Hunter\u2019s head was a pulverized mess where it had shattered apart the bottom half of the beam Jack was desperately clutching.  The second Hunter was scrambling across the floor feeling around piles of hay for what could only be a weapon.  The last Hunter had a dirk in hand and was cautiously eyeing Graywash.  The calm in the Hunter\u2019s eyes was unnerving.  Graywash kicked wildly tearing the stable apart.  Jack couldn\u2019t tell if the horse was trying to escape, attack or panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though in answer to Jack\u2019s confusion, Graywash exploded into the stable doors.  The force of the impact rocked the entire stable and Jack\u2019s perch swayed and snapped loose from the cross beam.  Jack and perch plummeted to the floor. His skill for being agile was well known in Col Ti'er, but it truly was a shame no one but the Hunters and horse were witness to Jack\u2019s graceful landing.  His slender, lithe form slid the beam beneath his feet, and the moment the wood struck the floor Jack leapt into the air, tucked into a flip and landed like a cat on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dirk wielding Hunter turned to his partner, who had recovered a whip from the stable floor, and pointed at Jack.  \u201cKill him.  I will get the beast.\u201d  He dashed after the horse through the shattered door.  Less than five seconds later, the Hunter was hurled back into the barn and an angry horse roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crack of a whip startled Jack.  The whip-toting Hunter was smiling.  Jack pushed himself upward to get to his feet.  But when he pushed off the stable floor, Jack was lifted completely from the ground and was then whipping in a half circle and literally flying through the now destroyed stable door.  The ground was rushing past him as he flew through the night with the back of his belt securely clamped between the powerful jaws of Graywash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 1,141 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cobblestone roads blurred into dirt pathways as Jack swayed helplessly to the rhythm of Graywash\u2019s gait.  The hot breath of the black horse produced an uncomfortable, wetness on the small of Jack\u2019s back.  The Col Ti'er guards at the east facing gate remained motionless and stunned when the spectacle of a horse carrying a man in his mouth burst through the open gateway and disappeared into the darkness. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\tGraywash\u2019s pace never slowed as they entered the prairies. Jack could only watch as the grassland\u2019s many shades of green with an occasion speck of color raced past him. Discomfort was settling into his hips and the blurring landscape was unsettling his stomach.  He closed his eyes, concentrating only on the wind roaring through his ear.  The sway of the ride and the constant drone of the passing air suddenly lulled Jack into a dullness then sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA wispy smoke invaded the darkness of Jack\u2019s slumber and fine tendrils of gray fog weaved around him.  Vague shapes and flickering tongues of orange and red formed within the haze while people-shaped movements faded in and out of the surrounding blackness. With shocking suddenness, his father slid through the murkiness and burst before him in stark clarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe was a thin man with a long, worn face and short brown hair.  His green eyes narrowed with worry and concern.\t\u201cJack, get up, now!\u201d  The words were said rapidly, almost blending into one another. Thin hands pulled him from under the bed sheets.  \u201cGo to your sister\u2019s room.  She\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDad? What\u2019s happening?\u201d  Over his father\u2019s shoulder in the clouded background Jack could see the living quarters of his childhood home.  The familiar sight filled him with happiness, sadness and longing all at once, each fighting for dominance. He looked down at his six-foot tall, fifteen year old body as his father shoved him toward the door of what he supposed was his sister\u2019s room.  Jack turned to his frantic father who stood at least four or five feet taller than him.  How could this be?  He could remember little of his father but he knew he was no giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGo now, son.  I\u2019ll explain everything later.  You and your sister need to get away from here.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy sister? Smoke erupted from the darkness and his father blended into the fog until he vanished completely.  Flames crawled up the walls of the living quarters.  His mother shrieked from somewhere beyond the reaching fingers of the haze.  He glanced over his shoulder toward the door that was supposedly his sister\u2019s room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe smoke vanished instantly. A gruff frightening voice, shouting indistinguishable words, could be heard from somewhere beyond the room he now mysteriously found himself standing.  A girl, maybe twelve or thirteen, looked down at him.  My sister! He knew instantly. Memories of her delicate hands bathing him, of their laughter blending into a joyful sound as her fingers tickled him, of her annoyance at Jack stealing candy from her special hiding place, and a hundred other images of their brief shared life flooded into his mind. Her name was Teresa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe have to go, Jacky. We will meet mom and dad later in a small village named Col Ti'er.\u201d  She smiled for his benefit alone, the true terror showing in her violet eyes.  Her hands, so soft and warm, lifted him to her window and sat him on the sill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe door to Teresa\u2019s room split into two, flames erupting through the jagged opening. A large silhouetted figure with a huge war axe in one hand and a short sword in the other slid between the two halves.  Teresa moved instantly in front of the looming figure, shielding Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThen the ground seemed to rise up and smash Jack in the face. He opened his eyes to clumps of prairie grass and could feel prairie dirt on his lips. \u201cI have a sister,\u201d Jack whispered as he ran one hand through the thick prairie grass and wiped his lips with the other. He rolled onto his back and stared up at the huge, black horse staring back.  He scurried backward moving away from the massive beast. Graywash charged slightly forward, snorting, then abruptly turned away, whipping the boy\u2019s face with his long black tail.  The horse nickered and trotted away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe sun peeked over the horizon revealing the seemingly endless prairie in all directions.  Jack stood, brushing off dirt and grass, and stretching to ease the cramping in his hips.  Graywash neighed and snorted loudly moving his head up and down in the direction opposite of the sunrise. Jack felt suddenly naked without any weapons as he watched the expanding sunlight reveal the spectacular waves of grass, the colorful spattering of wildflowers and four figures riding hard out of the west toward him and his menacing four-legged companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 805 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThe sunlight spread like a gleaming blanket across the plains.  Jack and Graywash watched the approaching riders and tried to determine if they were friend or foe.  In his gut, Jack feared the riders were more Hunters seeking to cut short the lives of the brash horse and the inadvertent witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe searched about the plains looking for a viable weapon but only found dirt, flowers and grass.  His eyes drifted to the massive black horse and the horse\u2019s eye glared back at him.  If he could ride the fearsome beast, he would be able flee from the pursuers, but would the horse allow it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared at the approaching riders again, trying to determine their identities, and then slowly stepped toward Graywash.  The horse snorted.  Jack quickly stepped away from Graywash. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cCome on, horse! We\u2019re going die!\u201d Jack said, stomping his feet in the grass. Graywash stomped his hooves in response along with a high pitched neigh. Jack\u2019s jaw clenched tight and his eyes narrowed at the horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may be afraid of you, Graywash, but you can\u2019t scare me! I am going to ride you!\u201d  Jack walked to the horse, placed his hands in the thick mane and pulled himself toward the horse.  Graywash stepped sideways and Jack crashed to the ground.  The horse kicked up patches of grass with his hind legs and patches of dirt and grass showered Jack.<br>\r\nJack punched the ground and bolted to his feet. A deep growl emitted from Jack\u2019s throat as he leapt for the backside of the horse with intentions of using his hands to push himself forward onto Graywash\u2019s back.  The horse\u2019s rear end bucked just as Jack pushed off and the young man sailed over the horse\u2019s head.  He landed in a heap amid a patch of dirt and wildflowers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face red and his eyes wild, Jack huffed and rolled onto his feet.  He ran head-on at Graywash, his hands balling into fist. He drew his arm back and aimed for the horse\u2019s nose.  Graywash\u2019s massive head swiveled to one side, missing the blow, and then slammed the side of his head into the side of Jack\u2019s head. The boy rolled head over feet away from the horse, jumped back to his feet for only a moment before collapsing on his backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate you, Graywash.\u201d  Jack grabbed a handful of dirt and slung it at the horse. \u201cLet me ride you or we are going to die!  Do you not see the riders?\u201d He pointed and glanced at four riders sitting on their mounts staring at Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you fighting with a horse, Jack?\u201d Aric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think they are having a mud clot fight,\u201d Taylor said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I think the horse is winning!\u201d Jasper added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNardst dismounted his horse and walked toward Graywash. \u201cWhat in the good graces of Elving Gorge are you doing out here, Jacky?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared at his friends.  He could feel tears forming as relief flooded through him. \u201cBy the stars!  I am so glad to see you all!  I was getting- \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAric interrupted, \u201cJack, we need to move, now. Can you ride your horse?\u201d  He looked over his shoulder, back toward Col Ti'er.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words came out before Jack could even think of stopping them. \u201cNo! I cannot ride that infernal beast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper smiled at Jack and pointed with his thumb toward their home. \u201cWhy in the gods\u2019 names not, Jack?  You rode him out here.  You see that cloud?  That smoke back there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stood and looked.  At least ten riders moved across the plains, and behind them, where Col Ti'er should be, rose billowing columns of smoke that became more and more visible as the sun left the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunters?\u201d Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Taylor answered.  \u201cWe, four, only escaped because we all came looking for you at the same time. We\u2026 I thought you were dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacky,\u201d Nardst called, \u201cride my mount. Come on, lad.\u201d  Nardst had mounted Graywash and was turning the beast away from the approaching riders and his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack glared hatefully at Graywash and then mounted Nardst\u2019s gray spotted Appaloosa named Wildy. Nardst and Graywash lead the way across the plains while the Hunters pursued and Col Ti\u2019er burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack rode silently next to Aric.  He wondered, even though his day was just beginning, if this day would ever end.  An attack by Hunters, memories of a forgotten sister, and now flight from his burning home were quite enough events for one week much less one morning. He glanced back at the pursuers and became suddenly aware of his lack of leather armor and weapons.  The Hunters were slowly closing the distance.  It was only a matter of time before they would reach weapons range and that would prove deadly for himself and his band of friends, especially on the wide open plains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to- \u201d Jack shouted at Aric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.  We can\u2019t outrun them. I think we need to split up,\u201d Aric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and the others agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is an abandoned winery about twenty-five miles to the east-south-east,\u201d Aric explained as they rode. \u201cIt is called the Screeching Bean.  Once you shake your pursuers we will meet up there.  I\u2019m going to head east.  Jasper and Taylor head north.  Jack and Nardst head south.  Good luck, my friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJasper and Taylor shot off to the north, Arik continued east while Nardst and Jack turned south.  This was the moment that counted.  The hope was the Hunters would divide their forces but there was no guarantee this would be the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack peered over his shoulder, urging Wildy to ride harder, faster.  The group of Hunters continued to follow Aric.  Death was certain for Aric if all the Hunters stayed on him.  Jack started concocting a plan to force some of the Hunters to break off when three of them broke from the main group and turned north.  Moments later four more broke and headed directly for Jack and Nardst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacky, about three miles from here the plains slope drastically into the Rujel Marshes.  It is there we can decide to make a stand or look for a hiding spot.\u201d  Nardst was gently urging Graywash to slow down slightly to avoid Jack and Wildy from falling too far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve no weapons, Nard!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve only a dagger, so it looks like we will be running to ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next three miles they rode hard and silently.  The horses\u2019 breathing, the rushing wind and their pounding hearts filled their ears as the Hunters slowly closed the gap.  The landscape changed slowly, giving rise to mushrooms and softer ground.  The grass was less green and the wildflowers less beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slope Nardst had mentioned was more like a jagged series of small cliffs.  The horses never slowed as they leapt from each cliff and landed in increasingly mucky ground.  When they reached the last cliff they leapt into waist high brackish water.  Nardst and Jack urged the horses to continue deeper into the Rujel Marsh.  Jack looked back as they began their trek across the marsh; the Hunters were just reaching the uppermost cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will keep moving to the center of the marsh where the trees get thicker.  I\u2019m hoping we can lose them in there,\u201d Nardst said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack watched as the Hunter\u2019s progress was slowed by the small cliffs and the soft earth. A gap had formed between Nardst and Jack as the soft bottom seemed to have no effect on the progress of the powerful Graywash. Wildy struggled and fought against the mud sucking at her hooves. A small current formed in the marsh water and Jack turned Wildy into it to increase their speed. The current gained strength and the water deepened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNardst shouted at Jack but the sound of the current drowned out his words. Graywash and Nardst turned and started moving toward Jack.  The current had transformed into rapids as Graywash closed the distance between them.<br>\r\n\u201cJack, get out of the current!\u201d Nardst shouted over the rushing water. \u201cThey lead to underground caverns-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The ground beneath Jack and Wildy vanished.  Horse and boy fell with water cascading all around them and the sunlight quickly vanishing.  Jack looked desperately for anything to grab to stop his descent.  Above him, an eight foot circular hole of sunlight with water pouring over the edges seemed to be getting smaller.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ice cold wall of water hit Jack so suddenly he lost all sense of space and place.  The watery pool chilled him to the bone.  The weight of the falling horse drove Jack further beneath the water.  Panic seized Jack as he realized his feet were still in the stirrups. As he attempted to free his feet, the heavy, unmoving horse pinned his leg against the underwater cavern floor.  Jack gazed at a small, shimmering circle of sunlight far above him.  Coldness stabbed his muscles and a sudden weariness stole over his entire body. He pushed against the horse but his strength was gone.  Pinpricks of light danced around the edge of his vision and Jack just wanted to sleep. Jack couldn\u2019t remember where he was and what he was supposed to be doing.  The freezing water lulled him into a deadly peaceful sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 1,548 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His legs were free now and the stabbing cold had vanished, leaving only the comforting warmth radiating from the light. He swam to the light pushing and pulling his body through water. <br>\r\n\tCRACK! Cold pierced his flesh like a million needles and there was no air.  The light had become a faraway glow which offered no warmth and did not beckon.  He struggled to move but a heavy object prevented him.<br>\r\n\tCRACK! Air flooded into his lungs and warmth blanketed him soothingly.  The welcoming light had returned and Jack glided toward it. Shadows moved beyond the light.  Jack increased his efforts to reach it, kicking his legs and pulling with his arms.<br>\r\n\tCRACK! Frigid waters swallowed him again, shooting pain and bringing overwhelming exhaustion. Jack fumbled with the heavy object briefly and screamed.<br>\r\n\tCRACK! His fingertips touched the light, spreading heat up his arm. Jack threw himself at the light and splashed onto a cold, hard surface.<br>\r\n\t\u201cHoly shit! Someone came through.\u201d The voice boomed and echoed.  Jack was blind, all he could see was whiteness.  The voice was male.<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh my lord, it worked! It worked! Who is he? Where in the hell is his realm key?\u201d  This voice was female.<br>\r\n\tJack scrambled around on the floor unable to speak or stand.  His body would not obey his commands.  <br>\r\n\tA new, deep, commanding voice echoed in Jack\u2019s ears. \u201cThere is no key! My god, it is keyless crossing! It is unstable, he\u2019s fading already! He looks like he is from the Carmek Realm.\u201d  Hands grabbed his shoulders as a faceless shadow appeared before him. \u201cListen man, tell Gregson that the Hunters are realm jumping freely now.  Tell him Overton spoke to you and I said he has to-\u201d\t<br>\r\nCRACK! Hands yanked Jack\u2019s tunic. A cold breeze slapped his skin and delicious air rushed down his throat only to be met by a stream of water shooting up his throat.  Jack coughed and water spewed from his mouth and nose. Strong arms supported him beneath his shoulders and dragged him from the icy liquid. The sound of falling water crashed all around him.<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet, Jacky,\u201d Nardst whispered in his ear. \u201cThe Hunters are close by, and even with the roaring waterfall, let\u2019s not take any chances.\u201d <br>\r\nJack looked upward at the sunlit opening in the earth. Trickles of water ran over the corner of Jack\u2019s mouth but wonderful air was filling his lungs. \u201cTell Gregson\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cShush.\u201d Nardst dragged Jack across damp rocks into the shadows away from the cavern\u2019s skylight opening and leaned him against an algae covered rock wall. <br>\r\n\tJack sat silently as his eyes adjusted to the darkness.  The cavern was roughly oval shaped with a waterfall and steep, dripping rock walls that contained dark, watery passageways.  Jack closed his eyes and slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rapid clicking interrupted Jack\u2019s sleep, and it was several seconds after waking when he realized it was the chattering of his own teeth. The coldness from the rocks beneath him numbed his backside and legs. The waterfall sprayed cold mist across the cavern chilling the skin and preventing wet clothing from drying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 526 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

She wasn\u2019t his horse of choice, but the pickings back in Col Ti\u2019er had been slim when he was forced to flee his home. A glance over his shoulder told him two Hunters had stuck with him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey had the better mounts and were closing in on him quickly.  He figured it was best to pick a place for a confrontation rather than have circumstances pick it for him. Aric scanned the landscape looking for a place to make a stand, noticing to his right were more grasslands and a large rock, straight ahead were flat grasslands and dirt and to his left was a large solitary tree. Rock or tree, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAric decided on the tree with the deciding factor being, if he died, he would rather rot beneath a tree than next to a rock.  He veered Marglee left and encouraged her to dig deep and hard. Another peek at his pursuers told him they were big, armored men with each carrying a fearsome weapon.  An axe dangled from the waist of the lead rider while the other had a war hammer strapped to his back. He spat in their direction before returning his eyes to the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked down at himself to assess his own readiness for combat.  Luck had favored him when the Hunters began laying waste to the village.  He had been getting ready for his next shift and had already dressed in his chainmail and strapped on his broadsword when he heard the first scream. He had exited the guardhouse to clouds of smoke, and at the head of the road near the east gate were flames. He could still picture the flames in his mind, unnatural in its movement and origin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Hunters had formed a line across the head of the east road and slowly walked west as they cut down anyone who opposed or presented themselves to the advancing line. Aric had made a quick count and determined there were at least fifty attackers. How had so many Hunters arrived in the town without notice? On instinct, he drew his broadsword and moved toward them, but then he saw the flames.  Some of the Hunters produced flames from their hands or from something in their hands; Aric couldn\u2019t see well enough to determine its true source.  The flames moved in a straight line from the source to wherever the Hunter pointed his arm, reminding Aric of pictures he had seen in storybooks of dragons breathing fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe flames hit buildings, people, and animals, igniting everything it touched. Aric sheathed his sword. He remembered his father, the greatest Town Guard Commander in Col Ti\u2019er history, saying that to openly confront an impossible battle limits possibilities. His instinct and desire to battle the invaders urged him to defend the town, but his duty to the people of Col Ti\u2019er and the words of his father overrode his raw impulse. Aric turned away from the Hunters to help evacuate the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe ran to the Black Dragon Inn and commanded anyone he met to flee from the city immediately. Door by door, Aric ordered people out of their rooms and out of the city. When he arrived at Jack\u2019s room, Taylor and Jasper were exiting the boy\u2019s quarters. They told Aric the boy was missing and nowhere on the premises.  Taylor explained Nardst was checking the stable for Jack and getting horses for them, and she suggested he do the same if he hoped to escape from the onslaught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear in the Innkeeper\u2019s face had been terrifying to Aric and that was when he remembered a rumor of Taylor surviving a Hunter attack before she lived in Col Ti\u2019er.  Aric, Taylor and Jasper agreed to meet at the west gate and ride out together. He rushed from the inn and to the Town Guard stable where he immediately noticed his horse, Whisk, was missing. The only horse that had remained was Marglee, so Aric saddled her and headed toward the west gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCol Ti\u2019er was an inferno when he crossed back to the main road.  Smoke and ash filled the air and burned Aric\u2019s eyes and throat.  The line of Hunters was slowly and methodically marching, burning and murdering their way through the blazing city toward the west gate. Aric wound his way to the gates, stopping at homes and businesses to help citizens escape the oncoming carnage and flames. When he arrived at the gate, Taylor, Jasper and Nardst waited on their horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack?\u201d Aric had asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears moistened Taylor\u2019s eyes as she shook her head and shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacky can take care of himself, and if not, he\u2019s already dead and there\u2019s nothing to be done. Now, unless you want to be roasted like a goat, I suggest we ride the hell away from here.\u201d Nardst said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAric, look here,\u201d Jasper called. \u201cHorse tracks heading across the plains.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI recognize that beastly hoof mark.  That is Graywash\u2019s tracks, for sure.  Let\u2019s follow it. We could make use of that horse if we can catch him,\u201d Nardst suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAric had agreed which lead to the discovery of Jack and to the current hope of reaching the tree before his pursuers reached him. As the tree came closer, Aric started to strategize his attack and his defense. He would stay close and keep his back to the tree to prevent either Hunter from getting behind him.  He noted several low branches that could block a high cut and he also mentally positioned himself on the side of the tree which put the sun to his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he closed on the tree, he glanced back once more estimating the time he had until his opponents arrived. He dismounted quickly and slapped the backside of Marglee to remove her from harm\u2019s way.  He moved into the ideal position and drew his sword.  A knot of nervousness tensed his stomach.  He swallowed hard and breathed calmly.  His feet spread shoulder wide, Aric found his center of balance and breathed another deep intake of air.  I am ready. I am focused for battle.  I am courage and I am confident. The broadsword lifted and pointed at the approaching riders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC:1062 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Hunters reined in their mounts about three yards from Aric and the tree.  It appeared he had taken them by surprise with his confrontation. They hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou care to dismount or should I cut you down while on your horse?\u201d Aric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead Hunter threw his leg over his horse and slid to the ground.  He studied Aric seriously then spoke without taking his eyes from his intended target.  \u201cStay on your mount.  I will engage him.  Once engaged, trample him with your horse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAric didn\u2019t know if he was surprised at the actual tactic or at the fact that he openly announced his intentions.  Either way, Aric never moved.  He would let the Hunter make the first strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hunter drew out his axe and walked toward Aric. \u201cYou\u2019re a big one.  We\u2019ll make this quick.\u201d In a flash of movement, the Hunter threw his axe at Aric.  It was an unexpected move but Aric side slipped past the oncoming weapon and feigned a lunge at the Hunter\u2019s midsection.  The other Hunter charged with his horse, and Aric pulled back from the feint and pivoted away from the axe-throwing Hunter and spun his body against the side of the approaching horse. The horse passed between the two combatants. As Aric came out of his spin, he jammed the edge of his blade to the horse\u2019s neck and sliced deeply into the flesh and then immediately turned his blade to an upward stroke striking the flat of his blade against the rider\u2019s chest. The horse roared and reared back slightly as the clank of blade on armor sounded into the morning air. Aric dug his boots into the ground and stopped his movement along the horse\u2019s body.  His sword pushed against the rider\u2019s chest, forcing him to the back of his horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rider fought to stay astride but the rearing of the horse and the pressure from the pushing broadsword flipped the Hunter backward off the horse. Before the rider struck the ground, Aric had thrust his sword into the belly of the rearing horse. Blood gushed to the ground and savage, raw screams erupted from the dying horse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAric stepped away from the horse and located the lead Hunter. He had retrieved his axe and had taken up a defensive posture near the tree.  The fallen Hunter rolled to his side and gained his feet. Aric noticed the fallen Hunter was off balance, possibly confused and disoriented. He knew if he didn\u2019t press his advantage now, he would have two opponents of opposite sides of him. Against better judgment and training, Aric turned his back on the lead Hunter, stepped toward the staggering Hunter and cut upward with his sword toward his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead Hunter shouted a warning, but his partner reacted too slowly and the blade cut into his throat, scraping against the bottom of his jawbone and cutting a wide, deep gash into his neck. His hands slapped at his face momentarily and then fell to his side as his body collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAric swung around instantly in a defensive stance and his sword parried the axe blow aimed for his skull.  The fighters stepped backward and studied each other. Aric was breathing heavily. The Hunter waited and glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAric wondered what he waiting for.  Why would he give me the opportunity to rest? Did he think I\u2026  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlames erupted from the spot where the fallen Hunter lay. Aric turned instinctively, bringing up his sword for defense.  The dead Hunter\u2019s entire body was engulfed in flames, although it wasn\u2019t actually flames, it was more like the body had transformed into lava and was burning itself into ash from the inside out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn axe blow slammed into Aric\u2019s ribcage. Pain seared through his side as the force of the blow knocked him toward the ground, but then something pulled him in the opposite direction. Intense pain rolled through his entire body as he was dragged in the direction of his attacker.  Pain blinded and disoriented him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me my axe, you bastard!\u201d the Hunter shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA foot pressed against his hip and pushed the lower half of his body as the top portion was pulled in the opposite direction. Excruciating pain tore at him.  Aric looked down and saw the axe lodged in his ribs and the Hunter\u2019s foot was driving into his hip as his hands yanked to free the axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Aric didn\u2019t know if it was the intervention of gods, the benefit of intense training, or the body\u2019s natural way of protecting itself that granted him a moment of clarity, but his mind cleared.  The pain ceased for only an instant, and Aric sliced deeply with his sword into groin of the Hunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pulling stopped immediately and Aric crumpled to the ground away from the Hunter, the axe still wedged in his ribs.  The Hunter cursed loudly, and he moaned, and then he repeated this pattern for a long time.  Aric rested his face in the dirt, unable to move, too painful to even speak.  He could see the writhing form of the Hunter and hear his vile curses and his pathetic moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAric felt tears roll across his cheeks. He touched the axe handle gently, but an intense pain shot from his side and stabbed him in the brain. He thought of his father and how he had hoped to follow in his footsteps to become the Town Guard Commander.  He knew death was coming for him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cursing stopped.  The moaning ceased. The Hunter\u2019s skin began to melt and then turned to lava. Aric watched the evil man disintegrate into nothing but black ash.  He wondered briefly what kind of creatures were these Hunters and where did they come from, and then he closed his eyes. <br>\r\n#<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirsty and cold, Aric was surrounded by darkness when he reopened his eyes. He thought he was dead and was saddened to know his side still hurt even in death, but something stirred behind him. He slowly and carefully dragged himself into a sitting position. The axe was still protruding from his ribs. Marglee stepped from the shadows and nuzzled his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, girl, you\u2019ll knock me over.\u201d Aric reached up and gently stroked her face.  \u201cThat\u2019s a good girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis side felt as though it were on fire, so much so that he was waiting for his own skin to become lava. Using Marglee for support Aric pulled himself to his feet as sweat rolled down his face and a sudden chill wracked his body. He needed a healer if he wanted to live.  He placed one foot in the stirrup and pulled himself up and over the horse\u2019s back. He screamed. Tears flowed from his eyes as he sobbed into the horse\u2019s mane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe guided Marglee over to the Hunter\u2019s horse still standing near the tree and removed a rope attached to the saddle.  Aric tied himself to the saddle while pain, chills, the protruding axe and fatigue wore down his body, but his spirit rebounded.  I will not die today, maybe tomorrow, but today I shall live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed Marglee toward the abandoned winery and urged her forward as his head slumped forward and sleep claimed once again him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 1209 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tJasper and Taylor sped to the north with three Hunters in pursuit.  Unlike Aric or Nardst and Jack, their quarter horses had the speed advantage and quickly widened the gap between them and the Hunters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSuck on our dust,\u201d Jasper shouted to the fading pursuers and then turned and smiled victoriously at Taylor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou truly are a simple bastard, Jasper.\u201d Taylor noted with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe only kind of bastard my mother knew how to raise, you dirty harpy.\u201d Jasper studied the landscape ahead of him as he pondered their next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo, where to? The Monastery of the Unspoken, the town of Grimchak, or Englatain Mountains?\u201d  Taylor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot the Monastery. I would hate to bring these animals to the monks\u2019 doorstep,\u201d Jasper stated. \u201cI\u2019m not very fond of what lives in those mountains either, so I\u2019d prefer to avoid them, not to mention it is a good long run to the Englatains.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGrimchak, then?\u201d Taylor grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJasper smiled as he imagined her displeasure at the prospect of visiting Grimchak.  \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, Grimchak it is.  But we need to make sure we lose our friends here.\u201d  He pointed over his shoulder to the trio of Hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTaylor shielded her eyes and squinted into the distance. \u201cThere\u2019s a small bluff up ahead.  If we run hard and put enough distance between us and them, I know a sure-fire way to prevent further pursuit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJasper never hesitated or doubted a word the innkeeper said.  He nodded and they pushed their horses harder to gain the bluffs. He was amazed at the speed they managed to coax out their horses and at the resourcefulness of the woman riding alongside him.  She had arrived in Col Ti\u2019er about eight years ago with a worn out mule, an oak bow, and a purse filled with a modest amount of gold coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe had been a wet behind the ears recruit back then and had been on gate duty when she had wandered into the city.  He had been instantly smitten by the new arrival.  Her dark hair and gray blue eyes warmed his heart with romance and hope, but his efforts had been gently, and then directly, rebuffed. After that, Jasper had never bothered her with romantic notions, but he had offered his friendship which she had readily accepted. Now, with so many years of friendship behind them, it seemed laughable to Jasper that he had ever considered Taylor as a romantic interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe had bought the Black Dragon Inn a few weeks after arriving and turned it into a thriving inn and a popular choice for a meal or a drink. She had, over the years, Jasper recalled, mentioned her past but only rarely and guardedly. He remembered she once mentioned that she had ended up in Con Ti\u2019er because of a Hunter raid on her village, but she offered few details.  He knew that she had been married once, but never mentioned what had happened to her mystery spouse. The following year, her brother-in-law, Nardst, arrived at the Black Dragon Inn and began working for Taylor.  Neither offered any information on their seemingly missing husband-brother to anyone in Col Ti\u2019er. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCut left around the bluff and get to the top.\u201d Taylor ordered, cutting through Jasper\u2019s thoughts and scattering them like cockroaches at dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bluff was small but offered an advantage of height and a moderate amount of concealment.  They rode around and up to the edge of the bluff, and then dismounted. Taylor moved swiftly. From her horse\u2019s saddle pack and straps, she removed three arrows and her unstrung oak bow.  She dropped to one knee behind a fallen, rotting tree and stabbed the three arrows into the ground beside her. In a matter of seconds, she had curved her bow, attached the string to the tip, and allowed the string to tense as the bow gained its familiar shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJasper could see the Hunters approaching, riding side by side, as Taylor nocked an arrow and drew the bow. Her breathing became steady and even, and her eyes locked onto its target a moment before the arrow released.  Jasper lost sight of the projectile the instant it left the bow, so he watched the approaching targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spray of blood from the closest horse\u2019s neck indicated a hit.  Its front legs folded, its head collided with the packed earth, and its forward movement slid across the ground until it came to a dusty halt. The rider stayed astride during the entire descent then leapt from its back to examine the fallen horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother arrow followed and pierced the farthest horse\u2019s eye, causing the beast to whirl in the opposite direction before collapsing on its side in an unmoving heap.  Jasper watched the Hunter roll away from his dead mount and come up on one knee looking for the source of the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor grabbed the third arrow from the ground, nocked it and let it fly at the final horse. Her aim was high and she missed her intended target and embedded the arrow deeply into the final Hunter\u2019s shoulder. Jasper watched the injured rider slide from the back of his mount and use its body as cover from further attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s move, Taylor,\u201d Jasper commanded as he pulled her mount toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitated a second, staring at the three Hunters below, and then mounted her horse with the bow still in hand. Jasper followed suit and they raced down the bluff and toward the north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI missed one of the horses,\u201d Taylor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed.  So did its rider.\u201d He smiled at her and pointed to the northeast. \u201cTo Grimchak we go.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d she said unenthusiastically. \u201cMore fun on this gloriously fun day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 954 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fires of Grimchak belched a greasy haze over of the circular corralled city. The smell of charred horseflesh hit Taylor in the face like jarring fingers jammed up her nostrils. The city, if city was the proper name, housed the best, worst and most notorious horse trainers, dealers and thieves.  The entire city\u2019s structure was designed for training, housing, selling, buying and slaughtering of horses. Taylor\u2019s nose wrinkled in disgust as she and Jasper approached the city\u2019s only entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimchak\u2019s entrance consisted of two platform towers and a strong, wooden, swing gate which controlled the exiting and entering of the city.  The guards at entrance were more interested in those exiting than in those seeking admittance.  Taylor noted the guards checking ownership documents of all who exited the city\u2019s corralled walls.  The Grimchakians frowned upon horse thieves as others would murderers and molesters. The phrase \u201cLike a horse thief in Grimchak\u201d was commonly heard and referred to someone who violated sacred laws of morality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love that smell. Yum Yum,\u201d Jasper stated as he rode up next to Taylor.  \u201cHorseflesh \u2013 the meat of champions, psychos, and Grimchakians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor glared at her companion in her familiar mock contempt way. \u201cI\u2019ve heard stories of Grimchak, but the odious odor doesn\u2019t do all the descriptions justice. This place is awful looking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t seen nothing, yet.  The inside of Grimchak is a horse lover\u2019s nightmare.  Steel your stomach\u2026 and your heart, my friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor sighed, trying to imagine the horrors held inside this circular horse hell.  She knew some of the finest horses could be purchased, but she also had heard of the atrocities against horses this place had committed.  She planned to be here only long enough to water and feed their horses, get a tiny bit of rest, and buy provisions before heading toward the Screeching Bean to meet Aric and the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach tensed at the thought of the others, particularly Jack.  He was so young and she or one of her friends had always been nearby to protect the boy.  She hoped Nardst was taking good care of him.  She hoped both the boy and her brother-in-law would find their way safely to the abandoned winery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice of the gatekeeper broke through her thoughts.  The guard wore horse hide for clothing and brandished a weapon that appeared to be made of bone - horse bone if she had to guess. He smelled of horse and manure, and Taylor could see tiny nits leaping to and fro in his hair and on his horse hide garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to resupply and rest before moving on,\u201d Jasper explained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard eyed Jasper with a hard stare before transferring his gaze to his horse. \u201cYou sell that horse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper shook his head. \u201cMy horse is not for sale, but thank you for the compliment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowing his head, the guard swung open the corral gate.  Taylor followed Jasper into Grimchak, wondering what compliment Jasper had spoke of.  She hated being so unaccustomed to her surrounding, and on top of that she was nearly exhausted, physically and emotionally.  She allowed her mind to think of the Hunters for the first time since the attack on Col Ti\u2019er; it hurt her heart and made her bowels turn to liquid. The fear of the Hunters could rule her if she panicked or dwelt on her past. She shove the thought away with a physical shudder of her body.  She hastened her horse\u2019s pace to catch up with Jasper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat compliment did that\u2026 guard give you?\u201d Taylor asked when she eased next to her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime a Grimchakian offers to buy or expresses interest in purchasing your horse, it is considered a compliment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t ask about my horse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I wouldn\u2019t think he would.  Let\u2019s find a hostel to get some sleep.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor crinkled her brow.  Forget that horse-killing guard - her horse was perfectly fine - even if she didn\u2019t know her name.  She had taken the horse from Nardst at the gate and wasn\u2019t familiar with her at all.  Leaning over the horse's neck, she gently patted her on the head. When she leaned back into her saddle, the whole of Grimchak came into view as she cleared the corner of the guard structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFires of varying size, intensity and color dotted the interior of the corral city while  a potpourri of horse breeds in varying states of healthy were gathered in hundreds of small corrals. Taylor\u2019s nose wrinkled at the overpowering smell of manure from the giant mountain sized pile of horse dung on the far city of the city.  The smell of shit almost overpowered the scents of cooking meats, rotting flesh, human toil and oiled leathers but not completely.  Men, dressed in horse hides and armored in horse skulls and skeletons, skulked all about the compound.  In the center of the corral, a series of buildings had been constructed which Taylor guessed were hostels, eateries and merchant stalls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d  Jasper had moved next to her, a look of concern and mild amusement on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man a few yards away sliced open the neck of a white, skinny mare.  The blood fountained into a trough and leather straps and hoists caught the dying body as it fell.  Taylor turned away, facing Jasper. \u201cBy Strakor\u2019s Plight, what sort of hell is this place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amusement washed away from his face. Jasper rested his hand of her knee. \u201cTry not to think about it all. We get some shut eye and some supplies, and the we put this place at our backs.  We\u2019ll be gone in less than 10 hours. Come on, I\u2019m bushed.\u201d  He rode away slowly with his eyes turned downward toward the horse trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor followed locking her moist eyes on Jasper\u2019s back.  She bit her lip until she tasted blood.  Her eyes grew heavy as they traversed the city.  Several men and women spoke to hear with offers of bargains or promises of cheap goods.  She ignored them all and concentrated on remaining awake. Her thoughts drifted back to days before - two days before the attack on Col Ti\u2019er.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 1028 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although this is atypical in a story, let us take a hard look at the Hunters through the eyes of one of their kind.  This story is a Hunter story and how one Hunter became a hero and a villain to an entire Galaxy.  Our story begins on a different planet than Jack and Jasper; it begins on a planet millions of miles away - on planet named Freeloader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA fist stormed into his lips, spewing blood.  It gushed across his chin and down his throat, choking him.  One of his torturers yanked his head forward and slapped him on the back.  <br>\r\n\t\"Now do you want to answer?\"<br>\r\n\tIt was the head interrogator, Major Redvins Treodon, speaking.  He was a tiny man, a Ruddy Hunter, with dark black hair and a face like a rodent.  His voice was high-pitched and harsh.  The prisoner lifted his face toward him. <br>\r\n\t\"My name is Sayer Ersk, aid to Governor Galen of Freeloader.  As a civilian, I protest these proceedings,\"  stated the prisoner, weariness hanging on each word.<br>\r\n\t\"We know that already!\"  The Major's hands swept at the air.  \tSayer glanced about the large, brightly lit office, desperately hoping to wake from this nightmare.  But the nightmare remained, as well as the five men surrounding him.  To keep his mind alert and the tears of despair at bay, he tried to remember how many days of captivity he had endured.  <br>\r\n\tHe could not remember.  The days and nights had blended into one another; all filled with nightmarish pain.  Consciousness was slipping away.  He dropped his chin to his chest and closed his swollen eyes, listening to the men around him.<br>\r\n\t\"You are not getting anywhere, Major,\"  stated Colonel Nyle, the Provisional Military Governor of Laldan.  Sayer pictured the man in his mind.  His head was completely devoid of hair, except for ugly, red eyebrows that resembled tiny bits of fire.  Nyle's nose was long and curved downward, reminding Sayer of a hawk's bill.  Like Sayer and everyone else in the room, he was a Ruddy Hunter.<br>\r\n\t\"Now wait a minute, Governor,\"  stated Captain Kirton, \"that's not true.  We know that his name is Sayer Ersk and he objects to everything.  We also know that we are wasting time.  We need that information soon.\"  Sayer almost laughed.  Kirton tried to keep the mood light, but Sayer could hear the frustration in his voice.  He tried to picture the Captain as well, but could only remember an average face and blond hair.<br>\r\n\t\"Don't worry,  I'll break him and we'll have that information,\"  hissed Major Treodon.  Sayer felt the Major's hot breath in his ear.  \"Isn't that right, Sayer?\"<br>\r\n\tDespair blended with anger.  Anger blended with fear.  Sayer wanted to weep and attack and beg, all at the same time.  Swallowing the knot in his throat, he lifted his head and glared at the Major.  \"My name is Sayer Ersk, aid to Governor Galen of Freeloader.  As a civilian - \"<br>\r\n\tTopa, the enforcer of the group, smashed his fist against Sayer's jaw, cutting off his words.  Of all his captors, Sayer hated Topa the most.   He was a behemoth with a bushy black beard and seemed to revel in causing Sayer pain.  <br>\r\n\tSayer ignored the pain.  \"As a civilian, I - \"<br>\r\n\tTopa struck again.<br>\r\n\tSayer bit into his tongue.  \"I protest these - \"<br>\r\n\tGrowling like a beast in fury, Topa drove his fist into Sayer's eye.<br>\r\n\tSayer heard himself cry out.  Colors swirled in intricate patterns and his head throbbed with the beat of his heart.  He attempted to speak but his mouth failed him.  He hung his head and remained silent, hoping he would disappear.<br>\r\n\t\"Let's call it a day, guys.  He won't be able to tell us anything if he can't talk.\"  The voice came from the back of the room.  It was laced with genuine concern and with something else Sayer could not recognize.  Pity, perhaps.<br>\r\n\tSayer forced himself to lift his head and looked at the speaker.  He was a handsome man with brown hair, a muscular body, and depthless gray eyes.  His name was Noah DeMara, but mostly everyone called him Buck.  Something about the man seemed familiar, but Sayer didn't know exactly what.  Buck seemed uneasy with the interrogation, and had only spoken when Sayer needed rest or water.   <br>\r\n     When Sayer looked into Buck's eyes, a strange and inexplicable sense of hope swelled his chest.  But that hope vanished quickly as Nyle's shadow fell over him.                                                                           <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNoah DeMara winced when Topa's fist slammed into Sayer's eye. It was not the violence or the blood that caused his discomfort, for he was no stranger to either, but it was guilt and shame.  He quickly pushed the negative emotions aside and walked over to Nyle and the prisoner.  <br>\r\n\t\"We have gone to a lot of trouble to bring you here, Mister Ersk.  Now please cooperate.  We don't want to hurt you,\"  stated Nyle to the prisoner.<br>\r\n\tSayer glared at Nyle and spat blood in his face.  Bad move, thought Buck.   <br>\r\n\tTopa's massive fist smashed against the prisoner's jaw.  <br>\r\n\tBuck quickly stepped in between Sayer and Topa, placing a steady hand on the prisoner's shoulder.  \"I think he's had enough,\"  said Buck, speaking to Nyle but looking at Topa.  <br>\r\n\tTopa glared down at him and slowly turned away.   <br>\r\n\tBuck handed Nyle a handkerchief, amazed that the Colonel had stayed so calm.<br>\r\n     Nyle wiped the bloody spit and glared at Sayer.  \"Get him out of here.  We do this again tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n\tBuck escorted Sayer from the room to a large hallway<br>\r\nthen into an elevator.  Buck felt Sayer's eyes burning into him, renewing the feelings of guilt and shame.  He hardened himself and stared at the blinking floor numbers above the door.   \t\"Thanks for getting me out of there,\"  whispered Sayer.<br>\r\n\tBuck shifted uncomfortably.  It was ironic that this man should be thanking him.  Me of all people, thought Buck.   He tried to keep his voice indifferent, almost harsh.  \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" <br>\r\n\t\"You're different than those other guys.  Are you a Network officer?\"  His words were laced with pain.<br>\r\n\t\"No.  I'm an ex-cop, who somehow got mixed up in this crazy war.\"  He wished Sayer would be quiet.  Each word the prisoner spoke only added to Buck's own inner pain.<br>\r\n\tSayer faced Buck and looked directly into his eyes.  \"Let me go.  Just let me walk out of here.\"<br>\r\n\tThe request was so heartfelt and unexpected that Buck almost agreed.  He wished he could, but things were beyond his control.  \"I don't think that will be happening.\"<br>\r\n\t\"Please!  Help me.  I have a family, a wife and daughter!  Let me go home to them.\"  Tears filled Sayer's eyes.  \"It's obvious you don't want me tortured, and that you don't want to have anything to with this.  Please let me go!\"<br>\r\n\tBuck felt anger crawl up his spine.  It was as if Sayer had looked into his soul and had read it like pages in a book.  And for a brief moment, he wondered if he knew about - he cut the thought off quickly.  No one knew, and he promised himself to keep it that way.<br>\r\n\tThe doors opened.  Buck and the prisoner exited, and entered a bathroom.  He handed Sayer a towel and told him to clean himself.<br>\r\n\t\"You won't help me will you?\" asked the prisoner.  \"Are you too scared to stand up for what is right?\"<br>\r\n     The fuse had been lit; his temper flared.  It was Buck's biggest weakness.  Once ignited, it was like a raging fire, hard to quench, quick, and sometimes deadly.  \"Can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n\tSayer nodded.<br>\r\n\t\"How were you captured?\"  His voice hissed. <br>\r\n\tThe prisoner wet the towel and dabbed at his wounds.  \"I was on my homeworld of Freeloader when three guys broke into my house, stuffed me in a bag, and beat me into unconsciousness.  When I woke up, I was in a brig aboard a transport headed for Laldan.  Now answer my question, are you too gutless to stand up for your beliefs?\"\t<br>\r\n\tThe flames of his temper erupted.  Buck snatched the towel out of Sayer's hands and grasped the front of his shirt.  \"You have no idea what my beliefs are!  So don't think you're talking to some bleeding heart who'll open the door and let you walk free.  You are here because you have information we need.  You are here because I brought you here.\"  Buck released his shirt with a shove.<br>\r\n\t\"You brought me?\"  Anger and astonishment laced Sayer's voice.<br>\r\n\tThe fire raged and Buck's hands curled into tight fists.  \"That's right!  I led the team that kidnapped you.  So I suggest if you want to stay healthy, you answer the Colonel's questions.  Let's go.\"<br>\r\n\tBuck brought his prisoner to the detention cells and left without a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 1475 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\"Can you break him, Major?\"  asked Nyle as Buck entered the office after delivering Sayer to his cell.  The Governor's eyes were locked on Treodon.<br>\r\n\tBuck stood by the door and watched Treodon squirm.  He had boasted about his prowess as an interrogator and now he had to answer for his failings.<br>\r\n\t\"Yes, Governor.  I'll break him.  I just need to find a new strategy.  Topa and I have some ideas.\"  Treodon's rodent-like face glanced at the giant Lieutenant standing beside him.<br>\r\n\tTopa nodded at Nyle ignorantly.<br>\r\n\tNyle leaned back in his chair, his fingers gently tapping the armrests, and stared arrogantly at the two interrogators.  <br>\r\n\tThe look of superiority smeared across Nyle's face turned Buck's stomach.  Since Nyle had gained his governorship, Buck had noticed a significant change in the Colonel's behavior and mannerisms.  He had become more demanding, less receptive, and increasingly condescending.  The dark delusions of authority had snared Nyle in a web of self-importance.<br>\r\n\tContempt flared in Treodon's eyes.  \"I'll admit, Colonel, Ersk is tougher than I had expected, but I will break him.  Give me a few more days and he'll talk.\"<br>\r\n\tNyle tore into Treodon, pointing out his failings as an interrogator and as a Network officer.  The Governor's bald head turned crimson as he described the unpleasant details of the Major's next assignment if he was to fail in breaking the prisoner.<br>\r\n\tKirton moved next to Buck and nudged him.  \"Things are getting a little tense.\"<br>\r\n\tBuck nodded.  The tension in Fleet Captain Kirton's voice was evident as well.  The prospect of upcoming battles on the untested commander seemed to be taking their toll.  <br>\r\n\t\"You think Treodon can get the information from Ersk?\"  whispered Kirton.<br>\r\n\t\"He's good, but Sayer's tough.  It's hard to say.\"<br>\r\n\tKirton sighed.  \"Want to get a drink later?\"<br>\r\n\t\"No.  I've got things to do.\"  Buck patted the Captain on his shoulder and moved to the window.  <br>\r\n\tNyle had finished berating Major Treodon and had moved on to Lieutenant Topa.  Buck watched the giant man tense at every vicious word.  <br>\r\n\t\"Are you some kind of mindless pet of Treodon's?\"  The veins in Nyle's neck bulged.  \"I can promise you a long tour of guard duty.  No more of the luxuries you enjoy with Treodon, because if you fail, I'm going to break up this little partnership and you'll never work with him again.\"<br>\r\n\tTopa's massive hands curled into fists and his eyes stared at the floor.  Buck knew Nyle had hit a nerve.  Topa and Treodon had worked together for years and had developed a close friendship.  The loyalty Topa displayed for the Major was almost perverse.<br>\r\n\tTreodon patted the Lieutenant on the back and stepped toward the desk.  Suppressed rage seeped into his words.  \"If you're finished, we have work to do, Governor.  Sayer Ersk will talk tomorrow.  I promise you.\"<br>\r\n\tA chill shot down Buck's spine.  He feared for Sayer's life.  The look in the interrogators' eyes said it all - Sayer would talk or he would die.<br>\r\n\tNyle dismissed them with a wave of his hand and the two interrogators barreled out the office.  Nyle turned to Kirton.  \"Are my forces ready?\"<br>\r\n\t\"Yes.  I have everything in hand.\"<br>\r\n\t\"Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n\tKirton's eyes widened and the muscles in his neck tightened.  \"I'm ready.  But the information would make things easier.\"<br>\r\n\t\"You may not have that luxury, Captain.\"   Nyle sounded like a parent scolding a child.  \"I suggest you prepare for that contingency, or should I find a replacement?\"<br>\r\n\t\"No, sir.\"  The Captain sighed heavily.  \"I'll be prepared.\"<br>\r\n\t\"I hope so.  You are dismissed, Captain.\"  <br>\r\n\tBuck watched Kirton leave.  He looked as if he were on the verge of crying.  \"I'll talk to you later, Kirt.\"  Buck smiled reassuringly.  Kirton forced a smile and disappeared behind the office door.<br>\r\n\t\"He's nervous.  I'm worried,\"  stated Nyle as he propped his feet on the corner of his desk.<br>\r\n\tBuck knew this was an invitation for an opinion.  \"He'll do fine, Nyle.  I think it's just a case of pre-battle jitters.\" <br>\r\n\tNyle smoothed his red eyebrows with his index finder.  \"Maybe.  You have any problems, Buck?\"<br>\r\n\tHe thought of mentioning the overly severe beatings of Sayer, but quickly decided against it.  \"No, sir.\"  Buck watched Nyle pluck his nose hairs.  He suddenly wanted to leave.<br>\r\n\t\"Good night, Buck.  Have Ersk here by the fifth cycle of the morning and inform the others of the time change.\"  Nyle flinched as he yanked a stubborn hair.<br>\r\n\tBuck turned away quickly.  \"Good night, Governor.  See you in the morning.\"  <br>\r\n\tAs Buck left the office, Kirton confronted him.  The Captain's lips quivered and his hands shook.  \"Is he going to replace me?\"<br>\r\n\tBuck grasped the Fleet Captain's shoulder and squeezed it reassuringly.  \"Relax, Kirt.  He was just kidding.  You're not going to be replaced.\"  Buck hoped not.<br>\r\n\tA sigh slipped from his lips.  \"You want to get a drink?\"<br>\r\n\t\"I told you I can't.  Maybe Tomorrow.  Oh, I almost forgot.  We're starting at the fifth cycle tomorrow.  Okay?\"<br>\r\n\tKirton nodded.<br>\r\n\tBuck took the elevator to the second floor and entered Treodon's office.  The Major and the Lieutenant eyed him suspiciously.<br>\r\n\t\"Nyle said we're starting a little earlier tomorrow - the fifth cycle,\"  informed Buck, trying to sound casual.<br>\r\n\t\"Why?\"  demanded Topa.<br>\r\n\t\"Because he said so,\"  snapped Buck.<br>\r\n\t\"We'll be more than ready,\"  stated Treodon, anticipating Topa's reply. <br>\r\n\tBuck locked eyes with Topa.  \"You'd better be.\"  He turned and withdrew from the office.  They were planning something.  He saw it in their eyes.  <br>\r\n\tBuck left Network Headquarters and headed home.  As he rode in his glider, a car that rides on air, Buck wondered if Sayer would survive beyond tomorrow.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC:944 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

Tears of despair formed in the corner of her eyes.  She could not understand why this was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCrawling back onto her cot, she looked sullenly about the room.  It was virtually empty.  A cot and a small table with two chairs were the only furnishings.  She hated the room and hated being its prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe fading sunlight filtered through the only shuttered window, its faint rays spreading across her small, pale face and casting a faded glow on her long, red hair and reflecting off her icy blue eyes.  Her petite features displayed a sense of wisdom that contradicted her age.  Desna was only twelve years old, and she couldn't understand why anyone would want her as their prisoner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe had been here several days.  Her jailer visited twice a day, bringing her food and allowing her bathroom privileges.  He was an Hunter   just like her   with handsome features and a soft voice.  He always asked her if she needed anything or if she was all right.  She ignored his questions and tried to look as pitiful as possible. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\tShe missed her parents and wondered if they were looking for her.  Desna wished she knew why she was here.  Closing her eyes, she reenacted in her mind the events which had brought her to this prison.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe had been sleeping in her bed when the sound of voices woke her.  Sleepy eyed and yawning, she went to investigate, and in her father's office found four men stuffing something into a large bag.  Desna tried unsuccessfully to slip away.  Her jailer noticed her and moving quicker than she had believed possible, grabbed her.  His hand quickly covered her mouth, muffling her scream.  Something jabbed her in the arm and blackness engulfed her.  When she awoke, she was a prisoner in this cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe door slid open and her eyes did the same.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was her jailer.  She stared at the ceiling and tried to force tears into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I got your food.  It's Timrek with rice.  I hope you like it.\"  He placed the food on the table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe thought of dashing out the door crossed her mind, but she knew he was too quick.  She was tiring of playing this pity routine and chose a new strategy.  It was time to get some information.  \"I'm not hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked at her suspiciously.  \"You have to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stared into his gray eyes and feigned the saddest expression she could muster.  \"I hate eating alone.  Will you eat with me?\"<br>\r\n\tThe jailer seemed to give it some thought and nodded.  He smiled sincerely and offered his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was taken aback by his charming smile and instinctively reached out for his hand.  \"What's your name?\"  she asked as he guided her into the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Noah, but I think you can call me Buck.\"  He eased into the other chair and smiled.  \"What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe never hesitated.  \"Desna.\"  She smiled back and began eating.  She could feel herself starting to like this man, and <br>\r\nthat was something should could not allow.  She needed to stick to her plan.  \"Why did you bring me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck shifted in his chair and she could see his eyes searching for an answer.  \"It was unintentional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What were you doing in my house?\"  She realized she had caught him off guard.  <br>\r\n\tBuck sighed and slowly shook his head.  \"It's rather complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Buck, what do you want with me?\" \tShe could see him squirming.  He was definitely not prepared for this.  She decided to press even harder.  \"Buck, why won't you bring me home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well, Desna, it isn't that easy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Because it just isn't.\"  A slight hint of frustration seeped into his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Can I go home?\"  A tear rolled down her cheek.  Nice effect, she thought as she casually brushed it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Eventually.  Just bear with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"When can I go home?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck took a deep breath and smiled at Desna.  \"Do you need to go to the bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No.\"  He's not getting out of this that easy, thought Desna.  \"Why don't you tell me what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe glanced thoughtfully toward the window.  \"Okay, kid, maybe you do deserve to know what's going on.\"  He looked directly into her eyes.  \"Let's set some ground rules, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded and stared back, trying hard not to blink.  She was surprised by his sudden cooperation and suspected some kind of trick.<br>\r\n\t\"First off, there will be certain questions that I can't answer.  If you hit on one of those questions, I'll say `Can't answer' and we move on.  Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded.  The distrust faded.  Feelings of fondness crept back in and she allowed them to stay.  Just for a while, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Second, I don't want any crying.  Third and last, I end this anytime I feel like it.  Got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And I can end it anytime I want to, too.  You got that?\"  Desna tried her hardiest to look tough.  She had to hate him.  Buck is the enemy she reminded herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck smiled.  \"Agreed.  First question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDesna straightened and folded her hands in front of her.  \"Why did you kidnap me?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck mocked her movements.  \"It was an accident.  You stumbled onto us and left me no choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why were you in my house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Can't answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe bit her lip and glared at him.  \"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Laldan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Do you plan to let me go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yes.  I promise.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Are my parents all right?\"  Desna pictured them in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck hesitated. \"Can't answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPanic gripped her heart.  She fought back the tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck gently put his hand over hers.  \"I had hoped you wouldn't ask that, Desna.  Your mother is fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And my father?\"  Her voice quivered.  She wanted to pull away from his touch, but she found it strangely reassuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck's jaw tightened, and for a moment Desna thought he was going to break rule two.  \"Your father has been taken prisoner by the Network.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why?\"  His touch was suddenly vile.  She yanked her hands away and gripped the edge of the table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Can't answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why, Buck?\"  She spoke through clenched teeth as the first feelings of actual hatred shattered the fondness she had felt for Buck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Next question.\"  His eyes bore into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Because of the war?\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\tBuck nodded and slid his hands under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDesna wanted to cry.  She wished rule two never existed.  \"Why is there a war?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why is the Network and Confederate fighting?\"  She didn't know why she asked this, but she couldn't think of anything better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It is rather complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe had some understanding of the war, but never fully understood why the two governments were fighting.  It had never been all that important to her, until now.  All of sudden, it was the most important thing in the galaxy.  \"Tell me anyway, Buck.  Tell me about the war.\"  Desna figured if she knew more about the war, then she may be able to figure out a way to help her father. \t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you want me to begin, Desna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 1207 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Buck could feel himself sinking in a mire of sympathy.  His heart went out to Desna.  The guilt he felt for bringing her here threatened to overwhelm him.  He cursed himself for letting her get to him.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\tIt wasn't just pity and guilt at work.  Desna impressed Buck from the moment he saw her.  She had a maturity and a directness that he found appealing.  Her presence demanded respect and honesty, and Buck decided he would give her both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I want you to start at the beginning,\" commanded Desna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, the beginning it is.\"  Buck sank into his chair and collected his thoughts.  \"I guess we will start on Rigel IV, the Hunter homeworld.  About a hundred years ago, the government on Rigel IV was weak and the Hunter people were in disorder.  According to stories, crime, violence, and poverty were common sights on the city streets.  The Hunter civilization was slowly tearing itself apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ten of the most powerful Ruddy Hunter families decided a change was in order.  They created an organization called the Hunter Network.  Don't ask me why they called it that.  I don't think anyone knows.  Anyway, in a matter of twenty years, the Network had removed the old government and had established themselves as the legitimate ruling body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I learned some of that in school,\" interrupted Desna, \"and my teacher said the Network used murder and threats and bribes to gain power.  Is that true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yes.  Their methods were questionable, but they did manage to clean up the cities and unite the Hunter people on Rigel IV.\"<br>\r\n\t\"What about the other Hunter planets?  How did they get control of them?\"  asked Desna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck leaned forward and rested his elbows on the table.  \"Well, according to history, many of the colonies that surrounded Rigel IV asked to join, but I suspect some asked and others were forced to join.  Eventually, all the Hunter planets in Hunter space were under Network control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"When did the Network takeover Laldan, Freeloader and Doo III?  Those planets aren't in Hunter space.  They're in the Triangle.  What right did they have to take over worlds in Free Space?\"  asked Desna, her voice rising in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck remained calmed and smiled.  \"They didn't exactly take over those worlds.  The government of Laldan asked to join the Network and Freeloader was liberated from the IKS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You mean taken over?\"  Desna pointed an accusing finger at Buck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA sigh escaped from his lips.  \"After all the planets in Hunter space were united, Laldan asked to join.  The Network quickly accepted them and that was that.  As for Freeloader, it gets kind of complicated.  The IKS had taken advantage of an unexplained mass hysteria on Freeloader.  They moved in quickly and claimed it as their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why did the IKS want Freeloader?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"As you probably know, the IKS is a splinter group of the Empire.  They broke off from the Empire and settled in the Triangle.  Over the years they gained strength, but lacked resources.  Freeloader was a perfect source for just about everything and it also served as a very strategic military base.  But the IKS didn't hold Freeloader for long.  The Network, in their first real military offensive, liberated the planet and sent the renegade IKS back to their own territory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You mean they chased out the IKS and took the world for themselves,\"  stated Desna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck started to object, but then thought better of it.  He was not about to argue politics with a twelve year old girl, no matter how smart and insightful she seemed.  \"Have you ever heard of Zirkon Arc?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe sighed and rolled her eyes.  \"Of course I've heard of Governor Arc.  He was only the leader of the Confederate!\" <br>\r\n\tBuck narrowed his eyes and fought to hold onto to his patience.  \"Before he was the Confederate leader, he was a strategists for the Network.  He devised and executed the attack on the IKS, and as a reward for his success, the Network appointed him as planetary governor of Freeloader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDesna shook her head.  \"I didn't know that, but what does all this have to do with the Network-Confederate War?\"<br>\r\n \t\"I'm getting to that now.  After Arc was appointed, he convinced the council on Doo III to join the Network.  Seven years passed.  During these years two noteworthy things happened, the Network acquired the planet of New Era which is also located in the Triangle, and the Network's leaders, the Convocation, became very secretive and mysterious.  They relocated to a secret base and only communicated with their most trusted officers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Then, without notice or cause, the Convocation issued a directive, that's a law of sorts, called Affirmative Action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDesna's face hardened and her eyes narrowed.  \"That's when you guys started hurting the Green Hunters.  Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck raised his hands defensively.  \"Wait a minute, Desna.  I don't know what this you guys stuff is all about, but I never had anything to do with the oppression of the Greens.  When Affirmative Action was started, I was still a cop for the Triangle Police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"But you are a Network officer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck couldn't deny that.  He also couldn't deny his dislike of Green Hunters.  His aversion of the Greens could be attributed to his upbringing.  All Ruddies were taught that Greens were different in their behavior, their intellect and their morals.  He questioned those teachings now, but the feelings of distrust ran deep and were hard to shed.  The mutual disunity between the Ruddies and Greens had existed since Hunter history began, but was always tempered by tolerance and laws.  Buck remembered when the Affirmative Action was initiated it was like declaring war on the Greens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I wasn't a part of the Green oppression, Desna,\"  stated Buck flatly.  \"I'll be honest with you though.  When the directive was issued, I was in full support.  Lots of people were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck looked at the ceiling thoughtfully.  He wasn't sure why the Affirmative Action received so much support.  The Network did a fabulous job at keeping the issue vague and complex, supplementing it with propaganda.  Ruddy Hunters seemed more than eager to seize the idea that Greens were the cause of any or all problems on Hunter worlds.  The hate came easily.  \"I'm not really sure, Desna.  For five years, the Action was carried out with very little objection or resistance.  The Greens tried to revolt, but they lacked leadership.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And this is where the war begins.  You see, the Green oppression started on Rigel and was steadily extended to the other Network worlds.  As on the homeworld, it was embraced by many of the Ruddies like a long lost child.  But when the policy reached the Triangle worlds, the Network faced their first resistance\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDesna smiled.  \"Arc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Right.  Arc and Governor Zardes of Doo III opposed the Affirmative Action directive and revolted against the Network itself.  Arc and Zardes created their own government, calling it the Hunter Confederate, and as their first official action, they launched an unsuccessful attack against Laldan.  The Network declared war, and that's how the war got started.\"  Buck eased back into his chair and folded his arms across his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That's not the whole story!\"  Desna stared at him accusingly.  \"What about Galen and the IKS?  What about the parasites?  What about - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck cut her off.  \"It's late, and I have to get going.\"  He was tiring of the history lesson, but that was not the real reason he wanted to leave.  Desna's eyes, her expressions and her voice cut through him with knives of guilt and shame.  He felt an overwhelming urge to put distance between himself and his captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why did you kidnap my father?\"  demanded Desna as she walked around the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck headed for the door.  \"I'll be back tomorrow morning.  Good night, Desna.\"  He raced for the door, but a sharp pain erupted in his left knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWC: 1317 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

He needed to escape, to get away before he fell prey to the girl's demands and to his guilt.  He shoved all the pain aside and reached for the door's controls.  Pain suddenly washed through his groin and slowly edged toward his stomach.  He dropped to the floor and curled into a ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA blur of motion moved past him and out the door.  Buck recovered quickly and stumbled after her.  His temper boiled.  His hand instinctively reached inside his jacket and grasped his holstered phaser.  He pulled his hand away from the weapon as if it were fire.  He shook his head vigorously, trying to clear his mind.  What am I doing, he asked himself, I can't shoot her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe quickly scanned the room.  He was in the living room of his apartment.  Desna's prison was a connecting storage room.  He did not see her anywhere.  \"Computer, lock all exits.  Code Noah two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA shimmering blue light washed down the front door and sealed it shut.  Buck stood in front of the storage room and listened.  Silence.<br>\r\n\tHe called out her name and stepped toward the sofa.  He heard a rustling to his right and quickly turned.  A metal figurine struck him just above his right eye.  The pain was quick, but intense.  He dropped to one knee and grabbed his head.  A tender knot was already forming.  He could not believe he was getting his ass kicked by a twelve year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That's enough, Desna!\"  Buck moved toward her, but she was gone.  \"Damn it, you can't get out of here!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why did you kidnap my father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe voice came from somewhere behind him.  He turned and saw a glass object speeding for his face.  He dropped and rolled behind a chair.  The object smashed against the wall.  He knew he had to get control of this situation quickly.  The noise would attract attention, and that was the last thing he needed.  Buck breathed in deeply and closed his eyes.  He traveled into his mind, blocking out emotions, ignoring physical pain, and forgetting all concerns.  He honed in on his one goal, capture and subdue the girl.  Instincts, cold and penetrating, swept through his body, tensing muscles and keening the senses.  His eyes snapped open, gray and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stood and examined his surroundings like seeing them for the first time.  Another object, a small iron tray, raced toward his face.  His hand snatched it from the air and dropped it noiselessly onto the chair.  He heard the girl speak.  The words muffled in his ears.  He moved like an animal stalking prey, maneuvering between furniture.  He paused and listened.  Her breathing was heavy.  She was very close.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe sprang over the sofa, glided behind the small bar, and snatched her by the back of her neck.  The muscles in his neck tightened like cords of taut rope.  His fingers tightened and slid around her tiny throat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDesna struggled to free herself, but his grip was like a vise.  She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDo not kill her, echoed in Buck's mind.  Subdue the girl.  Immediately, his hands relaxed and slipped over her mouth, deadening the intensity of the cry.  Teeth sank into his hand, blood rolling down his palm.  He felt no pain.  He wrapped his arm around her waist and carried her to the storage room, his bleeding hand still covering her mouth.  He shoved her inside, her teeth slipping free from his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I hate you!\" screamed Desna as she spat his blood into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck ignored her and pressed the door's controls.  The door slid shut and locked.  The bloody spit rolled freely down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 650 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The internal fire of his temper slowly died.  The physical and emotional pain broke free of the mental barriers and washed over him like a tidal wave.  Buck sat on his worn sofa and stared at the featureless wall as his muscles relaxed and his senses dimmed.  A muffled sobbing from an adjoining room filled the silence of the small apartment.  \t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked at the door of the storage room and thought about Desna.  He could have killed her.  Her innocent face haunted him, calling forth emotions that clawed at his soul.  That he was responsible for her misery left him feeling confused and powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe wondered how he had been transformed into this person, a stranger.  A man no longer sure of his beliefs and his duties.  A man who had kidnapped an innocent child, had participated in her father's torture, and had done nothing to right the situation.  How had he lost control?  The answer was as evasive as the night at daybreak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck entered his bathroom and cleaned his wounds.  He wiped the dried blood from his face and gazed into the mirror.  How had he come to be in this situation?  His past rose out of his mind and paraded before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe remembered how he, as a Triangle Police Agent, and several other agents had accompanied the Director of the Triangle Police to Freeloader for a diplomatic mission and how during this mission he had learned that the Network's leaders, the Convocation, and many Network officers had been taken over by a hostile and intelligent parasitic race.  He remembered how he had quit the Triangle Police and joined the Confederate, and how he and several others had joined Arc's strike team and how they had traveled to Rigel IV and destroyed the parasites.  He remembered how he had returned to Freeloader and had learned that Arc had mysteriously disappeared, and how Galen, the Assistant Governor, had taken over the Confederate.  At the thought of Galen, anger stirred in Buck's chest.  He quickly pushed it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe recalled how Galen had put him and the others of Arc's team into prison and how he had claimed it was for the team's protection.  He remembered how he had met Nyle, a Network officer being held prisoner by the Confederate, while he had been incarcerated, and how the renown IKS ambassador, Karstagg, had suddenly arrived on Freeloader to talk to Galen, and how he had persuaded Galen to free the strike team from jail.  He also recalled how Governor Zardes of Doo III had been suddenly assassinated and how quickly Galen had declared himself Doo III's new leader.  The anger he felt toward Galen stirred once more, and this time he let it linger as his recollections continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe recalled how he had decided to abandon the Confederate and support the Network, and how he had freed Nyle from prison and how they had escaped the planet in a stolen ship.  He cringed as he remembered hearing the news about Galen and the IKS's alliance, and about how Karstagg had deserted the IKS Empire and joined the IKS.  Galen had then given the traitorous Karstagg and his vile IKS forces Doo III in exchange for military support in the Network - Confederate War.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe feelings he had felt then renewed themselves in a sudden burst.  He felt the anger toward Galen and the determination to defeat the Confederate and to reunite the Hunter race surge through him.  He remembered how he had sworn to himself and to Nyle that he would do anything to ensure a Network victory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nyle and he had reached Laldan and Nyle had been appointed Governor.  Buck recalled how Nyle had asked for an oath of loyalty when Nyle had appointed him as a governor's aid, and how quickly he had taken that oath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck entered his bedroom and stripped off his clothing.  Slipping into bed, he stared at the ceiling.  Nyle had given Buck the order to kidnap Sayer Ersk, claiming it was necessary to insure a Network victory.  Buck had objected, believing it wrong, criminal even, to kidnap a civilian administrator who happens to possess needed information.  Nyle had insisted and had reminded Buck of his oath.  If anything, Buck was a man of his word and he had reluctantly agreed.  He had hired three civilians to help him, keeping their identities a secret from everyone, even Nyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuck closed his eyes and wondered if he had made a mistake in taking Nyle's oath, or if he had made a mistake in taking Desna as a captive.  Both seemed like the right thing to do at the time, but now he just didn't know.  He had wanted to take the oath and to help his people, hoping to right the wrongs committed by the parasites and by Galen.  He had had to abduct Desna.  If he had left her, he and his team would have never escaped Freeloader before she had alerted someone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd that left Sayer Ersk.  His death would eventually be ordered, whether he gave the information or not, and Buck knew he would never let that happen.  Buck felt he would ultimately have to choose between Nyle and Sayer and Desna Ersk, and no matter what his choice somebody was going to get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t  Sleep dimmed his thoughts and he wondered anew how he had lost control of his life.  An answer never came and sleep plunged him into the world of dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 914 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The hum of a forcefield created a constant background noise that was only interrupted by the occasional scraping of a Network officer's boots.  Day and night were meaningless within the prison, for windows and the sense of time were nonexistant.  <br>\r\n\tSayer Ersk sat on the edge of his bed and stared at the shiny white floor.  His body was exhausted and battered, but his mind was strangely alert.  He supposed it had to do with Buck's revelation, but he knew it was something else as well.<br>\r\n\tBuck had caught him off guard.  He fumed at himself for falling into the oldest psychological pitfall faced by hostages.  He had allowed himself to believe Buck would help him.  The idea of Buck being his kidnapper still seemed incredible, but Sayer had to accept that Buck was the enemy.  A vision of Buck being vaporized by a blaster flashed in his mind.  He wanted to smile, but his swollen face wouldn't allow it.<br>\r\n\tHe thrust Buck from his mind and decided to deal with him when the time came.   Other things demanded his immediate attention, such as Galen.   It was odd.  With his captors questioning and beating him on a regular basis, he considered Galen, the Governor of Freeloader and leader of the Confederate, his biggest threat.  He had the information the Network wanted, but he would never tell.  His silence had nothing to do with loyalty or a sense of duty toward Galen or the Confederate, but rather fear.  He was scared of Galen, or rather scared of what Galen might do to his family and the families of others.<br>\r\n\tSayer closed his swollen and bruised eyes.  A conference room appeared in his mind.  A long table surrounded by chairs sat in its center.  Galen was at the head of the table with two IKS soldiers standing at each shoulder.  Ten other men sat around the table waiting for Galen to speak.  Sayer was one of these men.  The others were various aids to Galen and Confederate officers.<br>\r\n\tGalen cleared his throat, his green eyes studying each man carefully as if looking for any sign of treachery.  Galen was a small Ruddy Hunter with jet black hair, yellowish skin, and pale thin lips.  He did not look like a man of authority, and he reminded Sayer of a slick, fast-talking salesman.<br>\r\n\t\"Seal the room and perform security sweep level ten.\"  Galen's voice was overconfident and cocky.  A forcefield shimmered around the perimeter of the room and scanning beams intensely probed each man present.<br>\r\n\tThe computer approved all security measures and Galen leaned back in his chair, a smirk creasing his thin lips.  \"This meeting, gentlemen, and all issues discussed will be under security code fifty-seven red.\"<br>\r\n\tSayer had never heard of security code fifty-seven red, but he knew it wasn't good by the gasps from several Confederate officers.<br>\r\n\tA civilian, like Sayer, raised his hand and waited for Galen to acknowledge him.  Galen nodded curtly.  \"Governor Galen.\"  His voice was uncertain.  \"I'm not familiar with that code.\"<br>\r\n\tGalen looked at the man disdainfully.  \"Someone tell him.\"<br>\r\n\tSendoc, the Fleet Captain and a Green Hunter, stood.  \"It means that all information revealed here will not leave this room.\"  Sendoc paused and glanced at Galen.  \"And if a leak from anyone in this room is discovered or suspected, all of our immediate family members will be terminated.\"<br>\r\n\t\"All family members of the person suspected of the leak?\"  asked one of the officers.<br>\r\n\tGalen shook his head and frowned.  \"No.  All family members of everyone present in this room, regardless of who is the leak.  If one of you betrays us then I will be forced to terminate each and every one of your families.\"  Galen sounded almost hopeful.<br>\r\n\tEach man at the table looked at the others like seeing them for the first time.  Sayer wanted no part of this.  He was not willing to put his family's lives on men he didn't even know.  He raised his hand and waited to be acknowledged, for he knew the procedure well.<br>\r\n\t\"Galen, I do not wish to be involved in this!\"  It was the civilian who had spoken earlier.  <br>\r\n\tEveryone in the room tensed.  Sayer's hand dropped to his side.  No one could believe that someone had spoken without recognition from Galen, and had failed to call him by his proper title.<br>\r\n\tThe man realized his mistake at once.  He tried to apologize but it was too late.  Galen's eyes narrowed and bore into the helpless man.<br>\r\n\t\"Very well.  You're dismissed.\"  Galen's voice was cold and unfeeling.<br>\r\n\tNo one breathed as the man walked to the door.  Sayer was unsure as to what was going to happen, but he had a pretty good idea.  His hands gripped the armrest until his knuckles turned white.<br>\r\n \tThe man paused before the door and turned toward Galen slowly.  \"Governor, I can't get past the forcefield.\"  His face was pale and his breathing ragged.  \"Can you lower it?\"<br>\r\n\tGalen grinned wickedly, his back to the man.  He bowed his head slightly and Sayer swallowed hard.<br>\r\n\tThe IKS to Galen's right administered a brutal chop to the man's throat.  Sayer closed his eyes.  He could hear the victim coughing and gasping for air.  Several more blows were delivered, each sounding more brutal than the last, and then silence.  Sayer opened his eyes and watched as the IKS vaporized the man with his disruptor.  The smell of charred flesh filled his nose.  Sayer thought he was going to be sick.<br>\r\n\t\"Let's get on with the meeting,\"  stated Galen in an obviously casual voice.  \"Sayer, you had your hand up.  What is it?\"<br>\r\n\tSayer stared at the tabletop, too scared to look into the Governor's eyes.  \"Nothing, Governor.  It can wait.  It wasn't important.\"  Sayer thought his voice sounded very far away.<br>\r\n\t\"Very well.  As you know,\"  declared Galen, \"Nyle escaped recently with the help of one of Arc's men, Noah Demara, and we need to work on security - \"<br>\r\n\tSayer's eyes snapped open and gazed at the detention cell floor.  That's where he had heard the name before - Noah Demara.  Buck!  He just remembered it.  He was one of Arc's men.  He used to support the Confederate.  A sense of hope filled his chest, but he quickly crushed it. <br>\r\n\tHe may be able to use this information, but he had to remember Buck was an enemy.  He didn't know why Buck had changed his allegiance and that was what he had to find out.  Then use it to his advantage.  If he was going to play mind games with Buck, Sayer knew he would have to rely on his wits and not his emotions.<br>\r\n\tSayer stretched himself across his bed and closed his eyes.  He thought of his family and hoped they were safe.  His absence may have caused Galen to issue the termination order, but Sayer didn't know Galen well enough to predict his actions.  Hopefully, Galen wouldn't act rashly.  Hopefully, his wife and daughter had enough sense to go into hiding for he had told his wife about security code fifty-seven red.<br>\r\n\tSayer was on the verge of complete exhaustion.  He hoped he had the strength to make it for another day.  He had to escape soon.  He would never tell the Network what they wanted to know - the consequences of that were too dreadful - but he didn't know how much longer he could survive the beatings.  If he didn't get free, he knew he would soon be dead.<br>\r\n\tSleep finally overcame him and plunged him into the world of nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 1278 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each flicker of red light was accompanied by a shrill high-pitched sound.  <br>\r\n\tA large fleshy man stirred in the bed next to the comm terminal.  He slowly rolled himself to the edge of the bed and ordered the computer to produce a dim light.  The room brightened slightly.  The large man wrapped a huge robe around him and settled into the overstuffed chair in front of the terminal.  He violently jabbed a button on the comm panel and the lights and sounds died.  A small screen in front of him came to life, illuminating the rotund man's features.<br>\r\n\tHis face was round and flabby with a slightly paler hue than an average Ruddy Hunter.  Layers of fat folded into each other where his neck and head connected.  His hair was jet black, greasy and thin.  Portions of his scalp were easily visible through the strands of hair that swept back from his forehead.  Light green eyes, cold and glassy, swept over the screen.  His bushy eyebrows raised as he poked at another button.<br>\r\n\tA figure cloaked in shadows appeared on the screen in front of him.  The dark form shifted and squirmed in his chair.  He cleared his voice before speaking.  \"Mister Fliss?  Naylind Fliss?\"<br>\r\n\tThe obese man nodded.<br>\r\n\tThe caller swallowed hard.  \"Sorry to disturb you.  It's me, again.\"<br>\r\n\tThe other nodded again.  \"I know who you are.  What do you want?\"  His voice was soft and compelling, not at all compatible with his physical appearance.  <br>\r\n\t\"It looks like I'm going need you after all.  We're getting nowhere.  Can you be here tomorrow morning?\"  The caller folded his legs and seemed to tense.<br>\r\n\tFliss leaned back, his chair moaning in protest.  \"That depends.  We haven't discussed payment.\"<br>\r\n\t\"I haven't much money.  How much do you normally charge?\"<br>\r\n\tAn arrogant smiled creased Fliss' lips.  \"More than you could afford.  Payment comes in other forms.  A promised favor will do.\"<br>\r\n\tThe dark figure was silent a moment.  When he spoke, his voice lacked any semblance of confidence.  \"Sure.  I promise you a favor.\"  He hesitated.  \"What sort of favor?\"<br>\r\n\tFliss leaned forward, his eyes cold and lifeless looking.  \"Whatever I ask.  Deal?\"<br>\r\n\t\"Just one favor?\"<br>\r\n\tFliss nodded.<br>\r\n\t\"All right.  We have a deal.  Be at Network Headquarters tomorrow at the fifth cycle of the morning?\"<br>\r\n\t\"First, send me all your data on this Ersk character, and all actions done to him thus far.  Second, will you have every thing prepared for my arrival, as we discussed earlier in the week?\"  <br>\r\n\t\"Of course.  Every thing is arranged, and I'll send you the files immediately.\"<br>\r\n\tFliss nodded and terminated the call with a vicious jab of his plump finger.  The screen blinked into blackness.  Tapping his fingertips lightly together, he waited for the promised information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 482 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun rose over the southern hemisphere of Laldan, shooting tiny streamers of light into the cloudless sky.  The greenish waters of the Deep Brint wore the sunlight like an overgarment.  Seabirds screamed as if heralding the dawn.  <br>\r\n\tA flittercraft skirted the water's surface, disturbing the serenity of nature.  The seabirds scattered at its approached and sections of the Deep Brint's garment shattered into tiny pieces.   The craft was small and circular with a transparent bubble encasing the small deck and its passengers.<br>\r\n\tThe pilot worked the small control panel that was situated in the center of the vessel.  He stared ahead at the large island as it drew near. <br>\r\n\tA short, stocky, Ruddy Hunter with greasy, gray hair and a thin mustache glanced over the pilot's shoulder.  He wore a standard Hunter Network uniform, a black jacket with maroon trim, black pants, and long maroon gloves and boots.  The yellow  letters \"HN\" were emblazoned on his right breast, and on his left breast was a name badge that read Gramey Marect.  On his collar was the insignia of a Lieutenant.  His hands constantly tugged at the jacket's collar and readjusted his belt and holstered disruptor.  After each readjustment, he would look to the rear of the craft at his companion for approval.<br>\r\n\tHis companion, who also wore a Network uniform, nodded indifferently and stared across the Deep Brint.  He wore the rank of Captain and his badge identified him as Paxton Dovic.  His face and body looked as if it had been chiseled from stone, hard and unyielding.  A long, thin, browned scar ran from his left eye across his protruding cheekbone and ended at his chin.  His hair was shaved close to the scalp and had the color of a walnut.  Dovic's brown eyes occasionally glanced at the large figure  standing at the front of the craft.<br>\r\n\tThe large man wore a Network uniform.  A thin cigarette rested between his plump fingers as he stared at the horizon.  The sun shone in his glassy green eyes.  The uniform's collar was barely visible beneath the rolls of fat gathered at his neck, but the rank insignia was unmistakably that of a General's.  The letters on his left breast spelled out the name Urish Rouchet.  He sucked on his cigarette and exhaled slowly as Marect cautiously approached.<br>\r\n\tMarect cleared his throat and spoke, his voice raspy. \"Fliss, I'm still not - \"  <br>\r\n\tA low growl sounded from somewhere beneath the General's layers of fat.<br>\r\n\tMarect flinched.  \"Sorry.  General Roket.\"<br>\r\n\tFliss eyed him without moving his head.  When he spoke, the air seemed to chill.  \"Rouchet.  Just call me General.\"<br>\r\n\t\"Right, General.  Got it.  I'm still not sure about this.\"<br>\r\n\tFliss never moved, his eyes returning to the horizon.  He took another drag on his cigarette.<br>\r\n\tMarect glanced at the pilot then at Dovic and then back to Fliss.  \"We can get into a lot of trouble here.  Why all the fake names and disguises?\"<br>\r\n\tFliss turned to the pilot.  \"Dock at pylon station seven.\"  He turned back to the horizon without waiting for a response.<br>\r\n\tMarect bit his thumbnail.  \"I don't like this setup, Fliss.\"  He bit into his lip, almost drawing blood.  \"I mean General.\"<br>\r\n\tFliss dropped his cigarette and crushed it with his huge booted foot.  Smoke curled out his nose.  \"Go away.\"  His voice was barely audible over the craft's turbines.<br>\r\n\tMarect chewed on his upper lip and sighed.  He stared at Fliss momentarily and scurried away.<br>\r\n  \tThe flittercraft glided around the western edge of the island and approached a small metal wharf built within a cove.  The pilot guided the craft beneath the landing and the transparent bubble retracted into the sides of the craft.  A circular door in the wharf's flooring slid open as the landing lowered around the round boat.  Huge bolts slid out the craft's sides and locked into sockets within the wharf.  The landing rose and lifted the flittercraft from the water.<br>\r\n\tFliss stepped off first with his two companions following.  A Network darter was parked at the edge of the wharf.   The darter looked like a large, black and maroon sled.  Inside the front of the vehicle were two seats facing a control panel, and in the back was a long, overstuffed seat that extended the width of the darter.  <br>\r\n     A beach of gray sand ran along the perimeter of the island and ended at a dense forest.  An ironmetal road extended from the wharf's edge and cut through the forest.  Fliss headed for the darter parked on the road and Marect and Dovic followed.<br>\r\n\tHalfway to the darter Dovic turned and faced the flittercraft.  He pointed a small cylindrical object at the  pilot.  A cluster of tiny needles sprang from the cylinder and embedded in the pilot's throat.  Dovic, his face inexpressive, turned and walked to the vehicle as the pilot instantly collapsed in a lifeless heap.<br>\r\n\tMarect and Dovic occupied the front seats while Fliss rested his massive frame in the back.  Marect punched in the required security code to unlock the darter's controls and powered the engine.  The darter smoothly lifted about a foot above the road's surface and glided forward.  Marect navigated the vehicle up the road until he reached a small forcefield with a sign reading \"Pylon Station Closed For Repairs\".  Dovic pushed a sequence of buttons on the darter's controls and the forcefield shimmered and vanished.  The vehicle continued on and the forcefield was reestablished.<br>\r\n\tThe darter glided into the city.  Fliss' eyes stared forward, as did Dovic's.  Marect took in the sights with the curiosity of a tourist.  Network soldiers casually patrolled among the island's residents.  The buildings, tall and sleek, were packed together tightly.  Floater vehicles filled the ironmetal streets. <br>\r\n     The island's newest arrivals wormed their way through the streets and eventually left the city and entered a decidedly residential area.  The buildings were multi-storied and elongated with neatly arranged patches of plasti-grass surrounding it.  The soldiers here were considerably less than in the city, but their presence was nonetheless evident. <br>\r\n\tThe dwellings ended abruptly and a dense forest appeared.  The trees and thorny undergrowth hedged the ironmetal road, casting shadows across the three men.  The traffic had steadily lessened and was now nonexistent. <br>\r\n\tThe road wound through the thick woodlands for several miles, leading to the center of the island.  The darter followed a bend in the road and the forest suddenly ended.  Several large structures enclosed by a domed forcefield lay ahead.  <br>\r\n\tFliss called the vehicle to a halt and nodded.  Dovic exited the darter and disappeared without a word into the forest.  The darter and its two occupants continued toward the structures.<br>\r\n\tThe ironmetal road ended about forty feet from the forcefield where a small building was situated.  Marect shifted nervously in his seat as a Network soldier exited the building and approached the darter.  <br>\r\n\t\"Welcome to Network Headquarters, gentleman,\"  greeted the soldier indifferently, \"Your names?\"<br>\r\n\tMarect glanced back at Fliss's name badge and then down at his own.  \"Lieutenant Marect and General Rouchet,\"  he quickly stated.<br>\r\n\tThe soldier snapped to attention and managed a quick glimpse at the huge man in the back seat.  \"Good Morning, General.\"<br>\r\n\tFliss' lips curled upward as he turned his glassy eyes on the solider.  \"Tell the Governor I wish to see him.\"  <br>\r\n\tThe soldier nodded and all but ran back to the guardhouse to contact Governor Nyle.<br>\r\n\tThe General tapped his fingertips lightly together and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 1243 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

Nyle motioned for Buck to place the prisoner in his usual chair.  <br>\r\n\t\"A General Rouchet, Governor, sir,\"  answered the guard as Buck gently placed Sayer in his chair.  <br>\r\n\tBuck noticed he was the first of the group to arrive.  He had started his day earlier than usual.  Desna had still been asleep when he had delivered her breakfast.  Sayer had said nothing to him and Buck had done the same.<br>\r\n\t\"Standby, soldier.\"  Nyle waved Buck behind the desk and spoke in a hushed tone.  \"Buck, have you ever heard of General Rouchet?\"<br>\r\n\tBuck shook his head and glanced at Sayer.  He appeared to be asleep.  <br>\r\n\t\"Neither have I.  He's here to see me.  Check the computers,\"  commanded Nyle.<br>\r\n\tBuck walked to a small worktable with a computer interface on top of it and accessed the Network personnel dossiers.  Nyle glanced through his appointments on a small hand held computer.<br>\r\n\t\"Here it is, Nyle,\"  announced Buck, \"General Urish Rouchet.  Homeworld is New Era and his current assignment is labeled as classified.\"<br>\r\n\tNyle furrowed his brow, tossed his small computer across the desktop and strode across the room.  \"Classified!  Who's his superior?\"<br>\r\n\tBuck scanned the screen.  \"Assistant Director Ehogan of New Era.\"<br>\r\n\tNyle marched to the window and stared at the front gate.<br>\r\n\tBuck sensed the uneasiness in Nyle.  It was obvious the Provisional Governor of Laldan was wondering just how provisional his governorship would be.  An uneasy feeling settled into Buck's stomach as he joined Nyle at the window.<br>\r\n\tThey could see the Network darter waiting outside the forcefield.  Even from the window the General's huge mass was obvious.<br>\r\n\t\"Why do you think he's here, Buck?\"  The anxiety in Nyle's voice was evident.  <br>\r\n\t\"I don't know.  Maybe an inspection or maybe to provide some orders.\"    <br>\r\n\t\"Maybe.  Maybe not.\"  Nyle stared at the General as if he were trying to read his mind.<br>\r\n\t\"What are you guys looking at?\"  asked Captain Kirton as he peered over the men's shoulders.<br>\r\n\tBuck and Nyle started at the sound of his voice.  Neither had heard him enter the office.<br>\r\n\t\"A General wants to see Nyle,\"  answered Buck as he steadied himself.<br>\r\n\t\"He looks awfully fat.  What's he want.\"  Kirton squeezed in between the two men for a better look.<br>\r\n\t\"We don't know.  Ever heard of General Rouchet?\"  asked Nyle.<br>\r\n\tKirton seemed to think for a moment.  \"No, sir.  Maybe he's your replacement.\"<br>\r\n\tThe look Nyle shot the Captain was deadly.  Kirton stepped away from the window and took another step away from Nyle.  <br>\r\n\t\"You'd better not keep him waiting, Colonel,\"  advised Buck.<br>\r\n\tNyle glanced back at the General, nodded and turned to the comm screen.  Beads of sweat dotted the guard's forehead.  \"Send him through, soldier.  Tell him I'll be glad to see him.\"<br>\r\n\tMajor Treodon and Lieutenant Topa entered the office as Nyle terminated the communications.  Treodon carried a large briefcase, and Topa cradled a roll of black plastic.<br>\r\n\t\"Morning, gentlemen,\"  greeted Treodon as he placed his case next to Nyle's desk.<br>\r\n\tBuck turned from the window.  The General was being admitted into the headquarters via a secured underground passageway.  Buck watched Topa toss Sayer's chair aside and spread the black plastic across the floor.  This didn't look good.  Topa replaced the chair directly in the center of the plastic.  Not good at all.<br>\r\n\tNyle ordered his secretary to prepare briefing room seven for the General's arrival.  He asked Treodon if he had ever heard of the General.<br>\r\n\tTreodon shook his head, opened his case and removed a long, jagged, curved blade.  He smiled wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNyle ignored the Major and asked Topa the same question.  The lieutenant also shook his head.  \"I want you to contact New Era, Buck.  Demand to know the General's orders.\"<br>\r\n\tBuck stared at the vicious weapon in Treodon's hands.  \"I'll contact Assistant Director Ehogan.  It will take two days to reach him and two more days for a response.  You can't stall the General for that long.\"  Buck faced Nyle.  \"It may be nothing at all, Colonel.\"<br>\r\n\t\"Send the message anyway,\"  ordered Nyle, \"if he is my replacement, I want to be prepared.\"<br>\r\n\tBuck nodded and dispatched the message from the communications console.  \"We should have a response in about four days, Governor.\"  He walked back to the window and watched the Network darter approach.  How had the General gotten on the island?  The question slipped into his mind with the suddenness of a tornado.  The island's magnetic screen prevented beaming and the incoming and outgoing traffic of the island was closely regulated.  An unscheduled craft approaching the island would be detected and halted.  The General had to have made arrangements with someone to gain admittance on the island.  Whoever that someone was should have informed Nyle.  Buck leaned next to Nyle and was about to mention it when Topa caught his attention.<br>\r\n\tThe Lieutenant was attaching straps to the prisoner's chair's armrests - he was attaching straps to an empty chair.  Buck's heart shot into his throat and he bolted upright, his eyes furiously scanning the room.  <br>\r\n\tSayer Ersk was gone. <br>\r\nWC 863 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

He attempted to stand, but a hand seized the back of his hair and smashed his face into the floor.  His nose shattered and darkness engulfed him.<br>\r\n\tSayer dragged the soldier by his feet into a supply locker.  His hands shook as he removed the unconscious man's uniform.  He had never struck another man in his life, and now that he had, he found the sensation both exhilarating and repulsive.  <br>\r\n\tThe stolen Network uniform fit well.  Sayer bound the soldier with his discarded clothing and hid him at the back of the locker.  Fatigue was closing in around him and he dropped to one knee to catch his breath.<br>\r\n\tHis escape had surprised him.  He couldn't even remember making a conscious decision to walk out the office.  Buck and Nyle had forgotten him, their attentions absorbed with something out the window.  Before Sayer knew what he was doing, he was hurrying down the hall outside Nyle's office.  Kirton had passed him in the hallway, but the Captain appeared to be preoccupied with his own thoughts and Sayer went by unnoticed.<br>\r\n\t  Sayer felt stronger and stepped back into the hall and quickly walked toward the stairwell doors.<br>\r\n\tA sign to his left caught his attention -  \"Environmental Control Room\".  He dashed into the room and a young soldier turned at his entrance.<br>\r\n\t\"Activate fire suppression for the Governor's office!\"  shouted Sayer.<br>\r\n\tThe young soldier's eyes widened.  \"There's a fire!\"<br>\r\n\t\"Hurry up!  It's spreading!\"  Sayer bolted toward the controls.  \"You'd better activate the suppression system for all of the adjoining rooms, just to be safe.  Hurry!\"<br>\r\n\tThe soldier's hands started pushing buttons and entering codes.  <br>\r\n\t\"Do you smell smoke?\"  asked Sayer as he exited the room and flew down the stairwell.<br>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tBuck moved away from Nyle and stared out the window.  A smile creased his lips.  Sayer escaped!  He hoped he would never see him again.  <br>\r\n\t\"The interrogation will have wait until after I meet with General Rouchet,\"  stated Nyle, looking at his chronometer.  \"Bring the prisoner back to his cell.\"<br>\r\n\tBuck winced.<br>\r\n\t\"Sayer is not here!\"  Treodon anxiously surveyed the room.<br>\r\n\t\"What?  He was here!\"  Nyle joined the Major in his visual search.<br>\r\n\tBuck turned to Nyle, disgust filling his heart.  \"He must have walked out.  I'll look for him.\"  <br>\r\n\t\"You have to alert the base, Governor!  Ersk must not escape!\"   Kirton was frantic.<br>\r\n\t\"No.  Not with the General here.  Topa, Buck, and Treodon, I want you find him.  Kirton alert the guards in the front lobby,\"  demanded Nyle.<br>\r\n\tBuck followed the Major and Topa out the office.  The chances of Sayer escaping seemed hopeless.  He would never make it out the building.<br>\r\n\tThe foam injectors in the hall fired, spraying high pressured froth everywhere.  The floor turned slick and Buck went down on his buttocks.  The fall was painful but Buck couldn't help laughing.  Sayer was indeed a man of surprises.  <br>\r\n\tTopa and Treodon managed to stay on their feet as they rushed down the hall.  Buck lifted himself to his feet as Captain Kirton barrelled out Nyle's office.<br>\r\n\t\"The communications system is off-line!  I have to contact the guards in the lobby!  Sayer must not escape.\"  Kirton sounded like a lunatic as he slid uncontrollably toward Buck.<br>\r\n\tBuck grabbed the blathering Captain by the front of his jacket and flung him down the hall.  The Captain was airborne for several seconds, then landed hard on his back and skidded across the foam.  He slid into the running Treodon and the Major toppled onto him.  <br>\r\n\t Buck smiled as he watched the two men flounder over each other.   Topa started to turn back to help, but Treodon waved him forward and shouted at him to find Ersk.  The Lieutenant nodded and trudged around a corner.  <br>\r\n\tNyle slowly stepped from his office and stared at Buck.  Globs of foam caked the Colonel's bald head.  Buck shrugged and  <br>\r\nfollowed Topa.   <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nWC 666 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n\t</span></div></div>",

He had eight floors to descend, and by the time he had reached the fourth floor his body protested with waves of pain.  He stumbled to the third floor and collapsed on the stair's landing.  The hard metal floor cooled his fiery skin, sending chills along the base of his neck.<br>\r\n\tThe past two weeks of beatings had taken their toll on Sayer, leaving his body unresponsive and feeble.  His breath came in small gasps and his lungs ached for oxygen.  The wounds to his face cracked and oozed blood.<br>\r\n\tThe sound of a door opening several floors above Sayer echoed down the stairwell.  He violently forced himself to his feet and glanced upward as the sound of boots crashing down the stairs filled his ears.  The footfalls approached rapidly and terror rose in Sayer's heart.<br>\r\n\tHe raced toward the second floor's landing and felt his knees buckle from exhaustion halfway down the stairs.  He tumbled down the stairs, bruising flesh and opening wounds, and plowed into the landing like a fallen meteor.  He painfully rolled onto his back and gazed upward.  His pursuer was one floor above and approaching at breakneck speed.  <br>\r\n\tSayer frantically crawled for the door leading into the second floor's hallway.  He could feel the blood flowing across his shins as he lifted himself next to the door and grasped the handle.<br>\r\n\tThe landing rocked as Topa's massive frame dropped into view.  A sheen of sweat covered his forehead and his bushy beard had trapped globs of white foam.  A smile of stained teeth appeared from beneath his beard.<br>\r\n\tSayer dove at the huge man.  Rage crushed all reason.  The hatred for Topa filled his being and gave his body an unexpected surge of strength.  The palm of Sayer's hand smashed against  Topa's forehead, driving the big man's head into the wall.   Sayer's knees slammed into Topa's chest and drove the big man downward, dragging his head along the wall.  A howl escaped from Sayer's lips as he pushed the Lieutenant toward the floor.<br>\r\n\tTopa's head came to a jarring halt and his body went limp.  Sayer's momentum hurled him over Topa and onto the ascending stairs.  He twisted around quickly, anticipating a counterattack.  There was none.<br>\r\n\tThe blunt end of the handrail had driven itself into the back of Topa's skull.  The huge man's stained teeth still smiled at Sayer from beneath a pair of lifeless eyes.<br>\r\n\tSayer rose to his feet mechanically as he stared at the dead man's eyes.  He heard himself laugh, a strange crazed laugh.  An invidious coldness stole over his body and he fell into a void of darkness as tears replaced the laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNyle buttoned his jacket as he met Buck in the hallway outside of the Governor's quarters.  He had changed his uniform and was rushing to the elevator.<br>\r\n\tBuck matched the Colonel's pace and tried to recoup his breath.  The scene in the stairwell still had him shaken and he was not looking forward to breaking the news to Nyle.  He remained silent until they had entered the elevator.<br>\r\n\t\"Well, we found Sayer.\"  It was best to start on a good note.<br>\r\n\tNyle nodded.  \"Good.  Where's the General?\"<br>\r\n\t\"I don't know.\"  With all that had happened, Buck had forgotten about Rouchet.  \"Topa is dead.\"<br>\r\n\tThe elevator rocked to a stop as Nyle jabbed the halt button.  \"He's dead?  How?\"<br>\r\n\t\"I'm not sure.  I found Topa and Sayer on the second floor stairwell.  Topa's head had been impaled by the handrail.\"<br>\r\n\t\"Sayer killed him?  That's hard to believe.\"  <br>\r\n\t\"I know, but right now it's the only explanation.  From the angle of the injury, there is no way he could have fallen.\"<br>\r\n\tNyle chewed on his bottom lip.  \"Where's Sayer?\"<br>\r\n\t\"He's in the infirmary.  I found him not far from Topa's body curled into a ball and weeping.  He was totally incoherent.  The doctor believes he's in shock.\"  The thought of Sayer caused waves of guilt to wash over Buck.  It was all his fault.<br>\r\n\t\"Have you told Treodon?\"  asked Nyle as he restarted the elevator.<br>\r\n\t\"No.  He's going to want blood.\"   <br>\r\n\t\"He'll have it - after I get the information.\"<br>\r\n\tBuck pushed the halt button.  \"Nyle, we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n\tThe Governor looked at his chronometer and sighed.<br>\r\n\tBuck ignored him.  \"I am very uncomfortable with this whole situation.  Sayer is a civilian.  Can't we get the information from him and then let him go?\"<br>\r\n\tNyle shook his head.  \"That is not procedure and you know it.\"<br>\r\n\t\"I feel responsible for Sayer.  I brought him here and I don't want his death on my conscience.\"<br>\r\n\tThe veins in Nyle's neck bulged.  \"Then you can relieve yourself of this assignment any time you feel like it.  I do not want to hear another word about this.  If you can't do your job, I'll find someone else.\"  Nyle jabbed the resume button and the elevator continued.<br>\r\n\tBuck's jaw tightened.  The fires of his temper stirred.  \"I thought the objective of this whole war was to unite the Hunter race, not to exterminate them.  Killing Sayer makes us no better than Galen.\"<br>\r\n\t\"In every war, Mister DeMara, sacrifices have to be made and prices have to be paid.  Sayer Ersk's death will be one of those sacrifices and your guilt will be one of those prices.  I did not force you to take an oath of loyalty and no one forced you to kidnap Ersk.  You chose to do both on your own.  Now deal with it.\"<br>\r\n\tThe elevator stopped and the doors opened.  Nyle stepped into the hall and turned to face Buck.  Every muscle in Buck's body was rigid and his temper was like an inferno.  <br>\r\n\t\"I wish I could let Sayer live, Buck,\"  stated Nyle in a softer tone, \"but I can't.  Especially not after he killed Lieutenant Topa.  I understand how you feel, but Sayer's path is unalterable.\"<br>\r\n\tBuck's temper fell away and he lowered his head.  \"I know.  It just doesn't seem right.  I feel as much a prisoner as Sayer.  A prisoner to my oath to you and a prisoner to my decisions.  I just wanted to let you know how I feel.\"<br>\r\n\tNyle placed his hand on Buck's shoulder.  \"I owe you a lot and I'm sorry I can't help you.\"  Nyle quickly lowered his hand to his side and stiffened.  \"But I do expect you to follow my orders and remain true to your oath.  I know I can count on you.\"<br>\r\n\t\"Yes, sir.\"  Buck felt a strange emptiness in his chest.<br>\r\n\t\"Go change your clothing, Buck, and meet me in briefing room seven.  The General is waiting.  I just hope Kirton and Treodon remember to change their uniforms.\"  Nyle smiled and disappeared behind the closing elevator doors.<br>\r\n\tConfusion whirled like a cyclone in Buck's mind, scattering his thoughts like dry leaves.  What was he to do?  He was being pulled apart by his loyalty to Nyle and his responsibilty to Sayer.  Walk away, he told himself, just walk away.  He closed his eyes and wished he had never laid eyes on either Nyle or Sayer.  <br>\r\n\tHis thoughts drifted and faces flashed in his mind.  Arc rallied his troops against the Green Oppression.  Galen and Karstagg basked in the glory of their alliance.  Nyle demanded an oath of loyalty.  Treodon smiled wickedly behind a menancing knife.  Kirton slid across a layer of foam.  Topa grinned stupidly with a handrail digging into his brains.  Sayer wept in a stairwell.  Desna kicked him in the groin.<br>\r\n\tDesna!<br>\r\n\tThe face of the red haired little girl froze in Buck's mind and the confusion shattered like a pane of glass.  How could he ever tell Desna that her father was dead?  He couldn't and he wouldn't.  Somehow, he told himself, he would save Sayer Ersk.<br>\r\n                                                      <br>\r\nWC 1307 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

I have been murdered by a cowardly assassin after being named as King.  I am so pleased to see my mother after the many years on earth without her prescence and with my just discovered father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father had named me as King on his deathbed.  I had never known I was his son and heir.  I was King for less than a day before those who killed my father also killed me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now I stand in a place with no name and no limits.  There are no parallels with the mundane and heavy earth I have come from.  Here, in what I am calling Afterlife, existence is unique. There are no houses, cities or civilizations. I am at a loss for words to describe the joy and relaxed nature of Afterlife.  I am happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the happiness is tainted by the circumstances of my death and the anger of my father. According to him, we can still affect the world now lost to me.  After our joyous discovery and reunion, my father explained to me that it was possible for us to regain the throne and... life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a wonder and pleasure to finally be able to acknowledge you, my son.  I am saddened and overjoyed that we are finally together.  I can not allow the villains who orchestrated, not only my death, but yours as well cannot be ignored.  We must avenge our deaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother has informed me that their are mechanisms and rituals available to us allowing us to access to our former world.  The throne is still in our reach and we shall reclaim it from those who usurped it with blood and deceit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need your agreement, my son. Do you want to avenge and sit upon the throne you were denied?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my joy of the Afterlife, there is an pained emptiness in my soul at the manner I was dispatched from my former life.  The thought of leaving this world hurts me almost physically but I know I must join my father in his quest for vengence.  \"Yes father.

My father and I have come to a place surrounded by pink fluffy clouds and penguins with pointy sticks.  I was told that the Being in charge of Return to the Earth request \"lives\" here and that our case must be made.  When my my father had said rituals, I had assumed killing a goat or a duck in sacrifice and burning some candles bit I was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis ritual involves the meeting of the Being of Earthly Returns.  I ask my father what is his name and my father only shrugs and repeats, \u201cThe Being of Earthly Returns.\u201d  To me it sounds like an administrator of the Iron Bank but who am I to judge the ways of the afterlife.  I am a mere newly arrived soul looking to return to claim my throne.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find it odd to think of the throne as mine. It is a seat I have never sat upon and a mantle I have never commanded.  All the same I feel it is my right, no - my birthright.  So I am claiming my birthright from the darkness of death so that I may rule and avenge all those who plotted against me and my father!  So many will pay the price.  If my power allows I may go as far as exacting revenge on the families of the usurpers.  Kill them all and so none shall ever hurt me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ask father if he would like me to talk to the Being of Earthly Returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not certain, son.  I have no idea what to expect of this proceeding.  I only learned of it shortly before your death from a Being of Information and Orientation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wrinkle my nose.  \u201cThere certainly are a lot of \u201cBeings\u201d about with odd distinctions and realms of command.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father nods.  \u201cI agree, but it is the methodology provided.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father and I wait for some time in the area of the pink fluffy clouds with the penguin with the pointy sticks.  I bend down in front of one of the penguins and smile.  \u2018Hello, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe penguin\u2019s left eye twitches.  \u201cOy Ho, fine being.  Do you require something of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I reply, \u201cDo you know anything about this Being of Early Returns?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYessir, I do.\u201d The eye twitches violently. \u201cThe Being of Earthly Returns decides on who may or may not return to the realm know as Earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my!  So there are more realms than just Earth?\u201d  I look at my father. \u201cHow exciting!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father just harrumphs and delivers a look that says, \u201cLeave the penguin with the pointy stick alone\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignore the look that says, \u201cLeave the penguin with the pointy stick alone\u201d and continue in the stimulating engagement. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe penguin with the pointy stick twitches his eye some more. \u201cI am known as The Twitchy-Eyed Penguin Being with a Pointy Stick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and raise an eyebrow.  I pick another penguin with a pointy stick at random and ask him what the name of that penguin with a pointy stick might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twitchy eye of The Twitchy-Eyed Penguin Being with a Pointy Stick sends a twitchy glance at the penguin with the pointy stick that I have pointed out.  \u201cThat would be The Dull Yellow Billed Penguin Being with a Slightly Dull Pointy Stick,\u201d says The Twitchy-Eyed Penguin Being with a Pointy Stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI point at another a penguin with a pointy stick in distant. \u201cAnd him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twitchy-Eyed Penguin Being with a Pointy Stick glances a hard twitchy stare and the nods.  \u201cThat is The Blue-eyed, Buck-toothed Penguin Being with an Extremely Pointy Stick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pick another penguin being but a strange summoning ding formed in my mind that beckoned me to a place beyoung the pink clouds.  \u201cNice to meet you,Twitchy-Eyed Penguin Being with a Pointy Stick.  I must be going now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d says The Twitchy-Eyed Penguin Being with a Pointy Stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father and I leave the area and enter a new area made completely of golden clouds and sparkles.  It is quite amazing and beautiful, and seated in a grand oaken chair laced with streaks of glowing blue illumination is The Being of Earthly Returns. It - for I cannot tell if it is male or female - glows a brilliant blue and is human-shaped.  I can feel the warmth coming off of it.  It reminds me the wonderful comfort of sitting in front of the hearth after coming in from the chill.  I cannot see its eyes but I can feel the glare of them upon me.  In my mind, I feel the beckoning again.  I come forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father, without a word, turns and leaves the area.  I watch him go only for the briefest of moments and then I immediately return my attention to The Being of Earthly Returns.  I walk forward and stop when the desire to do so overtakes me like a chill.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU WISH TO RETURN TO YOUR EARTHLY ORIGINS.  I SENSE IN YOU A DARKNESS AND EVIL INTENT.  REQUEST DENIED.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scream in protest but then my mind is settled and I accept The Being of Earthly Returns decision. I realize instantly that my intent was impure and fueled by Earthly desires.  I needed to see that my life was over on Earth and that this new life could not be directed by my past.  I lost all interest in ever returning.  I no longer wanted the throne.  My new life - my new future - is what I need.  Perhaps I be friends with the Penguin Beings with the pointy sticks.  There is a whole realm here to explore and discover.  I remember the excitement of my conversation with The Twitchy-Eyed Penguin Being with a Pointy Stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I return to my father and we never speak of Earth or thrones again.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sir Nigel Gray bore the weight of the newly crowned King and strode across the dark gray cobblestones of the palace.  His mind was a jumble of thoughts and choices.  The burden of protecting the new King was at conflict with his shame of failing to protect the former King.  How long had he served only to have it all taken away - stripped like a slab of cut meat by a sneaky, ass-licking assassin.  The life of the King he had protected had defined Nigel since the day he put on a King's Guard cloak, and now that was a steamy pile of donkey shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had to shove that down and face his new responsibility of this young man\u2019s life.  It was hard for Nigel to think of this man as King.  The King was now dead.  This man was named his successor but he had no idea who this man was.  He had never heard of Tyrl Keravin.  As far as he knew he had never visited the King nor had the King ever had any dealings with him.  This was an utter shock to all and especially to those close to the King.  But he had to protect this man whether he was worthy of the title or not.  The worth of the man didn\u2019t play into the duty of Nigel\u2019s life.  His only job now was to keep the new King alive and hope he was worth the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNigel chose the servant\u2019s quarters as a temporary safe house for his new charge.  He chose this simply as the least likely place anyone looking to do him harm would come looking.  He gently laid laid the King into the rickety bed with the threadbare sheets and flat pillow and pulled a chair next to the bed.  He gently covered the King with the thread bare blanket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared into his new King\u2019s face, searching for any sign of what kind of King he would be.  Nigel liked the face that he saw: handsome, kind and innocent.  He realized this man would need more than mere protection to be a good King - he was also going to need loyal counsel.  Nigel gently patted the sleeping King\u2019s shoulder - an act he knew was inappropriate for a Guard to do - but he felt an urge to connect with this man.  He needed the King Tyrl Keravin to be a living breathing soul that Nigel would be willing to die for.  He lowered himself into the chair beside the bed and rested his broadsword across his lap and held a dagger in his hand.  Whoever came for the King had better be prepared to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours passed before the King came awake.  He jolted upright in the bed and vomited on the floor opposite of where Nigel kept his vigil. The King\u2019s eyes met Nigel\u2019s.  Fear and uncertainty danced in his green eyes.  Nigel raised his hand to calm the King when the door to the quarters opened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muscular figure in a castle guard\u2019s uniform stepped into the room.  Nigel immediately put himself between the stranger and his King.  He smiled inside at the HIS King protectiveness that sprung to life. \u201cThis is no place for you, guard. Leave now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular guard moved his head to the left and the right to see behind Nigel. \u201cWe are doing a room to room search for the King.  Who do we have here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNigel, dagger in one hand and the broadsword in the other, stared into the guard\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow can you look for someone if you do not know what they look like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d The guard stepped away from the closed door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave now.  I will not ask again,\u201d Nigel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is our new King?\u201d the guard stated. \u201cOur King is a nobody cowering in servant\u2019s bed, hiding from his new crown.  This is rich.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dagger left Nigel\u2019s hand without warning or sound.  It shot across the room aimed for the guard\u2019s throat.  Moments before impact, the guard\u2019s sword arc upward and deflected the dagger.  It clattered to the floor.  Nigel dropped into a defensive stance while the King rose to his knees on the rickety bed.  The attacking guard pointed his sword at Nigel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurely you can see this King is a mistake,\u201d the guard stated, moving sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNigel tracked the guard but didn\u2019t move.  \u201cThe only mistake I see is the one you have just made by threatening my King\u2019s life.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sword swung in a vicious swipe for Nigel\u2019s neck.  He jerked out of its fatal arc and his own blade came up and deflected the strike toward the ground.  He used this moment to close the distance with guard.  Nigel struck for his opponent\u2019s leg but he evaded.  A crushing blow slammed into Nigel\u2019s jaw.  His face felt like it exploded and he dropped to one knee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard was of a single intent as he body slammed into Nigel, knocking the King\u2019s guard across the floor, and moving toward the King.  The assassin\u2019s blade swiped at the King\u2019s head but the attack was interrupted.  Nigel grabbed the guard from behind and crushed his arms and chest with all of his might.  The air shot of the assassin\u2019s mouth and he grunted and struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKLONG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard slumped into Nigels\u2019 arms.  A huge cook pot covered his head as the King stood upon the bed with his hands still holding the pot\u2019s handle. Nigel released the attacked and man and pot crashed to the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNigel and the King\u2019s eyes met.  Nigel was filled with hope.  This King would be very worthy.  \u201cNicely done, majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King nodded, breathing heavily.  \u201cAssassin?  Majesty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNigel smirked. \u201cAt least one of them.  And you are my King, sire.  The crown is yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it looks like this filth got a crowning before I did, Captain,\u201d the King replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my King.  It certainly appears that way.  But I think it best if we get more guards and find a safe place for you to wear your new crown.\u201d  Nigel smiled and bowed to the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 1,024 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

Before I never thought much of them when I lived in my quiet home, but even though many men offer their hands to me in friendship, I can't readily accept them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe His Majesty knew about their plotting for his throne all along. It might have been what prompted him to choose a nobody like myself. I cast an uncomfortable glance about the candlelit room and pulled the cloak on tighter. Now that I am alone, or at least very nearly so, I don't know what to do with myself. The guards failed to protect the king before. It might happen again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy musings are interrupted when a candle sputters and the lacy shadows dance along the pale cream walls around me and my back stiffens. I should be sleeping, but I can't. Every time the movements occur I remember all the whispers about the assassination, and just how deep a wound spelled His Majesty's demise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft whisper drew my attention about again, this time over my shoulder where I thought it originated from. Nothing. I remember that the assassination took place at midnight, and I note that it cannot be far from that time now. Should I call my guards, or could one of them be responsible? I don't even know what an assassin looks like, but does anyone? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand and begin to pace the length of my room. I got this position whether I wanted it or not. I should do something about this mess. Hunt down the assassin so I could at least live without terror. As I move, a flicker passes in the black window and I hesitate. Part of me wants to rush over to the window to make sure the motion was only me, but my sensible side stops me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the guards' metal shod feet clank against the floor with monotonous rhythm as they walk a short distance away from my door. I tighten my fingers into fists until my nails pierce my palms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when my candles sputtered and died, choking on the overflow of wax. I stumble in the middle of my strides and my heart throbs with awful strength against my ribs. My eyes struggle to adjust as I grope towards the candles. A breath of wind passes softly against my cheek and I jerk aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething moves in the dark, I am sure of it. I reach for the dagger I use for eating. As a weapon it would do little good, but it has to be better than fighting a shadow with my fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if I cannot really see, movement still swishes nearby. Some of the patches of blackness stir unnaturally and I can feel the presence lingering nearby. My fingers clench over the warm wax of a candle and I jerk it towards myself with a rustle of my kingly robe. As I fumble with it, I manage to catch just enough of my breath to form words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards!\" I call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft brush of some cloth rushes alongside my face and an unknown object crinkles as the guards fumble with the handle of the door. Although I cannot be sure, I am sure that the assassin has left me even before the door opens. The raw orange torchlight sweeps across the room as the guard strides in, his unfriendly face cast in the copper glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty?\" He asks, doubtful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy claim as King is already under much scrutiny and I don't need any more trouble. \"Please, relight these candles,\" I manage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe complies with some care, sets the flickering objects back on my desk, and heads back out at my bidding. My whole body shakes and I brace myself on the desk before me. That is when I notice the note left behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count: 643 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The more I thought about it, the more I felt the power of the manteau on my shoulders. How dare they! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy pride was hurt although I knew any pride to self-delusion. While I was a red fish passively observing life from the inside of a fishbowl, how ironic was that, the timid person, a mama's boy, to be exact, would crack the the glass and be lured out into the freedom of a wide, wild ocean, to be made a king to it. I felt like Poseidon now, and not the shabby-looking ineffectual character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Poseidon I was when I called for the guards. Forstrone, the chief of the guards,  rushed in wirh two armor-clad knights following him. I held the note to his note. \u201cWho put this on my table? Weren\u2019t you around watching this room?\u201d I roared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly who was allowed, Your Majesty,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou know we have a list of people drawn by the old king, May his soul rest in peace, and we only let them in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring me a copy of that list and alert the head investigator. I want this person, who wrote this note and put it here under my nose, brought to me so I can deal with him with the proper justice that he deserves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Your Majesty,\u201d Forstrone bowed and walked backwards to exit the throne room with the two knights at his heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he left, I sunk to deep thought. This character who was out to get me through his lies and sneaky trappings evoked my curiosity. Why would anyone partake, through such a serious nature of lies, in such a personal intrusion to my welfare or rather the welfare of the kingdom? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had to be someone close to the deceased king who had his very eyes on this throne on which I was sitting. The throne wasn\u2019t even a comfortable one. With all the gilded fancy work adorning it, the workers had omitted the seat. No wonder the old king had a faulty gait. Once I would solve the puzzle of the note, I decided to do something about this seat. After all, no king should feel resentment against his throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Majesty, Chief Guard Forstrone requests your counsel,\u201d the guard at the door announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSend him in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Forstrone appeared I crooked my finger for him to approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForstrone walked in front of me and bowed. Then he handed me a scroll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe list you asked for, Your Majesty,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said calmly. \u201cYou are entitled to five gold pieces for your promptness. Now, tell me, who do you think on this list wanted the throne after the old king?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Your Majesty,\u201d said Forstrone, with an embarrassed chuckle. \u201cI think everyone on that list did. All of them are suspect.\u201d And then with a note of appreciation in his voice, he added, \u201cOnly you, Your Majesty, were seen fit above and beyond those in the list. I have heard the deceased king refer to Your Majesty as a first-rate person, and I am always faithful to my kings, as I now pledge my loyalty to you, Sir, that I will do my utmost to bring the culprit to justice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe? A first-rate person? Never underestimate the value of a few gold piece to buy loyalty, but I knew what I was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Forstrone,\u201d I said. \u201cYou may go, now, and do the best you can for this matter. Please!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForstrone backed up as he bowed. I barely heard him remark at the door, \u201cA king who says please\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I glanced at the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n642 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All the names of the members of the Council for the Realm, were glaring at me, the poor-boy king, who felt he had no business being where he is. All he had wanted to live a simple life and play his banjo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that wasn\u2019t meant to be. I had to suffer through this ordeal, and my existence from this day on would be all about endurance. All my inner peace disturbed I sent for the chief investigator, Achenay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived without delay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYour Majesty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI handed him the list. \u201cIn this list are the names of people who are out to assassinate me just like the king before. Find out who, and I will see to it that he gets his just punishment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Sir,\u201d he said, \u201cI can\u2019t do that. Our kingdom is a small kingdom like many. These people are working under the supervision of the Realm Master. We don\u2019t even clearance to their files.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen find a way. Any way,\u201d I said, the future of our kingdom depends on it. Obviously, one of the Council members wants to incorporate us into his kingdom. This doesn\u2019t concern my life anymore. If you don\u2019t do this, our kingdom will be no more, and our people will be used a slaves by the larger kingdom. Do you want this, Achenay, for your family, your mother, your sisters, your sons, your neighbors?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me, Your Majesty, surely you\u2019re right; however, I don\u2019t know how to go about this as I said we have no clearance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAchenay, this person must be absolutely, positively destroyed, brought to justice, whatever. We cannot put this kingdom at risk. For that end, I am willing to put my life on the line. But are you willing to put yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchenay bowed. \u201cDefinitely, Your Majesty,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I am nothing else in my life, I\u2019m loyal to my country and my friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped down the throne and stretched my hand to him. \u201cThen, consider me your friend, Achenay. I will protect you if your efforts come to negative ends or if you are ever found out by the Council.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m truly honored, Your Majesty,\u201d said Achenay, taking my hand and shaking it vigorously. \u201cAs long as we watch each other\u2019s backs, we won\u2019t be ruined.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if nothing else works, we will have done the best for this kingdom, at least we will say we tried it.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that I got Achenay on my side it was up to the history to write itself. The soldiers would fight, yes, but they would be protecting the kingdom, and those battles probably wouldn\u2019t even be fought for years to come, again, if we established our power. It was a good decision I made to convince Achenay and he made a good decision to accept my proposal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur tiny decisions that could make or break us. Thousands and thousands of lives were always changed by tiny decision. And those changed lives would go onward to affect the rest of the realm and even the rest of the universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with myself, I climbed up to sit at the throne with that terribly hard seat.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a restless night of little sleep and vivid dreams of daggers and shadows, I awoke to a gray, misty day. I knew exactly the person to do my spying for me; someone I had used many times in the past with great results. My fool. No one would suspect my fool, because, rightly, most people thought she was an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, you ask? Yes, she. The village idiot, they said, never amount for anything but milking cows or breeding other idiots with a shepherd. Her real name is Calliope Canters, but everyone at the castle calls her \"Dum Dum\" or \"hey you\" or \"Fool\". She and I prefer it that way. Callie is still young, but wise beyond her years. An unfortunate birthing accident with a pair of delivery tongs by a sodden butcher of a doctor, and Callie was born before her time with a misshapen head and as short as a five year old, although she is probably twenty by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother was going to sell her for a new pig. I heard about it from my man about town and carriage driver, Donovan, an Irishman by birth, and the only person I really trusted in my castle besides my dogs. Donovan has a soft heart although he tends to cover it up with peppery language and a brusk manner. He was walking by the market square and saw poor ten year old Callie tied to a fence post with a misspelled sign announcing: Good for keeping house-mute girl-sold for a fine pig or best price. When Donovan saw her, his heart flipped. Despite her funny big head and tiny body, she had flaming red hair and eyes as green as Irish sod. She resembled his youngest sister, far away in the Emerald Isle. So he bought her, thinking she would be good help mate for his ailing wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Callie was, though, was a sack of bones and skin, who didn't have enough energy to milk a cat, never mind a cow. Donovan's wife didn't have the heart to through the little mite out, even though she hadn't spoken a word. So, he made up a fine Irish yarn about how smart she was and how clever and told his best friend, the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I met Callie, she had clean hair, shorn close to her head to get rid of the lice she had come with, a plain brown shift, good shoes on her feet, and hope in her eyes. I decided to make her my fool, since she was tiny and odd looking. But she couldn't make me laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, I found myself watching her go about the light chores I asked her to do. She reminded me a stray dog I once adopted, who ended up being the county champion sheep herder during the trials. She always did what I asked, and sometimes did what I asked before I opened my mouth. I think she was watching me as much as I was watching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a year of the two of us watching each other, Callie found her way into my study. I was trying to figure out what to do in the case of Widow Sandal, who had a mouth on her like a viper and a mean spirit. Widow Sandal was claiming the land next door as hers, because the new owners had never made proper use of the land, but let it go to meadow. She was insisting it was hers because the law of the land was such that all lands needed to be made useful for crops, or for recreation. Widow Sandal had beans she was waiting to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie heard me muttering to myself. She wiggled up into the high chair next to me and adjusted her long green gown. Callie made all her own clothes from the fine fabrics I had picked out to match her coloring. This one managed to make her look older and taller than she really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple,\" she said, in a clear, crystalline voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost fell off my throne. \"You can talk?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can speak. In fact, I know three languages. It is interesting what a girl can pick up in a bawdy house,\" she replied, a grin on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed to think of my fool in a house of ill repute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donovan didn't tell me that was your last employer. I thought,..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire, I am as virginal as the new snow outside. Why do you think the old bag was trying to sell me for a pig? No one would want to bed a girl as small as their daughter. Unless of course,\" she  answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, let's not think about such disgusting types of people. I didn't know you had an education. I thought you were just..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire, my father was a wandering teacher, a magician of sorts. He wanted to take me with him on his travels, but his horse came lame, and bandits waylaid him on the way to get me. He was killed in a sword fight. I hid his collection of books from my mother so she could not use them for firewood or to sell for more food or trinkets. I have knowledge of the stars, the medicinal herbs and the law. I even know what your courtiers are saying behind your royal back. Would you like to know?\" Callie had a full grin now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fool, you should have told your king as soon as you were comfortable here all this. I have wasted a year trying to figure out what that scoundrel Sir Lackjaw has been saying. Speak, girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fool, Callie, looked straight in my eyes and said: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nword count: 959 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa House Martell<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/view/456789\" title=\"House Martell  [#2039497]\nHouse Martell image for G.o.T.\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/trans.gif\" title=\"House Martell  [#2039497]\nHouse Martell image for G.o.T.\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" id=\"protectWMLImg1\"><img onmouseover=\"protectMe(this, 'protectWMLImg1');\" title=\"House Martell  [#2039497]\nHouse Martell image for G.o.T.\" alt=\"House Martell image for G.o.T.\" src=\"https://www.writing.com/main/images/action/display/ver/1466099729/item_id/2039497.jpg\" width=\"100\" border=\"0\" height=\"100\"></a> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I need someone's advice, and I don't know who I should dare trust or if I dare. But as the danger is already gone and only left me this threat, I take it to mean that they are not going to come back yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't understand why anyone would think I could bribe, but think it they do. I cast a longing glance at my bed and draw a deep breath into my lungs. Sleep would be nice, but now is not a good time. I fold the creased parchment in thirds and pull the unwanted mantle of my new status tighter around my shoulders. I head towards the door. The hinges let out a muted squeal and nearby armour clinks as the guards lean out to check what is going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have urgent business to attend,\" I say as I ease the door closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards exchange curious glances, then nod. I grasp one of the torches and turn aside. Maybe this will inspire a touch more faith in me, though I am grateful for the darkness. It hides the fact that my knees still feel like water and my jaw clenches against my will. As long as they can't see it, I seem like I'm stronger than I am. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my brief tour of the castle during daylight hours, I had observed the presence of a fantastic library. The man caring for it is elderly, and somehow doesn't seem like as much of a threat as the younger courtiers nearby. The Elder Scroller. Perhaps he will be willing to lend his counsel to me, or at least offer some insight on the letter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fingers that aren't curled around the splintery torch curl into such a tight fist I can feel my blunt fingernails digging into my palm. I would never bribe anyone, and I couldn't have. My very purpose for being at the castle was to ask for financial assistance. I hesitate. Did they think I had something else to bribe a king with, or perhaps the man that brought me the cloak in the first place? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remind myself it doesn't matter, because they still think the same of me, and hurry onwards. The far side of the castle is still in eerie silence, save the soft clanks of armour and the murmured voices of guards somewhere down the hall. Two of these guards stand erect in front of the library door and bend their knees at the sight of me. I slip past them without pause. I don't have time to be stalled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before I can begin my search of the Scroller, a whisper of sound catches my attention. I look back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire,\" the old, creaky voice makes me jump. \"What brings you at such a late hour?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI compose myself and loosen the death grip I have on the torch so the wood no longer set into my flesh. Though I promised myself I would try to be less obtrusive, I can't help but cast a surreptitious glance about the room. Just in case. In the feeble shadows I see nothing that stands out as dangerous, and return my gaze to the withered old man before me. His crouched posture, dull, ink stained jacket, and quizzical green eyes I take in with a quick look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" He asks more directly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so,\" I say. \"You are sure you don't know why His Majesty chose me to succeed him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fancy his eyes narrow at the question. \"Yes, Sire, quite sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps,\" I somehow manage to keep my voice steady, \"you could tell me more about this assassin's habits... and I'm in some need of suggestions. How can I show that I deserve this power?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(word count: 647) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Maybe I can't answer your question directly, but you might find what you're seeking in there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy doubts are not so sure, but I follow him anyway. The mantle of royalty seems to weigh more than ever before on my shoulders, and I try to straighten my back. It does not help. The weight is still there. The message's burning warning still flashes through my mind in warning. I shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor such a bent man, the Elder Scroller moves with surprising agility as he thumbs through parchments soft and wrinkled with age. I fancy some of them are older than he is, but it must be a close match if they are. At last he eases one scroll free of a pyramid of others. The stack trembles, but somehow contrives to stay upright. This rolled parchment he holds out to me in one claw-like hand. I take it with some misgivings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might hold your answers, Your Majesty,\" he tells me. \"How you can prove yourself, and why you were chosen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scroll in question is so wrinkled and yellowed with age that I find it difficult to comprehend how it could have anything to do with me. I'm a young man yet, though this job seems to age me by the minute and I haven't even survived a week. But he stares at me with such urgency that I sigh and unwind the parchments from their fastenings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the delicate rustle sends a nervous spike down my back, but I shove it away. The fading ink is so pale on the parchment's surface that it appears more brown than black, and in some places ancient stains mar the otherwise undamaged scroll. I squint in the feeble torchlight, but I can only make out a few words. Tyrl. My name? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light adjusts as the Scroller walks about behind me and holds it aloft. Thanks to this, I can make out the beginnings of a legend I have never heard of before, but too many words are blotted. A cold claw wants to rake through me. I take a deep breath and hold it higher so the orange luminescence brings them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a letter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A new king was born in the wake of the old one's demise. The gods choose one who is below all the others, someone who was not born great, but learned how to be great instead. Tyrants are not respected, they are feared. Assassins are not loved, but hated...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words are too rubbed out for me to make out more. It tells me nothing. I have no greatness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand,\" I say in frustration. \"How can this help me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more, King Tyrl,\" the Scroller reminded. \"You just have to decipher it. Your coronation is today. Sleep well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listen as he shuffles away, but I know I won't sleep. The night is too old, and I am too tense. The only thing I can do is try and decipher a useless old scroll with my name on it, and try to avoid the gruesome threats in my letter. How could I do that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 551 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

I roll the idea of showing it to him about in my mind, then turn as he disappears down one of the many aisles of scrolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" I call. My voice is muffled in the closed space, and I wonder if he can even hear me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can repeat my cry or advance towards the shelf, his wrinkled face shows up around the corner once more, this time a scowl creases his brow and he clutches a particularly yellow scroll in one hand. I have to admit, he works very fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was - was given a letter,\" I say as I pull the crumpled note from my sleeve. \"It seems odd that the assassin is able to write, so I assume it can't be a peasant. I wondered if you would recognize the handwriting?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI doubt it will be so simple to locate the person responsible for the previous king's death, but cutting the assassin out of the picture would make my life infinitely easier. Easier to hang on to. I didn't have much time, and even if I clutched at the faintest lead possible I need all the help I can get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elder Scroller's eyebrows arch in curiosity and he slides the burden he carries back in place with a rustle of old parchments. This out of his way, he approaches me with choppy, hobbling strides. I hold the letter out to him before I can stop myself and he snatches it from my hand with such speed I fear he might have torn it in half. But he holds the whole message aloft to the feeble light and squints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hemmed and hawed about the damaged evidence and turns it over in his hands several times. I shift my weight between my feet. What does he see that I missed earlier? Or is it nothing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty, I do not know the writer of this message's handwriting,\" he admits at last. \"It may or may not be one of the courtiers and noblemen here right now. I couldn't say.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden desire to tear the parchment washes over me in waves, but I keep myself in check and content myself by biting the inside of my lower lip. It is a mild pain, but it helps keep my mind occupied on something besides my frustration and fear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can give you a few names of people that didn't write this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels as though a cloud is swept from over my head. It might help narrow down the possibilities. That would make me somewhat safer, perhaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must remember, though, that it could be a forgery.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI catch myself before I groan, and incline my head to the man. \"I understand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opens his mouth to speak when something taps to the ground somewhere in the recesses of the library's vast space. Movement shifts, and another scroll clinks down. I stiffen and silence shrouds the entire expanse of the room. Though I listen, I can make out no further sounds. An eavesdropper? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will write it for you,\" the Scroller says in a hushed tone. \"You can make of it what you will then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 549 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It seems to me that the scroll is my best chance to figure my role out and come up with a plan of action. It's too closely related to me, since it has my name on it. I don't think there is a hero or king with a name quite like mine. Call it conceit if you will, but I would have known if there was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn from the room with a sweep of my unwanted mantle and let myself into the quiet hallway beyond. I still hear the clank of the guards' armour nearby, but it's small comfort. I rush to my chambers as the first light of dawn begins to turn the carpets gold before me and yank the door shut in my wake. Not that it would stop any determined assassin, but the note says I will be exposed as a sham. I find it hard to believe they would do so in the lonely confines of my room. Nobody would see the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought makes me grimace and I set the scroll down on my desk with a clack of the wooden rod that holds it shut. This is all I have to show for my efforts. My disappointment is stronger than my helplessness. That's saying a lot, because I feel like I am floating in place with no idea how to get out of the boat I am stuck in. Worse, it seems the king that appointed me his heir believed in legends and children's stories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI set a heavy jar of bluish black ink on the corner of the scroll and unroll it as far as I can. It is then that I realize it will snap shut by itself if I don't find something else. The dagger I use for eating is at my hip, and I pull it from its sheath with a hiss. This I set on the bottom portion of the scroll so its weight holds it down. With this set in place, I grasp one of the spluttering candles so I can see. Soon the sun will be up anyway, but I want to get as much crammed into my head as possible before that crown rests on my brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the helpful illumination the text makes no sense to me. My name is written in aged ink, and I am celebrated as some sort of hero born of an unusual relationship. My parents are kept in the records, but to me they are nothing more than names. I do not know them, and I never will as they passed away with the pox disease that spread through the kingdom many years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis never bothered me before, but now I am restless and tired. Some instinct tells me that, although I only ever oversaw a small portion of land, I am not what I thought I was before. Even aside from the fact that I am now the king. I never wanted this position. I just need to prove myself. The scroll tells me fire is my best friend, but as I gaze into the candle's steady flame I am not so sure. Could it be suggesting I show a display of power through violence? How can I when there is nothing to be violent to other than a group of helpless, pathetic peasants? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sure this will do me no good, but perhaps my real rivals are the nobles that eye me from beneath lowered lashes. They are my true danger because they know more of how the kingdom is run than I do. They are the ones I have to put in their place. But the scroll isn't helpful in that regard. It flings riddles at me, and tangles my thoughts so much that I, at long last, feel my head thump down to the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when someone knocks on the door behind me. I jerk upright and twist in my seat so I can face the door. They must consider dawn a decent hour to disturb their king at. I set my mouth in a firm line and push myself upright. Even if I don't feel ready, I do my best to bring minor order to my appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it and what do you want?\" I ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 718 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

His expression is unconvinced and the faint light picks out the crags in his rugged face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bows anyway and turns to leave, his red cloak snatching at his heels as he moves. The door creaks shut and I am left alone once more with a mysterious message tucked in my robes. I scramble to free it from its confinement and set it down on the table. I weigh it down with one of the candle holders and lean in close so I can read the scribbled words. They are hasty and spidery in appearance, but perfectly legible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>King Tyrl,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour life is in danger.

I know my life is in danger, and I fear it. But I also know that I can't do much about it. A throwing knife? I clutch my robes tighter around myself and shudder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know that I can't trust everyone and every letter given to me. It might be a trick to get me not to go to the funeral so I can be apprehended in my room instead. Easy, no mess. I shudder. But on the other hand it might honestly be a warning made out of concern for my welfare to keep me away from a potential threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it makes my head ache. I already have passed up too much sleep, and this isn't helping my frame of mind any. I chew on my lower lip and turn the message over between my hands. I should think about this. I need to think about it. I need more time, but the funeral is tomorrow and I'm sure the night is mostly passed me now.

Besides, my rule needs to be asserted. I can't pretend I didn't inherit a throne, or else it will definitely be snatched from me. I never wanted to be king, no, but I have a sneaking suspicion I would like an assassin as my king even less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pull my cloak from about my shoulders and drape it over the back of my chair. I can't second guess myself now, so the least I can do is make myself presentable. As far as I am aware, the king would have people to help him dress and get ready. At this hour I doubt they would be so willing to help me, and I need something to do with myself to keep my exhausted thoughts off the decision I have made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the letter were right, I would be apprehended by a person with a throwing knife. Definitely not from up close. I should think about preparing my attire to possibly deflect a weapon like that. I know I don't have armour with me, and I don't really know where an assassin would think to aim, but I have to do something just in case. I couldn't let the servants know that I have a suspicion like this. I need to act now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy wardrobes were not adjusted for someone of my size yet. I am smaller than the late king was, and most of his clothes do not fit me as a result. However there are many types of jewellery in boxes that are mostly for show.

It might be worth a try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI begin to rummage about through glinting jewellery, determined but uncertain as to what the assortment could do to help. I swallow these worries and remind myself that anything that might save my life is worth a few minutes of wasted time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the first knock sounds on my door, I find myself sitting before my mirror with exhausted triumph in my eyes.

Meanwhile the crowd pushed together, forming an expectant audience waiting to hear what the King would say.  He was in no hurry to speak to the audience as he held his cup to be filled with red wine.  <br>\r\nKnowing his claim to be King has caused a stir, he chats several minutes with others near him while the candles are being re-lit; unaware that the four guards who understood what might happen when he addressed the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King finally walked to his Throne, nodded to the guards on either side, and sat down.

The same would be decided for Remundo's henchmen who helped him carry out the attempt on the King's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Machiman, Earl of Cambria, served as judge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King, now safe without fear of another attempt on his life sat in the Golden Throne chair on which the mark of the dagger where his head could have been, was marked with a red circle.  The circle was permanent and would be a reminder to him for the rest of his years just how fortunate he had been that one of the guards had intercepted the note which indicated the moment when the dagger would be thrown at the King's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people chattered about the assassination attempt and worried that there might be another try at taking their new King from them.  In the few short days of being King, they had already learned to respect him and liked his plans for the country after Justice was completed against the assassins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot everyone agreed about the King.  Sir Landholm was whispering to three of his friends over in the corner as several people kept looking their way and wondering what they were discussing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no doubt they'll all be found guilty,\" grumbled Sir Landholm.  \"I can't believe young Peter Panship would have had anything to do that.  Why, he's not got the sense of a goat so what could he have done to be arrested with the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl of Kindleford responded.  \"I heard he's been hanging around Lord Herdling lately so that may be why he was dragged in to the situation.  Probably Kindleford had him carry a message or something simple enough for him to do well.  We'll just have to wait and hear the charges against him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Earl of Straithorn, \"I heard he was the one who put that note on the table.  If he did, it's enough to make him lose his head.  Poor little stupid fellow.  He didn't know better and I'm sure nobody told him the trouble it could cause him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Landholm nodded.  \"You're right; he's too stupid to know any better.  Poor kid.  His mama's going to be in tears for some time after this day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Earl of Straithorn added, \"Yes, I do feel sorry for her.  She's tried to raise him good but it's hard with a boy like that.  It's Gordo the Fisherman that led the whole affair, I feel sure.  He's been trouble ever since the new channel was constructed across the southeast corner of his land even though it was nothing but swamp.  He and Macademium Forestall both got more upset than they should have about losing some of their swampland.  I say take both their heads off and save the boy.\"  He laughed like a clown and his fat stomach shook like hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Judge called, \"Silence.  Silence.\"  He banged his wooden gavel on the table set in front of him.  \"This hour the jury of thirteen honorable men will listen to the charges and determine which of the prisoners will lose their heads when the sun rises in the morning.\"  He looked at the Jury.  \"You have the power over life and death for the prisoners charged with attempted assissaciation of our new and beloved King.  Now the Captain of the Guards will read the charges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hush fell over the crowd as the Captain of the Guards, Lord Byronkinson stood, unrolled his scroll and began reading, \"Romundo, also known as Lord Panterion is charged with throwing the dagger which could easily have murdered our dear King.  As you can see when you look at the golden Throne Chair of our beloved King, the dagger could have killed him instantly...\" For the next hours he and others read their scrolls giving details showing how each prisoner participated in the dreadful attempt on the life of the new King.  One thing the Jurors and the crowd noted was that there was a specific request in the presentation that the boy not be found guilty since he did not have the mentality to understand the significance of his placing the note where it had been found by a guard instead of the person it was intended for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the scrolls were completed and the Jury went to the side room to deliberate their decisions.  When they returned, the decision was read by the judge, \"All of the prisoners except the boy are guilty and this Jury recommends all should lose their heads at dawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Judge turned to the King.  \"Your Majesty, do you agree with the Jury or do you wish to make any alterations to the decision?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King stood, \"I agree with the decisions and the punishment and I abhor each prisoner who involved the boy whom they knew did not understand the gravity of doing what he did.  I ask his mother to coach her son to avoid doing whatever is suggested to him in the future.  The beheading will occur at dawn in the place provided.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prisoners were taken to the dungeon to await their execution.  The people left the castle murmuring about the day's activities and making plans to attend the beheading and join in the festivities which always followed such events in the Towne Square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dungeon, the prisoners were served their last meal before dawn and were led to the place of execution.  The crowd jeered as they were led, tied together in a long string of sad and mean men slogging along as slowly as they dared to walk.  People in the crowd through wine, water, fruit, and chicken blood on them so they were soaked to the skin and covered with rotten fruit and flies by the time they stopped at the beheading station where three men covered in black from head to toe held large axes which would soon be bloody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King's musicians played mournful music until the first prisoner's head was on the block.  The drums sounded as one man in black took his place, swung his axe and a head dropped into the wooden basket, leaving the headless body on the ground.  Remundo was to be last so he had to watch as his henchmen's heads rolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with blood everywhere on the ground where Remundo knelt, all over the men in black and their axes, and the block which dripped with blood.  Just as he was instructed to knell, Remundo shouted, \"Let the King Die Today.  Let others do what we could not do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people jeered and began to chant, \"Off with his head; he'll soon be dead\" over and over until the man in black raised his axe; then they cheered.  \"Long Live the King\"  \"Long Live the King\" until their King left the scene and those responsible too the bodies to be cremated and the heads placed on poles to line the roadway of the King's City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 1212 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

The crowd's cheers, \"Off with his head, he'll soon be dead,\" echoed through the square. Remundo's neck pressed tightly against the unyielding block of wood, but he raised his gaze and it settled on a young girl in the front of the cheering crowd. <br>\r\n\"Off with his head, he'll soon...\" her words trailed off as her gaze met Remundo's eyes. <br>\r\n\"I hope the king dies today,\" Remundo mumbled as the axe glinted in the sunlight as it arced downward through the air, stopping suddenly with a loud thunk. Blood spurted from the clean cut neck of Remundo, and his head dropped, eyes open but no longer seeing, into the basket placed below the wooden block to accept it. <br>\r\nThe crowd let out a loud cheer, the noise seemed to vibrate the ground in the square. People danced, laughed, and slapped each other on the back. Far in the rear of the crowd was Benile, a distant cousin of Remundo's, a man who wore a sober face. Turning to the man next to him, he smiled sadly and let his gaze move through the crowd.<br>\r\n\"A bribe as simple as a meal, some music, and possibly a bit of debauchery,\" he said, \"in exchange for the lives of so many good men.\"<br>\r\nThe man standing next to Benile, who wore the dark wool robes of a monk, tightened the rope surrounding his ample stomach and replied. <br>\r\n\"My son,\" for a starving people, the lives of many cannot compare to the satisfaction of a full belly.\" With that he patted the protuberance hidden beneath his stiff, stained robe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd moved to the edge of town and watched as the basket of heads were brought along the road by a horse drawn wagon. As its wheels creaked over the dirt ruts, people bowed their heads, refusing to see the blood dripping from the seams between the boards that make up the wagon's rear. But as soon as the wagon moved past, the conversations and laughter resumed. <br>\r\n\"Did you see that man's body,\" said a peasant, his voice filled with awe. <br>\r\n\"Which man,\" said a woman wearing dirty clothes, her hair grimy, her hands filthy. <br>\r\n\"The one who's body flopped around the platform after his head was removed from his body.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, I remember that one,\" she said. Her toothless smile widened with the memory. <br>\r\n\"And so many,\" the same man said, \"with so many heads rolling today, the feast should be bigger than usual. \"I'm looking forward to a meal like one I haven't had in a long time.\" <br>\r\n\"Look,\" a disembodied voice rose from the crowd gathered along the side of the road. \"There is the first pole.\" <br>\r\nAs the straight pole rose into the air, a head attached to its top, a great cheer went up from the crowd. <br>\r\n\"Where is the celebration to be held?\" a stranger asked no one in particular. <br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" shouted someone. <br>\r\n\"Does anyone know?\" someone else shouted into the air. <br>\r\nA guard, his armor scratched from many battles, but still sparkling in the sunlight, stopped and banged the end of his spear against the ground.<br>\r\n\"Silence!\" He shouted. \"I know where you must go.\" <br>\r\nA great hush fell over the crowd. A great dust cloud rose and moved over the crowd all the people suddenly came to a halt. A voice that sounded like it came from an elderly man rose up. <br>\r\n\"Tell us, soldier,\" he paused as if catching his breath. When he continued his voice had weakened. \"For we are hungry and we want to celebrate the King's victory.<br>\r\n\"You must follow this road,\" the soldier pointed with his spear. \"You are required to walk past each of the severed heads. Where the road ends--\"<br>\r\n\"We all know where the road ends,\" someone interrupted, \"It's where the king's castle sits.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, and in the court yard of the castle a great feast has been laid.\" <br>\r\nBenile, who up to this point had been silent, finally spoke to the monk who had accompanied him from the bloody square. <br>\r\n\"Look at them,\" he said. \"They cheer for the death of their brethren, they cheer for food so that they may assuage their guilt.\" <br>\r\nThe monk patted his thick hands against his stomach, and said, \"I have a lot of guilt to be assuaged,\" he smiled at Benile, \"so I had better hurry before there is not enough food left to make me whole again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle court yard slowly filled with people as they passed under the gates at the castle entrance. Some gasped, some pushed others out of their way, some fell to their knees to thank the gods for so fine a feast. <br>\r\nThere was a loud tapping that pulled everyone's attention to the balcony high on the southern wall. The king's colors were unfurled over the balcony raid to a great cheer. <br>\r\n\"Silence!\" A fat, bearded guard who stood on the balcony shouted. \"There is food enough for everyone. The minstrels will soon be here for your entertainment, and there will be games of chance that anyone will be allowed to compete with. Another great cheer rose up from the crowd. <br>\r\nBenile stood just inside the open gate and peered up at the balcony displaying the bright red and gold flag of the king. Surely the king will make an appearance there, he told himself. But it will be when the king comes to join the crowd that I will act. Benile's hand disappeared inside his tunic, and his slender fingers stroked the ivory handle of his curved knife. As he stared at the balcony, Benile closed his fingers around the knife's handle.<br>\r\n\"My time to act is near,\" he mumbled. \"I will avenge Remundo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n967 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After some consideration, during which the group's leader showed his impatience through further gesticulations of his sword, the king got an idea. It was questionable, but it might work to diffuse this situation. Well, as far as the King was concerned, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have one question,\" the former king said as he slowly lowered the pack from his shoulder and began sifting through it, as though he was trying to retrieve some money. At least, that is what the on-looking brigands thought he was doing. But instead of pulling out a bag of coins, he pulled out a fairly small, black, ball-like object. \"How many of you know what this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis question was met with blank stares until the leader spoke up. \"What is this? This is ball! Black ball, useless for this purpose. Give us this money, or this is this moment's end for you!\" He waved his sword in a slightly less random motion, and his men brought their weapons up in even more hostile attitudes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Just wait a moment,\" the king said, holding the object up in a showman's gesture. \"This may look like just a ball, but no! It is so much more than the naked eye can see. Give me a chance, and I can show you just how this incredible item can change your lives. Decide quickly, for this limited time offer won't last long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe looks on the faces of some of the brigands indicated that they were curious about his words, but the leader quickly countered. \"Nonsense! This is nothing but this desperate plea for this life. This will not save you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former king threw up his hands and sighed. \"Well, I tried. If none of you want the chance of a lifetime, who am I to argue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the brigands in the back of the group shouted, \"Come on, at least let him tell us what it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA different man near the front of the group nodded his head vigorously. \"Yeah. I wants to know how much we can sells it for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone else piped up with, \"Is it magic or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! This is not this way! Cease this talk of this ball!\" The mask on the leader's face didn't allow a view of his expression, but the former king was quite certain the man's face was probably becoming red and contorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former king threw his arms wide, saying, \"Well, what will it be, folks? Do I have to take this miracle product elsewhere? I can only give this limited time offer on a first-come basis, so act fast before it's gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos ensued. Several of the bandits desperately wanted the special offer, but since their leader wouldn't hear of it (he was quite tight with the purse-strings, at least as long it regarded his underlings), they decided to force the issue despite the forceful swinging of their leader's sword. The king took their momentary distraction as a chance to sneak away into the cover of the forest's canopy and continue in the direction of the crossroads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before he was intercepted by yet another shadowy form in the forest. After a moment of breathless mutual observation, the newcomer spoke. \"Call me Ivan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was as good a name as any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(551 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

We will need to tread carefully but quickly if we're to accomplish our mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are the others aware of these changes to the plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. You are the first I've had a chance to contact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we need to spread the word.

Whatever came next would decide the fate of his kingdom and, perhaps, the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he could find out what that was! The end comes too soon for those of us who fight the great battles which shape the course of our lives, and yet it is the struggle, not the victory, that makes us what we are.

He had pins stuck in his red velvet coat, a measuring tape slung about his wide neck, and he carried a small stool, which he set before me and hopped up on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, Sire. I am here to measure you for your royal wedding garments, if you please.\" His breath reeked of garlic and some other foul substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...oh, yes. Well, get on with it, I've more to do than stand around all the day, you oaf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I'd rid my self of the chattering tailor, it was one intrusion after another: the caterers, not just one, mind you, but one for everything: the salads, the main courses, the deserts, what wines, and on and on.  \"Why isn't the queen seeing to all this?\" I demanded of the winesman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe the good queen's feeling rather poorly this morning, Sire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.

Come! We've been waiting for some time for you to arrive. The bride's all-a-jitter,\" he informed us in his nasally voice. We stepped into the cool recess of the cathedral, and I gaped at the elaborate trappings of the place: marble floors throughout, massive candelabras that seemed to float from its vaulted ceiling, flowers of every kind let off an overwhelming perfume, and a lengthy red carpet went on forever down the isle to the alter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we approached the alter, I mused that its contents could have fed my village for many a year: golden goblets, a diamond encrusted sword laid lengthwise along the white draped marble, gems galore were inlaid in the two six foot candle holders that stood either side of the alter, and a feminine delicate crown of shiny gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered where the guest all were, when the doors whooshed open. In marched a parade that went on for quite some time. Lords, Ladies, the prince who'd knocked upon my door. Most were strange to me, but I did pick out one or two who were well-renowned. <i>Witnesses tot his spectacle, this farce, not wedding guests!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were all seated, Bishop VanGrew lifted a chubby arm, calling for silence. He nodded to an alter attendant, and he disappeared into a side door. Moments later, he ushered out a woman in a revealing white gown. It was cut low, and it reveal the swell of her ample breasts. <i>Stop gaping, you fool!</i> I felt like whistling! <i>If this is the famed <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'mystic_dreams', '', '', '', '10', '', 'OFF', '100914213'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'mystic_dreams', '', '', '', '10', '', 'OFF'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: mystic_dreams\r\nMember Since: September 30th, 2011\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;font-weight:bold;cursor:pointer;\">Myst</a></span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/mystic_dreams','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/mystic_dreams\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'mystic_dreams', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  1/28/20', '1/28/20', 'September 30, 2011', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a>, well, I could certainly do far worse; she's stunning!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI straightened myself up and gave a slight nod to my would be bride.

The castle was surrounded by thousands of knights as far as the eye could see.  I was rather glad I had taken care of business downstairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly someone below spotted me and a roar went up from the angry throng. A catapult pulled back and sent a mammoth rock careening toward the castle wall.  On impact the rock splintered into a thousand pieces and the wall shook.  I ducked and covered my head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Gavin reached down and grabbed me by my cloak.  Hauling me up by the scruff of my neck, he held me two feet above the floor, which could not be seen from below.  Dangling there, I realized I was actually eye level with the giant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe roared with anger.  \u201cDo your best, you infidels!  Our mighty King Keravin shall split your guts and roast your innards for the buzzards to devour!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who\u2019s he calling mighty?</i> I wondered as a roar went up from our own knights.  Sir Gavin sat me down, and straightened my cloak.  Behind him several ladders appeared along the outer side of the wall.  Horrified, I realized that an attempt was being to scale it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 uh\u2026.\u201d I pointed and Sir Gavin whirled.  He grabbed the nearest ladder and shoved with all of his might.  A thunk silenced a scream below.  Not breaking stride, Sir Gavin began screaming orders.  Out of nowhere, several men appeared with boiling vats of oil and dumped the scalding contents over the wall.  Screams of agony once again reached my ears.  Clasping my hands over my ears, I turned and darted for the staircase.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took no more than two strides before I found myself being lifted by the scruff of my neck again.  My feet kept moving but my forward progress was halted.  <i>This was getting old.</i>  Sir Gavin turned me once again to the wall so I could face the hoard of enemies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAct like you are yelling, Sire,\u201d he whispered.  Having no other recourse, I complied and began moving my mouth in gyrations.  For good measure I added some exaggerated arm movements, which apparently pleased my ventriloquist, Sir Gavin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee here, what befalls the enemies of our great kingdom.  Curse those who dare to think I am weak for you shall see just how mighty I really am.\u201d Sir Gavin laughed, and I threw back my head and mimicked a roaring sound.  Sir Gavin cut off the laughter so I snapped my mouth shut.  I could only hope that the cutthroats below could not see how out of sync we really were.  Finally, Sir Gavin once again set me on my feet and dusted me off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me, Sire.\u201d Sir Gavin nodded and almost smiled.  \u201cNow, you may return to your chambers if you wish.  I will send for you later so that our enemies may see what a worthy adversary you are.\u201d  He turned and began marching down the parapet, shouting out orders to ready for the next round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to sputter and then thought better of it.  I turned and scurried down the staircase, right past my chambers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count = 540 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I raced down the hall bent on seeking freedom from this nightmare.  No way was I cut out to be king.  What a joke, and everyone knew it.  Even Sir Gavin knew he had to cover for me.  I wasn\u2019t kidding anyone. I broke out into the courtyard and ran for the stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou there, stable boy!\u201d I cried.  \u201cGet me a horse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, Sire\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts, get me my horse, now!\u201d I was fairly sure a king had his own horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSire,\u201d the boy\u2019s eyes widened into saucers. \u201cAre you going to ride out there and kick some butt?\u201d That stopped me cold.  The castle was surrounded by thousands of enemy knights.  Suddenly, fleeing did not seem like such a good idea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no.  Of course not.  I just wanted to inspect my horse.\u201d I glanced around searching for a plausible explanation. \u201cUh, I wanted to make sure he\u2019s doing okay.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInspect your horse, Sire?\u201d The stable boy cocked his head and raised one eyebrow.  Apparently, that sounded even lamer to a lad than it did to me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you are doing a fantastic job.  Carry on.\u201d I waved him off toward where the horses were kept and turned to search out the sanctuary of the chapel. <i>Could my own chapel grant me asylum?  Where else could I hide?</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was half-way there when a hand reached out and snagged my neck, dragging me back into a hidden panel in the wall.  In a split second, I found myself inside the wall of the castle.  Wiping spider webs from my face, I froze as I realized Page Embrey stood in front of me, and we were alone in some kind of hidden passage.  <i>This was not good</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPage Embrey held up his finger to indicate silence.  Since he appeared to have the upper hand, not to mention a rather lethal looking sword, I decided co-operation to be the more prudent move at the moment.  Embrey motioned for me to follow him. We trudged the length of the dark tunnel, lit only by a torch that Embrey had picked off the wall.  The shadows flickering along the wall sent shivers down my spine.  I had heard stories of the castle being haunted but now they didn\u2019t seem like just stories.  It didn\u2019t help that my companion, if he was indeed the King\u2019s half-brother, probably wanted me dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a fork in the tunnel, Embrey turned left, glancing behind him to make sure I followed.  I briefly considered taking the right tunnel, but I suspected that he could chase me down if he wanted to.  After several more turns, we stopped in front of a panel.  Embrey reached up and pressed on a stone.  With an eerie creak, the wall began to rotate, stopping only when a doorway had been created to the King\u2019s bedchamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d I struggled to find my voice.  \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to run, Sire,\u201d sarcasm laced Embrey\u2019s voice, \u201cyou need to be prepared.\u201d He raked his eyes over me in scorn.  He grabbed a knapsack from under the bed and shoved it toward me.  \u201cHere, this is filled with food and water, enough for two days.\u201d  Striding over to the wall, he snatched a sword down and tossed it to me.  Out of sheer reflex, I snagged it out of the air, narrowly missing the blade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the King\u2019s bed table, Embrey pulled a dagger.  Holding it in his right hand, he marched toward me with a menacing expression.  Forgetting I held a sword, I back peddled until I felt the wall pressing into my back.  Embrey smirked, flipped the handle of the knife over, and shoved it into my belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!  I can get you out through a tunnel that opens into the woods.  I\u2019ve got a horse waiting for you there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d I cried finally gaining my senses.  \u201cDon\u2019t you want to kill me?\u201d <i>Okay, maybe I shouldn\u2019t have reminded him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKill you?\u201d Embrey mouthed.  \u201cWhy would I want to do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you are the King\u2019s brother and want the throne.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbrey laughed.  He actually had the gaul to laugh. \u201cYes, I\u2019m the King\u2019s brother, and yes, I want the throne, but you are an innocent pawn of my brother\u2019s.  Killing you would be one more crime for which our house would have to answer.  Besides, if you turn up dead, the kingdom might go looking for the real king.\u201d  He shook his head. \u201cNo, I just need you out of the way where my dear brother\u2019s minions can\u2019t use you anymore.\u201d  With that he turned and walked back into the tunnel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a stunned moment, I stood there trying to sort it all out.  However, Embrey interrupted my ruminations by poking his head back into the room.  \u201cComing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and scurried after him.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 812 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I jumped as darkness engulfed me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmbrey?\u201d I whispered.  No answer.  \u201cEmbrey?\u201d This time a little louder.  A torch flared behind me, and I swung to find Embrey standing there, his face cast in shadows.  He grinned, sending shudders down my spine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way.\u201d Embrey nodded to his left and set off at a brisk pace.  I marveled at the change in him.  As my page, Embrey had seemed rather mousy.  Now, he towered over me, and I struggled to keep up.  For over an hour, we raced around corner after corner, turning first this way and then that way until I was completely and utterly lost\u2014completely and utterly dependent on Embrey.  Rounding one such corner, I smacked into the back of Embrey\u2019s who had dowsed the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmph,\u201d I mumbled, pushing myself back from his immovable form.  From a grate ahead, a light filtered in, casting a soft glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhhh!\u201d Embrey held up a hand, motioning for my silence.  From beyond the grate, drifted the sounds of horses racing by and armor clanking as the riders held their seats.  Embrey turned to me and whispered, \u201cWe are just beyond the creek that runs north of the castle.  Most of the troops are amassed on the southern and western ends, since those are our weakest points.  However, they are patrolling the north and east quite heavily so no one can get through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, now what?\u201d Embrey looked at me like I was a court jester.  I suppose I might have been better qualified for that position than that of king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs soon as the patrol passes, we will have but maybe ten minutes to make our way through the woods.  Just behind the old healer\u2019s cabin is tied a horse for you\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe old witch\u2019s cabin?\u201d I cried. \u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhhh! Keep your bloody voice down unless you want your head paraded around on a stick by our enemies.\u201d Embrey glared at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter my head than my eternal soul enslaved.\u201d Every child in the kingdom knew the stories of the Witch of Glen Eives.  It was rumored that she captured those foolish enough to venture into her domain and then boiled them alive.  As they screamed their last breath, she would capture their souls and use them to do her evil bidding.  <br>\r\nEmbrey rolled his eyes, letting me know exactly what he thought of my superstitions.  He turned and shuffled to the gate.  Grasping the bars, he grunted and lifted.  With a groaning clank, the metal fell back in his hands, the sound reverberating throughout the tunnel.  <i>And he worried about me giving away our presence.</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbrey set the grate down and bowed, gesturing toward the hole. \u201cAfter you, Sire.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne\u2014I am not going anywhere near that witch.\u201d I held up a finger and quickly flipped up another. \u201cTwo\u2014I wouldn\u2019t be dumb enough to go first if I was.\u201d  Embrey growled and snatched me, hefting me over his brawny shoulder. <i>Where had he hidden these muscles as my page?</i>  Before I could squeak a protest, we were through the hole and moving through the brush.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Embrey keeping such a fast pace, I struggled to breath as I bounced with each step.  Using my hands to brace myself, I lifted my head and glanced behind us. I froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmmm, Embrey?\u201d  I croaked.  \u201cYou better run.\u201d  Embrey whirled and spied the two knights who had just rounded the bend in the creek.  Embrey swore and swung around to sprint toward the Witch\u2019s shack.  My head began another banging round against Embrey\u2019s back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalt!\u201d Roared one of the knights.  I pushed myself up enough to see the knight let loose an arrow flying straight and true toward us.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuck,\u201d I screamed, and for once providence was on our side.   Embrey tripped over a root and sent both of us sailing over the rim of a deep well.  With a scream, Embrey let go of me.  For just a moment, I felt weightless until I slammed into the hard ground below.  Blackness settled over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 692 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

The voice of an angel whispered in the same ear, \u201cCome now, Sire.  It\u2019s time for you to be waking up.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fluttered my eyes and squinted as the light sent shards of pain streaking through my skull.  I groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush, now.  I\u2019ll cover the light from the windows.\u201d The cloth left its comforting march across my forehead, and I risked a peek to see if an angel had indeed rescued me. In the darkness that now engulfed the room, I could just make out the shadow of a woman with long hair.   Not until she stepped up to stroke the fire, could I see she truly was an angel of mercy.  Beautiful blond hair cascaded in curls to her waist, and blue eyes sparkled as she smiled at me.  Her dainty nose set atop lush and full lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s better isn\u2019t it, my Lord?\u201d I nodded and was rewarded with another smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lady, where am I?\u201d The last thing I remembered was Embrey tossing me over the lip of a well.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are in my home in Glen Eives.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d I jack-knifed up as a sudden thought hit me. Pain throbbed but I kept my focus. \u201cAnd you would be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, I am the healer of Glen Eives, Sire.  I\u2019ve been caring for you for since yesterday.\u201d I stared in horror.  Standing before me was the most beautiful witch I had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026..\u201d I stammered, \u201cbut\u2026. I thought you were\u2026.. well, old!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch snickered. \u201cI am old.  Almost 300 years this coming spring.  I tell ye, these old bones ache something fierce through the winter months.  The cold is coming that\u2019s for sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d I had never spoken so directly to a woman in my life.  My angel turned witch shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFountain of Youth spell\u2014\u201c The door banged open and in stormed Embrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he awake yet?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee for yourself, Embrey, my love.\u201d <i>All now that just sucked!</i>  Her beauty was so great, I had almost convinced myself that 270 years was really not the big of a gap for two people in a committed relationship.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbrey marched over to the witch and gave her a swift kiss on those luscious lips.  And I had thought this guy was annoying as my page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cI guess she gave you a muscle-bound, handsome prince spell?\u201d  Embrey broke off the kiss and turned to glare at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she gave me a wimpy, sniveling page spell so no one would suspect anything.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh,\u201d I retorted.  \u201cIt worked.\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan he travel?\u201d Embrey asked, ignoring me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the morning, perhaps.\u201d The witch ran a finger over Embrey\u2019s chest and purred, \u201cPerhaps you can stay another night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a wonderful plan,\u201d   Embrey said as he dipped his head to feather kisses along her nape.  I groaned aloud again.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At nightfall the next evening, Embrey ordered me to make myself ready for our journey. Though my head no longer ached, every bone and muscle in my body still screamed in protest as I pushed myself off the bed.  Apparently, being thrown down a dry well was not something it had appreciated.  However, since said well was enchanted by the witch, no amount of searching had allowed my enemies to find us.  Thus we escaped to the witch\u2019s cottage, and for that the pain seemed a small price to pay.  <i>Better to be sore than dead I always say</i>. I chuckled aloud at my own humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch glanced at me and lifted one brow in question.  However, she said nothing and just handed me a small sack of provisions and a small amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, put this over your head and wear it with you for the entire journey.\u201d She rasped in an ancient voice.  I stared at her suspiciously.  I could have sworn her beauty had wavered for a moment to reveal an old crone.  But no, her blue eyes sparkled back at me when she winked.  I shook my head to clear my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat will the amulet do?  Make me invisible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo silly,\u201d the witch cackled\u2014okay that was definitely not her normal musical laugh, \u201cIt will protect you from evil spirits that lurk in the Woods of Hampshire.  You will pass through them at midnight, and I would hate for your soul to be enslaved by the Demons of Hampshire. Embrey needs you alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shuddered, \u201cYea, me too.  Thanks.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s be on our way,\u201d Embrey called from just beyond the door.  I stepped outside to find him holding the reins to one of the most beautiful horses I had ever seen.  The stallion stood at least 18 hands with a coat as silky and black as midnight.  I stepped forward and reached for the reins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Embrey said pulling the reins back. \u201cThat one\u2019s yours.\u201d He pointed to a tree to the left of the door.  There stood the oldest, ugliest nag I had ever seen.  Not more than 15 hands tall, every rib and backbone shown through its mottled and scraggly coat.  I groaned knowing that I\u2019d feel every one of those protrusions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou expect your king to ride a nag?\u201d I gave Embrey my best royal snooty look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do if that\u2019s all the horse I think he can handle,\u201d he retorted.  <i>Okay, I probably deserved that.</i>  I was not exactly known for my horseman ship.  \u201cBesides,\u201d he continued, \u201cYou are not my king; you are an imposter, and we both know it.\u201d With that, he placed a foot in his stirrup and swung up onto the magnificent black. \u201cAnd while we are on the subject of identity, I would appreciate it if you would address me as Sir Embrey.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shut my mouth at his audacity and turned back toward the nag.  The horse swung around at me and showed me its teeth in what could only be described as a snarl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could cast a beauty spell if it would be easier your sensibilities.\u201d The witch cackled again.  This time I was sure I saw a few more wrinkles in that previously porcelain skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould that make her run faster if our enemies should find us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but it\u2019s a wonder what a female is willing and able to do when she feels beautiful.\u201d The witch batted her eyelashes and tossed a moldy gray hair behind her shoulder.  I shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no thanks.\u201d  She shrugged and stepped back to stand in her doorway, her skin once again glowing in the evening light. Perhaps her spell was only contained within the parameters of her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped up to my waiting nag and grasped her reins to untie them from the tree limb.  For my troubles, the grateful wretch snapped at me almost, I was sure, biting my hand in two.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snatched the reins and jerked down to show her who was boss.  From the glare, I doubted I had made my point, but since Embrey\u2014Sir Embrey that is\u2014was bellowing like a jackass that it was time to go, I decided to save this battle for another time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped up into the stirrup and swung my leg over the saddle.  At that exact moment, my little nemesis sidestepped two steps toward me, which meant my momentum carried me right over the saddle.  I landed with an umph and lay there staring at the underneath of the tree branch.  The nag actually turned and laughed at me like only a horse can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Embrey, however, was not amused.  \u201cIs Princess too much for you to handle, Sire?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess?\u201d I sputtered, setting up. \u201cHer name is Princess?  You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d  I got to my feet and glared at Princess. Taking her reins in hand, I once again attempted to mount.  This time I anticipated her side step toward me.  Unfortunately, Princess moved in the other direction, which left me hanging in mid-air until gravity took over, and I once again found myself inspecting the undergrowth of the tree.  \u201cSpoiled Princess, more like it,\u201d I muttered once I had regained my breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Embrey had dismounted and held the reins firmly in his grasp.  \u201cAllow me, Sire.\u201d His voice practically dripped with sarcasm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood and grabbed the saddle horn and practically jumped into the saddle.  No way was I giving this little equine witch another chance to dump me.  Embrey handed me the reins and stomped back to his horse.  I watched with envy as he vaulted into the saddle and whirled his mount toward the trail.  Digging in his heels, he and his stallion seemed to take flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tapped my stirrups against Princess\u2019s side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tapped a little harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to stand it any longer, I let out a screech and slammed my heels into the nag\u2019s side.  She snorted and bobbed her head.  Another hard dig, and she ambled forward at a leisurely pace.  At this rate, it would take us a year to reach our destination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Embrey!\u201d I yelled.  \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure if he heard me as he and his winged Pegasus had a considerable lead on us.  Embrey pulled up and whirled his mount to wait for me.  As we moseyed closer, I could see his fierce glower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is Sir Embrey, if you please,\u201d he ground out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry, Sir Embrey,\u201d I emphasized, \u201cwould you mind telling me where exactly we are going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo Night Haven,\u201d he said. \u201cNow try to be a little quieter and try to move a little faster will you? The night patrols could still find us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou picked the stupid nag,\u201d I muttered.  Embrey rolled his eyes and turned back up the path, moving at a slower pace to accommodate the one speed Princess seemed to have\u2014turtle class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1169 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Occasionally, an owl hooted in the distance, its lonesome echo sending shivers down my spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Embrey,\u201d I whispered and watched his back stiffen.  I sighed  \u201cOkay, Sir Embrey?\u201d Embrey pulled up his horse and turned in his saddle to face me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes? What do you want now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust wondering when we would reach Night Haven?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother 15 minutes,\u201d Embrey muttered and turned, urging his horse up the trail.  <i>Well, somebody\u2019s a little testy. </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, seriously. This place is creeping me out, Embrey.\u201d I raised my voice hoping he would answer.  It took me a second to realize that Embrey had frozen in his saddle.  He snapped up a fist to indicate silence.  I had a feeling it would be in my best interest to listen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woodland creatures continued their ominous music. I heard nothing, but Embrey\u2019s back remained rigid.  Without warning, my horse, Princess Nag, shied away from the right side of the trail. Her eyes rolled back, and she reared, turning to face the opposite way. I nearly lost my seat, but managed to yank back on the reins, keeping the nag from bolting\u2014not a usual description applied to her I feared.  Princess kept prancing as if she could hear something I could not.  I managed to turn her back in the right direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen over the shuffling hooves and nature\u2019s big band music, I heard a low growl.  I whipped around to see what Embrey was doing.  Embrey chose that moment to leap into action; apparently he too had heard the growl.  As he pulled his sword from his scabbard and lifted it high, his stallion reared.  Like a statue I had once seen, the two hung there for several moments before coming to the ground with a jar that shook the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trees around us erupted in growls and snarls.  A black beast with three inch fangs and glowing red eyes sprang at Embrey.  With one swipe of his sword, he cleaved the beast in two.  Another fiend leapt out of darkness only to meet with the same fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbrey screamed, \u201cRide!\u201d  For once I was in total agreement. I dug in my heels and didn\u2019t have to tell Princess Nag twice this time.  She must have sprouted wings because we flew down the trail, snarling and nipping dogging our heels.  From behind me, I heard the pounding hooves of Embrey\u2019s steed.  A sudden yelp let me know he had dispatched another demon, but I wasn\u2019t looking to confirm that.    My plan was to ride until Princess could go no further.  Then, I would carry her if I had to.  After all, she might have just saved my sorry hide; it was the least I could do for her. Funny how running for our lives could bond two creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn my left, Embrey and his ride overtook us.  He reached out and snatched the reins, pulling us to a stop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d he said.  Sweat had plastered his black hair to his forehead and dripped down his cheek.  I whipped my head around to check for any more of the offensive creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we\u2026.\u201d I gasped for breath. \u201cAre we safe?\u201d My eyes continued to scan the surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Sire.  We are safe.  I\u2019ve been trying to get you to stoop for at least two leagues.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Princess had it in her. Now that I mention it, I didn\u2019t think you did either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time I laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s just say we were motivated.\u201d I reached down and rubbed Princess\u2019s neck.  She shook her head up and down as if to agree with me.  \u201cWhat were those things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy those were the Demons of Hampshire, of course.\u201d I shuddered.  I reached up and grabbed my amulet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought this was supposed to protect me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re still alive, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Embrey raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sucked in another deep breath and heard Princess do the same.  She seemed calm, so I hoped all was well.  \u201cSo the rest of the trip will be good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHardly, next are the Serpents of Stellerine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSerpents?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cYou mean snakes?  Please tell me you did not just say snakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say snakes; I said serpents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t those the same thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind snakes,\u201d Embrey explained. \u201cThey eat rodents and other such creatures.  The serpents are evil and can grow as large as twenty feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwenty feet?\u201d I gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwenty feet,\u201d Embrey agreed.  \u201cNow, let\u2019s go.\u201d He whirled his mount and urged it into a walk.  I followed suit, my imagination taking over.  <i>Twenty feet serpents?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count  = 786   <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This time I knew enough to trust my new friend.  If she was nervous, I had better be nervous.  As I listened I could hear the rustling in the woods.  Embrey had already halted, but instead of his sword, he had pulled a torch and lit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really wished he hadn\u2019t.  Hundred of snakes slithered through the branches overhead and on the ground.  Though I didn\u2019t see any twenty-foot snakes, there were several that measured at least eight to ten feet.  Apparently, Princess wasn\u2019t happy either and reared several times to emphasize her point.  I finally got her to keep all four hooves on the ground but she snorted her displeasure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbrey dropped from his horse, and holding the reins, he began swooshing the torch in front of him.  The snakes recoiled from the heat and light, clearing a path.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow directly behind me,\u201d Embrey whispered. \u201cKeep an eye overhead.  You don\u2019t want one of them dropping on you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No kidding. </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had not progressed more than 50 yards before Embrey froze.  In front of him, slithered a giant serpent of at least 30 feet.  Embrey\u2019s horse reared and nearly unhinged his arm.  Some how, he managed to keep hold and toss me the torch.  As he came down, he yanked his sword, prepared to do battle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-s-s-ave your s-s-s-word, human.  I mean you no harm.\u201d  Embrey froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid that snake just talk?\u201d I whispered, but Embrey never uttered another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serpent chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve never heard a s-s-s-erpent talk before, King Keravin?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026. How did\u2026.\u201d I sat stunned. Of course, I wasn\u2019t the only one.  Embrey and both horses were in some kind of trance, not moving a single muscle.  Even the other snakes had ceased slithering.  The giant serpent and I were the only ones present in the truest sense of the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did I know your name?\u201d asked the serpent.  \u201cI know many things-s-s. Now lis-s-ten clos-s-ely because-s-se your life may depend upon it.  Before dawn breaks-s-s over the eas-s-tern s-s-sky, you will encounter three more perils-s-s, each wors-s-e than the las-s-t.   The firs-s-t will be boiling mud traps-s-s. Watch the ground and trus-s-t your hors-s-e.  S-S-She will guide you through s-s-s-afely to the other s-s-side. The s-s-second will be the giant s-s-spider of Archaidia.  S-S-She is dec-c-eitful and once her web ens-snares-s-s you, s-s-she will never let you go.  S-S-Stuff your ears-s-s and cover your nag\u2019s-s-s eyes-s.  That way s-s-s-she cannot s-s-s-ee.  Then lead your hors-s-e through without looking to the left or right of the path.  S-S-She cannot trick you then.  The third is the deadlies-s-t. It comes-s-s in the form of a friend or foe.  Trus-s-t no one.\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust no one?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrus-s-t no one.\u201d The serpent weaved his head in agreement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Seemed a bit out of character to me for a serpent to be so helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy becaus-se, S-S-Sire, you will be the next true king, and I like to have friends-s-s in high pla-c-ces-s-s-s.\u201d  With that the serpent turned and slithered into the forest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbrey and the horses sprang to life as the other snakes disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 What happened?\u201d It was Embrey\u2019s turn to stutter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just a chat with a new friend,\u201d I muttered.  \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d I dug in my heals and Princess and I took the lead. </font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 646 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Another hour perhaps had passed before a foul stench reached my sensitive olfactory.  I wrinkled my nose in disgust and felt bile rise in my throat at the smell of rotten eggs.  Princess shook her head from side-to-side, as if to shake the odor from her nostrils. I pulled up and turned to face Sir Embrey.  I was a bit surprised that he had allowed me to remain in the lead.  Come to think of it, I was a little unsure why I had taken the lead.  A bit out of character you might say.  Maybe the Kingship thing was going to my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Embrey, do you smell that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRotten eggs.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, huh,\u201d I agreed.  \u201cThe Mud Pits of Arbrill.\u201d  Embrey\u2019s eyes widened at my knowledge.  I smothered a grin. He knew nothing of my conversation with the serpent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may be right, Sire. I had forgotten about them.\u201d Embrey looked past my shoulder, and I got the feeling he was hiding something. \u201cPerhaps we should take a short cut through the woods that I know.  There\u2019s a small path just up ahead that should get us through.\u201d  Embrey tapped his horse to take the lead, but I held up a hand halting his progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, my gaze steely, \u201cWe cannot risk any further delay. Princess seems to have a nose for it.  Stay directly behind me, and we shall be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou expect me to trust you and the nag?\u201d Embrey snorted in disgust. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \u201cDo what you want,\u201d I said, determined to stay the course, \u201cbut I am taking the straight path.\u201d I whipped Princess around and urged her forward, leaving Embrey sputtering.  I knew he would follow because for some reason I seemed to be of value to him\u2014at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench grew stronger and soon the moonlight revealed small patches of bubbling mud.  Princess shied away from a particularly big one that must have measured two feet in diameter.  I watched as a brown bubble expanded on the surface before exploding and showering us with hot bits of mud and ooze.  One splotch struck my arm leaving a burn mark before I could wipe the offending mass away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Princess had no such ability to protect herself, and she would jump and squeal whenever the splatter hit its mark.  However, she had turned into a real trooper, and she kept trudging along.  A couple of times, she stopped and backed up before choosing another route.  I gave her free rein.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering our rocky start, I found it amazing that I now trusted Princess so implicitly.  What was even more amazing was that I somehow knew the serpent was telling the truth.  Not necessarily that I could trust him, just that in this case, he was telling the truth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a curse and a shrill neigh from behind us as a particularly nasty bubble exploded.  I shifted to look and almost fell out of the saddle laughing.  Embrey looked like he had been indulging in a rather extended mud bath.  I sobered when I realized that some of those mud splatters were probably going to leave a few nasty burn marks, and I probably didn\u2019t look much better.  Embrey\u2019s eyes shot me daggers, so I decided discretion might be the better part of valor in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned and urged Princess on.  After several more minutes and a few more mud splats, one of which landed on my head singing off a bit of my hair, we reached the edge of the mud pits.  I sighed.  My father had been as bald as an egg; I did not need anything hurrying the process along.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSire Keravin?\u201d Embrey called from behind.  \u201cIs that a waterfall I hear up ahead?\u201d  I paused, and I too heard the distant roar of a water cascading over rocks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you be thinking we might be in need of a bath, Sir Embrey?\u201d I asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbrey smirked, \u201cJust thinking of your comfort, Sire.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Princess must have read my mind because she picked up the pace and headed straight for the rushing sound.  It wasn\u2019t long before the path opened up to reveal a pool at the base of a small waterfall\u2014maybe 25 feet.  Moonlight shimmered on the water and lush vegetation surrounded the oasis.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbrey and I jumped from our mounts and yanked their saddles from their backs. As soon as my horse had been cared for, I dove into the water and came up sputtering.  The cold left me momentarily breathless, but oh so refreshed.  I splashed about rubbing at my clothes and hair trying to remove the mud that had begun to cake on.  I finally realized I was going to have to strip in order to get truly clean.  Since I had never been terribly modest, this didn\u2019t bother me too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I pulled off my tunic, however, I noticed something a bit odd.  I wasn\u2019t sure if it was my imagination or not, but I could swear that my arms were bulging with muscles just a bit more than they had the day before.  I felt like a young boy who had just discovered his muscles.  I held up my arm and pumped my fist.  Sure enough, there were real muscles there, the kind that might actually be able to lift something.  What\u2019s more, there was real hair on my chest, lots of dark curly hair.  Now, I know that wasn\u2019t there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced over to see if Embrey had noticed these changes, but Princess caught my eye.  She was splashing around in the other end of the pool and had managed to cleanse herself of most of the mud.  Had she grown a couple of hands?  Surely not, and her coat.  What once had been a dingy mottled coat was now gleaming white, with a mane that would leave any woman to shame.  I looked closer to see if I could see her ribs or backbone but only healthy horseflesh greeted my eyes.  Princess met my eye, and I swear she winked at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Embrey!\u201d I shouted thinking to ask if he had noticed anything strange.  However, I decided I didn\u2019t want him to think I was anymore of a fool than he already did.  \u201cAre you coming in?\u201d Embrey was still working on cleaning his armor and his saddle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn just a bit, Sire. A knight always takes care of his armor and horse first.  It could mean his life someday, you know?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t really know, but I wasn\u2019t going to point out my ignorance.  Then another strange thought occurred to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Embrey? If you know I\u2019m not really the king, why do you call me Sire?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbrey shrugged, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to slip up if we meet others along the journey.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbrey wasn\u2019t meeting my eyes.  I wondered why?</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1,154 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As we dressed, I noticed that my clothes fit a little tighter.  I walked over to Princess, admiring her gleaming white coat. She nudged my shoulder and nickered her agreement.  She was liking the way she looked too. Embrey though seemed not to have noticed our transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSire, let\u2019s mount up,\u201d Embrey called.

I had felt peaceful and relaxed back at the pool, but slowly a sense of unease came over me.  I felt a thousand eyes peering at me, watching my every move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gripped the reins a little tighter and must have communicated my unease to Princess.  She started side-stepping and fighting any forward movement.  What had the serpent said? \u201cThe second will be the giant spider of Archaidia.\u201d  I really didn\u2019t like spiders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmbrey,\u201d I whispered, \u201chold up.\u201d He too seemed to be struggling to control his horse.  I dismounted and searched my saddlebag for a cloth I could use to bind Princess\u2019s eyes.  Finding nothing, I tore my sleeve from my left arm.  The darn thing was ripping out anyway.  Princess didn\u2019t appreciate being blind and she snorted her displeasure.  \u201cHey, cover your horse\u2019s eyes,\u201d I instructed Embrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d His face mirrored his confusion, and I recalled he had not been privy to my conversation with the serpent.  I\u2019m not sure he would have trusted him even if he had heard it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust trust me on this one okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust you?\u201d Embrey snorted much as Princess had which I found amusing. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmbrey, there is a giant spider up there, and if we don\u2019t cover our horses\u2019 eyes and our ears she will deceive us.  If that happens, we are dead.\u201d  Embrey rolled his eyes and whirled his mount to head down the trail.  \u201cEmbrey, please!\u201d But it was no use.  Beside me Princess danced and pulled on the reins.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, girl,\u201d I murmured. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this.\u201d In the next moment, I wasn\u2019t so sure. A piercing scream silenced the sound of the woods and all grew quiet as death.  I feared for Embrey but knew there was nothing I could do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was alone now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft whisper reached my ears, \u201cSo Sire, you dare to enter my web? You can save your friend, you know\u2014\u201c I snatched some remaining scraps from my sleeve and stuffed them into my ears.  I could hear nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, I stepped forward. Princess was blind and I was deaf. We had to rely on each other.  My heart thumped in my chest and sweat dripped down my back.  The smell of fear and sweat mingled in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI inched down the trail, being careful not to trip on any roots or rocks.  Princess strained at the reins, and I knew if I lost my hold she would bolt.  She was my lifeline.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my other hand I held my sword, but remembering the serpent\u2019s instructions, I looked neither left nor right.  Unfortunately, he had failed to tell me what to do if I met the Queen head on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI froze as a rather hairy appendage blocked my path followed by the most monstrous spider I had ever seen.  She must have been eight feet tall with the blackest thickest hair covering her entire body.  I stepped back and looked up. Large beady black eyes transfixed mine.  Her fangs clicked, and I could tell she was speaking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess yanked back on the reins, but I held firm and lifted my sword preventing the creature from advancing on me any further.  It reared on its hind legs and swatted at me.  I sliced at the attacking appendage and watched in horror as I cleaved it in two, blood spurting from the wound.  On the ground the amputated limb twitched and stilled.  Judging on the movement of the monsters mouth, I was sure it was screeching in pain, but I could not hear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning the creature charged at me, and Princess reared, lifting me from the ground.  Dangling from the reins, I swung the sword and plunged it up and under the monster\u2019s mouth.  It pierced its mouth, and deeper still.  I knew the moment it reached the brain because the spider tumbled taking both Princess and me with it in a tangle of hairy legs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the melee, one of my earplugs fell out and the reins slipped from my grasp.  I pawed at the prickly legs, desperate to find the reins.  Black on black in the moonlight made them invisible. I heaved one large appendage off of me and struggled to free myself, thinking I could at least reach my horse. I could hear her neighing in frantic confusion. Before I could break free, Princess managed to gain her feet and bolted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried whistling but my mouth was so dry nothing more than a squeak emerged.  Even if I had been successful, I doubt Princess would have returned. So much for our imagined partnership; not that I blamed her much.  I looked down at the hideous creature and shivered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when I heard it\u2014the clicking and rustling sounds of thousands of spiders. I turned and glanced behind me, my blood turning to ice.  Every inch of the trail from the ground to the tallest tree was covered in a web crawling with tiny spiders.  I turned and watched as the web began to extend up the sides of the trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing I would soon be trapped, I vaulted over the dead queen and sprinted down the trail after Princess.  I had never been the fastest runner but the adrenaline fueling my blood gave me wings.  I could hear the spiders behind me continuing to weave their deadly web but I wasn\u2019t looking back to check their progress.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow far I could run I would never know because as I rounded the corner in the trail, there stood a miracle.  Gleaming in the moonlight with her back to me, Princess waited, bobbing her head as if to urge me on.  I needed no such encouragement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping, I landed in the saddle, snatched the reins, and dug in my heels.  Princess needed no encouragement either and took off like a young filly determined to win her first race.</font></span>      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1,155 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She began to slow and her breathing became labored, taking deep heaving breathes.  I knew that even with her renewed youth and vigor we would have to slow or I would risk losing her.  Somehow being on foot in this wooded land of horrors didn\u2019t appeal to me.  Plus, I had become a might fond of my traveling companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I slowed Princess to a walk, I checked behind us for any sign of the creepy crawlies but could detect nothing.  I could only pray that they were not interested in capturing me and more interested in caring for their dead queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered for the countless time, what had happened to my other companion and protector, Sir Embrey.  I feared the Queen of Archadia had killed him or worse.  I shuddered to think of being injected with a spider\u2019s venom and then being devoured from within by its digestive juices.  As a child I had studied a bug meeting its fate that way.  I could only hope that Embrey had died first.  Though he may have been a pompous, arrogant jerk at times, he did not deserve that fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn\u2019s fingers began creeping over the horizon as I rounded the next bend in the road.  Though moonlight had lit most of our way, I hoped that the coming daylight would dispel the sinister shadows that seemed to haunt the trail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait.  Hadn\u2019t the old serpent warned of a third peril more deadly than the last two.  Now, that wasn\u2019t a pleasant thought.  What had he said? \u201cIt comes in the form of a friend or foe.  Trust no one.\u201d   What exactly did that mean? I could see not trusting a foe but not a friend either?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReminded me of an old wise man from my village from when I was but a scrawny young lad.  I had been complaining about a friend cheating at a game, and he had simply said, \u201cWith friends like that, who needs enemies?\u201d  I did not understand until much later that he was questioning my choice of friends.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould that apply to this riddle? And who was the friend and who was the foe?  I was alone out here except for Princess.  The serpent had said \u201cTrust no one,\u201d but I doubted that applied to my horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t even real sure where I was, where I was going, or what I was supposed to do once I got there.  That had been Embrey\u2019s job and I had been too much of a sniveling coward to insist on knowing the details.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess snorted and pulled up.  My head snapped up, and I focused on the trail ahead.  What in the heavens? The trail divided in a fork, but that was not what held my rapt attention.  To the left, sat Sir Embrey on his midnight stallion.  He smiled and nodded as if nothing was amiss.  To the right sat Sir Gavin on a sorrel steed.  He was dressed from head to toe in armor, but I could tell it was him because of his eyes and a shock of red hair that shown through the open face shield.  He was also scowling at me as he was often want to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, trying to gather my wits, \u201cfancy meeting you two here. Out for a morning jaunt are you?\u201d Sir Gavin\u2019s scowl deepened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSire, this is no time for joking.  We must get you back to the castle where you will be safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Embrey\u2019s horse took a restless step forward. \u201cSire, if you return to the castle, you will be a dead man.  Night Haven is this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat back in my saddle, crossing my arms over the horn with the reins dangling between my hands. I was hoping to effect a rather casual pose, though I was feeling anything but relaxed.  I studied the two men.  Who could I trust?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Embrey, how did you escape the Queen of Archadia? Frankly, I thought you dead.  I know I heard you scream.\u201d The last I said to get a reaction out of him. Though but minutes ago, I had mourned his demise, I now found myself furious to find him very much alive.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbrey sputtered, \u201cI did no such thing. Knights do not scream\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut they do,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cleave their king behind to face such a hideous creature?\u201d I raised an eyebrow in challenge.  Which fault would he admit? Either way he was a coward and I would see him exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, Sire,\u201d he argued.  \u201cThe Queen had captured and bound me.  I lay but a few feet from the trail, helpless to move or even, as you suggest, scream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, pray thee, Sir.  How did you escape?\u201d  The words of the serpent slid through my memory\u2014\u2014Trust no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Embrey shrugged, \u201cThe Witch of Glen Eives had cast a spell of protection on me.  Though the Queen of Archadia was more powerful, her hold on me loosened once she was dead.  It took some time for her poison to fade but once it did I awoke to find my horse nearby.  I immediately raced to catch up with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCatch up?\u201d I asked. \u201cHow did you arrive here before me?  You didn\u2019t pass me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbrey shrugged, \u201cA short cut, of course.\u201d  I turned to Sir Gavin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how did you find me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was easy, Sire,\u201d Sir Gavin replied, his deep voice rumbling. \u201cNight Haven is where the king has sought sanctuary. It only made sense that you would seek him out and try to dissolve the agreement between the two of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why would I be safer back at the castle instead of following the plan you surmise I have made?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause Sir Embrey never planned for you to reach Night Haven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d roared Embrey, pulling his sword from his sheath.  \u201cYou shall pay for besmirching my honor. I have done nothing but serve and protect Sir Keravin, as ordered by my King.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shut your trap, Embrey! You know very well that if Sir Keravin reaches Night Haven, he will have proven himself in valor and wisdom, and as such, his brother intends to abdicate the throne to him in truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped, \u201cWhoa!\u201d Both men turned back to me. \u201cWhat do you mean my brother? My brother the King?\u201d My voice ended on a squeak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Gavin nodded, \u201cAye, and meet your twin brother, Sir Embrey, younger than you by five minutes, making you the heir to the throne.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Embrey smirked, \u201cHello, big brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo with me out of the way, you become king? Why didn\u2019t you just do away with me somewhere along the trail?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u201d sighed Sir Embrey, \u201cThe Witch of Glen Eives cast a spell on me at our birth that prevents me from being directly responsible for any harm coming to you.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid she cast the same spell on me?\u201d I ground out, and Embrey actually backed his horse up a pace or two.  \u201cAnd I still don\u2019t understand,\u201d I continued completely furious now, \u201chow going anywhere with you, Sir Gavin, is in my best interest either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess there is no harm in revealing all now.\u201d Sir Gavin pulled his sword from his own sheath and before either of us could move had detached Sir Embrey\u2019s head from his neck. \u201cNo,\u201d Sir Gavin continued, \u201cIt\u2019s really not in your best interest as I am in truth a Prince of the House of Martell. The plan was simple really.  Once the King went into hiding to escape his assassins, we would finish off both of his heirs.  With no heirs, he would either have to return or we would hunt him down and finish the dog wherever he was hiding.  In fact, as we speak, a force is on its way to Knight Haven to do exactly that.\u201d An evil smile lit Sir Gavin\u2019s eyes.  He raised his sword and spurred his horse toward me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI surprised Sir Gavin\u2014and myself\u2014by spurring Princess toward the fight instead of away from it.  I had my sword between his chain mail and through him before he could even blink.  The force swept him off of his horse, taking my sword with him.  He lay there on the ground staring up at me in surprise. I dismounted and retrieved my weapon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Gavin gasped as if trying to say something.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomebody should have told you not to under estimate the House of Stark,\u201d I said.  With that parting comment, I turned back to my faithful steed and mounted.  However, as I turned back toward the trail, I found it once again barred by my friend the serpent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done, S-Sire,\u201d he hissed. \u201cI s-see you have filled out s-some s-since I last s-saw you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you wouldn\u2019t know anything about that would you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might.\u201d He bobbed his head, \u201cI trus-st you will remember me when you are king?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared for a moment unsure how far to trust. At last, I decided I would need all of the alliances I could gain, and I rather liked the new me. \u201cIf it be within my power and is honorable, I vow I shall remember you,\u201d I said, hoping I had not just sold my soul to the devil.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serpent nodded and said, \u201cThe king awaits you in Night Haven.\u201d</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1583 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Sometime around noon, I emerged from the wooded path.  Before me lay a small keep nestled in the valley below.  Conscious of Sir Gavin\u2019s threats that a force was on its way to kill the King, I scanned the surrounding countryside.  The peaceful scene belied any treachery.  Only a few trees and a handful of sheep dotted the landscape.  A lazy brook meandered through the rolling hills.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene would have made a beautiful scene, but as a defensive position it was a joke.  The enemy would automatically have the high ground and no moat surrounded the small castle.  I doubt the property housed 50 knights.  What was the king thinking? And who named it Night Haven?  Please, more like Invitation to Raid at Night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spurred Princess, and we quickly reached gate, which was wide open.  As we galloped into the courtyard no one challenged our entry.  I slid off Princess and tossed her reins to a stable boy who had hurried out to greet me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, see that she\u2019s properly cared for and where might I find the King?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe King, Sir?\u201d The boy scrunched up his little nose.  \u201cThere\u2019s no King here.\u201d  No King? A sense of foreboding settled over my shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen where is the Lord of the Manor?\u201d I asked, hoping he might have some answers.  The lad pointed to the stone building off to the right of the courtyard.  \u201cThank ye.\u201d  I hurried over and knocked on the door.  I cook answered the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes? What kin I do fer ye?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to speak to the Lord of the Manor, if you please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord Channing? What would ye be wantin with the like o\u2019 him?\u201d She eyed me with distrust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for someone and I hope he can help me.  The House of Stark would be very appreciative if you would please.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened and then she cackled as if she knew some inside joke. \u201cOh, it would, would it?\u201d she asked.  Opening the door wider, she bid me enter and have a seat in the drawing room.  Soon shuffling feet scraped the floor.  I looked up and gasped, surging to my feet to take a knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, pish posh! Now, rise,\u201d said the King.  \u201cI am Lord Channing here.\u201d He gestured for me to take a seat. \u201cI\u2019ve been expecting you for some time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI eyed the King shocked by his countenance.  His once tall and robust figure had shrunk into that of an old man.  His once handsome complexion was now marred by wrinkles and a scraggly beard.  Had it not been for his shocking blue eyes I might not have recognized him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSire?\u201d I managed. \u201cOr should I say, brother?\u201d The king smiled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may call me, Orion, if you please.  It is true you are my brother and Embrey was your twin brother.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas? Then you know?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, the witch of Glen Eives is here and we have been shall we say monitoring your progress.  I saw Embrey fall.  I loved him, but the world will be a better place without him.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, puzzled by his matter of factness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King shrugged. \u201cEmbrey\u2019s soul was dark and poisoned by envy.  He discovered too early in life who he really was and that panted the seed of envy.  He has been plotting to steal the throne since he was a young lad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, can you please explain to me how I am your brother? I was raised in Hampshire as a lowly Lord.  I haven\u2019t even been a very good one at that.  And what happened to you?  The last time I saw you, you were a robust warrior.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King shook his head sadly.  \u201cFor many months now that robust look has been thanks to the Witch of Glen Eives.  She has masked the ravages of this malady that racks my body.  A few weeks ago, she warned me that she could not maintain the cover for much longer.  She also could not hide your identity much longer.\u201d He glanced at me fondly.  \u201cWhen our father discovered your birth, his wife the Queen was insanely jealous.  She cursed your birth and proclaimed that Embrey would be responsible for your death.  To prevent this, my father enlisted the Witch of Glen Eives\u2019s help.  She has always been loyal to the House of Stark.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Witch of Glen Eives was more powerful than the sorcerous the Queen used.  She was able to undo much of the damage but not all.  For your safety, it was decided both of you would be separated and hidden away.  Embrey was sent to live with a close cousin, and you were sent to live with a dear friend Sir Keravin.  Unfortunately, the Queen discovered the whereabouts of Embrey.  She used her money and position to plant people near him who would poison him against you and the throne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d I interjected, \u201cWasn\u2019t the Queen your mother? You speak of her as if she were some evil hag.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d sighed the King, \u201cShe was both. When she passed from this world, I grieved for the mother I wish she had been.  Just as I will grieve for the brother I wish Embrey had been.  It is that way in families sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, explain the muscle thing?  Was that the serpent? The witch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, the answer is both.\u201d The king smiled.  \u201cThe serpent is the Witch of Glen Eives in disguise.  You were never quite as scrawny as you thought but that was necessary for your disguise.  Your adoptive family was not the most brawny of creatures and you would have stood out.  Questions would have been asked.\u201d  The King eyed me a bit. \u201cThough I do think she might have been a bit excessive with the new you.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cThat might not last, but no matter.  A bit of training and you will beef up in no time.\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Princess?\u201d I asked feeling a bit perturbed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, she was disguised as a nag. Couldn\u2019t have Embrey knowing you were riding a horse from the King\u2019s stable, now could we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, this is all good, but what now?  Do you know that the House of Martell is on its way to kill you and steal our lands?\u201d  I stood up and began pacing back and forth.  The King eyed me warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and I shall let them do me the favor of ending my suffering.  But by that time, you shall be crowned King and shall be long gone from here.  By the time they figure out they have killed the former King, you will have returned to the Castle and will have marshalled our defenses.  I have made alliances with the House of Targaryen, the House of Arryn, and the House of Nights Watch.  Each have promised their finest knights to join us in battle.  They have all agreed to follow you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d I protested, \u201c I am no knight, no strategist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are more than you know, brother.\u201d  The King rang a bell near his chair. \u201cThere are several knights whom you can trust implicitly.  I have written their names on a scroll for you.  They will guide you and teach you everything you need to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Sire?\u201d A maid had silently entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring me my scrolls and summon the Bishop and the knights.\u201d </span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 1,237 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Right away.\u201d She bowed and backed from the room.  In almost time, Bishop VanGrew glided into the room.  Behind him three page boys followed each carrying an assortment of items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are ready, my liege?\u201d He asked the King.  The Bishop\u2019s eyes, heavily lidded held great sorrow.  The last time I had seen him he had been full of mischief, but not now.  The carried on his shoulders a great cloak of sadness.  When the King nodded, the Bishop turned to me and asked, \u201cAre you ready, my prince?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady for what?\u201d I said, feeling completely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady to become king, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, \u201cUh, no.  I can\u2019t.  He\u2019s still capable.\u201d I gave my head another shake. \u201cI can never take his place.\u201d I felt tears burn the back of my eyes. I felt overwhelmed, terrified\u2026. And somehow like I was losing a brother I never knew I had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you will never take his place, but you will be King in your own right,\u201d The Bishop said. \u201cTo refuse is to leave the House of Stark and this kingdom without a king.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, then when he dies, but not until then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother, you must,\u201d the King coughed, and gasped for breath.  \u201cI will be dead in days of natural causes and in hours if the House of Martell has its way.  For the Kingdom\u2019s sake, you must take the crown.\u201d His eyes pleaded with me. \u201cPlease?\u201d I felt myself sink as I stared my destiny in the face.  I glanced at the Bishop and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I knew it, I was kneeling before the Bishop vowing to protect and honor the House of Stark. I could hear him praying in Latin as he placed the heavy crown on my head, making me truly the King of Stark.  Our only witnesses were a few page boys, a maid, a cook and a half-dozen knights who had seemingly materialized out of nowhere.  I briefly wandered where the Witch of Glen Eives was but dismissed the thought.  After all, it wouldn\u2019t do I suppose to have a witch and a Bishop in the same room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I rose, my brother feebly pushed himself from the chair.  He took me by both shoulders and stared me in the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered a tear in the corner of his eye. \u201cNow, I can rest knowing that our kingdom is in good and noble hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could respond, one of the knights, a Sir Mardune, stepped up. \u201cSire?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d my brother responded but grinned sheepishly when he realized what he had done. He looked at me, nodding for me to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes?\u201d I asked, feeling like a fraud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSire,\u201d Sir Mardune answered, \u201cWe must make haste.  Ours spies tell us that the House of Martell is but an hour away.  We must leave now.\u201d  With that the house and knights erupted into a frenzy of activity.  Within minutes, I, along with an accompaniment of six knights, headed out on horseback in the opposite direction that Martell would come.  I looked back one last time.  Despite the ravages of age and disease, a noble man stood there, his hand half-raised in a gesture of goodbye. </span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count = 537 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He seemed hesitant to speak so I decided to help him along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Mardune, is there something on your mind?\u201d I glanced sideways at him. \u201cSpeak, please.  I\u2019m counting on you and the others to guide me through this. I need your complete honesty and your frankness.  Don\u2019t worry about offending me. I promise you shall keep your head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Mardune nodded and grinned. \u201cOf course, Sire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d I prompted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe scouts say we are now being followed. I don\u2019t believe your brother gave us much time before the Martell\u2019s discovered our trail.  We must pick up the pace if we wish to reach our reinforcements.  I would also suggest that we send messengers ahead, asking those reinforcements to prepare for battle.  We could lead them into a trap, if you will.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou give sound advice, Sir Mardune.  Who is our quickest messenger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLars, Sire.\u201d Sir Mardune motioned for a young scout to join us.  The lad could not be more than 15 summers.  He was fresh-faced and eager to please.  Sir Mardune leaned over and spoke quietly.  Lars nodded and then spurred his horse.  The two shot off like a rabbit I had once seen flee from a fox.  I just hoped the fox that chased us would not catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, we crested a hill and halted in awe.  Thousands of knights lay in wait.  They and their horses were decked out in full armor, their weapons at a ready.  I grinned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Mardune? How many men do you think the Martells have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \u201cScouts suggest half of the force in front of us.  They think they are chasing a small contingency, protecting their king.  They have no idea our allies have joined us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we waited in the hot son.  From a distance, the sound of a small army moving over the countryside reached our ears.  The enemy was making no attempt to hide its progress.  They probably thought we were on the run and they just had to catch us.  Well, keep coming, Martell.  We shall let you catch us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of our scouts burst over the hill and skidded his horse to a halt in front of us.  Both he and his horse gasped for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, there young sir,\u201d I said. \u201cTake a breath and give your report.\u201d The boy sucked in several breaths until he was calm enough to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSire, 300 knights are about 10 minutes behind me.  I think they saw me so they may be weary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Sir Mardune. \u201cThere goes our element of surprise,\u201d I said.  \u201cUnless\u2026.\u201d I drifted off thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSire?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I take a small portion of our knights up to the crest and pretend to stand our ground and fight? Then when the battle turns against us, and it will, we will turn and pretend to run right over this hill.\u201d I grinned. \u201cAnd the Martells will chase us right over that hill and right into our laps.\u201d  Sir Mardune nodded in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could work, except for one thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way will we allow our King to be at the front.  We can\u2019t risk losing you.  We will need a decoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I insisted.  \u201cI understand your concern, but they have to see me.  There can be no doubt or they will be suspicious.  Plus, my knights must know that I am willing to fight with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSire, since you asked for frankness, you are no trained knight.\u201d Sir Mardune\u2019s expression revealed his angst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but Princess and I have gotten really good at running.\u201d I smirked when Mardune raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, \u201cAll right, but only if I am by your side.  I am much better at fighting than I am at running.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d We turned in unison and gathered a small force.  As we crested the hill, my heart stopped.  Other than my skirmishes over the last 24 hours, I had no battle experience.  \u201cMerciful, Father,\u201d I muttered. \u201cProtect us.\u201d I flipped my visor in place and waited for the Martells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were within a few hundred yards, I raised my sword and sceamed, \u201cFor House of Stark!\u201d I slashed my arm down and we lunged forward to meet the coming melee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two forces came together with a loud cacophony.  Swords slashed and clanged.  One nearly took my head off, but Mardune\u2019s sword met the incoming with such force the attacker was unseated.  I was really beginning to like that guy.  After giving enough to make it look as if we had tried, I gave the retreat cry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spun around and raced over the hill with the Martells right on our tail.  As they crested the hill, they tried to pull up when they saw the formidable force waiting for them.  Unfortunately, their sheer numbers pushed the ones in front forward into our trap.  In the meantime, a portion of our knights circled around the hill and flanked the Martell forces.  They had nowhere to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe showed no mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></font>Word count 851 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stepping from her embrace, I backed off and waved at the air, futilely. \"Next,\" I hissed, unable to draw enough breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumber Twenty-two though, took the grand prize in repulsiveness! At first I believed it to be an ugly man, pretending to be one of the sisters, but, then looking at her feminine body, I wasn't so sure. <i>Is that a mustache. It is, and it's better than any I've ever been able to grow.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!,\" I growled, just as the servant was about to call number twenty-one. \"Enough! I am tired, and we will resume this far...er, we will resume these proceedings at, say, 3:00. I made for the door at a brisk trot, and slammed the door on number twenty-two in the middle of her whining complaint at having not been chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 350 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

I've no doubt each will be an insult to my eyes or my nose, or my ears! How could one man have sire so many repulsive daughters?

I plopped down, wearier than a Mayfly in May. Thankfully my normally tardy servant had had the foresight to bring me up a flagon of good ale. I pulled the stopper and poured some into my golden goblet, and downed half of it in one long draught. \"Ah,\" I sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ill just rest my eyes for a second.\" My head spilled to the side, resting on my shoulder as I fell into a nightmare:  there were not just twenty-seven sisters now, but row, upon row, upon row of them, extending out as far as I could see and even beyond that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a screech from that ill-dressed servant, they all spun about at once, and every single one of them was identical to number twenty-two, complete with mustaches! \"Ahhh!\" I awoke drenched in sweat, my half-full goblet of ale had spilled into my lap and now lay on the floor in a small puddle, the rest having soaked into my royal breeches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBang!

And here I was forced stand again, forced to participate in this farce, trying to select one of them for my bride to be. \"Let's get on with it, man,\" I called to the balding servant. <i>A new one, and better dressed too. Probably just as much of an oaf as the other though.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Persnillica!\" His voice rang out, echoing off the high rafters of the assembly hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Persnillica!</i> \"what a stupid, stupid name,\" I grumbled to my Page, Embrey the Exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I quite agree, Sire,\" he whispered to me, rolling his blue eyes and, giving his head the minutest shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Persnickity Persnillica,\" I shot back at him, gafawing loudly, quite pleased with my alliteration.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was neither tall nor short, a little plump, but what man doesn't like something to grab onto. She approached us with her head down as if inspecting the stone tiles. When she stopped before us, I lifted her chin up gently, and gazed into two of the most lovely pools of blue. <i>A man could drown in those beauties.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile at her, and she gave me a timid grin, then immediately looked back down. I wondered what held her attention there, and I did the same. That was when I noticed her golden slippers. There was nothing remarkable about them, other than the fact that they covered two of the largest feet I'd ever seen. <i>Why, they're a size or two bigger than my own! And I've big feet for a man!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hands, young maid, may I see them.\" She'd had them tucked neatly behind her back as though hiding a surprise, and, oh, I got a surprise, alright! They were two of the biggest ham-hockers I'd ever, ever seen in my life. Why, they were bigger than Clem the Blacksmith's, and his were enormous. Before I could even signal for her to be escorted away, she turned, sniveling, and ran from the hall. Surely this had been a huge, not to be mean, but a huge problem for the lass in procuring herself a mate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly,\" I said loud enough for the remaining nineteen to hear, because at this point I just didn't care anymore, \"Are any of them even worth me looking at?\" And as though I hadn't said a word, the, now, in my opinion, cocky servant, called the next name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calinda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, now that's a pretty name, and perhaps she will match it.\" <i>Not with your luck, Tyrl. Who are you trying to kid?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the girl even turned, a wicked clap of thunder boomed overhead, shaking the rafters. Several of the maids screamed and covered their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Embrey! Find out how close that storm is, and inquire where the safest place in the castle is. Go on. Be quick about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Sire,\" the young man said, giving me a gracious little bow. He dashed to the door as only youth can, stuck his head out and spoke to several guards positioned outside the door. {My Royal Guard. My Royal pain-in-my-rump Guard, keeping me prisoner here more than protecting me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, Sire, and bring the maids, the storm...,\" His voice was chopped off by a massive crack of lightning, followed by thunder so loud I thought we'd all be permanently deaf...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 550 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check5.png\" alt=\"*Check5*\" title=\"Check5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></font></span></div></div>",

We stood beneath the arch that flanked the massive wooden door, now hanging askew. Like a twin brother answering his call, the thunder roared across the castle as though it would shake the very stones apart. Within seconds, our clothes lay plastered against our shivering bodies, for it was a cold rain. The maids, all twenty, huddled in the entrance, their faces pale with apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between gusts of wind, I shouted, \"Embrey, tell the girls we head for the lower levels of the castle after the next thunder!\" It didn't take long before the lightning lit the heavens again in multiple flashes, and I saw the skies were a swirling mass of violet and black bruises. Thunder crashed, and I raised my voice above the cacophony of the wind, \"Now! Get them moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbrey led the maids out of the hall, some holding hands with their sisters for comfort. Following the young man's lead, they dashed straight across the cobblestones to another archway that would lead them down to a lower level of the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hung back as another barrage of violence erupted overhead. I could see the last of the girls scampering in through the arch across the way, young Embrey ushering them in. When the last went through, he beckoned me to cross. I wave him off, motioning for him to go, and held up the pointer finger of my right hand. \"I'll be there in a moment!\" I shouted, but I knew the lad would not here with the pounding of the rain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I stood alone, drenched through and through, I bolted from the arch, but turned left, not toward the safety of the lower level. I ran on down a hill and through a cobblestone courtyard, through another massive arch, until I saw the object of my desire ahead. This was the Peddler's Gate, where deliveries were made day and night for the many needs of the lords, ladies and even commoners of the castle proper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few small kegs, most likely empty of ale or wine, were stacked against a closed shop. I snatched up one and hoisted it to my shoulder, then another I tucked under my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I drew closer to the gate, a guard stepped out from a small enclosure. Within I saw another guard, and a table strewn with playing cards and mugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is you business, sir?\" he asked, flinging the rain from his mop of dripping, black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wine keep wanted so many kegs, so I bring him so many kegs. Oh, no, he says to me, you bring too many. I should have shown him my fist, but Fagarro is too kind for such things,\" I told the guard. \"Now I must return them to my uncle, and in this storm. Ah, the life of a poor merchant, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then it began to hail in earnest, and the man wishing to get back inside, or get back to his card game, or maybe both, turned a key and flung open the small door, shooing me through. \"Try and stay dry, eh\" he said, turning and giving a wild laugh. He stepped within and slammed the door against the gusting wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free at last!\" I ran...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 556 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></font></span></div></div>",

I stopped, bending over to catch my breath. The rain still fell in torrents as I rubbed my sore muscles. Shaking my head from side to side did little to dispel the water from obscuring my vision. Through the mist I saw the forest looming to my right, and I made for it, slowly, as my legs were still quivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large pines offered some protection from the pelting rain as well as hiding me from anyone coming down the main road to the castle. On and on I marched, setting myself a brisker pace as I went. When I thought I could not take one more step, up ahead, I spied a small cave off to my left. It was man-made, tunneled out of a large hill, its entrance supported by a frame of oak beams. Scampering in, I could see nothing, not even my hand held aloft. I stood there, shivering from head to foot. <i>Tryl, you'll have pneumonia for sure if you stand here doing nothing.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertainly, I had not had time to prepare for this unexpected flight. I had no dry clothes. I had no dry kindling to attempt a fire to dry those I wore. Nor had I any provisions to sustain me. <i>Well, at least there's plenty of water, eh. Tyrl?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my eyes adjusted to the dimness of the cave, a faint light glowed further in. <i>Could their be King's Guards holed up in here?</i> I took a few tentative steps forward, the light growing brighter as I went. Tip-toeing the last few steps before a bend in the cave, I inched my head around the curve. One gray-haired old man in a tattered but dry cloak sat warming his hands over a small fire set in the middle of a tiny room. The smoke rose to a vent cut in the ceiling. I noticed a large wood-framed carrying pack lying off to the side. My stomach rumbled at the thought of food. Continuing to stare into the room, I tried to decide if this man would be a friend or a foe. {I]What, you couldn't take on one grandfather if need be, Tyrl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I still contemplated my options, the old man spoke in a leathery, cracked voice, \"You may come in, young man. Come share my fire, and warm yourself. Are you hungry?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" I said, stepping in and sitting across from him on the hard-packed dirt floor. I noticed he sat upon a nice padding of fresh pine needles and envied the comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to thank me, son. This particular shelter has stood here for eons, certainly before my time, and I am quite ancient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a closer look at him, I knew this to be more than true. His face was not just lined, it was a road map of deep crevices, which, oddly, gave him a kind of handsomeness, in a wise sort of way. His full head of gray hair shone like silver in the firelight. A matching beard and mustache accompanied his beautiful locks. A vibrancy vibrated about this old-timer. I couldn't lay my finger on why he made me feel so at ease. It was as if I'd known him, always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his pack closer, he opened the main portion and removed a second cloak. The outer layer had been sewn with supple light-tan leather, its inner lining a patchwork of winter-white fox fur. <i>It must have cost a fortune!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and strip off those soggy clothes, and use this while they dry,\" he said, proffering me the magnificent cloak. \"Keep it if you like, too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I..., I could never accept such generosity. That is the finest cloak I've ever seen! Are those real jewels on the golden clasp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are. And this cloak is more than it seems, young man, but I've no use for it after today,\" he informed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I said, rising and stripping off my uncomfortable clothing, while he began to explain.As he talked I used a few taller branches he had gathered and built several tripods, lashing them together with some leather cording the old man had in his large pack. I draped my soggy items over them, placing them near to the fire. Throwing the cloak around my shoulders, I plopped down by the fire, luxuriating in its soft warmth as the old man talked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, the cloak was a gift, from my own father many years ago. Are you familiar with the sir name of Galvarn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Galvarn..,\" I mused. It had a very familiar ring to it. Then it hit me! I let out a long whistle. Surely, you don't mean Gregor the Great?! Wasn't his sir name Galvarn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The very one,\" the old man said, a generous smile blooming on his face. That would be my father, and great he was. I fear I pale in his shadow, but I have tried, and that is all one can do. No? And, may I have your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyrl. Tyrl Keravin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keravin..., hmm, I do seem to recall hearing that name, though, it was a long, long time ago. It might be you've a connection to him, and if you are related..., and here he paused and said, oh, but forgive an old man's wanderings. Where were we? Oh, yes, my father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would guess it would be no small feat to match your famous father. How came he by this cloak, and do tell me what else is special about it, if you please, good sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis next simple statement rocked me back, and my jaw hung slack. \"It is a magical cloak, imbued with the magical property of invisibility, young man, though, I must worn you, there are many who seek it to this day. So I will let you decide how much of a gift you consider it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat there a few moments, absorbing all he'd said. He, in turn, stirred the fire, causing a shower of sparks to cascade up and out, like a firemaster's display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many are seeking this cloak, and exactly who will be looking for it?\" I asked him, a bit of apprehension creeping up my spine. <i>Nothing's ever free, is it, Tyrl?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the time being, you are more than safe,\" He said, though I thought I saw a twinkle of mischief in still-clear green eyes. \"Let us put that aside for now, and perhaps you'd enjoy a small feast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Feast? What could he possibly have in that bag that would constitute a feast?</i> \"I am quite famished, and I do thank you for your kind offer,\" I told him, my mouth beginning to water, my stomach to growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see,\" He spoke as if to himself. After much rummaging about in his pack, he proceeded to pull one item after another out. I sat there, dumbfounded. <i>No way is this possible!</i> Seeing the stunned expression on my face, he smiled again, and said. \"Oh, yes, it's a magical bag, too, if you hadn't already guessed that, Tyrl.\" He gave a chuckle, and spread the silk table cloth he'd pulled out with a flourish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, like an experienced house servant, he'd begun to dress our makeshift table. Feast was an inadequate word to describe it all: wines of two kinds, both white and red, and ale to boot, golden goblets to drink from, a fully cooked grouse, stuffed, he told me, with early onions, carrots and cabbage, there was fish, and curried lamb, and here he briefly described his visit to a far off island, where he'd procured the curry and other rare spices too, small finger bowls of varying sauces and dips to delight your taste buds he said, a variety of cheeses, nuts, fresh succulent berries, and on, and on, and on, finally ending with a selection of sweet treats, which had me salivating, having quite the sweet tooth as I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe set about devouring most all of it, and let me tell you, that old man could keep up with me, bite-for-bite! When we could eat not another morsel, we sighed in unison, \"Ahh..!\" I let out a loud belch, and we shared a laugh. Leaning back on my elbows, my gut far too extended, I waited patiently for the old man to renew his tale of the cape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, after I'd dozed for a few moments without meaning to, I noticed he'd packed it all up neat-as-a-pin. Feeling rather guilty for not doing my share, I offered to go out and collect more firewood for the night, but he just gave me another of his twinkle-eyed smiles, and said, \"Oh, there's no need for that. You catch my meaning, Tyrl\" He said, patting the bag...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1494 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

Not everything, young man. It cannot, for example, give you happiness, nor pride, nor ambition. Those are things you must see to for yourself. However, it might help you attain them. Though, people often have the wrong ideas about such things. For example: I had one  impoverished lordling, who had a heart filled with rage for his neighboring lord, who had absconded with some of his lands. Now, this not-so-bright lording wished for a magnificent warhorse, and a magical sword to brandish against his foe. I did try to explain to him, that vengeance rarely beets happiness, but he would have non of it. To cut to the chase, he rode that horse, and held that sword in single combat against his fellow lord, however, his horse, in full charge, stumbled upon a rock, and went crashing down with his leg splintering. The lord was pinned beneath him, where upon his foe jumped from his stallion, and pierced him through the heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very gallant to kill a man when he was incapable of defending himself,\" I cried out in anger, blushing at my outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're quite right there. But he was no Gregory the Great, this lord. My point being is to be careful what you expect from the bag. Now, I believe my old bones are in dire need of a rest. Morning will come soon enough, and we must be away before dawn, if you wish to make good your escape from your would-be-brides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, how did you know about that,\" I asked him. He never ceased to amaze me, this old man, and all of his magical ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, we shall leave for the morrow,\" He said, and with that he curled up on his soft bed of pine bows and within moments I hard the soft, purring of his rhythmic breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not so fortunate. I tossed and turned on my hard-packed bed of earth. Several times I removed small stones that were digging into me. <i> Does he really mean to give me this cloak, and, just imagine, if my pursuers do catch up with me, I can some how activate it, and be gone from their sight? I wonder if it is some word I must speak. Round and round went my thoughts, and it was hours later when I drifted off into a fitful sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dull light crept across my closed eyes, and somewhere someone whispered my name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyrl. Tyrl, they called again, and again. \"Wha...,what is it?\" I mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must awaken at once, Tyrl, for there are men fast approaching. Come, we must be quick? With that the old man gave me a none-to-gentle push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Okay!\" I grumped, sitting up and stretching. Within seconds he grabbed my arm and yanked me out of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spacarta! He yelled, hurting my ear. \"Say it! Spacarta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spacarta!\" I screamed, and poof, just like that the old man who had grasped my elbow disappeared before my eyes. Nor could I see my arm.

He was spry for someone who claimed to be ancient, and it was all I could do to keep up with him. I tried not to follow too closely after getting smacked in the face with a few pine branches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going to?\" I asked, stopping to catch my breath when we'd been plowing on for a good bit of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly there,\" and on we plunged, if anything, picking up more speed. Huffing and puffing, I followed along, for what else could I do. On my own, I would surely be apprehended by the King's Guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" the old man sighed, stopping so abruptly, I bumped into the back of him. He sat his large pack down and rummaged within it for a few moments. \"I know it's in here somewhere,\" he muttered. \"Yes. Yes. Just as I thought. Here it is!\" he called out with another of his famous smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" I asked, staring at the unusual stick he held. It was made of some smooth, dark wood I didn't recognize, and it had many intricate carvings on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Stick of Jamar,\" he told me as if I knew exactly what that would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes. Jamar was a wizard of renown in the 'Age of Dragons', don't you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I am a bit rusty on my 'Age of Dragon's' history,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another time, perhaps, I could catch you up on that, but for now, I think it best we slip away, don't you?\" Before I could answer, he thrust the stick out in front of himself, muttered something intelligible, and a bright, blue light spat from the end of the stick. At once a blue hole appeared in the hillside where he'd aimed it. \"This way! This way!\" he called out merrily as if we were on a grand adventure. I gulped, staring at the magic hole, swallowed my fear, and followed him through the shimmering light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took my eyes a few moments to adjust, but when they finally did, my mouth fell open, and I blinked several times to be sure what I saw was still there, was even real! \"My word!\" I said, dumbfounded. \"Where are we? Surely, we've left the King's forest!\" <i>And anywhere else you've ever been or even heard of Tyrl!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite impressive, no, Tryl,\" the old man chuckled! \"Have yourself a rest ,and look around at all the beauty of this magical place, Tyrl.

The grass I lay upon shimmered as though alive, a vivid green such as I'd never imagined, let alone saw before. Not even a dyer of queens' gowns could duplicate this shade, I had no doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough I wanted nothing more than to close my eyes and sleep for a week, I could not stop gazing around me, for everything from the grass, to the trees, to the bluer-than-blue water in the small, lazy stream sparkled.  It was as if some band of faeries had enchanted the whole of the land with their magic dust. Not that I believe in them, mind you. <i>Well. maybe I do now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head because it was a bit too much to take in all at once. I mean, the tress themselves were cast in shades of pinks, yellows, violets, and I even spotted one tree with velvet-soft leaves in blue! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tis beautiful,\" someone croaked in a raspy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked about, but  saw no one near. \"Where are you,\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I am here,\" came an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing all around now, I stood, and turned in a circle, but still no one was there that I could lay eyes upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gurgling chuckle came from the water, but when I looked, there sat only a lonely frog sunning himself upon a large rock in mid-stream. <i>Why not, Tyrl. Haven't the last twenty-four hours contained one incredulous thing after another?</i> \"Did you speak?\" I asked the frog, feeling a fool. When no reply came, I blushed, and spun about to resume laying on the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, young man,\" came another croaky reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped up and strode over to the, not green but orange with violet spots, frog. \"And what manner of thing are you?\" I asked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you tell?\" he chided me, rolling his large, bulbous eyes up. \"I am a prince,\" he said, sounding as if I should know this for a fact. \"Prince Valon, if you please. Though I've been stuck here in the condition you see me in for some years now. I could return home, but for one thing,\" he told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I tell you, you won't help me, and that I know for a fact. You see, in order for me to go, another must agree to take my place.  And I've yet to meet anyone who would agree to become a frog willingly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flung out his long golden tongue and snatched some queer insect from the air, gulping it down and smacking his thin lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tryl!\" cried the old man, who had crept up on us. \"Keep away from that one,\" he told me. \"Ever is she up to her old tricks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tricks?\" What sort of tricks? By its voice I thought it was male, \" I  said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. She's definitely a female. And did she tell you she was a prince, a prince in need of someone to take his place. No need to answer me as I've heard it a thousand times. She's a frog, and nothing more. Oh, granted, she can talk, but, then so can most of the creatures who call this place home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she gotten you to touch her slippery hide, no doubt you'd be croaking right alongside her by now. That's her game, always looking for a mate, and when she grows tired of her new mate, well, that's a tale for another day, Tryl. Come, now, we've things to attend to,\" he said, striding off in his usual hurried gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took one quick look back at the frog, but just as I turned, he..., er, she dove into the stream and swam out of view. I swiped my brow with the sleeve of my shirt, and ran to catch up to the old man...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 653 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </font></span></div></div>",

Sometimes a man of my age, who has seen it all before, forgets a whipper snapper, such as yourself, is still a bit wet behind his ears, and hasn't traversed the world, seen all its paths. Forgive me,\" he said, plopping down on a fallen log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" I gasped, still trying to catch my breath from our hurried trek. \"It's just that this place...,it's really something quite remarka..., just as I was about to finish my statement, a long and thunderous trumpeting sounded. It shook the<br>\r\nleaves of the myriad colored trees, and seemed to enter the core of my being. \"What is that ?\" I screamed at the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That,\" he said, pointing at the stream, which seemed to follow us where ever we went, was, none other than, my good friend, Jasperine,\" he said with some pride. \"Isn't she the loveliest creature you've yet laid eyes upon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...,but, she's a unicorn!\" I cried out, excited as a boy on 'Gift Giving Day'. \"Is she real?\" I stood gaping at her, and I do not lie when I say, she was magnificent:  standing two hand taller than the tallest horse ever born, I was sure, and her hide was a shade of white that nearly blinded me, but it was her horn that I gaped at! It was ridged, thick at one end, tapering to a very sharp point. Each ridge held a color, of which I cannot say, for I had never seen these colors, nor were they a blend of any colors I knew. How this could be, I knew not. That would mean they would have to add another few colors to the rainbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I approach he.., her?\" I asked him. Is she tame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, tame is not a word I would use to describe Jasperine, but, yes. You may approach her. She's awfully fond of those fronds growing near where you stand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached out and plucked a handful, shaking off the dirt from the roots. With slow steps, I drew near to her, my extended hand proffering my gift and shaking like a leaf. \"Hello, girl,\" I whispered withe awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, yourself, handsome,\" she said with a snort and a stamp of her front hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when my legs went weak, and I plunged head first to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was pushing my head from side to side, and I felt cool water roll across my face. \"Whaa..., stop it, \" I cried out, sitting up. \"What happened? I said, my head in a fog, I shook it to clear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just the usual reaction to Jasperine, when someone realizes unicorns are real,\" he told me. He stood by the stupendous beast, gently stroking her between her blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the whole of this place is a lot to take in all in one day, and Jasperine, well, I guess she was my limit of surprises. Does this land..., this path as you say, have a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a name such as you or I or someone  say <i>not on the path</i> would name it. I simply call it 'Here'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here? That's an odd name, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot so, young man. We are not there, but we are here,\" He chuckled, moving away from Jasperine and plunking back down on his log. \"We'll rest here for the night, since she showed up. I was hoping she would. It will cut our travel time down considerably,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mean she will allow us to ride her?\" I gaped at him, shaking my head and staring at the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly,\" he said as if I should know this as certain as the sun rises every morning. But let us make beds of some of those purple pine-like leaves, for I grow weary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so we settle down for the night, comfortable in our beds, Jasperine munching contentedly on the luminous grass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 740 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though the unicorn had run swiftly, jumped, and, yes, flew, for many a mile, no lather graced her pure-white skin, nor did she breathe as though labored in the least. No horse I had ever ridden shared such endurance as this mighty creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy that, Tyrl?

I had always loved the woods and had spent many a pleasant day enjoying its scenes. Now, it seemed the beauty had been whisked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chin up, young Tyrl,\" There is still much beauty to be found here as well. You must search harder for it is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" I muttered, not quite believing the old man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt strange to be afoot again after riding the unicorn for more than a day. I missed the power of the beast that radiated through my thighs as we had ridden her.

In that, I mean you should not use it for mere personal gain. Those who seek wealth for wealth's sake will come to no good end. The bag, it has a life of its own. It senses a man's true spirit. Abuse it, and it will do the same in kind to you. It is a rare and wondrous thing created by a powerful, but good-hearted wizard, long ago. His name, well, even I do not recall his name. No, so long ago lived he, that no one but the bag knows who he was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced sideways at my travelling companion, still remaining quiet.

The colors with no names were becoming but a faded tapestry, something I may have dreamed, perhaps. The melancholy bled away as well, and my mood lightened, so that when the old man graced me with another one of his twinkling smiles, I returned one of my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Here we are, just as I told you. Wait until you taste the water from this spring, young Tyrl. It will be like nothing you've ever had before. I guarantee you,\" he said as we both knelt before the crystal clear pool. It gurgled and sent little ripples out, growing wider until they splashed against its sides in small waves. I could not see the bottom, though I peered intently into it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon's Pool,\" he stated. It was named for a very brave young prince-ling. Unfortunately, he was lost in the wilds north of here, and no one ever knew what became of the boy. But that too was many, many years ago.\" As he went on, he rummaged in his large, bulky pack, at last producing an intricately carved silver cup, which he dipped into the pool. \"Try it, Tyrl. You won't be disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI  took the handsome cup from him and brought it to my lips. I closed my eyes, trying to decipher the intense flavor it had. Then it hit me. Once as a very young lad, I had traveled far south with my father and mother. A sad occasion it was, though, as we went to attend the burial of my father's father. But while we were there, my father's sister, Annala, her name was, gave me a fruit I had never tasted before, as it grew not north of there, and she called it a Tangerillo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What flavor did you get?\" the old man said, startling me from my memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tangerillo,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the cup from me and took a long draught, draining the full amount he had dipped out. \"Coconut!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coco what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coconut. It grows on tall trees on islands many days to the southwest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does a co-co-nut taste like a tangerillo, then?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good heavens, no!\" he laughed. They taste nothing alike. I'm afraid I've had a bit of fun at your expense, young friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, I told him. That's a magic cup, right? And everyone who trys it, gets a different flavor. No?\" We both laughed, and he clapped me on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're learning,\" the old man said, delight pulling up the corners of his mouth. \"And, now, I am afraid I must leave you. Don't look so sad for we shall meet again, but I cannot say exactly when.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, we came together in an awkward embrace, then I stepped back, and he put his hand upon my shoulder. I felt it quiver beneath his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll do well, Tryl. Everything in the pack has its purpose, which you'll soon discover along your journey. Try and remember all I've told you, and be a man your mother would be proud of. I can ask nothing more. Now I must go as the hour has grown late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took out his magic stick that made the blue holes, pointed it toward the far side of the meadow we stood in, and sprang through the shimmering waves. I saw him, as if in a mist, turn and wave farewell, which I did in turn, though he'd already vanished by then.

I smiled, put the pack back on my back, said the word again to deactivate its magic, because it was unnerving not being able to see one's own hands and feet as you moved, and then I set of at a brisker pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gone, and still he's somehow pushing me faster,\" I said, but only a lone chipmunk chided in answer. I missed the cheerful conversations I'd share with him. Theses unfamiliar surroundings suddenly seemed very lonely indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rustle of leaves off to my right and the pounding of many boot heels sent my heart racing. Turning, I spied them. The King's guard, dressed in their black tunics, breastplates and helms sparkling in the late-afternoon sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There he is!\" one of them called. At once they all came flying from the surrounding woods. So many! I stood frozen, flinging my head all around, looking for any means of escape. But they surrounded me on every side, swords drawn, glares on their strong-jawed faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you'd escape your duty with the maids, eh, Tyrl?\" their captain, whom I recognized, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there like a treed dog, cowering before their might, eyes round, sweat pouring down my back. And, then..., \"Spacarta,\" I half-croaked even as I began to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the name of the good king!\" I heard the captain holler. But by then, I was deep into the wood and making all haste to put more distance between us. Their voices became murmurs as I fled on\u2014smiling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 451 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

Borrowing a trick I'd learned from the old man, I set about gathering up fresh pine bows, nipping them off with my knife from the bottom branches. These I laid in a semi-secluded spot between a large bolder and a small hill. It would at least provide shelter from the wind, which had picked up in the last hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down on my comfy bed, I gazed up through gaps in the pine's canopy. The sky a velvet-black canvas with tiny pin pricks of stars. I picked out a few clusters I recognized, and one, suspiciously appeared to form a unicorn. My eyes began to droop, my head nestled into the fragrant bows, then sleep claimed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\"La, la, la, la, my heart beats fast<br>\r\nfor spring has come to me at last...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" I sat up with a groan. Sometime during the night I had shifted onto a sizable rock, and this I now dug out from under me and tossed it off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is there?\" a girls soft voice said, and I could here a touch of fear in the little quiver it held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tis only me, Tyrl. A wandering young man who makes the forest his home,\" I answered. <i> A wandering young man who...,that was lame, Tyrl!</i> \"May I ask your name, and why you are out here in the middle of nowhere, all alone?\" I asked her, searching to see if I could spot her. She must have been well hidden, because I failed to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know you're not a rogue? A fiend? A man who makes sport of young maidens,?\" she asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought I heard a rustle of leaves behind me, and I spun about. A chattering squirrel chastised me, clutching a nut in his tiny furred hands. He darted away and up a nearby pine tree, where he sat eye-balling me and munching on his prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not,\" I told her, though that sounded flimsy even to my own ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me where you've come from, and I might come talk to you in person,\" she offered, yet her voice seemed to echo all around me, so I couldn't discern where it originated from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would only scoff and name me a liar,\" I said, sitting back down on my pine bows. I plucked a blade of grass and chewed on it, my stomach protesting that breakfast time had surely come and gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me,\" she called out. Her voice had a sing-song kind of sweetness, but it also seemed a trifle teasing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. The last few days I spent in the land of \"Here' as my travelling companion, an old man who had befriended, me called it. He knew of magic, and we rode a real unicorn, and..., I was about to go on when she rudely cut me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did this old man look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" I said with a bit of sarcasm, \"if you must know, he was old, no not just old but ancient. He had a white beard, mustache, and hair to match. His face ancient with deep crevasses. But aside from that, he had the most magnificent twinkling smile. I mean, it seemed as though he always knew something that you didn't. He was my friend,\" I told her, once again welling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlop!

Her hand moved to the position just above a sheathed knife she carried on her belt.

Did you steal his most precious possessions, boy who wanders?\" she asked, placing one foot ahead of the other as though for balance.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I didn't!

I am supposing it didn't happen on a count of him coming across you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure what to say, I stared at her, waiting for her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,, well, I thought since you liked the land of 'Here' so much, not to mention Gramps, maybe you'd be willing to come along and help me track him down. It's rather important that I find him and tell him something. And, no, don't ask. It's a private matter,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled over onto my stomach with a little moan as it pushed in on my overextended gut, and got up, shaking of toast and muffin crumbs from my britches. \"I've no where else to go, and if he has returned to the land of 'Here,' we might get to ride the unicorn,\" I said, a huge grin creeping across my face. Have you ever rode he?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many times. I raised her from a wee filly. Knew her dame and sire as well, but they've not been spotted for many years now. They never were half as tame as Jasperine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe gathered up our things from breakfast, and shoved it all in the old man's pack (I never can believe it's really mine though he gave it to me). Bralina had a small over-the-shoulder tote, which she plucked up, and we set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an inkling which path he may have taken,\" she told me. \"It's just through the pines and down a long hill in a hidden valley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hidden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, it's hidden from eyes we'd rather not have see it. Now come on,\" she said, trotting ahead of me, pushing pine branches away from herself, and trying to slap me in the face, I was more than sure. I fell back a pace or two, until we cleared the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stood atop a very high hill, more like a small mountain, I thought, looking over the steep edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put the bag down a moment,\" Bralina said. She squatted down and undid its clasp, plunging both hands into the opening, and pulling out a queer object part way. \"Well, give me a hand, you lazy oaf,\" she said. I stood next to her, our hands touching, and we both yanked, backing as we yanked some more. Finally, a five foot piece of wood with a curved front that rolled back, came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is this thing?\" I asked. It was made of a smooth, dark wood and polished so it gleamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called a toboggan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is it for,\" I asked, feeling a little stupid for asking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's for flying down this here hill, ya oaf, now get on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 557 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></font></span></div></div>",

This hill is chock-full of small rocks, dirt, and clods of grass. Won't that be rather dangerous?\" I leaned out over the massive hill, vertigo gripping my now queasy stomach. All that wonderful breakfast threatened to come roiling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly. Will you never learn?\" And with that, she plucked a stick, carved identical to the old man's, from her tote bag. \"This,\" she said, and pointed it up in the air, making swirling arcs back and forth, back and forth, \"is how. Watch!\". Then  a few minuscule snowflakes began to fall from the clear-blue sky, then more, and soon it was like millions of twinkling lights as they tumbled down. I thought for sure they would melt in the warmth of this autumn day, but, no! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood watching as the ground became saturated in white, then as it continued to fall, faster and faster, they became little drifts, and then, mounds, until, finally, it lay in heaps across the entire hill. I shook my head and smiled. Of all the magic I had seen thus far on this strange adventure, this took the grand prize for grandeur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite impressive, no?\" she said as she stood. Once aggin smug in the knowledge that I'd thought just that. She reeked of self-assurance, but I found it rather enchanting. <i>What, are you falling for the little wench, Tyrl?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we steer this toboggan,\" I asked. Though I tried to hide it, a small amount of fear refused to leave my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We lean whichever way we wish to go, together, you oaf, now come on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith care we hung the toboggan over the edge, being careful to hang on to it, so it wouldn't go careening down the hill without us. She stepped over the edge and climbed aboard, making her way to the front, where she grabbed up a small rope that was attached to the curved front. \"Now you,\" she called back to me, excitement making her cheeks flush in a most attractive way. <i> Pay attention, Tryl!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hopped on quick as I could, and we both paddled in the snow, like a pair in a canoe, rowing together. At once the toboggan picked up speed, and we were soon <i>flying</i> down, just like Bralina had promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe steered past a large mogul, barely missing it, and she turned back laughing, the wind whipping at her short black hair.\"Weeeeeeeeee!\" she screamed as I clung to her back, much less enthusiastic than her. In fact, I was quite sure my face had turned whiter than the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half way down the slope, Bralina stiffened beneath my grasp, pointing down the hill. \"Say the word,\" she yelled, pointing and waving her arm about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\" I hollered over the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say the word, you oaf!\" she screamed, practically taking out my eardrum as she'd turned about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spacarta!\" I yelled, and just as I looked around her shoulder, I saw the dreaded black-clad soldiers. Immediately, Bralina disappeared as did the toboggan, and my arms wrapped around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe heard the men at the bottom calling out in bewilderment. \"Sorcery!\" I heard as we went flying, faster and faster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, we had gathered such a tremendous amount of speed that we were racing down the hill as though shooting through rapids on a river. The bottom of the hill lept to meet us, and the King's Guard stood right there in our path, a neat little cluster. We bowled into them, scattering them in all directions. They let out multiple screams of agony, calling out in pain, \"My arm, my leg, oh, my back, my back is broke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, we shot past the broken bodies and sailed on by for many, many feet, finally coming to a halt right before a tiny pond. We jumped from the toboggan and ran across the shallow pond. Our feet kicking up splashes of muddy water, which must have looked quite queer with no one to be seen making them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, we lay on a grassy knoll, catching our breath, smiles on our satisfied faces. \"That was thrilling, huh, Tyrl?\" she asked with another of her adoring laughs. <i> Really, Tryl, what's with the adoring crap!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was quite something I told her,\" refusing to admit I'd been no less than terrified the entire ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRested, we both got up and ,once again, set off in search of the path to find the old man, her gramps. We descended hills and came back down them, one after another, until my knees began to protest. \"Couldn't we stop, say for a bite of lunch?\" I asked, giving her what I hoped was my most endearing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose. I am rather hungry myself, and if I know gramps, he already knows were coming. He has his ways, you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I didn't really know, but I nodded in agreement, happy we'd be taking a break. We lunched on smoked salmon, fried potatoes drenched in ketchup, and a whole, but small, fruitcake. Satisfied, we packed it all up and set a slower pace to find the path we needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here!\" Bralina cried as we came upon a majestic scene: a completely round lake, teal in color, not the standard blue! It shone in the early afternoon sun, sparkling like turquoise gems; it took my breath away! Two adult white swans shepherded their little flock across the lake, creating a large vee in their wake. <i>Ah, now here's a place a man could call home and never grow tired of, eh, Tyrl?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked a short ways to our right, through a copse of ironwood trees, and came upon a path laid out in neat cobblestones of varying colors. This we followed for sometime, and then rounding a bend, there sat a quaint, small cottage. A wrap-around porch disappeared from view. Pretty potted plants and shrubs in many styles and bright foliage gave the place a pleasing charm. Smoke rose from its chimney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weathered door opened, and out stepped the old man, wearing one of his twinkling, know-something-you-don't, smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gramps!,\" Bralina squealed running up the two steps and across the porch to leap into his embrace. She planted a kiss on his leathery cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,070 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

And how goes your fight against the darkness, my brave granddaughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bralina blushed and looked down at her feet., but a wide smile crept across her petite face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And look who we have here! Tyrl, my boy, how is it you have stumbled upon this little rascal of all people? Has she been treating you well?\" he said, casting a smirk Bralina's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gramps!\", she protested, turning another shade darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, children, I've much to tell you both.\" The old man turned and went back into the cabin. Bralina and I followed him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, we all sat down at a plain wooden table, a single unlit candle in the center. The place had a woman's touch about it, no doubt, (and I wondered what had become of the grandmother), with lace curtains at the two windows, an afghan slung across a cozy chair, and cookie jars\u2014many cookie jars in varying sets of themes: pigs and children, and even a moose decked out in 'Gift Giving Day' colors of red and orange. The pot-bellied stove in the corner radiated heat, making the cabin feel snug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tryl,\" the old man said in a much more serious voice, \"I think it is time Bralina and I offered you a bit more information. I mean, here I up and thrust magic in your lap with nary an explanation of how or why we have it, and what you should do with it. Hmm, where to start though? That is a fine question.\" He paused for some time, scratching his snow-white hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, how about at the beginning?\" I asked. He and Bralina laughed at this, and I joined them. Of course they both had their twinkling grins on after the laughter died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I go on or would you prefer the honors, Bralina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you go right on, Gramps. I know how much you love to talk,\" she teased him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Well, then, let' see,\" he fidgeted with his matching white beard, then began: once upon a time, there lived a wizard of some renown. His name was Pravel. He had mastered all of the arts of magic, and there are many. All of the other wizards came from near and far to study under his tutelage. Mind you, Pravel, and all those beneath him in rank, were good men dedicated to banishing darkness from the world. So I have told you, young Tryl, that you should be wary of how and when you use the magic within the bag I have given you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI coughed, looking down at the scratched wood of the old table, then looked up, and I met his eyes. \"Yes. And I understand. I also wish only good upon the world, and I am willing to swear an oath to this, if need be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so you will,\" he told me, no nonsense in his voice. \"Now, aside from that, I think it time you stop calling me 'The Old Man'. Yes, I have my ways of listening in, hmm?\" At this too, he laughed, a great and deep belly laugh, which Bralina took up, and I as well as I could not stop myself. Such was the ways of 'The Old Man'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like my father before, I'm a simple man, and a simple man should have a simple name. You may, henceforth call me, Jarode, or Gramps, but never 'Jarod the Jolly, for I detest that,\" he said, yet still he wore one of his silly grins, so that I wasn't sure if he were serious or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry,\" Bralina said right out of the blue as was her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let us eat and be merry,\" said the ol...,er, Jarode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you've been following along in my grand adventure, then I've no need to tell you how well we feasted. No king ever had a better table laid before him. I was growing fonder and fonder of that magic bag. Oh, yes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you had a spot of trouble with the King's guards,\" Jarode said, after we'd removed ourselves to the comfy chairs and couch which face a massive fireplace. \"I also saw that you did well, Bralina. I had to laugh at your inventiveness with that snowfall and the toboggan. Very Clever, indeed, young one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Gramps. I thought so too, \" she said with a big grin. \"Though I don't think Tryl appreciated my cleverness as he clung to me like a scared rabbit the whole way down the hill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not!\" I protest, and now I blushed a crimson-red. \"It really was a big hill,\" I offered in my defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all is well, and I am glad you made good on your escape, though I am afraid they won't give up in finding young Tryl so easily,\" Jarode told us. \"They mean to see this farce of their's through, and yet do the maids wait for his royal inspection.\" He cast his twinkling blue eyes my direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up, anger seeping into my bones. \"I don't know why the real king chose me! I certainly was minding my own business. I had come to see the king about having our taxes lowered as the winter before was harsh, the spring rains torrential, and this past summer as you know, put a drought upon much of the lands. Then, poof! I was snatched up, trussed up, and stuck into this farce of being named the new king, all while the real king hid out, and all because he wanted to marry another. Well, what has it to do with me!\" I plopped back down onto the sofa and sat their fuming over my plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a breath, Tryl,\" Jarode said. It shall all work out. You shall see and soon,\" he said, coming over and sitting down next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us make a new plan. Shall we?\" he said, rubbing his weathered hands in mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count 1,006 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></font></span></div></div>",

I had never believed in elves, and if I had (not saying I did) entertained the thought of them on occasion, I'd always pictured them as: short, funny-looking little people, wearing green outfits, pointy-toed shoes, matching hats complete with a feather sticking out of them, and over-sized pointy ears. Well, I got the ears right,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Bralina! it is very good to see you again.\" the <i>tall</i> elf said, gently taking her hand and bringing it up to his lips. I felt a pang of jealousy shoot through my heart. <i>What's gotten into you, Tryl. One would think you were in love with the wee lass, for crying out loud!</i> His voice had a musical quality to it, deep and resonate like a finely made bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glimmer,\" Bralina said, gazing up at him with big doe eyes, I noticed. \"I thought you'd never visit us again; it's been so long, too long, my wonderful friend.\" She took up his hand and practically drug the elf across the room, depositing him right smack in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I know I've gone on and on about the old man's and Bralina's twinkling smiles and how they can light up a room, well, when this elf smiled, the whole world could have been lit up. He had the most dazzling set of pearly-white teeth! To say his gem-like green eyes twinkled would not do them justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarode let out a small a cough from the high-backed chair near the fireplace. \"Prince Glimervan,\" he said, standing and giving the elf a deep bow. \"It is a great honor indeed to see you again, young friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The honor is all mine, good, kind, and truthful Jarode.\" <i> Did he know and take the oath I'd just taken?</i>  And who have we here?\" he said turning to face me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI...,I am Tryl,\" I said, my body slightly rigid from awe. Not only is he an elf, but a prince; it was a bit much to take in all at once, and I plopped back down on the couch, flushing red again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them chuckled, and I grew redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, you needn't be embarrassed. We laugh with you for we ourselves had a similar first encounter.\" Jarode said. \"He's a friend, and a good friend at that. Soon, you'll grow accustomed to these little surprises, eh, Tryl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do, Tryl, friend of my friends?\" he asked, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, and you, Gli...Prince Glimmervan.\" I choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he laughed, it filled the room, like a small waterfall tinkling. \"Quite well. Thank you for asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Bralina cried out. \"Looks like it's time for yet another feast! Are you hungry, glimmer? I sure am!\" Everyone laughed at this as apparently we <i>all</i> knew that Bralina was <i>always</i> hungry, though slight she was. She bounced off to retrieve the ever-bountiful pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarode's face grew serous as he asked the elf prince, \"What, aside from our good fortune, brings you to our Path this day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid I have bad tidings, regarding the advancement of \"Bad', he said. <i>What the heck does he mean by, 'Bad?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!

It involves the loosening of the morals of men. To be more technical, it comes down to spreading the philosophy of 'What's yours is mine' Oh, never mind if a man is slovenly and has not earned it. This is a sickness creeping over our lands. So far it has been contained to where men dwell, but it is threatening to engulf all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is very bad, Glimerman,\" Jarode said, hanging his head, and closing his eyes as if contemplating all the solemn elf had said. All of a sudden the old man stood up, his chair falling back. I had never see him angry, and I gaped as he slammed his weathered fist on the old table, rattling our cutlery and cups and plates. \"This can be the doings of none other than my half-brother, Drakar. Foul he has been and ever will be. Do not take lightly that men and elves alike name him 'Drakar the dark. For his soul is mired in darkness, his heart black as the deepest pit.\" He began to slump, and quicker than I could believe, the elf was at his side, holding him up. Bralina, too, sprang up and righted her gramp's chair, so that Glimerman could settle him on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive my outburst,\" Jarode said, lifting his face and giving us all a half smile. \"Ever has that man tried my patience.\" He fiddled with his beard as he was like to do when thinking, and said, \"We shall defeat him. Yes. And all of the rest of those who spread this 'Bad'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I offer a saying my father once told me?\" I asked, looking around at the three of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would be most pleased to hear it, Tyrl,\" Prince Glimervan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was often complaining to my parents of my long list of chores, that they were to hard, that I did more than my younger siblings, and so one night as I prepared to sit down with the family at the dinner table, and this was a night after I had done my chores but very sloppily and in anger, too, I noticed there was no plate where I always sat. When I asked my mother where my plate was, she looked down, and my father spoke up,\" and he said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If a man, or in your case, Tyrl, a strapping boy, won't work, then he shall not eat. I think it best if you go to your room and contemplate that, whilst your belly complains,\" he told me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of my friends nodded at this as though they thought it very wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I was none to pleased by this, but as I grew, the saying stuck with me, and I grew to appreciate the wisdom of my father's words more and more, and I knew as well the harsh lesson had been done for the love he bore me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 544 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></font></span></div></div>",

No sooner had I, than a black-feathered arrow crashed through the window, glass shattering into a myriad of pieces. It buried itself with a pronounced \"Thunk,\" into the high-backed chair Jarode had occupied a mere moment before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close one,\" the old man said, giving a small laugh. He didn't seem at all concerned that men\u2014and they were men dressed in black, wearing mail and helms,\u2014we're trying to kill us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf banged a large shard of glass with his elbow from his side of the window and rapid-fired three arrows: \"Thwack! Thwack! Thwack,\" was the sound I heard as each struck one of our attackers, and with every one a man lay dead or dying. <i>Man, he is so fast! Puts you to shame, Tyrl.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let loose with one of my own, but it sailed on by my target, the arrow embedding in an elm tree. I blushed, which seemed to be my new favorite pastime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow and steady,\" the elf said, in his musical tone, and I tried again. This time I hit the man who appeared to be in charge. I'd noticed him standing in the rear and directed the other men about. My arrow took him in the thigh, but he went down with blood streaming from his wound, and I inwardly cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's three for me!\" Bralina called out, giggling like a child at a circus shooting booth. \"That last sneaky trickster had a torch, too! Do I get double points for that, Glimmer?\" Her face flushed from excitement, rather than embarrassment as mine had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tryl,\" Jarode called to me. \"Get down and crawl to the pack, and sling it over to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The pack sat about seven feet from me by the front door, and I crouched down, and crab-crawled to Jarode, depositing it by his foot then scampered back to my window just as another arrow blasted through the last remaining shard of glass in our window. This one hit the cast iron stove in the corner, snapping the shaft in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I attempted to fit another arrow in place, Glimmer's hand whipped at the side of my face, knocking an arrow away, but still it grazed my cheek. I felt a slow burn, and a wetness roll down my cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that was even closer,\" Jarode said with one of his twinkling smiles. \"You okay, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye...,yeah, I guess,\" I said, swiping at the blood with my sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horn sounded, and all at once the men-in-arms began to retreat. I gaped as they were cut down to a man, and after the last had fallen, a flood of elves dropped from the surrounding trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we won't be needing the pack after all,\" Jorode laughed, and we all joined in, tension draining from our faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 569 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

They celebrated bumping fists and patting each other on the back. <i> They certainly are a jovial bunch,eh, Tyrl?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn older, solemn elf with yet-blond hair stood a little to the side of the throng, and Glimmer walked over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father,\" he said, dipping a gracious sweeping bow. \"We are most grateful for your assistance this day,\" he told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my son, and good that we did.

It was as if they <i>grew</i> the place not <i>built it!</i> Rope ladders made from hemp ascended into the gigantic Redwood trees and spans of rope and wood crosswalks spider-webbed everywhere! You could go anywhere you needed to go without ever coming down. And the living quarters! Amazing in their construction! These were no mere tree huts but palaces with towers and ramparts, brightly colored banners fluttering atop them from what had to be at least a hundred different elven clans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty impressive, eh, Tyrl,\" Bralina elbowed me and smiled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an understatement,\" I said, returning her smile, but not without another of those cursed blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, my friends, and we will have a bit of respite and talk over our plans to defeat 'The Bad', Glimmer said. We followed him through the dense and lush vegetation. Flowers of every color, every scent, wafted up and delighted the eye, bushes laden with ripe berries, carefully placed, paced us down a neat cobblestone path (I snatched a few every so often, stuffing the sweet and juicy fruit in my mouth), and pools of that same teal water as the lake I'd seen earlier could be seen dotting the grounds every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my father's humble house,\" Prince Glimmervan announced. I bent my head and neck back, trying to take in the colossalness of it! It had to be a hundred rungs up from where we stood, and it spread out in every direction! <i>Humble, my #*$!</i> Off to the side, Glimmer helped his father into a large wicker basket, gave a tug on a side rope, and the king and basket began to ascend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may do the same, Jarode,\" Glimmer said to the old man, but I am sure my friends would rather take their time and go up by hand and foot. That way they will enjoy all the views our fortress affords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralina and I followed the spry elf up, and, about halfway up, I made the mistake of looking down. Dizziness threatened to topple me from the ladder. I gripped the ropes, my hands white-knuckled as sweat ran down my back and brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer gazed down at me and said. \"Tyrl, try not to look down as there is much to see out and up.\" He gave me an encouraging wink, and I gave him a weak nod and tried to relax. Placing one foot on the next rung, one hand up,..<i>Stop being such a baby, Tryrl!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last we made the summit and stood upon a veranda of sorts. The view! Stunning would be a poor choice of words to match the grandeur! From our almost cloud-like view, I could see the surrounding lands for many miles: sparkling rivers flowing off into the east and south, grassy meadows waving in the gentle breeze, valleys, and even far-distant mountains. Closer in I even spotted Jarode's cabin. And! What are those small, dark things moving all around it? Peering harder, it hit me. <i> King's Guard's!</i> King's Guard's! I cried, grabbing Bralina's arm and turning her to where I pointed. \"There, by the cabin!\" I told her, I fingering the now bloody scab on my cheek, remembering our recent skirmish with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glimmer, dispatch a segment of elves at once!\" King Fabellious told his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you command, my King,\" and, with that, glimmer gave a low bow to his father, then ran down one of the many walkways, where he was soon lost to view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 658 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></font></span></div></div>",

We sat sipping spiced, ice-cold tea of a most delectable flavor I could not name. Several servants bearing the king's emblem of a mighty-antlered elk on their tunics, served us what the king had called a light lunch\u2014a delicious bread the elves called Cambrelle, scrumptious, creamy butter and spreading cheeses, more of the berries I had snatched on the way up with little saucers and pictures of heavy sweetened cream to douse them in, cold roast venison, slices of duck smothered in an orange sauce, and tiny tea cakes peppered with nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Glimmer had run all the way back and climbed the ladder in haste, he was not winded in the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Father,\" he said as yet again he bowed in respect to him. It was a larger pack of Kings' Guards this time, but I chose a band of our finest archers, who quickly dispatched them to a man. Let us hope that is the last we shall see of them for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As always, Glimmer, your old father is  proud of his faithful son,\" the king said, dipping his head to the prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Sire,\" Glimmer said, using a more respectful title than he normally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we were just about to begin discussing our plans to eradicate 'The Bad', King Fabellious said. Let me tell you how the elves believe this 'Bad' came to be.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a time long ago when the land was pure, and no evil walked upon it. But their came to be born a man named Baraba, a man of lowly birth, but one who aspired to greater heights. At two and twenty, he left his father's meager farm and set off to do so. Along his way he met a sorcerer. This man believed in using his powers for the good of all men, much like your oath, Jarode,\" Baraba, convinced him that he was such a man, and that he would be willing to see to the wizard's every need, if he would take him on as his apprentice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I recall this tale,\" Jarode interuppted. \"Carry on Fabell,\" he told the king, using a more familiar name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, where was I? Ah! So this good sorcerer taught Baraba all of his secrets of magic, and he was renowned in all the lands for his skill, so it was an extensive undertaking. Now, there came a day when apprentice matched master, and Baraba grew jealous of his fame\u2014he wanted this for himself.\" The king paused to take a sip of his lemonade, gave a little cough, and began again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One fateful night, when many in the village they dwelt in were at a fair two towns march from there, Baraba, carried out the dark deed he had long harbored in his heart. Just as we sip our drinks together this day, so, too did they, but this evil apprentice had doctored his master's drink with the fatal Febba leaves, found only on the edges of Lackamoore Swamp to the north of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A most horrible death, I am afraid,\" said Glimmer, shaking and hanging his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so it is,\" said the king. When his master's body lay cold and stiff, he rolled it in a carpet, tossed it into the back of a wagon, and set off to dispose of it and to hide what he'd done in the same swamp the poison had been fetched from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many days later he arrived at his destination,\" the king went on. Now this was already a dank and foul water, fit for no man to drink from, nor beast to live in. And when he threw his master in, immediately a fouler stench arose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I interrupt a moment, Father?\" Glimmer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may my good son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love to tell this part, because Baraba, 'Black Baraba' as some have called him, got his for the cruel thing he had done. Apparently the clever master had had a talisman of sorts tucked into a secret pocket of his robes, and Baraba had missed it in his search of the body. This artifact would grant the old wizard a brief period of life after death, so it would seem. I will relinquish the tale back to you now, Father,\" the prince said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to get to the point,\" the king said. \"The old wizard now knew he had passed on, and he had watched as his body was roughly tossed on that cart, thrown into the stagnant waters of the swamp, and his anger grew. When it did, the swamp turned dark as ink, and it bubbled and tossed about, until it became a swirling tempest. Up it rose, and rose, and then, it was flung all across the lands. And that was the beginning of \"Bad\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glimmer, you may tell the last bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and this was the first time that neighbor rose up against neighbor, coveting what the other had, the first time men slayed men, and all the land grew darker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jarode nodded in solemn agreement, his weathered face bearing a frown. \"We have had this 'Bad\" with us since then, but always there have been times when it was pushed back as though it slept, but I fear, it has reawakened and in some strength this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 929 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

Me who'd risen in anger, and me who'd played a part in helping spread the 'Bad'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tryl, wake up, you oaf,\" Bralina's voiced drifted through to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Is it morning already?\" I rolled over and groaned, stretching my aching, tired muscles. \"Arrrg,\" I let out as my arms and legs protested. \"That long, long rope ladder did me in, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I think you'll survive. Now get up, get dressed, and meet us on the veranda,\" Bralina said and flounced off, swinging her slim hips as she went. I saw her glance back over her shoulder to see if I'd been watching, but she only winked at me when she saw I had been, while I blushed, yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up, get dressed, and anything else, your highness?\" I asked, doing my best to sound as bossy as she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside, the fresh air revived me a bit, and I drew in a few long breaths of the sweet-scented morning air. \"Good day, King Fabellious, \"I said with a low bow. I gave a nod to Jarode, and Glimmer, and they both smiled. Bralina I ignored, but I heard her giggle as if that didn't bother her in the least.

He laughed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come enjoy some of these fine sausages. Glimmer and I made them ourselves with rare spices brought in from the coastal cites.

We've been calling it 'The Quest of Three', which has rather a nice ring to it, eh, Glimmer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do love a quest, Father,\" Glimmer said, showing off his brilliant white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been on a quest,\" I said, then blushed as they all stared at me. \"I mean, what will we do on this quest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a lowered, serious voice, an almost threatening voice, the king said, \"You three will cleanse the swamp of its foulness, and thereby restore the balance of the 'Good' and the 'Bad', he told me, then included the other two with a nod at each. The look on his face brokered no arguments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, and  looked around at Bralina and Glimmer.

It would be a three day trek to the foul 'Lackamoor Swamp'. King Fabellious, looked us over as though we were his King's Guard, which I suppose we were in some ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May the blessings of the elves be upon your journey, young ones,\" he said, rather too solemn for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Father,\" Glimmer said, reaching out and hugging him in a warm embrace. They held each other for a moment, then broke apart, the old King giving a small cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralina and Glimmer hoisted their smaller packs on their back, while I carried the larger, though weirdly lighter magic pack the old man, Jarode, had given me. <i> How many supplies would we really need with everything we could possibly want coming out of mine?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe said no goodbyes, which I thought odd, but then these were elves, and surely they had their own customs. When we made our way down the long rope ladder, at last, we walked out few paces, gazed up, and Jarode gave a wave, which we returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was warm, and we were soon all sweating under the high-noon sun as we strode from the forest and across the flower-strewn meadow. A deer drank from one of the teal colored ponds, stopping and lifting her head to watch us, though seemingly unafraid. <br>\r\nWe entered the other side of the forest after a few moments, and we were glad to be in the cooling shade of the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What say we sing a song to make the time pass quicker,\" Glimmer said, stooping to pluck a blade of thick, green grass. This he folded and brought to his mouth. I looked up in surprise when he played a recognizable tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Can you teach me to do that?\" I asked him, and he gave me another of his dazzling smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fairly easy, once you practice for a few years,\" he said, clapping me on the back and giving a small laugh. He began the tune anew, and Bralina chimed in, singing in a sweet, high voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Oh, the maids are lovely, lovely!<br>\r\nOh, lovely in the springtime.<br>\r\nOh, the boys do flirt and flirt,<br>\r\nflirt with the swish a skirt.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Those are not the words I learned to that song,\" I said, giving her a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" she said. \"But they are mine, and Glimmer never said we couldn't sing original lyrics, now did he?\"  She skipped and did little twirls ahead of us, singing it again, and pretending she had a skirt to swish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't plan on making a career out of being a poetess,\" I called out to her as she'd gotten far ahead by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later we heard her squeal, and Glimmer and I raced ahead to see what the trouble was. <i>Let it not be more King's Guards, I prayed.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of breath, we pulled up next to he. I bent over with my hands on my knees, panting though Glimmer seemed hardly winded at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere stood Bralina, her pack on the ground, and stripped down to her underclothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that gorgeous waterfall,\" she squealed again and walked out into the teal water. <i>Why I ought to spank her while her bottom's wet! Making me think some beast had got her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer dropped his back as did I, and we spent an hour swimming, splashing, and cooling off our sweaty bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 585 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></font></span></div></div>",

He took a few staggering steps, then he collapsed in a heap. His clothes were soiled, his bare arms and face covered in a criss-cross of scratches and bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning fast Glimmer stood beside the boy, who appeared to be in his mid-teens. \"Are you okay?\" he asked the youth, kneeling down and cupping his head in the cradle of one arm. He un-slung his deer skin water pouch, removed the wooden cap, and offered the gasping lad a few sips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy tried to talk but failed. The elf gave him another small sip, and said, \"Take your time. We won't let any further harm come to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he tried again, and got out, \"I..., I...,\" before he lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralina and I joined Glimmer, stooping down to gaze at our unexpected arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you suppose he's come from?\" I asked them. \"He seems to be pretty beat up and a bit malnourished to boot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor thing,\" Braliina said as she stroked the boy's flushed cheek. She pushed a few strands of blond hair from his eyes. That was when she noticed the small dart embedded in his neck. Her hand went up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't!\" Glimmer's hand shot out and knocked her hand back down. \"It's a poison dart, and I know who has done this to this boy,\" he said as he stood up. He searched the forest a moment, shielding his eyes with a cupped hand from the glare of the setting sun, then he told Bralina and I to grab his feet, and he asked us to help him move the boy to a more secluded spot in the shelter of the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we'd walked deep into the thick forest, the hardwoods gave way to tall pines with wide spreading branches, and here, we laid the battered and drugged boy down, under a canopy of one of the largest pines I'd ever seen. Glimmer set about snipping off low branches, and these he stacked up in a wide circle. With care, we picked the boy up once more, and he gave a soft moan as we laid him on the bows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer stood up, a frown spread across his handsome face. \"Watch over him, Bralina. and give him sips of water, if he will take them. Tyrl, stand lookout, for I fear he may be followed, yet. I know of a leaf that will save his life, but it is a far ways from here, and I must be quick, if he is to live.\" With that, Glimmer shot out of sight. One second he was there, the next gone. <i>How does that elf move so quickly!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe normally petulant, teasing Bralina had grown quiet. She sat on the edge of the boy's make-shift bed, once again stroking his cheek. She murmured a lullaby of sorts to him under her breath. I could make out only a few of the unfamiliar lyrics:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Hush sweet child 'O mine<br>\r\nfor I shall keep you safe...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snap!\" Someone or something stalked the forest. \"Ssh, Bralina,\" I whispered, pointing to where I thought the crunch of a broken branch at been, but she was already nodding in silent agreement.

As soon as it is cool enough, get a large cup of it into him as fast as you can. He may vomit it up, but do not let up, he must have a full cup, so replenish it as needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely this intruder will see and smell the fire,\" I said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That is so. I must go and search him out first. Remain vigilant.\" And with that he pulled his quick disappearing trick again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI searched for kindling and small twigs. Bralina gather a few small logs, and together, we soon had a nice blaze going. She set a flat stone atop it, and I placed a cast iron pot on this, which I had filled with water from a small stream nearby. Soon the water began to boil, and she added in the correct amount of leaves to make it strong enough for the boy's antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile we waited for the concoction to cool, we sat close together, and I noticed Bralinas hands were shaking. This was so unlike her\u2014to let her guard down\u2014to not be'Bralina the Brave'. I draped an arm around her, and she leaned in closer to me. \"It will be okay,\" I said, trying to comfort her. I smelled her sweet lilac-scented hair, and being brave for once, I planted a light kiss atop it. Her hair was smooth as corn silk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniveled, and remained quiet. A night owl gave a long series of eerie hoots, and when I looked up through the gap in our pine tree, I noticed the moon was full\u2014 <i>An ominous sign with the owl hooting, too, eh, Tyrl?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot two seconds later, a wailing scream echoed through the woods.

His eyelids fluttered, then opened, though he had a faraway look in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssh,\" Bralina said. \"Don't try to talk, now. Here,\" she said, bringing the cup up to his mouth. \"This is what will make you all better,\" she coaxed him into drinking it as if he were a small by, not a half-grown man. \"Our friend, the elf, Glimmervan, ran very far to fetch the leaves of the 'Bava' bush. It is said they will counteract most any poison, for that is what has happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pois...,\" the boy said, but he choked on the liquid and began to cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. There.\" Bralina said. \"Lets not talk on it anymore, just now.\" She poured a small amount more into the half-full cup, to replace what he'd spat out, remembering Glimmers warning that he must have a full cup for it to be effective in counter-acting the poison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boy sipped, the color began to return to his round, still-babyish face. After he'd finished the whole cup, he was able to sit up on his own, though still a bit shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwigs and leaves crackled under someone's feet, and then Glimmer emerged from the forest, his bow resting over one shoulder. He smiled when he saw how well our young arrival was doing. \"Well, it would appear someone's taken their medicine,\" he said, giving the you a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving!\" Bralina said, and both Glimmer and I burst out laughing, while the youth stared at us in bewildered silence. I grabbed the magic bag and produce the best feast yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I pulled one item after another from the pack, the boy's eyes grew wider and wider. Soon I had everything arranged on a silk tablecloth, complete with a candle and a vase of brightly colored tulips (which were out of season, of course). The boy drank in the aroma of baked turkey, steaming rice pudding, creamed corn with lots of bacon bits thrown in, and apple pie to-die-for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" he said, his moth hanging slack. \"How are you doing that? I mean, it shouldn't even all fit i there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all laughed again, and Glimmer began telling of Jarode's magic pack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 466 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </font></span></div></div>",

Glimmer suggested the boy be given only water or mint tea, until his system would be purged of the deadly poison. We kept the conversation light, so as not to over-tax the youth. We did learn his name was Stevan though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhh,\" Bralina stretched her arms over her head, and said,\"I think we'd better hit the hay. Morning will be here bright and early.\" She got up and made her way to her pine bow bed, plopped down, and was making purring noises within minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over to where Stevan lay and noticed he was already out. Glimmer and I sat up for awhile, watching the dying embers of our small campfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tell me about earlier,\" I said. \"Who did you hunt down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was another of the King's Guard.\" he said.  \"I believe he got lost in the woods, and that he was alone. \"He won't be sneaking up on us again.\" His face was pulled down in a slight frown, his brow wrinkled as if it pained him that he had to keep taking people out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were protecting the boy, Bralina, and me, and I thank you, Glimmer,\" I said, rising. \"I think I will call it a night as well, my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Tyrl,\" the young prince said as he doused the fire with the remnants of the tea kettle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning dawned with a heavy fog surrounding our little camp. Glimmer, always the first to arise, sat drinking a cup of strong coffee, by it's smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't mind some of that,\" I said. \"Good morning.\" I arched my back and intertwined my fingers, stretching my arms up high. He poured me a cup and handed the steaming mug to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Should we wake the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon, for I am anxious to complete this quest as soon as possible. It worries me to be away from our fortress so long, what with King's Guards crawling all around the region,\" Glimmer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up,\" came a groggy growl. Bralina threw her blanket aside and sat on the edge of her pine bows, stretching her legs out and kneading her thighs. Apparently, those elven rope ladders had gotten to her too, though she'd never say so in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I,\" came a croak,\" from our new fourth member. The boy sat up and coughed. \"My throat is a bit sore,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It most likely will be for a day or so. That poison works all kinds of dark magic,\" Glimmer told him. That poison comes from a plant near where I went for the antidote, and the only people I know who use it are the 'Swampers' as they are called. We'll have to skirt their known haunts, too, on our way to the swamp. We'll make for the north side of it. They believe there is big evil there and avoid it at all costs. I believe they may be right,\" the prince said, raising an eyebrow in my direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe packed up and set a slow pace through the fog. It hung around until way after high-noon as though to prevent our progress. But soon the sun broke through, and a gentle wind scattered it, leaving a crystal clear sky. The day was cooler than yesterday, and we were glad of it, for we found no other pools to refresh ourselves in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 573 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

It's another common side effect of that nasty poison,\" said Glimmer. \"But you are not a burden, my friend. It may take us a day or two longer is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard you all mention this <i>quest</i>. May I know what it is about, where we are heading?\" he asked looking around at me, Bralina and the prince. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile we snacked on ham and cheese sandwiches, fresh picked apples Glimmer had plucked along the way, and a refreshing lemonade, Glimmer and Bralina took turns filling the lad in on the 'Bad' story, and how we had been sent to cleanse the swamp and hopefully put things back in balance with the 'Good'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's a very noble quest,\" Stavin said. He flicked his shoulder-length hair from his face and gave us a smile, the first I had seen on his young face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you? Are you up to telling how you came stumbling out the woods and into the meadow we were crossing?\" Bralina asked him, giving him a sweet smile in return. <i>She'll make a fine mother when she out grows her tom-boy ways. She's very good with kids.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant no harm,\" he said, a tremor in his voice. I was just hunting squirrels, and I must have crossed over on to old man Wolton's property. He's got three sons, and one is as mean as the other. They'll fight anybody, just for looking crosswise at 'em.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the youngest spotted me just as I was taking aim on a grey, and, sure enough, he set to hollering for the others. They came a running with whatever they had to hand, pitchforks and shovels. They scared me to death, screaming and shaking them forks an what not over their heads, like they was possessed by demons.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I lost them after a couple of miles of running. As you can see, I slammed into and got face-smacked by quite a few limbs and branches. I back tracked and circled wide of them, that's how I finally lost them, and that is when I came stumbling out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't see, until right up before I lost them, that the youngest one had some sort of a blow pipe. That must have been what he got the dart in me with. I felt it go in my neck, hurt like a son of a..., oh, pardon me, Bralina. It hurt bad, but I kept right on running. That must have pumped that poison in good. Then I stumbled on you three, and thankfully I did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhew!\" he said, drawing in a long breath, and giving a little chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 514 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

Hopefully, it would be the last of two stops before we finally arrived and completed this quest King Fabellious had entrusted to us three, which now is four, with the addition of the boy we'd picked up along our way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe'd marched all day and all were weary: sore muscles, sore feet and sunburns for fair-skinned Bralina and I. We were a dusty, tired bunch in need of a bath. Fortune chose to smile on us when we exited a thick wood of maple and oak, entering a wide valley with a deafening double waterfall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo tumultuous were the falls that we could not hear each other speak. We followed the series of cascading rapids strewn with gigantic boulders as if some Giant had heaved them helter-skelter in a fit of rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked as though we'd be having salmon for lunch and maybe dinner as well. Hundreds of them could be seen leaping and swimming throughout the waters. We camped on the gravel shores of the river, parallel with a good-sized inlet, where one could snatch the fish right out by plunging our hands into the shallow water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralina and I as our custom had become, gathered and started the fire for our noon meal. Glimmer, ever quick, provided the salmon, and our new friend cleaned and, surprisingly, cooked them. We sat enjoying our meal and listened while Stavin told us about more of his life on his father's small farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying,\" the boy said, \"it's just me and Pa, since Mum died giving birth to me. Pa had taken to the bottle for many a year, but right around the time I turned twelve, he swore off of the stuff. After that, our farm began to prosper for a time. But no sooner had we built things up, than raiders would come in and steal and/or destroy our crops, fences, and one time they burned down our barn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always suspected it was them Waldor's that done most of it, but we never did catch them in the act. They liked to do it when they knew we was off to market or visiting a small fair, times like that,\" he told us, pausing to take a breath and a long swill of iced-tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is very commendable of you to stick with a drunken father, and so you were rewarded with his sobriety,\" Glimmer said. He gave the boy a pronounced nod of his head and one of his beautiful smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Gli..., I mean M' Lord, your Grace, if you please,\" Staving said, a slow blush creeping up his neck and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do call me Glimmer,\" the prince said. \"We are friends, after all, and friends needn't be so formal when they are alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much further is the 'Lackamoor Swamp', Glimmer?\" I asked him as I took a bite of the delicious salmon and licked my lips. I savored the taste. Stavin had dipped them in batter and fried them on a large flat stone placed on the coals of our fire. He'd found a variety of rare spices in the magic bag (which the boy had become fascinated with), and sprinkled them liberally over the fish. I don't think I'd ever tasted better salmon than them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would guess just under a day to go,\" the prince said. If we can march well into dusk, and, if we rise early on the morn, and march a good day's march, too,\" and at this  pronouncement, he looked at the boy. \"You do seem to be growing stronger by the hour, Stavin. Are you up for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel almost back to my old self, and I think after a good night's rest, you'll all be hard-pressed to keep up with me!\" We all shared a laugh at that, and I clapped the smiling youth on his slender back, giving him a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe gathered up the supplies we'd brought out for lunch, and packed it all into our packs, then once again set off, following the stream bed for a good long while, before veering off into another dense wood of pine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe further in we went, the denser the trees, which at one point were so tightly packed, we had to negotiate with care, lest someone get a branch in the face. Here, too, were many thorn bushes, and loads of itch weed, and other poisonous plants so that when it finally began to thin out, all of us were covered in a myriad of scratches and small cuts, well, all but Glimmer, of course. Two of us had poison Ivy, so we took an early evening rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw a leaf that will take the itch from your rashes. It's just back a ways,\" Glimmer said, looking at the boy and Bralina, who were squirming and trying not to itch and make it worse than it already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be right back, and once we've made a salve, we can go on for another hour or two, before we make night's camp. The elf strode off with his easy, long-legged gait, and we all plopped down, enjoying a much needed rest from our long journey this today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo much time had passed, we noticed, and, still, Glimmer did not return. The sun was setting, and it cast shadows across the rippling waters of the river, making ghostly images appear to be floating by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should one of us go seek him?\" Staving asked when we were all pulling long faces and looking all about for our friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I said. \"Then I fear we'd be looking for two of us. Glimmer can take care of himself, and better than an of us,\" I added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralina, who'd been quieter than normal ever since we'd picked up the boy, said, \"I have a whistle, and it was given to me by Glimmer's Father, King Fabellious. Shall I blow it?\" she asked, cocking her head and looking at us. \"He will recognize it particular call.\" So typical of her,she didn't wait for us to answer. Putting the long, thin, wooden whistle to her lips, she gave a pronounced and shrill blast. We waited. Nothing. She tried again. No answer was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that!\" Glimmer called out, emerging from the woods. \"Do you wish to call the King's Guard down upon our heads, foolish Bralina?\" he said, and that was the first time I'd ever heard the prince speak even slightly harsh to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralina blushed a deep crimson-red, and looked down. \"It was foolish of me. Forgive me, Glimmer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should not have spoken thus,\" the prince said, hanging his head so that his long, blond hair fell across his tired face, but this quest has taken a tole on even me,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over and gave Bralina a warm embrace and a peck on her pale cheek. Brushing her short, dark hair from her face, he tousled her hair, and then we all stood up, and we were off again, marching until well after dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1196 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

They marched in sullen and silent discomfort, wiggling and flinching as if that would make the itching go away. I walked ahead of them with the prince, and we shared a small laugh, but not so they could hear. <i>No sense in rubbing salt into n open wound.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a weary three hour trek, we came upon the perfect place for a night camp. A considerable hill sported a flat spot at its summit, roughly twenty by twenty feet of grassy turf, which would be almost as soft as the pine bow beds we'd become accustomed to. We trudged up, sighing as we ascended, for we were weary, indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy dropped his pack and flopped to the soft green turf! He spread his arms and legs wide, stretching and giving a big, \"ahhh,\" as only a teen-aged boy could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer laughed, and set his pack aside as he sat down and stretched his long legs out in front of him. He absently plucked a blade of the sweet smelling grass, folding it and bringing it to his lips to play us another tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralina did the honors in her high, sweet voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">In a meadow, in a meadow,<br>\r\nin a sweet clover meadow,<br>\r\ncame a fellow, came a fellow,<br>\r\nto my sweet clover meadow.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well,\" I said unrolling my sleeping blanket and lying on top of it, for the night was warm and mild, I'm about done for. And the morning will come as it always does.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, ya oaf,\" Bralina called making her own bed. I heard her soft giggles at this and smile. <i>She's growing on ya, Tryl. Best watch that or your roaming days will soon be at and end!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe song had many more verses, but that was all she could remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments our little camp lay sleeping, soft purrs from Bralina, and larger snore from Stavin. <i>I think he has some serious nasal blockage!</i> I lay gazing at the myriad stars, strewn across a black velvet sky, they twinkled like the old mans eyes when he smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning stole in with a nasty, cold rain, which soon had us scampering to pack up our camp. We marched out, munching on cold biscuits and little else, seeking shelter has quick as we could. We didn't find it quick though. On and on we marched across open field of knee-high grasses that soon had all of our pants. My left shoe had a small hole, and I could feel the water oozing in and out with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer came to a halt, pointing off to our right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is that a cave? Out here on the prairie? Impossible!</i> None-the-less, when we drew closer we saw that it was, indeed, a cave, though it was man-made and dug into a small hillock. It reminded me of the one Jarode and I had stayed in, when we hid from the King's Guard though this one was much smaller. I doubted any of us could stand erect in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we all stood there inspecting it, wondering if it could shelter all of us, wondering if we'd have to crawl into it, a crow landed on a nearby oak tree. From its perch it berated us, \"Caw! Caw! Caw!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the cave banged open, slamming against the hill, and out stepped the smallest man I'd ever laid eyes on! He had a long white beard that swept the ground. <i>How does he keep from tripping on it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe gawked at the little fellow, most of our mouths hanging open, except for Prince Glimmer, of course. He had more manners than we.. He wore a bright blue vest with a ruffled long-sleeved shirt beneath it. His shoes! His black shoes were polished to a high gleam and sported golden buckles. These caught the morning's sunlight and thrust it in our eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who be you?\" Glimmer ask him, shading his eyes with a cupped hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I be, Vandermiremire,\" he said, giving a sweeping bow. \"You may call me Van as my friends do. They do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo our shock, the crow called out, \"They do! They do! They do!\" Apparently, he likes to say things in triple! He flew from his branch and landed lightly on Van's shoulder. \"Food! Food! Food!,\" he screamed, so I thought he'd break the little fellows ear drum, but Van never flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 755 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

I would have sworn, right there and then, that that darn bird twisted its neck to the side and kissed him. And there was a total look of admiration gleaming in its dark, beady eyes. I am not joking. The bird seemed to calm at his touch, and instead of screaming, it said, \"Van. Van. Van,\" with a kitten's purr of affection!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? Yes. Food we must have. Yes?\" the little man said in his queer way of speaking, clapping his small hands and nodding all the while, and giving us a wide grin. \"So, come. Yes?\" And, with that, he turned, and, without having to duck at all, he retreated back into his earthen cave. A moment later, when we had not yet decided who should follow first, we heard a faint call asking from far off, \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer flashed one of his pearl-white smiles and ducked low, answering Van as he went in, \"Yes! Yes, we come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralina, Stavin and I burst out laughing. This was probably the most fun we'd had on this quest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of us remaining outside took a turn at stooping and entering the little fellow's home. Once inside, we descended down a long cobblestone path, which twisted and turned the further in we went. The walls brushed our shoulders at times, and other times we had to turn sideways and scoot along. Rounding a bend, we reached the apparent end of the tunnel, and and all three of us stopped and gaped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer stood grinning like a court jester. I think that's the only time I'd ever seen the prince acting like a commoner, his mouth hanging open with a dazed look of amazement pasted on his handsome face. \"Its..., it's quite something. Isn't it?\" he asked, gazing about a wondrous woodworking workshop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo stunned to answer, I gave a long whistle instead. Everything, from supplies, tools, half-made and finished works, had been placed in the perfect position, so that your eye took them all in in a glance. Here stood a bench, with larger tools, saws and clamps longer than the little man, and above, row upon row, hanging on brackets, were hammers of all sizes, chisels, their sharp edges gleaming in the many over hanging candelabras, awls, hand drills and so many other bits and piece. Only two words could describe the owner of this fabulous workshop: organized and talented!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan stood bobbing his head, which seemed slightly out of proportion to his small, compact body. \"Like? Yes, like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like's not the word, my friend,\" the prince said. \"How long have you had this workshop, and who do you make all these marvelous things for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little fellow did not answer, but merely smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no end to the variety of objects Van had created. It must have taken him years to accumulate it all, not-to-mention all the wood he would have needed to haul down here to make them. There were: dolls, who's faces were painted with such life-like qualities, you might not be shocked if they got up and walked, horses pulling carts laden with this and that, flowers carved in such intricate detail and painted so realistically that one would think they could actually smell them, shields with beautiful emblems emblazoned on their fronts, toy soldiers, and..., too many things to name all in one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent about an hour drinking in all the wonderful sights of his workshop, then the little fellow said, \"Come? Yes, come.\" He motioned with one hand for us to follow him down yet another tunnel in his warren-like home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crow, still nestled on his shoulder called out,\"Come! Come! Come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the workshop was stunning, his living quarters were quaint; lace curtains on windows that had been painted so as though one would think they really were gazing outside. One window pictured a mountain scene with evergreens marching up its slopes, and yet another cast your eye on a meadow spread with a magnificent bouquet of wildflowers. I walked up to it, reaching out to be sure I couldn't feel the softness of their petals, smell their lavish perfumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are amazing, Van\" I told him, turning around and grinning at him, for the windows inspired one to grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned mine with one of his own. He really was a pleasant little guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat? Eat, yes,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe watched him prepare our meal in his just-his-size kitchen, even the ceiling was lower there as if he had made it off limits to anyone else, well, to normal sized people. We sat in his miniature chairs, Glimmer reclining on a fairly nice sized sofa. The furniture though tiny felt as though it were very sturdy and would bear our weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a time, the most delightful aromas began to fill the rooms. I breathed in, trying to distinguish the many smells wafting about. \"Is that lemon pie,\" I asked Van, and he turned nodding his head up and down, more than was necessary to convey his affirmation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemon pie. Yes. Good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Good! Good!\", screeched his pet bird as it flew into the living room and landed on the arm of my finely-made wicker chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name! Name! Name!\" it seemed to ask. \"T...,Tyrl,\" I told it, scratching my head. I didn't know if I quite trusted the thing, if it would suddenly fly at me and try and pluck out my eye, but it remained perched there, staring at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat,\" called Van, and he began bringing us out many dishes of steaming food, which we carried to his miniature, though long oak table. I saw now that he'd quickly put together quite the feast: roast duck, a very large bowl of mashed potatoes, and there were candied yams, and, of course, the lemon pie I had smelled earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat! Eat! Eat!,\" the crow called, and so we did. Van fed it bits of duck as it once again perched on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,019 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After we'd stuffed ourselves on Van's delicious meal, we took to the living room once more. All were content to sit and stare at Van's wonderful painted windows, where one could imagine this underground den set above ground in a beautiful meadow or at the foot of a wooded mountain slope. We sat in silence for some time, each lost in their owns thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer broke the silence saying, \"As Tyrl is like to say, morning always comes, so I think it best we thank Van for that fine meal, once again, and get some shut eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all murmured our assent, and thanked the little man, shaking his arm up and down, patting him on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan stood up, and hopped form foot to foot, then ran over to a wall with framed pictures. I had noticed them before, eight of them, hung neatly in a row. I'd thought they might be of his parents, siblings or passed on relatives, but when he motioned us over, I saw that each bore a striking resemblance to the little fellow; they shared his same short stature, and many were the spitting image of him, with some perhaps having different hair coloring or a longer nose, but much the same, still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine. Yes, All mine,\" Van said, puffing out his chest and rocking on his heels in obvious pride. \"Mine! Mine! Mine!\" screamed the crow, startling everyone but Van. {I I wish he'd stop that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are <i>all</i> your children?\" Bralina asked him, and he nodded, smiling wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandermotemote, Festerinerine,bailygormgorm, he went on, reciting and pointing to each picture as he went down the row. <i>I wonder why they all have names that repea? Did their namer have a stutter?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe nodded, and Stavin said, \"What a fine lot of children you have, Van. They must be a big help to you, no? Where are they all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this the little man hung his head, his mouth pulled down slightly at the edges. \"Gone. Yes, all gone.\" He spread his arms out wide and turned in a circle, pointing at the four directions. \"Married. Gone. Babies. Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they ever come to see you,?\" Bralina asked, she looked as if she would cry for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face brightened at this though, and he darted across the room to a corner desk carved in intricate patterns and polished to a high shine. From this, he pulled out a calendar, bringing it over to us. He pointed at a big X placed on the 20th of this month, which would be in nine days. \"Coming. Yes, Sandermotemote, come. Wife. Babies, many.\" He told us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralina smiled, and a \"Ah,\" escaped her parted lips. \"I am so glad for you, Van!\" He grabbed her hands and they both spun around in wild circles, then they fell apart, and he gave her a bow, and she a curtsy to him, and then they both laughed, their faces flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head up and down, then said, \"Sleep? Beds. Yes, many beds.\" At this he chuckled some more and marched off down another tunnel. We followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here was yet another surprise, well it should not have been, but it was none-the-less, for the room he'd led us to had not one, nor two, nor even three, but four sets of bunk beds. Now, they were, to be honest, rather on the short side, but if one curled up slightly, one could have a fine rest. I pushed down on one of the mattresses, and, of course, it had to be stuffed with goose down. I plopped on one, and its softness enfolded me. \"These are wonderful mattresses, Van. Did you make them yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Make. Very soft.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soft! Soft!

Since there were no <i>real</i> windows in Vans warren-like home, we had no way of gauging the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning. Yes? Good morning,\" Van said as we all stumbled into the living room, rumpled an bleary eyed. We all nodded to the little fellow, saying the same to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast. Yes?\" he asked, already moving towards his little low-ceiling kitchen. He hummed a merry tune as he went, and began slamming pots and pans onto the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what we'll be having this morning?\" I asked the others, my stomach already rumbling and my mouth watering, for I knew whatever it was to be, it would be delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon we sat about the old oak table, stuffing our mouths with a honey-sweetened porridge, crisp bacon, scrambled eggs smothered in three kinds of cheese, and a delicious pineapple-orange drink. <i> I wonder where Van got those fruits this time of year and so far north of where they grow. Must be one of his many children delivered them to him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious!\" Stavin said then burped. \"Excuse me,\" he blushed. \"That was yet another fine meal, my little friend,\" he told Van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Fine! Fine!\" the crow called out. It had chosen to sit right on the edge of the table next to Prince Glimmer, who like Van had at dinner last night, fed it bits of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a time, we all pushed  our plates back, our bellies more than satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van, my good friend, we have enjoyed your gracious hospitality, and for that we thank you.\" Glimmer said, pushing his chair back and rising. \"But all good things must end, and now we must be on our way to complete our quest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quest! Quest! Quest\" <i>I'll give ya a quest if you don't shut your beak, you annoying black-feathered beast!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crow go. Yes?\" Van asked, looking around the table at each of us. \"Yes. Crow go. Lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you telling us the crow knows the exact way to 'Lackamoore Swamp?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lackamoore. Yes. Not far. Crow go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so now we are a party of five it would seem!\" Glimmer laughed, and we all joined in, well, me just for show as I was none-to-happy to be having that loud mouth bird tagging along on <i>our</i> quest. And, just to rub it in, he screamed, \"Five! Five! Five!\" I covered my ears and sulked, stomping from the table to gather up my pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBright sunlight struck our eyes. I blinked and looked at the ground, until my light-sensitive eyes adjusted. The rest of our group gathered around me as the little fellow emerged last. Big hugs were shared all around, and I saw tears slipping from Bralina's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan wiped them from her cheeks with his small thumbs then planted a kiss on her forehead, which she had to bend over to receive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye! See you soon!\" we all said and turned, heading down a well-trodden path, heading north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll miss that little guy,\" Bralina said, and we all agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whoosh of air ruffled my hair as the crow flew right over me.

At times, the steepness had us slipping and sliding, for a light rain had fallen here over night, making our footing treacherous. We grabbed onto small saplings or roots to keep from plunging down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had we crested one of these monumental hills, than we were sliding down its backside, loose gravel kicking out from under our boots, then up another\u2014an endless row of teats rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can...,we...,stop a moment?\" Bralina asked, bending over and breathing hard as sweat poured down her flushed forehead and cheeks. I was glad she had asked, for my legs trembled and felt as though they'd turned into bread dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were on top of one of these teats, and we could see for many miles. \"Look, there,\" Stavin said pointing down and to his right. A meandering path cut through a light wood, and skirted around the last of the four giant hills. \"That's the way I'm going,\" he said as he tossed his pack down and himself too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer flopped down, too, and gave the boy a head rub. \"Smart boy,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe rested for half an hour, then made the last descent, and all of us agreed that we'd find another way to return, if we could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two-thirds of the way down, Bralina's foot twisted on the root of a scrub bush, and she went head over heels, landing in a heap. She let out a yelp at the bottom, wincing and holding her ankle. \"Ahhh, it hurts!\" she said as her face scrunched up in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see, Glimmer,\" said, being the first to reach her. Stavin and I slid down the rest of the way and went to see if we could help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay,\" the boy said. He reached out and grabbed her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take you hand away, Bralina,\" Glimmer said.  He gave her an encouraging smile, and said, \"Let me see. It's probably only a sprain.\" I could see blue and purple spots rising around the back of her ankle though no bones protruded, thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his careful examination, the prince assisted Bralina in sitting up. \"It's not broken, but I don't think you should walk on it for today, maybe tomorrow as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stavin, and you, too, Tyrl, scout around for two sturdy young saplings to make a travoix,\" he told us. \"Here, wait a moment.\" He walked over to me and rummaged in my pack I had set by my feet. He pulled out a very sharp ax and handed it to me. \"This should make light work of cutting them down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer picked up Bralina and carried her to rest in the shade of a large pine. He gathered bows from its lower branches, building them up to make a foot rest for the girl. \"It will aid in reducing the swelling if we keep that foot of yours elevated.\" Bralina gave him a small smile though the pain was still writ across her wrinkled brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Glim,\" she said then closed her eyes, and soon she was purring softly, giving a little moan every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twenty minutes later, Stavin and I returned with the saplings, which Glimmer stripped of the small branches with a sharp knife. \"Tyrl, go get your pack, and search it to find a large piece of leather and some rawhide strips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pack, being magical, came in handy, and, in no time, I had procured the items Glimmer needed. Stavin and I helped lash the leather to the poles, and soon we had a sturdy frame on which to carry Bralina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe ate a light lunch of cheese, grapes and fresh-baked bread with butter\u2014thank you, pack. After ten minutes of letting our bellies rest, Glimmer and I gently placed her on her new ride, and we set of again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you lucky, getting to ride the rest of the way to the swamp?\" Stavin teased her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ride! Ride! Ride!,' screamed the crow. He'd been circling ahead of us the whole way, but now her landed on Bralina's good leg, making himself at home.  \"Ride. Ride. Ride,\" he said in a much softer voice. <i> that is one smart bird.

Bralina complained that she most likely could walk, that all this business really wasn't necessary, but we didn't pay her no mind. Her ankle\u2014though not too swelled\u2014 had turned a vivid mixture of purple and blue and was still painful to the touch and/or any movement. There was no way she could bare weight on it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind kicked up a notch, blasting our hair back from our faces, and we put our heads down and trudged along, slower than we had been before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that awful stench?\" Stavin asked, waving his free hand about his face as he pulled his side of the travoix one handed. \"It's enough to make me gag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lackamoore Swamp, my friends,\" the prince said. He knitted his brow, gazing ahead. \"It won't be long now. I suggest we rest in the shade of that large maple tree up ahead. We need to discuss out plans to complete this quest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of us argued as we were more than wore out. Days of marching had done us in, and we all had the blisters, aches and a sprain as in Bralina's case to prove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all flopped down, relishing the shade the elm provided. \"How much further do you think, Glimmer?\" I asked, stretching out on my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say less than two miles, Tyrl, at least from the strong smell coming off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember Jarode said we must toss in the talisman he gave us, but were there any words to say? I don't recall,\" Bralina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe we toss it in, say a quick prayer to banish the 'Bad', restore the \"Good', then we get out of there. Jarode seemed to think something violent could occur,\" Glimmer said. I think Tyrl and I should go alone the last two miles as there's no way Bralina could run if need be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just a dang minute! I didn't come all this way to be left behind,\" Bralina said. Her face scrunched up in a scowl, her lip protruding in a pout. \"I won't stay behind! My ankles almost good as new, what with lying around all day on that contraption.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been decided. You would hinder our escape if it is needed. Glimmer stared her down, until she cast her eyes at the ground, still pouting but no longer protesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stavin, you okay to stay and watch over her?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. This were never my quest, and I've only come along to see a bit of the land. Ain't never been off Pa's farm much. He gave me a smile and sat down by Bralina, who'd grown very fond of the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us get this over with, Tyrl.\" And he and I stood, giving the two remaining behind friends a nod.

With each step that I advanced toward this evil body of filth, they wobbled and sent me slithering sideways as if an earthquake shook the ground. <i> Something doesn't want us coming any closer! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The 'Bad', Tyrl!

I looked over at him, and he was pointing back the way we'd just come. I saw his lips saying, \"Back! Back! and we turned and stumbled back for half a mile, finally collapsing beneath the cooling shelter of another massive pine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was beyond gross, horrible, no..., I don't know what it was,\" I said, swiping at the tears streaming from my sore eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI' ha...ehh, ahh!\" Glimmer coughed and spat out a wad of black slimy goo. \"Arg..! That is just nasty business!\" he said. His face had gone pale, and I thought he might collapse, so I sprang to his side to support him. He breathed in a few more gulps of the, at least, fresher air here by the tree, though it still carried a pungent blast of foulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be alright\", Glimmer said, a bit of color coming back into his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You scared me about as much as that awful wailing we heard, I said.

I've a plan.} He raised his eyebrows and gave me a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe rested for a good half hour, then Glim sat up, and said,\"Here's what we'll do, my good friend. There is pine sap leaking from many of the branches and the trunk of this tree. We will gather up as much as we can and spread it on small pine bows, placing another layer on top. It's fairly sticky stuff, so that should glue it together. Then we shall lash it across our faces, covering all of our noses and mouths. This should help somewhat with the horrendous odor, though I don't think there is much we can do for our eyes. At least we won't be retching every few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time to accomplish this task, but once our pine bow masks were in place, we set of again, though we both seemed to want to drag our feet, in no hurry to get back. We looked to be two men walking to the gallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 575 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Foot dragging or not we came back within sight of the cursed Lackamoor Swamp. The pine bows Glimmer had suggested worked well to diminish the foul stench but nothing could eliminate it completely. And, while our noses and stomachs were most grateful for the masks, our eyes suffered horrendously. I looked over at my friend and thought he must be crying, for great tears fell in abundance from his eyes. He swiped at them and shook his head, new ones forming before his face could dry. I, too, did the same, wishing this were over and done with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we wrestled with our blurred vision another problem arose, for a great gray cloud formed in the middle of the swamp, where the reeds grew thick and tall. It snaked out like ghostly fingers, its tendrils searching us out. Within minutes, we could see nothing, not he I, nor I him, nor even our own outstretched hands, so complete did it block out any light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glimmer!\" I said, panic rising up to form a bile in my throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here,\" he said, reaching out and poking me in my already sore eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Tyrl. I didn't realize you were standing so close to me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we to do now, Glim?\" I asked. Jarode said the talisman must be thrown into the very heart of the swamp, and we are only standing on it's edge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must inch our way in. But be very careful where you place your feet, for there are sinkholes and much that can swallow a beast or man whole. Come,\" he said, gripping my wrist and trying to pull me forward a step.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped. For a moment my legs remained locked as though they were between the jaws of a massive vice; trapped firmly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyrl? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but lead on.\" I hoped the quiver in my voice wasn't too noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe advanced three steps before we heard <i>something</i>, \"Clickity-clack, clack, hisssss,\" it cried out, like some grotesque half reptilian, half insect thing. It was approaching fast. To make matters worse it now chomped its jaws together, or so I imagined. \"Chomp! Chomp!\" They had to be very large jaws, with very large teeth, to make such a loud racket. I gulped again, reaching out and grabbing Glimmer's shoulder. \"Whaa...,oh, man, Glim, what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a fear rose up in me that I attempted to bolt, but the elf held firmly on to my wrist as if he had anticipated this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt him lean into me, and whisper, \"To the left. Go to your left.\" Now I was leading him, hoping I'd not guide us both into a mud hole or something worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clacking noise became fainter, and we both stopped for a moment. Sweat rolled off my face, my heart fluttered like a cadged bird's wings hitting the bars of its prison. \"I'm scared, Glim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And rightly so,\" the elf said. <i>That helps! Thanks, Glimmer.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light wind touched us for a moment, clearing away a bit of the putrid gray cloud that had surrounded us. We could see around in about a six foot diameter. No more. I spied a large stump from some long dead oak it looked to be, and both of us sat down, breathing hard. No sooner had we than the cloud engulfed us once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really not liking this swamp at all! I hope we find those reeds soon, toss that darn talisman in, and get the heck out of here! Without getting eaten, too, huh, Glim? No answer. Glim? Gim!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought I'd upchuck right then and there, so frightened was I to think I was alone, alone with that thing out there. \"GIMMER!\" Nothing, not a peep, but then, far away, but growing louder, \"Clickity-clack, clack, hsssssss! \"NO!\" I jumped up and bolted back off to my left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf prince had been sitting to my left, so surely he went this way. <i>But why did he leave me? Or did he? Maybe that thing stole up and took him, or maybe he stood up and paced about and fell into a whole. Stop it, Tyrl! Get a hold of yourself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter slogging forward a good dozen paces, I heard him. Gurgling, the words hard to make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty...,glug...,rl...,ahhgh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glim! Where are you?\" The sound had came from lower than where I stood, so I got down on my knees, crawling about in a wide circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...,help...aagh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached out both hands swinging them in a wide circle. \"Slap!\" My left hand struck the soft flesh of what had to be my friend. My other hand shot in, and I reached down into a slimy substance, grasping the elf beneath his armpits. I tugged, but he would not budge. I gripped him tighter and strained back with all my might. I kept up the pressure, tugging even harder, until at last I heard a sucking, slurping noise as his body withdrew from the gross muck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay half in, half out of it, while I sprawled on my back, thoroughly spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha...,thank you, Tyrl, my..., my friend.\" He lay there panting for a time, then used his arms to drag himself the rest of the way out. \"I thought..., I thought my goose was cooked for sure!\" he gave a small laugh, but I knew he didn't think it a bit funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" was my only response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had not rested but a few precious moments before the beast could be heard, closer than ever. Now I could hear that its body must be cavernous. A loud slithering, slopping, thud, thud shook the ground, threatening to knock us from our feet. We scrabbled up, Glim taking the lead, and dragging me along again. \"Run!\" he said, and I swear I felt hot breath on my leg, and the hideous clacking right behind us. \"Faster,\" Glimmer said. We bolted like two scared wet hares escaping a flooding warren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe came to an abrupt halt as we crashed into something solid and unmoving. We fell apart, crumbling each to a side. \"Ouch!\" I said, grasping my right elbow. \"Glim?\" When he didn't answer immediately, I screamed at the top of my lungs, \"GLIMMER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tryl! Stop that! I am here. I thought my neck was surely broke. It took me a moment to regain my breath,\" he said. But to be sure, I scooted close to the sound of his voice, and reached out and touched him with my shaking hands. I sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must try to be quite. We will draw that thing to us otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I am sorry, but I just want this over with, Glim. You know what I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you, my friend. Soon it will be.\" And he said it with such finality, I nearly believed it. Nearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come,\" he said, placing his shoulder next to mine. \"Let us see what we crashed into. Perhaps it will lead to the center of the swamp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe crawled back where I had sat and put our hands out, groping in the gray mist. Our hands touched smooth wood. \"A door!\" I said, standing, and searching. \"I found the knob,\" I said. But, all of a sudden, I thought,  <i>Maybe we don't want to open it. Maybe something worse than clickty-clack thing lives within!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf prince stood alongside me and pushed my hand off of the knob. \"Wait.\" he said, he reached inside the pack on my back and brought out two glowing swords. They emitted a bright blue light that drove back the gray mist, enough that we could see the dim outline of the door, its knob of brass highly polished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the heck didn't we get these out before?\" I asked, my voice sounded quavery, and I gave a delighted little laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear has a way of driving sense from a man's mind,\" the elf said, and he too gave a nervous laugh of relief. We both felt more sure, so that he placed his hand back on the knob and turned it. A creaking sounded as if this door had not been opened in a long, long time. I thought the hinges would bust off, so loud was the complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside it was black as pitch. I poked my sword in, and I could just make out a narrow tunnel. The walls seemed to be comprised of hard stone. Glimmer took a step in, his own sword leading out front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran my hand over the smoothness of the wall. It was so sleek to my touch. It was as if water had flowed through this tunnel for many eons, polishing them. The tunnel went on and on, and we both noticed we seemed to be going in a spiral. I hoped it was spiraling toward the center where we needed to go. At last, we came to the end, and there stood an identical door to the one we had entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Glim?\" I asked him, furrowing my brows, gulping back my mounting fear. \"Do you think it is the middle of this swamp? Who would have placed these doors here? Do you think it  could have been an ancient sorcerer?\" Sweat rolled down my forehead and stung my sore eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it was, Tyrl, let's pray he worked for the 'Good',\" the prince said, placing his hand on the knob and giving it a twist. A blast of hot, putrid air caused him to pull back his hand, slamming the door shut again. \"Arrgh!\" he said, coughing out another wad of black crud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're definitely going to need something stronger than pine sap to squelch that horrid smell,\" I said, shaking my head and trying to wave off the foulness that seemed to want to choke the life from us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I know exactly the thing that will do the trick, Tyrl,\" the elf said, his face lighting up like a bright blue candle from his hefted sword. Once again he reached into my magic pack, and extracted two clear vials with a pink substance half filling each. \"Oil of the 'Sabbalac' flower. I wish I had thought of this before we approached this wretched place! he said,\" shaking his head in self scorn and handing me one. \"Take off your mask, and place a single drop, for it is powerful, on yours. Surely this will block out even that foul odor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door a second time, and to his credit, the foul blast of air that rushed out, seemed to be diluted by at least half with the aid of the sweet smelling flower nectar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stepped through together, for the door was tall and wide. What we saw, what we smelled, what we heard, made no sense. No sense at all! This could not be the middle of the swamp. Could it...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no reeds. There was no stench. No clackity-clack, clack, either, so far. But what there was!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,839 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

It was good to see my optimistic friend back, so I returned them both, giving him a hug to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we just may make it out of here alive, Glim!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of refreshment, for our throats were parched raw from the foulness of the outside, we began to explore our new surroundings. In the center, a lovely teal colored lake took up a good portion of the cave. A small waterfall flowed from so high up, its origin could not be viewed from the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Tyrl!\" Glimmer said, and I followed his pointing hand, and I spotted what had him so excited. A pair of graceful swans, both white, swam in lazy circles, far out on the beautiful lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It..., it's magnificent, Glim,\" I said. I spun about, trying to take it all in. We were in some cavernous cave, but there was a giant hole in its ceiling, and blue skies could be seen. I inhaled fresh clear air. I could not get enough. I became dizzy with gulping it in as did Glimmer. We fell down, laughing, on soft light green grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe hadn't meant to, but having been through so much on this long quest we fell into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tryl. Tyrl, wake up,\" someone said, polking me in the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I..., I want to go back to sleep. I was having a wonderful dream,\" I said, yawning and rolling over. Now a boot roughly prodded at m leg. \"Arg! Why won't you let me slee...,\" I began to say, then saw the tall. old man standing over Glimmer and I.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wore a long gray robe, belted with rough rope, sandals on his large tanned feet. His beard ran down the length of his thin chest, thick and lustrous and he stood towering over us. He bore no weapons but held a carved oak staff in his right hand. His face seemed as serene as the waters of the lake we'd raved over before we'd drifted off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is he?\" I whispered to the elf prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Narthargan, young man.\" His voice resonated like a well worn lute, soft and mellow, fatherly almost.  \"An who be you?\" he gave us each a stare, that for some reason seemed okay. He had an air about him, an aura of peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do, Nathergan,\" the prince said, standing and giving the elderly man a love bow of respect. \"I am 'Prince Glimmervan of the Secret Forest', and this is my travelling companion, Tyrl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood also, giving him a nod and moving next to Glim just in case he should prove unfriendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man moved to sit upon a large flat-topped rock , sitting near the water's edge. Glim and I followed, still keeping our distance, our swords sheathed and hanging down our sides, at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need for those,\" he said and gave a wave of his large weathered hand. Both our swords came up and out of our sheathes and flew like kites in a strong wind to land against the cave's side wall. They clattered down, a ringing filling the quiet cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? How did you do that?\" I asked, scratching my tousled hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim beat him to the answer though and said, \"Magic. You're a wizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled at this, and nodded his head, his long white hair falling across his wide forehead. He brushed it back, and smiled. \"You are correct, good Prince of the Secret Forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, may I ask how you have come to find the Hidden Lake?\" he waited patiently, folding his large hands and leaning back with his long legs outstretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are on a Quest, and sent by my Father, 'King Fabellious\" and our friend Jarode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jarode. Yes. Jarode is a very old name, and one given only to the son's of wizards of renown. Tell me, is your friend also a wizard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at Glim, wondering whether we should divulge secrets about ourselves or others. After all, we really didn't know this man from squat. Glim looked to be considering this too, for he waited a full minute before replying. \"He is, and a very good wizard, both in deeds and in his art.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho! The old man gave a hearty laugh. A wizard of some renown. Then, my new friends, I would very much like to meet this wizard.

His gray robes swirled about his long legs as he turned and faced the cavern lake. He extended his staff with the runes etched upon it, thrusting it toward the water...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fasama El Jarode!\" the wizard's voice blasted through the cave, bouncing back at us with deafening reverberations. Glim and I covered our ears, wincing as our ear drums throbbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cloud of pure white light exploded with another barbaric burst of sound, this more cacophonous than the first. Both Glim and I fell to the ground, moaning in pain. I saw a thin trickle of blood run down the side of the elf's face, even as I felt the wetness on my own face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter images flashed before my eyes, and I scrunched them closed against the pain. When I opened them, spots of white danced before them, then slowly my vision began to clear. At first, I thought I'd gone mad, mad with this wizard's display of magical power, but I blinked, and blinked again. He still stood there by the lake, facing Narthargan, his white robes stark and brilliant compared to Narthargan's dingy gray. \"Jarode! I called out. \"But..., but, how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back, Tyrl, Jarode said. I saw his lips move, then panicked as I heard nothing. \"What?!\" I screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarode must have magically enhanced his voice, for this time I heard him clear as a bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back, I said, Tyrl, for this does not concern you nor Prince Glimmervan. This is between my brother and I.\" he told us, placing one long leg behind and one in front, he took up a defensive pose, raising his own carved staff up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro..., brother? Did he say brother, Glim?\" My voice was not enhanced, and Glim shrugged his shoulders, mouthing, Come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a time, I began to hear the waterfall gurgling over from high above. At least we had not been permanently deafened. \"Did he say brother? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That he did,\" the elf said. \"I suggest we retreat to the near to the door, lest we need to make a fast escape.\" We did, and stood watching the two wizards locked in a combative stare. Both of their staffs now crackled with energy; Jarodes sparkled like diamonds in a heavy mist, whereas Narthargan's seemed almost foul, like the putrid mist we saw rising from 'Glackamoor Swamp'. <i>He is no good wizard. Is he, Tyrl? You were nearly tricked!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you smell that?\" the prince asked me. We gazed about for where the faint odor could be coming from. \"There!\" he called out, pointing beyond the two wizards, who were now shooting off flames of white and gray light at one another. Glim continued to point, and I followed his directing finger. The lake! Up out of the middle rose swamp-like clouds as if the swamp were invading the pristine waters of this beautiful lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem we were deceived, Tyrl,\" the elf said, hanging his golden crowned head in shame. \"And, see, he pointed at the water again, even the teal beauty is vanishing, and it is nothing more than that blasphemous swamp! His eyes narrowed with anger, his fists knotting. My heart thudded, and I, too, grew angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must help Jarode,\" he said. \"There, see those mid-size rocks? Grab one.\" We both ran over to snatch one from the side of the cavern, then I followed the prince as we dashed in close to the dueling wizards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo focused on each other, and still blasting each other with even brighter bolts of light, they did not see us approaching. \"On the count of three, Tyrl, aim for his chest, and if we hit his head, so much the better. One..., two..., thr...,ee! We both heaved our heavy stones, and Thwump! Thwump! Mine hit him smack in the chest, and I heard bones cracking like dried twigs. The prince's rock hit the left side of his face, taking off half the wizard's nose and scraping down his cheek to the bone. One of his eyes lay half out of it's socket, crimson blood oozing from all his many wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAArg!\" Narthargan bellowed, thrusting his staff in our direction, even while he attempted to stuff his damaged eye back in place. Glim and I dove apart, me to the right, and him to the left. His bolt of light split between us and crashed into the wall near the door. A great chunk of rock flew from it, and a spiderweb of cracks began to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the break Jarode had needed, for he took careful aim, and with one last humongous blast, he blew his brother off his feet. I blinked from the brilliance. And when my eyes had adjusted, nothing remained of him but a smoldering pile of dusty gray cloth and a short length of his rope belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe heard the old man sigh and saw him lurch forward. Glimmer darted to his side and caught him before he slammed into the large boulder by the lake. He breathed heavily, leaning upon the elf for support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, wherein we had all remained silent, contemplating this last series of events, Jarode spoke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was foolish! Foolish indeed to come between two wizards, you young fools.\" His voice, at first stern, had gradually softened near the last bit. \"But, I am glad you are <i>my</i> young fools..,er..., friends.\" he said at the last. His old whit-tooth smile touch his eyes, setting them to twinkling, and Glim and I returned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother long gap of silence ensued as we each rested, lost in our own thoughts. Then the young prince sat up, and asked, \"Good Jarode, was that foul man really your brother as you called him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid so, Glim,\" though I am not proud, or I should say, I was not proud to be his brother. No. From the time we were wee lads, he had a mean and dark streak in him as though the \"Bad' had always been within him. He left our small village, where we had both trained as apprentices under a renowned wizard, named Agore. No one ever heard from him after that. Though I long suspected he had gone off to practice the dark side of our craft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall we do now?\" I asked Jarode. If that lake is really part of 'Glackamoor Swamp', then perhaps we may toss the talisman in from here to banish the 'Bad'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,087 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

He still rested upon the flat-topped rock near the teal lake, 'The Hidden Lake' as the now dead Narthargan had called it. \"I would urge caution, however, for I surmise this is the very place my brother practiced his darkness, and if that be so, he may have warded all within this cavern, even the lake, itself.\" Jarode said, his face pulled down in a slight frown of thought. He raised his bushy white eyebrows at Glim and I, waggling them and nodding his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are wise, good Jarode,\" the elf told the old man. \"How may we aide you in searching for these magical wards, Jarode?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid magic is best left to magic, good prince, however,' he grinned, I am famished after that fierce battle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all laughed at that, and Glim and I set about preparing the old man a feast deserving of a conqueror. While we did Jarode strode about the large cavern, around all sides of the teal lake, and he even contemplated the waterfall and ceiling for a good bit of time, I noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look here,\" Glim said, pulling out a whole cooked turkey, brown and crisp and set upon a gorgeous platter he'd pulled from the magic pack Jarode had given me so long ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to be outdone, I rummaged in the pack for some time, then, smiled big as a Cheshire cat as I plucked a white and red checkered table cloth from it, complete with matching red napkins, real silverware that gleamed in the late afternoon light streaming in the sky hole above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" I cried out as Glim tried to reach around me into the pack. \"I need these, too,\" I said bringing forth three crystal goblets of which I struck one with my thumb and fore finger, producing a lovely \"Ping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He tried to get in, yet again, and I snatched the pack closer to me and said, \"If you please, my friend, I am not quite finished!\" He gave a little huff, but sat back waiting for me to finish my display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, I searched for my last contribution to our grand feast; \"Aha! I have it! Out came a huge bottle of a very fine red wine. \"All yours, Glim, I said, pushing the pack back to him.\" He ruffled my hair and smirked at me, then began digging deeper in the pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potatoes shall go nicely, mashed, of course,  the elf told me, setting a big bowl on the center of the cloth next to his scrumptious turkey.\"Quite right,\" I agreed, smacking my lips. My stomach was beginning to rumble in protest of having to wait so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else? Oh, well, we certainly must have sweetened cranberries, and yams, and corn, and fresh baked hard rolls, butter, and what for desert?\" he finished, puffing with that long winded spiel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I rather fancy some strawberry-rhubarb crisp, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most excellent choice, Tyrl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat patiently for a time, waiting for Jarode to finish his inspection of the cave when, at last, he strolled over. He eased his old bones down onto the soft mat of grass, spreading his long legs off to the side of the table cloth. \"Well! It would seem my two young friends have not been idle. It smells wonderful, and I am hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim passed him a plate and a set of the expensive silverware. Jarode filled his plate to overflowing, like he was a starving lumberjack, who'd not eaten, ever! Glimmer and I roared in delight, heaping our own plates the same. We all stuffed ourselves to over-full as well, then lay back upon the light green grass and slept for a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I opened my bleary eyes, night had fallen and moonlight crept across the sky hole and the lake, sending shimmers of grey and white rippling across the water. I saw the two swans, still gliding on that placid water, and I thought it a very good sign, indeed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jarode made a small fire from twigs and branches he'd pulled from the pack, and we soon had a nice little fire to vanquish the shadows that were rapidly filling our cavern. He set about making a delicious smelling coffee, and on this we sipped to clear the cobwebs that sometimes formed from afternoon naps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful coffee, Jarode,\" Glim said, setting his mug on a flat stone he had found for a makeshift table. \"Where did the beans come from, for I've never tasted anything like them?\" he asked Jarode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, very far to the south, on yet another island I visited last spring,\" the old man answered. \"Gabol, if I recall the name. It means 'The Island of Love', and the people there are quite friendly, if you catch my drift.\" I'd never heard the old man speak as such, and I blushed a deep shade of red, while he and Glimmer shared a laugh at my expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf, as he was wont to do, absently plucked a blade of thick grass, folding it in two and bringing it to his full lips. He played us a soft, sad melody, then a livelier tune, as the old man said we should be on alert and not napping more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" the old man said, pushing himself up straighter and leaning back against the big rock by the lake, \"about this business with the talisman, and whether or not, to throw it into the lake. I believe that is the course we shall take, Tyrl, Glim,\" he said, looking over at us as we put away the remnants of our feast. <i>It never ceased to amaze what all we could pull from and stuff back into the small pack! But that is, after all, magic, eh, Tyrl?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Where was i? Oh, I have been thinking, and if we were to make our way to the top of the falls,\" he paused here, pointing and drawing our eyes to the now silvery water splashing down into the lake, from there we should be able to throw it the farthest. I think, too, it is critical that it land near mid-center, for surely that is where Nathargan would have set his evil to work, his awakening of the 'Bad', if you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know just the way to reach the top of the waterfall,\" Glimmer said. <i>Of course he would.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We'd all had more than enough, after more lengthy discussion on reaching the waterfall's summit and much back and forth contemplating on just how the talisman would vanquish the 'Bad\", hopefully for good, though even if it set it back a pace, we had all felt that would be a great success. \"Let's get some shut eye, young friends, Jarode said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim and I pulled sleeping mats, blankets, and even three goose down pillows from the pack, that we might rest comfortably and be refreshed come morning for our great task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lay upon my comfy bed, sleep eluding me for a time as I am sure it did the other two. I must have fallen into a deep sleep, for I dreamed the evil wizard, Nathargan, lived, once more, and he chased me through my slumber, shooting my backside with his foul bolts of gray light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, Tyrl,\" I heard Glimmer saying. I opened my sore eyes to one of his famous, bright white smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Thank you, Glim, my friend\" I was being slowly roasted by Nathargan in my dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he's quite dead, young Tyrl,\" the old man assured me, smiling too. Apparently, the old man and the elf prince had been up for some time, while I'd snored on. The old man handed me another of his cups of fine-brewed coffee. I wrapped my hands around it, relishing the warmth of the mug, for the cavern had grown cool over night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if everyone is wide-eyed-and-bushy-tailed?\" Glimmer asked. I think it time to surmount that waterfall's top. He pulled the pack, my pack, closer to himself, and with a bit of effort, he tugged a small contraption from it. It was made of hard wood, maybe oak, with bits of gleaming brass holding its parts together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is it?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pulled a long length of rope from the pack, with a small grappling hook attached to one end, he answered me, \"That, tyrl, is a miniature catapult, and it will fling this hook very far. Hopefully, all the way to the top of the waterfall. You see those large boulders to the left up there? That is where we want our hook to land. Behind them, so that when we ascend this knotted rope (I looked to see that it was indeed knotted), it will pull snug and bear our weight, and if not, well, we would tumble back down into the water, and there are no large stones, I noticed, to break our bones.\" He thought this uproariously funny, though I gulped back a bit of fear, seeing how high up we'd be if it did let loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we'd best forego breakfast, Glimmer said,\" looking straight at me. \"I think Tyrl is afraid of heights.\" He rubbed my hair as he so liked to do and smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, <i>I</i> wasn't born in a tree!\" I said, and he and Jarode, and then I, too, laughed, trying to scare off my jitters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer strode out into the teal water, stopping when he reached the middle of the waterfall. He stood about twenty feet from the falls, so that he could see the rocks above. Setting the hook in his catapult, he then cranked it up tight, took aim, and fired it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe soon realized that getting the hook up there would take a few tries, but Glimmer, as I knew from watching him shoot his arrows straight and true, many a time, managed to embed it behind the large boulders on his third attempt, just as he'd said he could. He gave the rope a couple of hard pulls, then climbed up about a third of the way, and with great ease I noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back down, he strode through the calm water of the lake, and flopped down on its grassy bank. \"We'll be up top in no time,\" he said smiling at me and Jarode in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the old man nodded, and I wondered how he'd have the strength to propel himself up, what with him being quite ancient. But, he soon put my worryings to rest, when he lightly touched his own shoulder with the tip of his staff, then did likewise to mine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn't felt anything, but then, a tingling went through my muscles, and I felt very much alive. I grinned like a school boy out of class without a pass. \"What is this?! It feels magnificent! I feel as though I could climb twenty of those ropes, keep right on a climbing up to the heavens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was beyond elated, until Jarode placed a hand on my shoulder. Immediately I began to calm, my breathing slowed, and I let out a long sigh. I still quivered a bit, but it seemed to be ebbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My fault, Jarode,\" said, giving a big guffaw, which Glimmer joined in with, but not I. \"I'm afraid I gave you a little too much get-up-and-go, there, young friend. A small smiled tugged at my lips as I never could stay mad at either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" I said, acting as though still slightly miffed for being the butt of their little joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall go first,\" Jarode said, and with that he waded out to the dangling rope and went up hand over hand with ease, his long white robe billowing around him in the gentle breeze drifting down from the sky hole. The higher he went, the more it billowed about, and one time it rose up to cover his face. His pale legs looking like two sun-starved saplings. I thought he might fall, but the robe resettled, and then he was up top. He stood looking down at us and gave us a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're next, Tyrl. It will be easy, I promise. Just don't look down,\" the prince said, grabbing the rope and handing it to me. I grasped it in my sweaty hands, then looked up. \"Okay,\"I said, reaching one hand up to the knot above, I began to climb. Up. Up. And up some more, and then, I looked down. The cavern began to spin, and I gritted my teeth, squeezing my eyes shut. <i>Breathe, Tryl. Breathe.</i> After a moment of hanging there in mid-air, I looked back up. Placing one hand up, I began to ascend again, chanting, just one more, just one more, until Jarode was, thankfully, hauling me over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,077 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Glimmer was the last to begin the long climb to the top of the waterfall. Both Jarode and I stood near the edge watching him come up. When my head began to spin and my legs to wobble, the old man gently pushed me back, and I plopped down on the soft grass that adorned the summit of the waterfall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, the swift and sure-handed elf hauled himself up and over the edge. We gazed about at the wondrous site. Here, on the top, grew a wild assortment of plants and flowers; giant ferns, bushes, trees, and so much more grew here. The bees buzzed and sipped nectar from, at least, a thousand blossoms spread about in a dizzying rainbow of color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowzers!\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a beautiful spot! \"Wouldn't it be grand to build a house here amongst all this..., this bounty of nature,\" Glimmer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first, my young, impatient friends,\" the old man said. \"Tyrl, have you the talisman I gave you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the pack, scrabbling about until I felt its smooth wooden edges in my grasp. I pulled it out and examined it. It had runes all over it, in a language I couldn't hope to decipher. I handed it to Jarode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" he told us, holding it up so that the gems embedded in the front of it shone in the early morning sunlight, \"is very old, even older than I,\" he said, laughing at that. \"And that would be older than dirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I shall place strength upon our elf friend, for his aim is to be envied,\" Jarode said as he handed the magical object to Glimmer. He touched both of Glim's thin but broad shoulders, tapping each lightly. Glimmer shuttered, then wiggled in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Tyrl, it is delightful!\" He did manage to contain it better than I had though, I noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, young prince, aim for the middle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer cocked his long arm back, squinted one eye, then plunged his arm forward. The talisman arched up high, tumbling as it went, then it began its descent. Down. Down. Down into the very center of the lake. It splashed in, making ripples that grew out in ever widening circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw the two white swans, then, and they had swam for the shore and were now flapping their wings up and out of the water. They waddled off a dozen yards or so, then turned as if anticipating something. But nothing happened. The water lay placid, not the tiniest movement on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all stood staring at it from atop the falls. Then...,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe calmness shattered, and the teal waters of the lake shot up and out of the sky hole! More and more of the water was funneled up, and more. Half an hour later, we gaped at an empty hole where the lake had once been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?!\" I asked, shaking my head in utter disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarode looked at Glimmer and I, and he said, the 'Good', young friends! The 'Good' is what happened! And if I am right then we must descend, and we must go back out the way you two came when you entered the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..., but that way is dangerous,\" I protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I begin to understand why,\" the elf prince said, turning to gaze at the old man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssh!,\" Jarode said to him. Let us keep it for a fine surprise for Tyrl.\" Both of them nodded in agreement then, and Glimmer deftly hopped over the edge, scuttling down the rope, like an experienced pirate from a crow's nest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI needed a little encouragement to toss my leg over into open space, quite a lot, actually. My knuckles were white with fear, but I closed my eyes and made my way down, and Jarode soon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we'd all assembled on the grass, we flopped down for a bit of rest. That was when Glimmer's jaw fell open, for across the way, stood a naked man and woman, well, naked except for the few white feathers they held in personal places. A large pile of feathers lay scattered about them and both of the swans were no where to be seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man looked as if he would faint, and he reached out and grasped my shoulder, digging in his nails. \"It cannot be!\" he cried out. He took a step forward, then another, then stood staring at the comely couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sported masses of shoulder-length golden ringlets. Their identical eyes a soft, robin's egg blue. They were young as well, not much into their teen years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...,\" Jarode cleared his throat, then pointing at the girl he began again, \"Alivina,\" he said, giving her a low bow, and you would be her twin brother, Alastin. Am I correct?\" he asked them, giving the boy a sweeping bow and an extra flourish with his white robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice still shook slightly as he turned to me and Glim and said, \"These two have been missing for many a year. They are the son and daughter of the King of the North, Valaspar. But..., how?!\" He scratched his head, then tugged on his long white beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, the prince, I would assume, spoke first, saying, \"And who would you good rescuers be?\" He gave each of us a nod, his royal curls bouncing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the Wizard, Jarode. This is Prince Glimmervan of the 'Secret Forest' and our young friend, Tyrl. I have known your good father for many a year. He has been beside himself with grief all these long years. \"Oh! The joy that shall fall upon his face when you lovely children grace his castle once again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that proclamation, the old man strode to the pair, and he swept them both up in a fierce embrace, knocking their modesty feathers to the ground. I averted my youthful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone for another feast?\" Glim asked, his smile beaming and gleaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me, Glim. I can eat any time,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we'd found some suitable clothing for the brother and sister in the pack, of course, Glim and I set about pulling food out and this and that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,037 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

I thought their wide eyes would burst from their sockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I imagine one grows tired of eating worms and bugs and plants, no?\" Jarode joked with them, laughing a deep belly laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of them smiled their eyes lit up, much as Jarode's did, twinkling is what I liked to call it. And, with every bit they brought to their identical cherry-red lips, they, \"ooohed, and ahhed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Alastin! Do you remember when we were very small and mother wood fetch us up warm cheery tarts from the kitchen? I do! And they tasted very much like these,\" the young princess squealed, stuffing another large bite into her half-full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember that,\" Alastin told his sister, but I do remember how much I loved roast beef!\" He, too, was cramming it in so fast, we all thought the pair of them would choke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our friends await us outside,\" Glimmer told them, after everyone had had their fill of food. \"We have left them for too long, and I fear for their safety as one of them is inured or was. If anything came upon them, I am afraid, she'd not been able to run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a wave of guilt over this, over leaving Bralina and Stavin to themselves and without the aide of the pack, too. But repelling the 'Bad' had been foremost in our minds as we'd separated that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to say that the outside is not quite as lovely as this beautiful cavern that has served as your home all these years,\" I told Alivina and Alastin. I saw Glim sneak a look and share a smile with Jarode, and my mind began to wonder. <i>hmm..., no, that could not be!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed we were always gathering up feasts, but none-the-less, we packed up this one, and when everyone was ready, we walked to the tall and wide door that had brought us here. We wound our way out, round and round, just as we had the first time, only going in a different direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we came to the last bend, I called out, \"Here it is!\" I remembered the straight section that had led us in, and now it took us out. I gulped, hoping, that  everything would be okay. I prayed no harm had come to Bralina and Stavin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait up, Tyrl,\" Glim called out as he came forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jarode chimed in. I think I should be the first out, and having said that, he thrust his staff out in front of him and led us on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright sunlight stung out eyes, so accustomed to the cavern's dimmer light had our eyes become. But that is not what had me gaping!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glim! Glim, do you see this?! \"What has become of the foul swamp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know,\" Tyrl, he said, smiling one of his biggest smiles yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jarode said, going out and looking in a wide circle. \"The wind must have carried all the waterfall to land all across this swamp. It has carried the 'Good' and cleansed this foul place at last!\" Tears shone in the old wizard's tired eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so glad, and I thank you for your wisdom, and my father's in sending us on this quest and in your aiding us, good Jarode,\" the prince said to him. \"However, I think we had best be going, for it is a good two miles from here where Tyrl and I left Stavin and Bralina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, by all means, let us make haste to them, Gliimer. Lead on,\" the old man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, for we were as weary as when we'd been going in as we were in coming out of the once swamp land, we came upon the giant elm we had left the pair of friends under.  I spied Bralina's travoix we had carried her on, but they were not to be see. It looked as though the waterfall had reached even here, for the ground was saturated with water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Glimmer called out. \"See, here, and here?\" Two sets of prints led away to the left, one big, one much smaller. \"They've gone somewhere. But it will be easy to track them, at least where it is damp,\" the elf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe'd gone down the left hand side of a game trail and exited into a small meadow, when we first heard their voices, well, voices and the splashing of water. Giggles and playful screams led us through a patch of blueberries, which I stopped to grab up a few, stuffing the delicious fruit in my mouth as I continued to walk, and just beyond, there they were! They had shucked down to their small clothes and were floating and splashing themselves in a wonderful, but small, <i>teal-colored</i> pond!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a low whistle, and their heads whipped our way. \"Hey, ya great big oaf,\" Bralina called out to me. \"Took you guys long enough! We could have been long dead and buried all the while you two took. And! Jarode! How did you get here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer and Stavin swam the short distance to the ponds edge and clamored out, shaking their hair so that it sprayed all of us. Bralina laughed,\" her face flushed and healthy with the glow of new tanned skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Watch it!\" I told her, brushing water from my face. \"Hello to you, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah..., who are these two lovelies?\" Bralina asked, eyeing the siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be a very long story, and one told best after a refreshing swim,\" Glimmer said, stripping down. I did likewise, and we both swam about in the beautiful teal pond, while Jarode and the twins walked in ankle-deep water, to cool themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, being both weary and hungry, we all decided to make camp and strike out in the morning for Glimmer's home in the forest.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning dawned sweet, with no foul smells, no putrid swamp to dampen our spirits! I had dreamed the foulness of the 'Bad' had crept back in, saturating the surrounding land with its stench of evil, but as I opened my bleary eyes, I saw it had only been a nightmare, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sunshine,\" Bralina said, handing me a cup of Jarode's steaming, delicious brew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to you, Bralina,\" I said. \"How is your ankle today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That? I haven't thought about it in two days, so I guess it is very good,\" she smiled and continued to fry sausages on a flat stone someone had found and laid across the white hot fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ya cooking, Glim?\" I asked the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My own special scrambled eggs,\" he said, giving a large pan next to Baralina's makeshift one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure smells good around here,\" Stavin chimed in, sitting up from his bedroll near the fire and giving a big stretch and yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" the wizard said. \"Now that you two sleepyheads have finally awoken, we have urgent business to discuss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, including the newest additions to our party, the Swan Twins as we were calling them, grabbed plates and helped themselves to the finished food. We talked as we ate, everyone in a rare good mood, what with the new blossoming of this land. We all counted our blessings that this quest had gone in our favor, in favor of the 'Good'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all,\" Jarode said, holding his hand up as he'd taken another huge spoonful of Glim's spiced eggs, \"Ah..., yes..., he swallowed and went on. I believe we really should consider splitting this group into two groups. Glim, Tyrl, I would ask that you two escort the twins back to their father, the King of the North, KIng Valaspar. Wait, hear me out. The rest of us should continue on as planned, returning to the 'Secret Forest' to bring King Fabellious up to date on this quest's success Now, has anyone any objections to that, and, if so, please tell me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that a splendid plan, good Jarode,\" the elf prince said. He chomped down a sausage in two bites. Who could blame the slender elf for being famished what with all the energy we'd all exerted over the last week. I, myself, felt as if I could eat an entire mountain of sausages!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Bralina would be the first to raise an objection saying, \"Why can't I go with Glim and Tyrl?\" she asked, one of her famous pouts pulling down her cherub-like mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The less in that party, the faster they will be able to travel,\" the old wizard said. \"With so many different groups of King's Guards seeking our demise, I think that the wisest course of action to take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so, but I'm not very happy about it,\" Bralina said, one corner of her mouth pulled up, giving him a half-hearted smile, but it never reached her lovely blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then, it is settled?\" the old man asked, looking around at each of us. The twins nodded, silent as ever, but maybe they had much to contemplate, after being away from their home all these years. <i>I wonder what it felt like to be turned into a swan?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, everyone pitched in cleaning up and packing it all back in my magic pack, then we all enjoyed one last cup of Jarode's delicious coffee, except the twins, who had yet to grow to like it, they enjoyed fresh-squeezed orange-pineapple juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" the old wizard said, standing up and stretching his long arms over his head, \"It is time we were off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a time, the two parties traveled together, but we soon came upon a crossroads, and there is where we said our goodbyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stick to the forest paths, Glimmer, Tyrl, where you will be less likely to stumble upon or be set upon by any of the King's Gurads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we shall, good Jarode,\" Glimmer said, taking the wizard in a strong embrace. I did likewise, and then we hugged the others as well. They took the fork to the east, with us going straight north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye! Be safe!\" we faintly heard Bralina call out, after we'd gone down the road a ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer, the twins, and I all turned and waved, then they were out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far is it to our father's castle? Alastin asked. His voice still had that half-boy, half-man quality to it and broke in odd places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have never been all the way to the castle but close to it,\" said Glim. From the 'Secret Forest' it would take two days, but I believe we are closer than that from here. I would guess about one and a half days, if we make good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too think we were that close all these years,\" the young princess said to her brother. I saw a sngle tear slide down her round face. Alastin put an arm around her thin shoulder and swiped the tear away with his thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going home, now, Sis, and that is all we need think about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glim,\" I said, \"Look. Here is a game path, heading due north. I suggest we get off this main road and take to the shelter of the forest as Jarode suggested.\" We did just that then, and we all appreciated the coolness of the overhead canopy of maple and oak leaves. Dappled sunlight filtered through, but not enough to overheat us as we marched steadily north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun lay high in the sky when we stopped by a small meandering brook. We removed out boots and socks and went wading in the cool flowing water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins offered to make a light lunch, and we heard them \"Oohing\" and \"Ahhing\" every time they plucked a new food from the bag. Of course, Alavina insisted on more cherry tarts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, they had spread out a substantial feast, all carefully positioned on Tyrl's red and white checkered table cloth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well!\" Glim said, eyeing the bounty of it all. \"We'll be lucky if any of us can even move, let alone hike, after consuming all of that!\" We all roared with laughter and set to eating every last scrap of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snap!\" Our heads all twisted to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssh!\" the elf said, bringing a finger to his lips. He stood, and silent as a snake, he moved off in the direction of the noise, taking his bow from his shoulder and notching an arrow. He disappeared behind a large maple...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,105 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

She gazed up at me with her big robin's-egg blue eyes. I noticed they were moist with unshed tears. <i>First day free of being a swan, and she probably wishes she were back gliding on the peaceful lake.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy legs grew stiff with squatting so long, and I sat down and stretched them out. <i>Where is Glimmer? Why hasn't he returned yet?</i> Then I heard the slightest rustle of dried leaves. I craned my neck around the side of the large bush, but I saw no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he's not back soon, I told the other two, I must go and see if all is well,\" I said, pitching my voice low as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, good Tyrl,\" do not leaves us!\" Alavina said, rather too loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had she spoke than a large sword parted the bush we hid behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Out!\" a mans rough voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood as did the brother and sister, and we came around the side of our hiding place. I nearly burst out laughing, but sighed instead, for there stood our little friend, none-other-than, Vadermiremire, or Van as he'd said his friends called him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van!\" I said, forgetting we might yet be in danger. \"How did you disguise your voice so? And when did you start carrying a sword?\" I eyed the sharp-edged beauty, thinking he must have honed it a very long time to be so razor sharp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyrl. Sword mine. Yes. Friend,\" the little guy said in his usual unusual way of speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van, what are you doing out here in the forest, so far from your house?\" I remembered the night we'd spent in his cozy, warren-like home with fondness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van bored. Visit, yes. Visit King. My friend.\" he smiled at this, and I gaped at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you know King Valaspar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Van know. Good friend. Yes,\" he gave me a smile and pointed at the twins. \"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van, let me introduce you to two very special people who, your friend the king will be heartily glad to see! I began, first, with their back story of how the evil Nathargan had used the 'Bad' to turn both of them into swans, many years ago. Then went on to tell him of how the good king and all within the castle had wept over their loss, for all feared the pair dead. But as you see, Van, our quest has brought a bonus. Not only did we cleanse the 'Glackamoor Swamp' and all the surrounding area, but we have freed the twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" he bobbed his over-sized head up and down, then went and shook hands with the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van!\" came another shout. Glimmer strode from around the giant maple, a huge grin widening across his handsome face. He went to the little man, picking him up and twirling him about, until he grew dizzy. Van's smiled blossomed bigger, his plump cheeks rosy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where did you come from?\" he asked him, but he just smiled and pointed at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He grew bored, and he just so happens to be friends with their father, the king,\" I said, pointing at the brother and sister. \"Did you find anyone about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the price said. \"Perhaps it was Van, who snapped that twig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you know the king, eh, Van? Well, then we're going in the same direction, and now we be five! Seems like that's what I said when Stavin joined our party,\" the elf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeppers! Five,\" said Van, and we all laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five! Five! Five! his crow screeched. I turned and looked up. I had not noticed it sitting on a branch of the maple tree. <i>Darn! Why'd he have to bring that annoying bird?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had best be off again\", Glim said. \"We've lost a bit of time, and if we're to make the castle by tomorrow, we'd better step lively.\" And with that, our five members marched single file down yet another north-heading game trail. The sunlight filtered though the trees overhead, keeping us all in the shade mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate in the afternoon, we stepped out of the light forest, into a wide grassy meadow. There was but one tree here, centered in the middle of this green area, and we made for the shade of its spreading branches. The crow alighting before we reached it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tree! Tree! Tree!\" came its annoying call. <i>Yeah, it's a tree! We know that, you dumb bird brain! I wonder what crow pie would taste like.</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's up for a feast?\" Glimmer asked, smiling and sounding very much like Bralina. <i> I miss that girl, already!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll heads nodded as they murmured their ascent. Once again a grand feast magically appeared, and we all sat about with full bellies, regretting that we still had far to go before sunset would force us to camp for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward, we hiked another two hours, then found a lovely spot to spend the night. It was a secluded area with forest on three sides, and a small waterfall, spilling into a pond,and just perfect for an evening bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins were rather modest and only strode through the shallows, rolling up their travelling pants to avoid getting them wet. Glimmer and I stripped down to our skinny's and strode out to the deepest part. It came up to just under my neck, and the water was cool and invigorating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Van!,\" I called out to the little fellow. \"Don't you want to cool off?\" I asked him. He shook his head, and then pulled out a two-piece fishing rod from his small leather pack he'd brought along. he snapped the two together and had himself a fine pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fish. Yes? Eat!\" he said. He set about digging up some of the turf near the bank, and he soon had a whole slug of wiggling worms, which he place in a cup. He attached one of the squirming things to a hook on his line, then expertly cast it into the lake. \"Fish!\" he said again. \"Yum!\" We all laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum! Yum! Yum!\" said his sidekick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim and I splashed around for a good half hour, then emerged from the water, shaking ourselves dry. By this time, the little guy was cleaning a pile of sunfish he'd caught, and the twins had the checkered table cloth out and side dishes ready. My mouth watered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,079 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That fish is so good! You must share your secret with the castle cook, so that when the king is reunited with his beloved children, we can have it at the celebration feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fish, good. Yes.\" He told Glimmer and took another helping himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset had come, before we finished the huge meal, and with all the walking we'd done in the last days, all of us were more than ready to roll out our beds for some much needed rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stars were twinkling in mass as I lay staring at the night sky. <i>What a journey it's been, eh, Tyrl. And you thought you'd never have any adventure!<i> That was my last thought before my eyelids closed of their own accord, and I drifted off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI awoke to the aroma of brewing coffee and a soft mellow tune I didn't recognize. I opened one eye to see Glim sitting on a fallen log near the morning fire. He'd plucked up another blade of wide grass from the meadow we'd slept in last night, and on this he played his song. <i>Man, I wish that elf would teach me to do that!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" he said noticing my eyes had both opened. \"It's about time you got up, lazy head. We saved you some breakfast and a spot of coffee. You'd best get to it, before noon's shining on our backs.\" He laughed, and then went on playing his leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arg!\" I groaned and rolled from my bed, making my way to the log and settling in next to the elf. He poured me a cup, and I accepted it with a nod, it being too early for me and manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say we might make the castle by supper time, maybe a bit later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great as I've had about enough of this marching day and night. Where are the twins?\" He pointed to the pond, and I saw Alastin sitting on a rock, his back to the pond. \"And where's is his sister,\" I said putting my hand up to shade the sunrise coming up over the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's around that little curve, and the prince is guarding her, so none will disturb her bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I said.\" I finished my coffee and helped pack the cups and the pot back into the pot and rolled up my bed and blanket. By that time, the twins had come back, Alavina's wet, curly locks shining like gold in the sun. They bounced to and fro as she set about gathering her things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you two are anxious and a little nervous for the grand reunion you'll have, maybe this very day,\" I said to the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlastin looked over at me and Glim, a shy smile growing on his face, \"Yes, I am a bit nervous about meeting my father. I hope he will approve of me.\" He blushed and looked down at the ground, scuffing his boot in a patch of dirt beneath the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You needn't worry about that, Prince Alastin, for any father would be proud to call you son, from what I have seen these past few days.\" Glimmer told him, one prince to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Alavin said, and he also gathered his things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the trek took us down a narrow road, but we met no other travelers after many hours march. Here the hardwoods gave way to giant redwoods, and we soon felt like dwarfs in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt, in the name of the King!\" We all came to a sudden stop, gazing all around at the swords that circled our little group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who be you? And what be your purpose on the 'King's Road'?\" asked a burly man in a shining breast plate and helm. A fancy red plume swayed back and forth in the evening's light breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glimmer took the lead and spoke for us, \"Good Knight of the King's Guard, I assume?\" he asked the swordsman. \"We have come to pay our respect to King Valaspar, and to deliver..., a message, meant only for his ears. I am Prince Glimmervan of the 'Secret Forest', and these,\" he said spreading his arm in an arc toward us, are my travelling companions. A brother and sister, and my friend, Tyrl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrrmph!\" The man seemed unimpressed with these introductions. He spoke with one of his men, who pulled a great stallion from the woods, where they must have tied them, and down the road he galloped as if something chased him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think he's off to in such a hurry?\" I asked Glim under my breath. The burly knight coughed and looked straight at me as if he'd heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will escort you the rest of the way to the castle,\" he told us, and his men gathered their horses reins, climbed in their saddles and formed up, some behind and some in front of us. <i>Do they think us prisoners? Do they think we might try and escape? Some welcome, eh, Tyrl?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese Men must have been out-reach guards, for we were a good ten miles from the castle, and our feet grew weary with the passing hours. It was, as Glim had predicted, well past sunset when at last the castle came into view. And a grand site it was! Spires and turrets and battlements, crisscrossed here and there and walkways from one place to another, even one that spiraled down to a waterfall and lake. Had the sun been shining, I had no doubt it would have been even more stunning, for in the full moon light, I saw it was made entirely of white marble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Alavina!\" cried out even as she slid to the ground in a crumple heap. Prince Alastin  ran to her, and lifted her head into his lap. \"This march has been to much for my sister! Water, someone bring her a drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ill be alright ,\"she told her brother, after taking a few small sips from a canteen someone had offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe let her rest a few moments, then she said, \"I have delayed you all long enough. I can make it the short way left.\" Her brother helped her up, and we made a slower pace to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,099 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </i></i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As our weary band drew near the massive front gate of the castle of King Valaspar, we saw more guards lined up on either side of the road. I felt like a prisoner being escorted down a gauntlet. They peered out at us from the slits of their helms, stern faced all. <i>Some welcome!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir 'Captain of the Guard' rode up to the tall wooden and iron enforced gate, speaking to someone within the gatehouse. A black-bearded, rotund man popped his head out to inspect us, wrote something on a chart, then spoke to the captain again. A few moments passed, where we were made to stand on our aching legs, and then a creaking sounded as the door, finally, opened wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain drew his stallion to the side, where it pranced in irritation of having to wait also, I assumed, and he dipped his head to us to proceed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins eyes were wide with wonder as they crossed into their long lost home. \"I'm shaking like a leaf, Alavin,\" Alavina told her brother. He grasped her hand in his moist one, and gave his sister a smile. \"Soon we will feel as if we had never left,\" the prince said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe entered into a very large courtyard with a massive statue of whom I thought to be King Valaspar, but I would later learn it had been modeled after his great, great grandfather. The statue sat on a wide base, made to look like a giant boulder, and this was placed in a round pool of sparkling clear water. It was fed by a small boy statue, standing beside the late king. The boy held a urn, and, from this the water continuously flowed down into the pool. Like the entire castle it was made of white marble. <i>There must be a marble quarry nearby to have used so much in the construction of this marvelous place.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we all stood admiring the fountain, a long and sustained horn sounded from somewhere within the castle proper. After a moment, six guards, dressed all in white, including white enameled armor exited a small door set in a stone wall to our left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be the king's personal castle guards,\" Glimmer said to us. They filed out and lined up, three to a side and stood at attention, eyes locked straight ahead, but I felt them on us none-the-less. The captain who'd led us in, gave a wave of his hand, letting us know we should enter, and so we did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were led down a long hallway, lined with beautiful tapestries in bright colors. Most of them depicted hunting scenes, and I noted the bold crimson splashes of a giant elk, killed in a hunt. Someone, who looked a great deal like the statue in the pond, stood over the great beast, his bow hanging loosely at his side, a short sword drawn, with which he had obviously put the animal our of its misery with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long walk, we came to an intersection, and the three guards in front of us turned to the right and we followed like sheep. The three others, bringing up our rear, did likewise. We found ourselves in a cavernous reception hall. The room was filled with long wooden tables and benches, scarred from many a feast that may have been rather raucous. That would be typical of gathered knights and men-in-arms who celebrated, tipping their hands until they were well into their cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very front of the room, upon a dais set up above the other tables and benches, were more seats, and in the very center, lounged a man on an elaborately carved throne He was long-bearded in black, with matching hair, though it was sprinkled with lines of gray. All six of our guards went ahead of us, making their way up, splitting in two, and left and right, they reformed to either side of King Valaspar, standing very straight, very still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king raised his large hand and motioned for us to come forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins seemed frightened, for they refused to move, and Glim placed his hand upon Alastin's thin shoulder and gently glided him forward. I took the princesses elbow and did the same for her, though at times, I felt as if I were tugging her along. I looked over at her, and her young face which was normally rosy-cheeked, had grown ashen, her eyes doe like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be okay,\" I encouraged her, still tugging her forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we came within ten feet of the dais, the guard to the king's left raised his hand and said, \"Halt!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king looked down on us, his eyes somber and his lips in a stern line. \"What business have you four travelers to discuss?\" he asked us. His voice had a deep and resonate ring, exactly as one might think a king would sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer, still with his hand on the young prince's shoulder, took a step forward. The prince did not follow, and Glim gently nudged him forward. \"Your Royal Grace,\" he said, giving the king a sweeping, low bow. \"I think you had best prepare your royal self for a shocking surprise.\" Glim smiled his best smile, white teeth flashing, though the kind did not return it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king's busy eyebrows raised, his face grew sterner, if that were possible, and the guard who had told us to halt, withdrew his sword as if we meant the king harm. The king stayed his guard, and he replaced his sword in its sheath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am quite prepared for anything you might have to tell me, elf,\" the king said. He motioned for Glimmer to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Your Grace,\" the elf prince went on. You see, we four have been on a quest, Your Grace, and it is a fine tale to tell, however, how should I present this?\" Glim, never at a loss for words, seemed a bit tongue tied at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling my friend struggling to find the words, I stepped forward as well, dragging the now shaking and very frightened, Alavina with me. \"If you will, Your High..., I mean, if you will, Your Grace, we have brought you a gift. Actually two gifts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that the princess's knees went out from under her, and she spilled to the floor in a dead faint. At once, the young prince, Alastin, bent to her, cupping her head in his lap. He called softly to his sister, \"Alavina,\" tapping her cheek with the fingers of his hand. I noticed a large purple bruise already forming on her forehead. She did not respond to her brother's call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,122 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing the golden haired young girl lying upon the floor of his reception hall. King Valaspar's face softened, concern raised his bushy black eyebrows. He spoke to one of his personal guards, and the man ran off, out the way we had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she okay?\" the king asked, standing and leaning out toward the pitiful scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe she'll be alright, Your Grace,\" Glimmer said. \"Though she has a nasty bruise, I'm afraid, Your Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting a hand the king spoke. \"I am sorry she has been injured, and I have sent one of my men for a healer. It is best not to move her, so he will come to her.\" He sat back down on his throne. He stroked his long dark beard with the fingers of his right hand, then said,\"While we wait, I think it best you tell me exactly what your business here is this day, for my patience grows thin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once, Your Grace,\" Glimmer said. \"These two,\" and at this he pointed to the twins, \"ah..., these two young ones are Alastin and Alavina,\" he finally said. The elf prince gazed up at the king, waiting for recognition to hit the king. I hoped he too wouldn't faint dead away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't just hit the king. It blasted him back into his chair. His face flushed with heat, and his whole body seemed to quiver. He tried to speak, even as he rose. He stood glued to the spot he stood up in, and I saw his legs begin to tremble. One of his guards reached out and grabbed his shoulder, steadying him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, the king gathered himself, and he gave a nod to the guard, letting him know he was okay to proceed. He came around one side of the long table, descending the short staircase. With slow, exaggerated steps, he came to stand by us. I saw a single tear slip from his eye and roll slowly down his cheek, and tears formed in my eyes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out and touched the young princess's soft, pale cheek. \"Ala..,\" he said so faintly I could barely make out the syllables. He pulled his hand from her cheek and placed both upon his weathered face. He wept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment or two, the king looked up, and his watery eyes found those of the prince, his son. His voice full of gravel, he stood and said, \"And..., and, you must be Alastin.\" He choked up again, and said, \"My son! My long lost son!\" And with that he ran to the boy, gathered him in his long arms and hugged him like he would never let the lad go again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father!\" was all the lad kept saying, over and over as they cried in each others arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout this time, Alavina's eyes fluttered opened. Just as they did, the guard who had left came running in, another short balding man in tow. He wore a plain brown robe, belted with twine. and a large golden cross hung from a chain around his pudgy neck. He bent down and spoke softly to the girl, \"At least I see you have rejoined us,\" he gave her a small smile of encouragement. His voice was low and fatherly, and kindness seemed to be all about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am..., where am I?\" she asked him, her eyes had a far away look to them, and perhaps she thought herself yet again a swan, swimming with her brother on the beautiful, teal, 'Hidden Lake' in the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlastin broke away from his father, coming again to his sister's side. \"Alavina,\" he said, staring down into her confused eyes. \"There's someone you should meet. Remember?\" Recognition of where she was and of what they had com to do, filled the young girl's eyes. She struggled to sit up, and the healer assisted her, keeping a steadying arm about her slender back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king moved to her, bent down, and cupped her round cherub-like face in his palms. \"Oh!  I have often prayed for, dreamed of this day, never imagining it would come, would be granted to this old man. But, here you are, my lovely little daughter! My heart is full, full and overflowing with joy!\" They both wept for a time, and then he scooped her up in his strong arms, and carried her from the room, never looking back at us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king's personal guards escorted Glim and I and Van, of course, who had remained quiet as a church mouse during all of this, to quarters where we could freshen ourselves. He said they would call for us soon, but he took Prince Alastin along with him, and we were left to ourselves in a grand room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive bed had been placed in the center of one wall of the room, which gave a view to a large terrace and the surrounding countryside. Ornate carved doors led out to this, and a servant had come and opened them wide to allow a fragrant breeze to fill our room. Thick red velvet drapes hung at the four corners of the stately bed, and the dark wood of it had been polished so that it shone in the rays of moonlight streaming in from the west-facing terrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant brought us spiced, chilled wine, and a light snack of fruit and cheeses. We ate sparingly, knowing the palace staff was surely preparing a welcome home feast for the long lost children. Our servant smiled and smiled as though his face were frozen in happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us, having had so much excitement, and after having marched such a long ways, retreated to the bed. It was more than able to hold the three of us lying abreast, and we were soon all sleeping soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe awoke to the same servant calling to us softly, \"Good Sirs, if you will. It is time to attend the feast. I have laid out a selection of fitting apparel in varying sizes. I do hope you will find something you like.\" With that, he bowed from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe each splashed our faces from a pitcher of water poured into a basin in the corner of our room. It helped to chase our sluggishness away. Then we looked through the huge assortment of clothes, each choosing his own. At last we were presentable, or so we hoped. <i>I have no idea what one would wear to this kind of reunion feast.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1086 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

Yes? Feast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young lord in fashionable velvet clothes with ruffled soft linen rows upon his chest and cuffs, raised his eyebrows at our little friend's queer speech, but made no note of it, having courtly manners, no doubt. He'd given us a slight bow when Van had opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening,\" he said, politely smiling. He was a young man, though he'd gone prematurely gray at the temples. \"I trust you have had ample time to refresh yourselves, and, too, that you are quite famished from your long journey?\" He stepped back from the door, gave a half bow, and a with a flourish of his arm, he ushered us all out into the wide hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we all had adorned our feet with indoor footwear, soft slippers in three glaring shades of red (mine, embarrassingly, had little bells that tinkled at my slightest movement), which is what our servant had called proper dress for a feast, our footfalls fell silent upon the stone floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were led down a series of steps that seemed to spiral around as we went down, so that we knew not where we had begun nor ended up, but we soon came upon a wide, grand staircase, which led down to a massive foyer. From there it was but a short jaunt through an arch to a beautifully carved set of very tall oak doors. Leaves, vines, and bunches of grapes had been expertly carved in high relief on each of them, and we stood admiring whomever's handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way, if you please, good sirs,\" the young lord told us, and he opened both doors, flinging them wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowzers!\" I said, staring at the lavish production within a grand ballroom. <i>How had they had time to prepare all this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over at my two companions, and their faces were as stunned as I was sure my own looked. Glim gave a low whistle, then put on one of his twinkling smiles, that made his elf's eyes dance. \"After you,\" he said with a flourish of his arm, and Van and I entered the room with Glim bringing up the rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once the merrymaking grew quiet as a funeral. I blushed as all eyes fell upon us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA herald sounded his horn, and all the guests rose at once, giving us a bow or a little curtsy. I blushed deeper, not being used to being bowed to, I mean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men all wore similar clothing to that of the lord who had fetched us from our chambers. But the ladies of the court! Oh! There were so many to look upon!, And a good many were more than comely to boot. Their gowns were low cut, showing swells of amble and small bosoms, and their lovely dresses fanned out or dropped, clinging to their slim, pleasingly plump, or just right bodies as if they'd all been splashed by a rainbow, in every color and combination of colors. Jewels sparkled from throats and hands in a dazzling display! Of course all the knights and King's Guards wore their finest battle gear, minus their helms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Announcing: Prince Glimmervan of the 'Secret Forest', son and 'Heir Apparent' to King Fabellious!\" the man called out. Glim gave a deep bow to the king, and twins, Alastin and Alavina, seated to his left an right, high up on the raised dais at the back of the large room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Announcing: Tyrl, friend and travelling companion to Prince Glimmervan,\" he called out for me. I guess it was fitting, since I had no titles of my own. <i>Might as well have said, Tyrl of nowhere and of nothing!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnouncing: Vandermiremire, 'King of the Gnomes', 'Keeper of the King's Forest', and long time friend of the King.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Glim's and my mouth fell open. \"Did he just say King?\" Glim shrugged his thin shoulders, giving me an arched eyebrow. <i>Sheesh! That makes me the only one with no royal blood!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king waved us toward his table, and we made the long walk. When we stood just before the dais, he called out in his big booming voice,\"Good Knights, my loyal Lords and Lady's of the Royal Court, I give you the heroes who have returned my precious, long lost children, heroes and friends to all assembled here!\" <i>Gosh! That sounded like a royal command!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll stood and a thundering round of applause ensued. I blushed crimson when ladies began showering us with all manner of sweet-scented blossoms. When they were done, we stood knee deep in petals, and I blushed crimson this time. Glim, prince that he was, only smiled wide, eyes twinkling again as he turned in a slow circle and dipped his head now and then to the adoring crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I have told you all often enough, we were used to having lavish feasts, what with the magic pack Jarode had given me, that wasn't hard to do, but the fabulous feast the king had ordered on our behalf, and of his children's, too, was something to behold. It went on for half the night. We sampled food I had never seen nor tried in my life. Deep fried frog's legs that melted in my mouth, and, oddly, tasted like a young chicken, prepared perfectly. There were  so many side dishes, the servants were kept running, and I was sure they were being exchanged for new ones every so often, for a fresh round of faces served us often. Wine flowed like a raging river, and soon the hall grew loud and laughter bounced from the walls and rafters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim turned out to be a splendid dancer, and all the ladies wanted at least one turn round the floor with the good looking Prince. I, on the other hand, possessed two left feet, so I contented myself with watching him, and the unexpectedly spry and graceful Van, spin round and round. It made me dizzy to watch them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,027 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

Van got a running start in one and slid nearly twenty feet, all very graceful as though he were riding a wave on the open seas, but as he came to a stop, he teetered left, then right, then spun about and landed in a heap. We gave it a try as well, Glim doing even better than the little fellow, but I lost my balance half way through and careened off one of the none-to-soft stone walls. They had a good laugh at my expense as I rubbed a lump now forming on my cheek. We tried to get our escort to give it a go, but he politely declined, though I did see him smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside our lavish room, we stripped down to our small clothes, the many cups of wine I'd had began to make the room spin. Both Van and Glim looked as if they thought so too. It was all we could do to find the bed and crawl in. Soft snores were soon emanating from all three of our open mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome morning, I would have traded the drum beating in my skull for last night's spinning room. Our servant fetched us up some mint tea with a touch of willow bark brewed in for the pain and queasiness. \"May I get you anything else, good King, Prince and Tyrl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast. Yes? Eat?\" Van said, and I ran for the extra pot next to the chamber pot in the corner. I had an extra cup of mint tea, before I felt ready to leave the room. We certainly were not sliding or riding waves this morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe entered a small receiving room, where the king could entertain smaller groups. It was cozy, laid with a small fire and conformable chairs scattered about. A small buffet had been laid out on oneside of the dark paneled room. Van hopped t it immediately, while Glim and I contented ourselves to sip on only strong black coffee. Both of the twins sat close to their father, probably afraid to let him out of their site. I was sure the king felt the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've come to say our farewells,\" Glimmer told them, his face pulled down in a sad frown. \"You have been most gracious to receive us in such a splendid fashion, King Valaspar, and I shall tell my father of your wonderful hospitality and of your amazing marble castle, too.\" the prince said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The king smiled broadly, standing and shaking each of our hands in turn. Both Alavina and Alastin had tears in their eyes as they gave us big bear hugs and many thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will see you again,\" I said. \"And, hopefully, soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, soon!\" Van chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whoosh of air flew in a window as the crow landed on the arm of Glim's chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon! Soon! Soon!\" it cried out. The king and the others laughed, and even I had to join in. <i>At least that annoying bird wasn't at last night's feast. That was something. I wonder where it had gone off to?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you depart, young friends,\" the king said. I have gifts for each of you.\" Glim started to protest, but the king held up one of his large hands, saying, \"No. I insist upon it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gifts! Gifts! Gifts!\" the crow screamed. No one laughed this time. <i>Annoying bird!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alastin, would you bring the leather bag just there in the corner?\" the king asked his son, pointing off to his right. The young prince jumped up and retrieved the rather large bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see\", the king said, rummaging about in it. \"Ah! Yes,\"he said as he pulled out a magnificent emerald ring. The stone was set about with diamonds in an oval shape, the emerald huge and gleaming in the morning sunlight filtering in one of the room's many floor-to-ceiling windows. \"For you, Tyrl,\" he said, extending his arm out to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M..., m..., me?\" I squeaked. \"But I could not accept such a lavish gift, Your Grace.\" I said to the old king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can. And you will,\" he said with finality ringing in his deep voice. Then he smiled at me. \"It's not just any ring, my boy, it has been imbued with magic. Though exactly what sort of magic it will produce for you is hard to say. The wizard who gave it to me many years ago, said it deepened on the heart of the person wearing it. But he was a wizard who worked only for the 'Good' of the land and people, so that I've no doubt it will aid you in a time of need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" I said, giving him a bow from my chair and taking the ring from him. I slid it on the ring finger of my left hand, and I was amazed that it seemed to fit perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now! For you, my little king. What have I got in here for someone like you?\" After much digging through the bag, King Valaspar pulled out a carved wooden box, about a foot in length and maybe ten inches wide. It was beautifully wrought with engravings of forest trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, then, Van, open it,\" he told him, rubbing his hands in delight to see what his reaction would be. Van pulled the box in close and opened the brass hinged lid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!,\" the little fellow squealed. \"Pretty! Yes. Very pretty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty! Pretty! Pretty!\" screamed the awful bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Van, they are. They were given to my late queen by her grandfather, a master carver of some renown. These, chisels are touched with magic as well. For there came a time when the old man could no longer carve, his hands having grown weak with arthritis. He had carved a most beautiful chair for a passing good wizard as one of his last projects, and this wizard so loved his handiwork, he imbued these chisels with strength, that my wife's grandfather might yet carve with ease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love! Van, love\" he said, clutching the box to his little round chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even!\" I screamed at the bird as I saw its beak begin to work. It glared at me form the window ledge where it had flown, then flew out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, lastly, for you, good Prince of the 'Secret Forest', a place I must visit, yes. For you I have a very...,\" he struggled to pull an ungainly shaped form the confines of his bag, but, at last, it popped out with a flourish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer whistled as his eyes took in the large ash bow, complete with a quiver of white and rare black swan feathered arrows. \"Yes, I am sure you have guessed, for this bow is known of far and wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The 'Bow of Truth'!\" the stunned prince forgot his manners, his mouth hanging open. He quickly remembered and snapped his jaw shut. \"But, how? How did you ever come across this famed bow? It is said than any arrow shot from it shall never miss! But one can only take aim at a man or woman whose heart does not ring true, ring with 'Good'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The very one!\" the king said. I am not able to tell you, at this time, how I acquired it, but there may come a time when I may.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was much sharing and passing around of our magical gifts, but soon it was time to say our goodbyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,268 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

We had been a band of five, though now we were but a sad party of three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had dawned cool and crisp with a hint of smoke tinging the air. \"I hope that is just campfires burning,\" Glimmer said, sticking his nose up high and taking several long whiffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it is a wildfire, it must be someways off, huh?\" I asked, gazing over at the elf and Van. <i>Van!

We still called him Van, for he had told us, \"King. Yes. Van King. Call Van.\" An so we did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon. Yes. Soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a time we came to a crossroads, and this would be where we departed east, and our little friend to the south. The sun sat high overhead, glaring down on us as we'd left the tall cedars behind and now strode through a lovely flowered meadow of bright green grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Glimmer said, pointing ahead at the tall elm. Remember? That is where we slept that last night before reaching the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and a perfect place for a feast!\" I said. Van rubbed his round, little belly and smiled. Glim laughed and with a sudden burst of energy, he raced off to the tree. We caught up eventually, for the elf was lightening fast. We all plopped down in the umbrella of shade created by the tree's wide, spreading branches and lay there panting. Well, not Glim, of course, he could run forever and never tire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur feast laid out, we all munched and sipped in no hurry to be anywhere for once. \"It is nice not to be rushed or have to think about cleansing swamps, or returning lost princess and princes unharmed,\" I said, rolling over to my stomach. I pushed myself up, then stood,<br>\r\nand went to lean against the rough bark of the elm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will agree with that,\" Glimmer said. \"Though we should keep a wary eye out for any of the other King's Guards,\" he said, scanning the meadow with his shimmering green eyes. I did so too. <i>I hope we don't run into those nasty fellows anytime soon.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to make our hearts jump, the annoying crow screamed out,\"Guards! Guards! Guards! Still, both Glim and I checked a second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a fine rest, where we actually all slept soundly, we awoke and packed up everything. We drug our feet, talking of this and that, but soon we had to say goodbye to our little friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall miss you, Vandermiremire,\" the elf told hi, reaching out and engulfing the little guy in his long arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An I,\" I told Van. Big tears formed in his large blue eyes, and I fought back my own as did the elf. Sniffing, we both hugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van go. Van sad. You come soon?\" he said, and fresh tears sprang into my already red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim and I shook our heads, said one last goodbye, and then we were off, heading east across the meadow. I looked back once, and Van still stood there watching us depart. The crow sat upon his shoulder, fluffing its black feathers out. Just before we rounded a bend in the meadow, I heard it scream, \"Friends! Friends! Friends!\" Then I felt ashamed for always calling it names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours of marching at a leisurely pace, we spotted the slow flowing brook we'd camped by one other time. Here we dropped our packs and removed our socks and boots, to stroll for a time in the cool clear water. Frogs spoke to us from the shallows, and one big fat fellow who, lounged on a rock in mid-stream, sat sunning his fat green body. We sat on the bank, our feet danging in, and watched him for a time. Every so often his long tongue would snap out and snag a brightly colored dragonfly, slurping it back in and gulping it down whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if he were really a prince turned into a frog by some evil wizard,\" I said. Glimmer raised his eyebrows as if I were mad. \"What? We did just see a prince and princess changed from swans back to a boy and girl. It isn't so far fetched to think. Is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose not, Tyrl,\" the elf said smiling. We headed back out after donning our socks and boots. A short stint across the rest of the meadow and we had entered back into the hardwood forest we'd been in before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's is nice and cool here,\" I said. The forest had many game trails and the footing was very good. Squirrels and chipmunks chattered at our passing, our feet kicked up dry puffs of dust and leaves as we made our way. Somewhere far off, we heard the hammering of a giant woodpecker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're shy birds,\" Glimmer said, speaking of the woodpecker. \"You can spot them though if you sit quietly for a time. Up ahead is where we turn slightly north for my home,\" he said, and I watched a small smile bloom on his handsome face. He picked up the pace, too, as though the 'Secret Forest' were calling his name. <i>I wouldn't doubt it if it was, either, eh' Tyrl</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game trail we now follow had been tread upon by many feet, for many years. It was hard packed, and wider than the others we had followed. Here, too, the trees thinned, and patches of bright blue sky peeked though with white puffy clouds floated high above. I saw a falcon shoot across one, obscuring a small cloud for just a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clavar!\" the elf screamed, jolting me from my daydream and causing me to stumble forward, tripping on a the root of a massive oak tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you yelling about,\" I said as I eyed the elf with furrowed brows. I dusted the knees of my pants off and licked at a small cut on the palm of one of my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My falcon, Clavar,\" he said, pointing to the giant bird, who now sat on a branch of the tree who's roots I'd just tripped over. It gave a solitary screech and flew to Glim's slim shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,163 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

And it makes the crow look like a baby bird still in its nest.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where ya been, girl,\" the elf said, stroking its sleek brownish-red feathers. \"Tyrl, could you rummage in the pack for some raw meat?\" he asked, never taking his adoring eyes from the creature, just cooing at the dang bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" I said, setting my pack down. <i> Dang bird probably looks at me and sees raw meat!</i> I gulped, looking over at it as I searched for some meat. Finally I pulled a chunk out, though why our magic pack didn't smell like coppery blood I couldn't say. Blood dripped from the large hunk and splattered into the dry dust, sending up little puffs and leaving small round pools of crimson stains. I tossed it to the elf, who took out his knife and actually cut strips off of it for his bird. <i>Does he think its a baby bird? Does he think it couldn't tear that hunk to shreds or us?</i> I fought back my lifetime fear of birds and said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clavar is trained to hunt.\" He smiled one of his twinkling smiles my way, then returned to ogling the bird. \"My father gave it to me for my sixteenth birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter too long of a time for me, he released the bird back into the air. Its giant wings flapped up a breeze, blowing back my hair. I stepped back as it rose higher and higher, until it was not but a speck against the light blue sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" The elf said. \"We're on the home stretch now. We picked up our packs, slinging them over our shoulders and began a quick march down the game trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were came off of the trail into a huge apple orchard. There had to be a thousand trees here, all bright with cherry-red apples making the branches droop to the ground. Bees in mass swarmed about, and I slapped one off of my neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many trees,\" I said to the elf prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We make the best jams and jellies, and, of course, not-to-mention the very best apple wines,' he said, one eyebrow shooting up as he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had just about crossed the orchard when, \"Thwack!\" Something hit me in the back. I saw another incoming missile and spun. Too late! I now saw they were apples, overripe apples, and someone hidden was splattering us with them. The first one's sweet smelling juices had drenched my shirt, the second my hair, which was now sticky to touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over at Glimmer who, of all things, was laughing his head off, pointing at my shirt. \"It's an apple war!\" he said, grabbing me and ducking under a big fruit laden branch. \"Quick! Gather as many as you can in your shirt, Tyrl. I know of a hill right back there,\" he said, pointing behind us. We stuffed as many squishy ones as we could fit into the folds of our shirts, and then we were running, Glim laughing all the way, his cheeks rosy, white teeth gleaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to keep up to the quick elf, but he was already on the top of the hill when I panted up to join him. He'd set his apples in a pile at his feet, so I did likewise. \"There!\" he said, pointing at a rather small apple tree ten yards away. With that, he took aim, cocked his long, slender arm back, and let loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard an \"Ouch!\" And then I recognized the mischievous voice that complained, \"Not so hard Glim! That one hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bralina!\" I called to her. \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think smacked you up side your head with a rotten apple, you oaf?\" She gave a great belly laugh at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You won't like the pay back, young lady,\" I called out. Then Glim and I grabbed one soft apple in each hand and ran toward her tree, counting as we went: one..., two..., threeee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA barrage of sounds filled the orchard with: \"Twack! Thwack! Thawck! Thawck,\" and the apples went pummeling into the tree, followed by many screams of pain, though I doubted they hurt as much as she carried on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give! I give!\" Bralina called out, jumping out of the branches. Both Glim and I fell on the ground laughing, for she was covered in an overripe apple pulp and sticky juice. A bee landed on her nose, and she swiped it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Laugh now, you two oafs,\" she said, stamping her small foot and crossing her sticky arms though I saw a small smile play at the corners of her rosebud mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim, who was the cleanest of us, was the first to be stung, probably from standing to close to fragrant Barlina. We all dashed from the orchard, running as fast as our legs could go. Thankfully, the bees did not give chase so content were they with their bounty there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'Secret Fores't came into view in all of its grandeur as we sped onto the road leading up to it. Several archers dropped from the surrounding hardwood trees, calling out to Glim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince, Glimmervan,\" one said to him, giving the elf a low bow. \"We have been anxiously awaiting your return. I have orders from the king to present you, and your friend, of course, if you will? He swept his arm to the side, ushering us out front. I saw many more smiling elves drop from the tress to follow in our procession. \"Glimmer, we missed you,\" said a pretty faced elf, short of stature but well endowed, with a pair of ruby lips made for kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I have you,\" he said, looking back over his shoulder. I saw him blow her a kiss and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just who is that?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face turned a bright red, and he said,\"Oh, that is just Caravellia, Cara for short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon we were at the base of the rope we'd climbed the first time I had seen this marvelous place, but being so tired, both Glim and I used the basket, and someone pulled us up from up top. Ever the showoff, Bralina scaled the rope with ease and beat us. She stood looking over the veranda's rail and stuck her tongue out at us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count:  1,062 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

Nope. She acted the perfect wizard's daughter, polite, courteous always when she needed to be. I shook my head at her as the prince and I exited onto the veranda, and she gave me a smug little smile, her eyes dancing with mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My son! At last you have returned to me!\" the king said, rising from his throne-like chair his servants had carried out for him to enjoy a bit of sun. He had laid his heavy royal red and white robe over the arm of his chair. The day had grown warm over the last few hours, and sweat lay like morning dew across his wide handsome face. <i>That big bushy beard's got to itch like a son of a gun! I'd shave it off, if I were him, at least in the warm months.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father,\" the prince said, giving his father a deep bow, then stepping over to embrace him. \"It certainly is good to be home, though our adventures were grand, to-say-the-least. Glimmer smiled, a twinkle reaching his sparkling elf eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You were gone so long, my boy, your old father imagined all manner of things that could have befallen you.\" the king cleared his throat and swiped at a tear that threatened to spill from one of his bright blue eyes. \"An old man's fate, I gather.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now you are home, and you as well, young Tyrl. And my heart is glad, indeed! Come. Sit and have some iced-cold lemonade, made with fresh squeezed lemons, no less. You must tell me and Jarode everything, leave nothing out, for it has been rather dull in the 'Secret Forest', I must say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Prince Glimmer and Tyrl, I see Bralina has brought you two boys in.\" She giggled at this, and when neither the king or Jarode were looking, I spat my own tongue out at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A goo place to start, said the king, would be at the very beginning, and at this we all shared a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Glim said, and slowly our story unfolded. He was telling them how we'd come across Vandermiremire's home in the hill, and how the little man had offered us shelter from the pouring rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" said Jarode,\" at this part of Glim's tale. \"It seems to me that I recall a gnome by that name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why he was a gnome, Jarode!\" I said, \"and not just any gnome, either! Sorry, Glim. Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he had the most marvelous workshop, and everything was beautifully wrought, and all so neatly placed that your eyes could not take it all in in one viewing. Oh, and he insisted that we cal him Van, and that we did. We soon became splendid friends. We already miss him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I sure do as well,\" I said, giving a long sigh. \"The little fellow really grows on you. But, I said, \"That is more than I can say for his annoying bird!\" Glim laughed, but Jarode's head spun my way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped his gnarled fingers, and stood. \"Yes! And not the first one he's trained to speak, no doubt. It's been nigh on twenty years since I came across Van, and he had another crow back then. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, I do remember it all now. It took my old brain a moment though. Now let me see,\" the old man said rubbing his snow white beard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Yes! He was more than just a gnome, you are right, young, Tyrl! King of the Gnomes! And..., and he knew the king in the north. King Valaspar. I was there when the little fellow arrived shortly after me. The king was quite pleased to see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember one thing clearly, the little gnome worked his magic on the king's trees as some had contracted a disease and many were dying, their bark falling off and insects invading. Well that gnome, that kingly gnome, got to brewing a foul smelling pot of something. It carried on the wind something awful, and was like to make you wretch if you breathed it in too much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he applied this to the bark of the trees, and I recall seeing those insects dropping straight off. Then he'd applied more of the gooey stuff and wrapped the tress in fine linen. They looked very odd, indeed, like a mummified forest. And it worked! Three days later when he unwrapped them, you could see new bark forming over the old naked scars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Valaspar was so relieved, he bestowed a grand title on Van, 'Keeper of the King's Forest,\" if I recall right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are absolutely right, good Jarode,\" Glimmer said, giving him a nod and smile. \"Van is really something. And we must tell you of how we came across the little fellow, near same as you. But that would be getting ahead of our grand adventure, the prince said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that could hold off until we had a bit of feasting, don't you all?\" Bralina had been so quite (I told you she minded her manners when need be), we'd all forgotten she was sitting off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, that's a grand idea!\" cried the king. he stood up, waving his servant over, then proceeded to describe in great detail just what we'd need for our feast. This went on for some time, and my stomach began to rumble form all the delicious items he mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor servants had to go up and own flights of stairs many times, setting it all up outside. No sooner had they, than dark clouds rolled in. Tiny drops began to fall, and everyone looked up. Soon, they became fat drops, that splashed in the mashed potatoes and gravy boat, then a down poor sudden and fierce. The rolls were a soggy mess. The servants scrambled to get it all back in side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim, Bralina and I roared with laughter. After all we'd been through, what was a little, or a lot of rain? We hugged in a circle and danced barefoot on the veranda, having shucked our socks and boots. The king and Jarode stood in the doorway, looking out at us younglings as if we were quite mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,083 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wonder if he knew me and just didn't say anything? I should hope not, what with me paying no respect to his position within the gnomes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure Van will forgive you, Jarode,\" I told the old man. \"We did have other things to keep our minds occupied, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Quite so, Tyrl. I still marvel at those two young ones spending all these long years as swans. Well, they're free now, and they seem none-the-worse for it.,\" Jarode said, helping himself to another portion of the delicious scrambled eggs and cheese the servants had set upon our heavily laden feast table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, how fares the King of the North?\" King Fabellious asked. He pushed back from the table, standing and reaching into his pocket, he pulled forth a handsome pipe. This he lit, then strode up and down the veranda to stretch his long muscular legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is well, Father, and I do need to mention what grand hospitality he showed us while we stayed there. He is a good and fair king,\" Glimmer said and also stood, having eaten all he could hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall have to consider a trip to see him then,\" Fabellious said. \"It would do my old bones good to have a bit of my own adventure. What say you, Jarode? Would you make the trip with me? We might have need of his aid, and soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I would, my royal friend. That I would. I have always favored the north. The air has a certain sweetness to it, and the giant redwoods make the trip worth it. What a fabulous site to behold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What news of the 'Bad' declining, I asked, looking at the king and the old man. Have you had any further attack from the other King's guard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Shortly after you three left, we had a sizable force march upon the 'Secret Forest', however, they were, nor ever will be, a match for our archers. We dispatched them rather handily, and sent them scurrying away, but only after half their numbers lay dead or dying upon the meadow. We lost not a single elf, I am proud to say.\" The king smiled a broad, toothy smile, pride written across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have several prisoners being held in our lower dungeons at this time. They have been questioned thoroughly. We have obtained some very useful information about their plans to take over the entire 'First Kingdom', which includes all the lands men have inhabited for a thousand years or more. Grandiose is their scheme, but not one that cannot be undone!\" Here the king's face pulled down in a fierce scowl, such as would frighten even a battle hardened soldier. <i>I bet he was something leading his troops into combat when he was my age!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jarode said, standing and joining the king at the rail of the veranda. He too lit a beautifully carved pipe, and, in fact, I noticed it was the exact twin of the king's. <i>Fabellious must have gifted it to him for some past deed he'd done for the elves.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarode went on, \"There is a land, uninhabited by men, north of the north by far. Few men have ever traveled there, for it is a cold and forbidding place. Through questioning these other king's men, we have come to know of a plan for them to go there, to search for a powerful artifact they hope to use against the \"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the king interrupted Jarode. \"And that is why we must ask you, my good son, and you too, Tyrl, to go on a second quest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis statement hung in the air, and our eyes grew wide and thoughtful. After a long moment Bralina burst out with anger, \"Wait a minute! I got sent home early last time, and I want to be included in this quest!\" She stamped her little foot down hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed as Jarode's and the king's eyebrows shot skyward. <i>Ha! Now they see your true side, little girl! Forgot about that, didn't you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be a dangerous trek,\" Jarode said, eyeing his outspoken daughter. There are <i>things</i>..., things no man should ever have to look upon. Make no mistake,\" and here the old man stared into Bralina's eyes as he went on, \"evil lives and breathes in this land! Foul beasts that live in snow caves or beneath the snow in great tunnels. Ancient things, created by ancient sorcerers, powerful men who worked only for the \"Bad'.\" He shook his head, and his eyes took on a far away look as if remembering some great tragedy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to go,\" Bralina said, crossing her arms across her chest. I'm second best shot with a bow among all the fine elven archers even. I have been trained with a sword, and with the whip, she said as if this would change her father's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If I say no,  I know you'd most likely run off and join them anyway. Isn't that so, my brave, little Bralina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Father,\" she said, giving him a half smile that reached her pretty blue eyes. It was meant to win him over, and having practiced it her whole life, she knew it would succeed this time as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Jarode sighed. You are a persistent little creature, but one I love, and one I can never seem to deny anything to. Very well...,\" but before he got the rest of his consent out, his daughter flung herself into his long, thin arms, kissing both his cheeks, and the old man beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come,\" King Fabellious said, sweeping his arm toward the door of his rooms. Let us retreat to my war room as there I have fabulous maps of this land Jarode spoke of, and I have a few more gifts that will aide you in your quest.\" His eyes sparkled just like Glimmers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur bellies overstuffed, we followed the king down a long corridor that took many twists and turns before arriving at his war room. And, when I saw it for the first time, I was astounded! Not by the size of it, but by the marvelous table that was centered there. It was carved with a map of the entire First Kingdom. So large was this table, it filled most of the room, leaving only enough room for the chairs to be pushed out slightly when one wanted to rise. I counted, and it could seat forty at any given time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,119 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

It had been coated with many layers of clear varnish so that it shone in the light of the sconces along the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" King Fabellious said, placing one of his large fingers on a spot high on the center of the map. \" This is simply called 'North of the North', for lack of a better name or because that is exactly where it is.\" We all chuckled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks to be a good deal north of King Vlaspar's Castle,\" the elf prince said, leaning in to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jarode said, \"and it will be an arduous journey to-say-the-least! See here? These are the foot hills of the 'Great Snowy Watcher' as the mountain is named. Who named it has been lost to our knowledge, but it is a fitting name, for it is said that a powerful wizard passed not through death's eternal gates, but remained, half-spirit, half-man, and it is he who guards the only pass through to where he protects the ancient artifact the 'Bad' now seeks. That is where you must go, where you must seek entrance form 'Chalin the Chaste', as he was/is known for he took a vow of chastity, which I have read, he kept!\"  Jarodes blue eyes twinkled, looking over at me and Glim. And both of our faces sported a growing blush or red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Glim and I eyed each other, most likely both of us thinking but not saying, \"The poor man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps good King Valaspar will give us hospitality once again, that we might rest there for a day or two, before proceeding on further north.\" I said. \"He may even offer a few of those burly guards of his that ushered us into the castle. I think even the snow monsters might cringe at the site of their fierce faces!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone shared a laugh at this. Although, we all knew we might not be laughing in the near future, if we did chance across some of these beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do we leave?\" Bralina chimed in, ever the one in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon enough,\" her father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent the night lounging on the veranda, making small talk of anything but monsters. The king and Jarode retired early, claiming their old bones needed a bit more rest than our young ones. But, the three of us soon grew tired, too, so it wasn't long before we each began to yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come,\" Glim said, \"as tomorrow will be quite the trek and back the long way we've just come from, huh, Tyrl?\" He tousled my hair as he liked to do then we all went to our separate rooms, and I for one, passed out on the soft downy bed immediately, snores soon filling my chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyrl!\" someone called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arg! Go away, Glim,\" I said as I threw my pillow at him, but the spry elf deftly jumped to the side, so quick were his reflexes. He picked it up from the stone floor, and began beating me with it, until I rolled over and shook my fist at him, in mock anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on lazy bones!\" Bralina called from my door. I sat up and noticed both of them looked spry, fully dressed and each toting their packs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't either of you two ever sleep in?\" I asked, my voice like a little girl complaining. They helped me pack, while I took care of my needs, dressing in hiking gear once again. We made our way back down to the king's veranda where Jarode and King Fabellious snacked on a light breakfast, which we three joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" said the king, \"I have not forgotten about your gifts! He rubbed crumbs from his long bushy beard and stood. He walked over to a medium-sized trunk his servants had no doubt toted out for him, and opened it. Its hinges creaked in protest as if it had not been opened in many years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe waited in anticipation as he rummaged in the trunk for several moments, then he finally extracted a large leather bag, which he hefted out. He undid a raw hide strap, and opened the bag wide. One-by-one he took out three exquisite fur lined leather coats, with large hoods that could be cinched tight to keep the wind from our necks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid them out according to size, then handed Glimmer the largest, which he took and opened to reveal the white winter fox fur it had been lined with, the outside being made of beaver skin, which would repel the wetness of the strongest rains or melting snows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is amazing!\" Glim told his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king handed me the next biggest and the smallest went to Bralina. We both admired and stroked the soft fur, our eyes full of appreciation for the fine gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" said the king, his eyes twinkling, \"These are no ordinary jackets. Oh! I should say they are not!\" He rubbed his large hands together, and his eyes said they had a marvelous secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he said nothing more, Bralina burst out, \"Well! Aren't you going to share this marvelous secret with us?\" Everyone roared with laughter at her impatience. And Bralina blushed crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king tortured her with another moment of silence then said, \"These fine coats will imbue the wearers with the magic of invisibility!\" He waited impatiently for our response, arching his great eyebrows up and down, smiling broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowzers!\" I said, smiling myself. \"When some great snow worm seeks to eat me whole, I think I may grow to love mine!\" Another round of laughter ensued as we all slipped our jackets on to see how they felt and fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We definitely won't need these warm coats until after we leave the marble castle,\" Glim said as beads of sweat were already forming on all three of our faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!\" each of told King Fabellius, and we each gave him and Jarode farewell hugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be safe, and may your quest be as successful as the last,\" both the King and Jarode said in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will, Father,\" the young elf prince said, giving him one more last hug. Then we were off, taking the rope and going down to the ground far below. We set off across the meadow, elves dropping from trees to wish us well, smiles all around. <i>Well, Tyrl, your life sure has been an adventure for the last few weeks, and now you're in for more!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe turned and gazed up at the old pair on the veranda, waving and then going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,115 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

The three of us marched side by side, across the bright green grass as it swayed before us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two as nervous as me about climbing up, dang..., ah, what was it cal..., oh, yes, the  'Great Snowy Watcher'?\" <i>I think that is what Jarode had called it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe we all should appreciate the danger we will be placing ourselves in,\" the elf prince said. He looked over at me and Bralina to be sure we agreed, and we both nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can get many useful things from my magic pack, too, like snowshoes,\" I said. <i>Boy! Sure glad the old man gave it to me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day grew hotter as we trekked on, but the game trail we'd been following for some time, had led us into a light wood, where we now found ourselves under the canopy of hardwoods. Here only dappled sunlight filtered down to us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon we spied the little stream Glim and I had twice now rested by. We unslung our packs, which were heavier now with the large fur coats King Fabellious had given each of us, and dropped them, dashing to the brook..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of us removed our boots and socks and sat on the low bank with our feet dangling in the cool water. The frog I'd imagined a prince was nowhere to be seen, but further down the narrow stream swam a mama goose, her little flock in tow in a neat little follow-the-leader bunch. If I didn't know I could pull a goose, and a cooked goose, at that, from the pack, I would have been eyeing the big fat mama for dinner. But probably not now, since she had her little ducklings, and Bralina would put up a large stink about it too. You never wanted to push it too far with that hot-tempered little wench. I laughed and they looked over at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Private joke? Tyrl,\" Barlina asked, raising one of her perfectly sculpted eyebrows as though she'd read my mind. <i>I wouldn't doubt if the king or her father, Jarode, had given her such a magical item. I'd best keep my thoughts simpler and not about her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Glim said, swinging his long legs from the stream and standing up,\"We've a good couple of hours left before sunset. You two up for making it a ways yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe swung our legs out in answer, gathered up our packs and set off again. We probably wouldn't make it to the 'King's Road' this night, but it would be close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim plucked up another thick blade of grass, and after he had it just as he liked it, he began to play a lively, little tune. Bralina hummed along in her high, sweet voice. It made the going nicer, and I soon lost track of time, for the shadows were now thrown out in front of us, like three additional members to our little band of adventurers. <i>Ha! Tyrl, can you believe the wonders you've seen and heard? Of course not, I answered myself. I certainly cannot. Thought I'd never see anything more than five miles from Pa's farm.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" Glim called out, running ahead of us. \"Here's our old campfire from when we were but a day from King Valaspar's castle,\" the elf said. \"What say we call it night, build up a fire, and have ourselves a feast?\" He waggled his light blond eyebrows at Bralina, and she gave him one of her prettiest smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralina offered to set the feast out, and Glim and I gathered loose wood and kindling that lay within easy reach of our little campsite. Glim soon had a nice small fire going, and he went off in search of a flat stone to brew our coffee on in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralina gazed around the small clearing, and said, \"Where's Glim gone off to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He went to find a flat stone,\" I told her, \"He's been gone for some time though. What do ya think? Should I go see what he's up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, he's a big boy..., er, a big elf,\" she said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flutter of wings landed in the elm near our fire, and my eyes shot up, staring at it with its beady eyes returning my stare. \"Na, that ain't him is it?\" I asked, squinting at the bird. My question was answered, soon enough, as here strode in Glimmer, and following along behind was, none other than, little Vandermiremire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van!' I said, rising up from where I had been adding bits of branches to our little fire. \"What good fortune is this to chance upon you, yet again. I smiled a big smile, my cheeks puffing out. I went to the little fellow, and he grabbed me in a fierce bear hug, though his head only came up to my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Van here. Very happy now,\"  he told me and included Bralina with a warm hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan!\" I have missed you, my little friend,\" she said, squeezing him tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend! Friend! Friend,\" screamed Van's crow. <i>Arg! Here we go again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set his much smaller pack down a ways from the fire, then he opened it and said, \"Gifts. Yes, make Gifts. Van's friends' gifts,\" he told us. His round blue eyes danced in pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that so sweet of you, Van,\" Bralina said, plopping herself down next to the little fellow. \"I hope we have something for you as well,\" she said nodding her head toward my magic pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah..., yes. Of course we brought something along, just in case we ran across you, my friend,\" I told him, and Bralina finally let off giving me the evil eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan removed a package wrapped in fine white linen, and unrolled the contents carefully. When I saw the three figurines carved to match our likenesses to eveyr detail, I gave a low whistle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowzers! How did you have time to make these so quick, Van. They are amazing likenesses's. I mean right down to Bralina's little mole on her upper lip. You are a master carver, Van! That's for sure!\" I said as he handed me mine. I looked quite a bit handsomer than I saw myself though and said so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van,\" the prince said as the gnome handed him his. It was Glim to a tee, long of limb, and how he'd gotten it to look as if sunlight played off the elf's hair was nothing short of astounding. So life like, we all gaped at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like? Friends like. Yes?\" he said, but by our smiles and hugs, he knew we did, indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,120 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I stuck my tongue out at her when the little fellow wasn't looking. {I what am I supposed to give him? Thanks a lot you little wench!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dug around for quite sometime, delaying s I could think of something the gnome my like to have. {Ah! I never see him with a hat on, and it gets awful hot when we trek across open fields. Maybe he'd like a fancy hat, one with a feather in it. He seems to like bright colors from the grab he wears. Finally I pulled out a bright blue tall hat, like a stove pipe, and it just happened to have a blindingly glaring orange feather stuck in the brim. It was a huge feather, too, and most likely from an ostrich being that large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to our little friend, bowed low, and presented it to him,\"Your Highness..., er..., I mean, Your Grace, 'King of the Gnomes,\" Glim, Bralina, and I, are very pleased to give you...\" this fine hat. Glim snickered and raised a blond eyebrow my way. \"...this fine , beautiful hat, and we hope you like it as much as we like you!\" I bowed again, then blushed as all three of them burst out laughing, though whether it was directed at me or the hat, I could not say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van love! Pretty! Yes, pretty,\" Van said, then tried it on. It fell down over his eyes, but he adjusted it, and it seemed a perfect match for his orange trousers and blue robe he wore today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty! Pretty! Pretty!,\" screamed his crow. <i>ah shut up your stupid bird!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven I had to have a laugh as the little guy marched along, proud as a peacock in his new matching hat, though every few steps he had to shove it back from his wide forehead so he could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we left our little campground by the stream, we were marching east by northeast, and soon we found the game trail that would take us straight north to the 'King's Road'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're making excellent time,\" the elf prince said. \"We should be seeing signs of the 'Giant Cedars' very soon, eh, Tyrl? he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so as my feet are beginning to ache! What say we take five and have a light snack? No, Bralina, no feast just now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, including Bralina roared at our private joke. She seemed to have a hollow leg, and could eat mountains for such a slight little thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feast! Feast! Feast!,\" demanded Van's crow. <i> I'll give ya a feast, with you as the main course, if you don't knock that screaming off!</i> Van pulled some nuts from one of his many pockets in his bright blue robe, and he spread them on the ground. The crow flew down form a giant maple tree branch, and began pecking at them. \"good! Good! Good!,\" it said in a softer tone. I noticed the bird reserved this voice for only Van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe ate some berries, cheese, and a nice iced-tea, flavored with orange. Then we we're off again, hoping we'd spill out of this forest, and onto the road that led straight to the marble castle of good King Valaspar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince we'd been under the vast canopy of leaves for most of this trip, when we walked out into a grassy meadow, we noticed for the first time how dark the skies had become. Angry purple and black clouds sped by with a wall of blue and black behind that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that doesn't look to good,\"  I said pointing at the massive storm sure to lash us any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Glim said, his face pulled down in worry. \"We best go back into the forest. I saw a hollowed out oak, large ought to keep the rain off all of our heads, and keep our packs dry too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's run!\" called Bralina as she'd already took off running like a banshee as fat drops began to fall. We bolted after her, Glim soon taking the lead so he could direct us to the shelter he's spoken of. With in minutes we were soaked to the skin, and to make matters worse, a barrage of hail pelted us. I was sure we'd all have bruises, too, because some were as big as apricots! One landed on the gnomes at, so large, it dented it and pushed it down over the poor little fellow's eyes. Down he went in a deep puddle of mud, splashing my legs as I drew up beside him. I helped him up, then straightened his hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" I said, taking his arm and dragging him on. Up ahead, I saw Glim dart into the oak, followed by Bralina, and then Van and I, who'd gotten quite a few more poundings from the viscous hail storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were all safely inside the giant hollowed out oak, we dropped out soggy pack, shook the water from ourselves as best we could, then stripped down to our small clothes. The ceiling of this hollowed oak went up quite high, and we decided it would be safe to make a small fire. I pulled kindling from my magic pack, and Glim soon had a nice little fire blazing. We placed hooks in opposite sides of the massive tree, then strung a rope between.Each of us hung our clothes over this, and we rotated them to hang closest to the little fire.  Meantime, we pulled fresh clothing from our individual packs and dressed, finally dispelling the chill we'd all caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh..., chew!\" the little gnome said, and we all laughed, then shivered some more. I notice quite a few welts on all my friends faces and arms, and I am sure they did on mine. I reached up and softly touched a bruise on my left cheek. <i>Well, we'll not be looking our best for the king, eh, Tyrl?</i> presentable to the king<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,031 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

It was spacious inside, big enough for the four of us to lie down in, and with dry clothes on and a nice cozy fire burning down to hot coals, we were soon all sleeping soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe must have been much more tired than we thought, for we awoke to the hooting of a large owl, somewhere very close by the sound of its hoots. Darkness had swallowed the forest. I gazed out into a deep blackness. The moonlight did not filter down, so the skies must still be laden with rain, though it had let up for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy companions still lay softly snoring, perhaps dreaming of snow monsters, for Glim and Bralina, both, kicked out or punched something in their sleep. I sat up and pulled my magic bag close, reaching inside and pulling out a few breakfast items, thinking to surprise them all with a lovely start to their day. Orange juice, and ham and eggs, with fluffy biscuits too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey awoke to the tree smelling of fresh brewed coffee. They stretched and yawned, and smiled to, for who doesn't like to have someone else do the cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" did you do all this, Tyrl?\" <i>Tyrl! I think that's the first time Bralina's ever used my name as it's always been ya oaf before!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did!\" I said beaming her my best smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed,\" the elf prince said, sitting up and stretching his long arms over his head. \"Sure smells grand, Tyrl! Thanks a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI poured them each a cup of the steaming brew that Jarode had given us more of, since we'd all said how good it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess were not going to make the castle in daylight, huh? Wow, we slept this long?\" Bralina said, slurping on her coffee in a very un-lady-like-fashion. <i>That's our little Braliina!</i><br>\r\nAs we all sat around a new morning campfire, we heard the pitter-patter of more rain as it fell on the leaves of the surrounding trees. Then a whoosh of air caused sparks to flare up from our fire as Van's crow swooped in out of the rain, flapping it wings from his shoulder and spraying drops of water on us and our breakfast. A lone black feather floated down and landed smack dab in my scrambled eggs. <i> Dang that bird!</i> I plucked it out, cheese sticking to it and tossed it out into the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rain! Rain! Rain!\" it screamed as if we didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I kicked back lounging against the inside of the oak, my legs off to the side, the three of them packed up our remains, stuffing it all into my pack, though this would not make it heavier, being magic and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is but a light rain,\" Glimmer said, packing the rest of the bowl of eggs away. \"I think if good Tyrl would find four large umbrellas in that pack of his, we might yet make the 'Kings Road', and the castle by midnight. If you're all up for a considerable march, that is?\" He cocked his head at us, awaiting an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suits me fine,\" I said, standing and stretching my arms over  my head. \"I certainly wouldn't mind sleeping in that grand feather bed we enjoyed last time we visited good King Valaspar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor I. Van ready,\" the quiet little fellow said. He had been extra quiet this morning. Probably he had been thinking of the trees he cared for in the King's 'Forrest'. I remembered the tle Jarode had told us before we left, how the gnome had saved the trees from an infestation, wrapping them in a special potion and linen cloth, like mummified trees, the old man had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had completed their cleaning up tasks, we all slung our packs over a shoulder and headed out into the black, dripping forest, each under a brightly colored umbrella I had found in my pack. We were a site with oranges, yellows, blues, and even Van with a red and white poke-a-dot one I'd found special for the little guy. He'd smiled broadly and set off out front, stomping his small feet through the puddles on the game trail we took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter not to long, the clouds were swept away by a strong southerly wind, and out popped the moon in all its full splendid glory. It made our footing that much sure. And, in no-time-at-all, we stepped out of the hardwood forest and onto the 'Kings Road', which was lined with the monumental redwood trees, forming a long tunnel a we marched toward the castle some ten miles from there. The crow flew off ahead, once again ruffling my hair, so close did he fly over me. <i>You cut that out, you dang black monstrosity!</i> Of course, I would never call the thing names in front of Van, for he loved it as though it were one of his kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so far now,\" Prince Glimmer said, and set off at a brisker pace, the wind whipping his golden hair back from his handsome, young face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother two hour trek saw us standing before the unbelievably beautiful castle of King Valaspar. Wrought entirely of marble, it was a site to behold. No King's Guard had stopped us this time, though we'd all spotted them lurking within the redwood trees. The gatekeeper called out though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who goes there, and what is your business so late this night?\" he asked us. We saw the same rotund face peek out the door, with his lively gray beard and mustache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are Prince Glimmervan, and a party of three others,\" the elf said. \"The good king will be delighted to see us again so soon, for we are on another quest, and we require his assistance in it, and in the war with the 'Bad.\" Glim said, stone faced and in his most somber tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked open, as he said,\"Then enter and be welcomed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,007 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

That was the same way we'd been led in before, however, this time, his Captain of the Guard, dressed smartly in his white mail and whit cape, stepped up and gave Prince Glimmervan a modest bow, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you will, good Prince,\" the burly guard said,\" His Royal Highness, King Valaspar\" will receive you and your companions in the royal feasting hall. \"This way, if you would,\" he said, and three of the white robe guards led us, while three fell in behind. Just as it was. Things seemed to be repeating themselves everywhere we went on this second quest. <i>I wouldn't doubt it if Jarode were to show up as well.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Bralina said, catching up to me and Glim, \"I , for one, am certainly up for feasting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say,\" Glim said, and he, Van and I all laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am hungry, Bralina said, stomping off to bother the guards n white. <i>Better them than us!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suppose the king is throwing a fest for?\" I asked Glim. \"certainly he had no idea we were coming to visit so  soon after leaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true,\" the elf said. \"Perhaps it is a wedding or a birthday? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The burly Captain of the Guard, turned upon hearing us talk, and said, \"Today is the King's fiftieth Birthday, so it is a quite special occasion, and many have come from far and wide to celebrate with him.\" After that, he resumed his straight ahead stiff posture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Hall,\" he said, stopping so abruptly, we all piled into one another. I ended up lurching into Bralina's back, sending her sprawling to the cobblestone path we'd walked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! You dumb oaf, Tyrl. \"Why don't you watch where you're going?\" She dusted off her breeches, and gave me a fierce little scowl, her round face scrunched up and red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" but Glim and Van plowed into me! There was nothing I could do to stop myself from being propelled forward. <i> You ornery little wench!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wench! Wench! Wench! Van's crow cried, alighting on his small shoulder and riding there as we were ushered into a large room, filled with tables and chairs, and all decorated with party streamers, lanterns, flowers and more! It was definitely a lively affair, with much shouting, laughing, singing and some arguing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusicians played from a balcony to the right of the King's Dais, where we were led by a tall, balding servant, dressed in a garish blue velvet suit. When the king spotted us, he stood and tried to greet us, though the ruckus going on about us was deafening. Instead, he waved us up, spoke to another servant, who must have told four lords to vacate their seats, which they did, but not without studying us usurpers. One glared at us as he strode by in his ruffles and what looked like tights, and if they were breeches, they certainly fit snug in some areas! Glim and I shared a smile.<i> I wouldn't be caught dead in that outfit!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Glimmervan, and Van! And, you as well, young Tyrl. I did miss you all, but what brings you back to the castle o soon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim leaned in, so that the king might better hear him, and said, \"I am afraid we are on a rather urgent quest, Your Grace, though, we should discuss it on the morrow, for it is your day, after all. On behalf of my father and myself, I wish you a grand birthday,\" the elf prince said, bowing low to the jolly king. He looked to be well in his cups, for his face was flushed, and beads of sweat rolled down his wide, handsome face. The room though was cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Tomorrow will be soon enough. Surely you are tired from two long, back-to-back marches.\" He motioned for a wine servant to bring us all cups, and here we went again! Soon we be sliding down the hall and crashing into walls again! I, for one, only sipped on mine, remember all the mint tea I'd had to drink last time. My head hurt just thinking about it, and my stomach gave a little flutter. I notice Glim and Van had sat their's down all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe did partake in a few dances though, ans as ever, all the girls wanted a spin or three round the floor with the handsome, light-footed elf. I took had several slow dances with Bralina, who was an excellent partner, though she did call me oaf, for stepping n her little feet once or twice! <i>I never claimed to be light on mine!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hour grew very late, and we found a servant to show us up to our rooms. We meant to say good night to Good King, Valaspar, but he must have finally had enough wine, as he was not to be seen. Bralina was shon to a private room, and we three ended up in our same room, with the large, soft feather bed. We washed our faces, then sat on it, discussing what we thought the \"Snowy Watcher and surrounding smaller mountains would be like to traverse. We all agreed, we were so happy for Glim's Father's gift of the invisible fur coats! <i> Imagine a giant snow worm, Tryl!</i> I shivered, and the other two looked  o be thinking the same, for their faces were rather ashen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough we put these thought aside, and we all lay down and slept like the dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe awoke to sunlight spilling in through the open double doors of our veranda. The crow perched on the low wall, and he called out his morning greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snow! Snow! Snow! <i>I'd like to roll you up in a snowball, and throw you off the mountain.

I stood looking down at the inner court as it slowly awoke to the new day. Shopkeepers open their doors, setting our their many wares. Horses pulling carts laden with fruits, vegetables, grains and other things  entered through the same gate we'd come in last night, though I notice a different gatekeeper for this early shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're up early,\" the elf prince said, stepping out onto the veranda. He handed me a steaming cup of coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Glim,\" I said, taking the mug from him. \"Are Van and Bralina up yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The little fellow is still sawing logs, and I've not see our little Bralina yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling anxious for the start of this quest. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said before, Tyrl, we had all better be wary and watchful, for it is a dangerous task we have taken on. None of us have any experience in mountain terrain. We shall need a good dose of luck on our side, eh, my friend?\" He gave me a gentle nudge in the ribs and flashed one of his famous twinkling smiles that lit up his emerald eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Make that a humongous dose of luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luck! Luck! Luck! screamed Van's crow as it alighted on the low wall of the veranda. <i>Oh! Go away, you annoying bird!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning. Yes. Good morning,\" Van said stepping from our chamber into the sunlit morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, yourself, sleepyhead,\" I said, ruffling his snowy-white hair. He smiled and his blue eyes squinted at the brightness of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd best find the king, and have another look at that map of his, so we know our exact route to find this 'Chalin the Chaste' who supposedly guards the object we seek up on the 'Snowy Watcher' mountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe dressed and went in search of Bralina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe this is her door,\" Glim said, giving a few light raps upon a massive oak door with fruit and vine engravings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lady servant answered, giving us a low bow. \"She is dressing in the other room, if you care to wait here, she said, sweeping her thin arm around at the many comfy chairs surrounding a  fireplace already burning bright with logs flaming and crackling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe each took a seat, but Bralina soon pooped her head around her dressing room door. She stepped out, dressing in good travelling boots and attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" all three of us said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" she said, stretching and giving a big yawn. \"I could have slept all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean,\" I said. Seems like we never get enough rest with all these marches and quests!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quests! Quests! Quests! screamed the crow. <i>Arg! do we have to bring that dang bird along again/</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe found a servant to take us to the king as we knew not where he could be found. We were told to wait in his outer chamber of his sleeping quarters, and we all sat about sipping more coffee and a light breakfast of biscuits with butter and an assortment of fruits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good time later, after we'd all been pacing about the room, King Valaspar finally appeared. I felt sorry for him immediately and remembered last night that he's been well into his cups. He look as if a mountain had fallen on him, so downcast was his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh!  My aching head!\" he said, falling into a wide, high-backed chair. \"It is a good thing I do not turn fifty every day! Ah! but one must always pay the pipe, eh?\" he asked us, giving a lopsided grin that never reached his blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are sorry for Your Grace's suffering,\" Glim said. \"Shall we have your servant fetch some mint tea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I think that would be most excellent,\" Valaspar said, giving a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter, he'd had his tea, which had also been laced with willow bark, he went back to his private chamber and dressed for the day, saying he'd be not but a few moments, and he thanked us for our patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he came out, and then he led us all down several flights of spiraling staircases, so, once again, we were all turned around as to where we were within the marble castle. <i> think that is intentional.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first time I'd laid eyes on that massive carved war table, my jaw had fell open, and it nearly did again. Whoever carved the relief of the whole of the North, including the North of the North, where we were headed, was to be commended. Every detail was included, from trees to valleys to each peak and pathway up the mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing I had not noticed the first time I looked at it was the little red circles with a sword going through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those red dots with the sword, Your Grace?\" I asked the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, yes. Those , young Tyrl, ar something all of you need to study and study well!\" He raised his bushy eyebrows at each of us in turn as if a father giving a son a lecture. \"Those are where monsters have been sighted more than once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped and Glim, Bralina, and Van's eyes grew wide, for the 'North of the North' was covered in red dots just about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Your Grace!\" Bralina said, sitting hard on her chair. \"So many!\" Her face paled and her eyes took on a faraway look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so.\" the kind sounded a bit worried for us. \"However! Fear not, for I am sending a full regiment of guards along with you. \"Each will be chosen for having experience in this mountain terrain. This is my gift to you, and upon your return, your safe return, we will discuss in detail the aide I shall give to your Father, Prince Glimmervan, and to his Wizard, Jarode, for fighting the 'Bad' falls on the shoulders of all who profess to work for the 'Good.\" His face grew stern and we all had a moment of subdued silence. <i> Boy!

Here the men-at-arms were practicing their sword fighting and other weapons such as cudgels and spears, archers, too, took aim at stuffed targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe watched the mock fighting for awhile. The mens' bodies gleaming with sweat in the early morning sun. One man had the poor luck, or stupidity, to glance over at the arrival of his king, only to be knocked up side his head with the blunt end of a practice sword. His fellows hooted and called him names, while he burned a crimson blush up his neck and ruddy face. He stalked of in embarrassment, them still jeering at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Valaspar motioned for his Weapon's Master, and a man who stood well over six feet strode over. For such a large man, he walked with a sure-footed grace. He saluted his king, and gave him a slight bow. \"How may I serve you, My Grace?\" he asked, standing firmly at attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farok, this is Prince Glimmervan, heir to the throne of King Fabellious of the 'Secret Forest', and these three be his travelling companions. The four of them were sent on a quest by the prince's father and his Wizard, Jarode, and they have need of a regiment of well trained mountain soldiers. Put together twenty of your finest, and have them present themselves fully packed and ready to go within the hour.\" The kind nodded to his trainer, and the burly, dark haired man strode off to do his bidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we set your packs by the fountain there,\" the king said to us, and he pointed at the statue we'd been told was the likeness of his great, great grandfather, though it could have been of this king as well, so much did he resemble his ancestor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all lazed about the fountain wide circular border, dipping our hands in to have the pretty, multi-colored Koi fish nibble at our fingertips. I pulled some chicken from my magic packs and they flocked to mine, nipping gently as they gobbled it up as fast as I could give them more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hour flew by, and soon the Weapon's Master brought a detachment of twenty men, presenting them in two neat rows to his king. \"As you bid, Your Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Valaspar strode up and down the ranks, speaking to some by name, nodding to others. Some were old and gray of beards, while others sported fresh, youthful faces. All wore chain mail and had both swords and bows slung over their shoulders, with full quivers on their backs. their helmets were open faced, and each had a red and white feather for the king's colors, sticking out the top. They wave back and forth in the morning's gentle breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also noticed that each soldier had a large pair of snow shoes tucked underneath their quivers. I remembered Glim's and my conversation about having the magic pack just for that purpose, though I was not looking forward to tromping through deep snow, especially, not deep snow with snow worms living in it! I began to sweat before we marched out the castle's back gate, heading straight north, north to our doom, I hoped not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we fist det out, ten of the men-at-arms, advanced out in front of our party of four, with ten bringing up our rear. The way was easy going through open meadows, but soon we began to see some hard woods, and then a smattering more, and more, yet, as we went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon we were on another game trial, still heading due north, but we were now in a dense wood of ample and oak, with some spruce thrown in here and there. As we continue, until nearly high noon, we came out of this wood and into a lush valley of swaying, tall green grass. Here The Captain of the Guard, who was also  Farok, the Weapons' Master, called everyone to a halt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe dropped packs, swords and other equipment, and all shared a meal and some refreshments. The soldiers gaped when I pulled a fully cooked ham, bowls of steaming yams, and even a few trays of cherry tarts from my magic pack. <i>Yes! Those last were for Bralina's sweet tooth and love of them, since the young swan princess had requested then on our way to taking the twins back to their home.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps we should not have eaten quite so well, for we were a slow, sluggish troop marching on well into the sunset. By then, the hardwoods had mostly vanished, except for a straggler here and there. They gave way to the tall pine and blue spruces which grew well in the foot hills of these snowy mountains. Flocks of crows sheltered in the blue-green branches of several large trees, and as we approached they took wing, cawing and flapping in protest of their solitude being broken. Surely they did not see men often, this far north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan's crow, riding on his little shoulder, cried out to his feathered friend, \"Caw! Caw! Caw!\" A myriad of answers followed, like a drunken orchestra of cawing drunkard crows! <i>ARG! Shut up, already! As if one of you wasn't enough! Now I have to put up with a while flock of you nasty birds?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe rounded a bend in the trail we'd been following, and there we glimpsed our first sighting of the majestic 'Snowy Watcher Mountains'. As Jarode had said, they were named for 'Chalin the Chast', he who refrained from women, so that he might watch over the sacred artifact that the 'Bad' now sought. We were on a quest that would take us to his snowy doorstep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, of course, if we did not fall to our deaths scaling this mountain range, or that we were not eaten, torn limb from limb by the many morbid monsters that dwelt both above and below these lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Death! Death! Death!\" Van's creepy crow called as if it had read my mind, or was it a premonition?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,039 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, too, did we add extra liners to our boots that we had deliberately selected to be an extra size bigger. The soldiers  took the snow shoes they had on their backs and, I dug out four pair for us in varying sizes, and we all sat in the six inch snow, lacing them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as everyone took up their gear, the front ten soldiers, started picking a path up the gradual slope of the mountain. At the bottom the going was easy, but looking up to the higher elevations, I gulped  at what lay ahead. We were no mountain men. And, though some of these soldiers the king had sent along in hopes of protecting us, in hopes of our quest to retrieve the artifact was successful, some had some experience, but certainly this was not their normal kind of terrain either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were several hundred feet up, we encounter loose gravel in the areas where the snow had bee swept from the mountain, and with the winds increasing by the hour, our footing became treacherous, to say the least. One guard went tumbling down, though he received some small cuts and scratched on his hands and face, he was mostly unharmed. Little Van nearly slid down as well, but the sure footed and ever quick elf had grabbed him by his fur trimmed collar, yanking him to his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it there, little friend, we wouldn't want to lose you,\" Glim favored the gnome with one of his glittering smiles, his eyes bright green in the overhead light of the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look over there,\" Glim said, as a trio of eagles flew off to our left. They glided with ease on the mountain's air currents. \"Probably searching for snow hares or mountain rodents,\" the elf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain of the Guard called for a rest once we'd all reached a wide shelf of granite. Weary, we all dropped our gear, sitting wit our backs along the ledge's wall, which offered some protection from the relentless winds. We had a lit lunch of bread, meat and cheese, and hot coco, which I served the men from my magic pack. They each smiled and offered thanks as Glim, Bralina and Van handed them a steaming mug. They took off their gloves and warmed their fingers round the steaming cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, the tough captain called an end to our rest, and we set off to picking our way carefully up. Up. up, and up some more. As we went up, the air became much colder, so that our hairs in our nose froze and itched. Thankfully the boots and gloves, and the wonderful coats King Valaspar had gifted us, kept us toasty warm, and, too, we each, I am sure, remembered their magical power of invisibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we went up even higher, I could see that this mountain range was made up of many peaks, which rose and rose, until their tops were lost to the clouds. The main one we sought, was 'Snowy Watcher', and to reach it, we would have to go round a smaller, though still vary high peak. The captain had said a narrow ledge went round it, but that we would have to then traverse a snow bridge, made entirely of thick ice. I did not relish either task, and my heart had fluttered as he'd said many had slid off of the snow bridge from going across too fast, especially if the sun was out, because it made it very slick, indeed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe'd been advancing all day, and our legs and arms, not to mention our backs laden with all our gear, were beginning to grow fatigued. When another man slipped, and was caught by one of his companions, thankfully, the captain said we'd make for another ledge about thirty feet up, and there we would make our first mountain camp, well, the first for many of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis ledge, also made of the same hard, gray granite, was much larger, and a wall of rock formed a near perfect shelter, with a slight overhang for a roof. Under this we all collapsed. We lay panting for some time before even removing our packs and gear. We'd long since taken our snow shoes off, because most of the way up had been swept clear, and they were far to cumbersome to try scaling a mountain in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men-in arms, took off their coasts to remove their heavy metal, and their captain suggested they leave it here, and pick it up on the descent. To this he got a round of applause from the normally stalwart men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also gave us a round of applause when to their surprise we pulled log after log and kindling, and even small stones to make several campfire rings from my pack. Soon we had two fires blazing to push back the chill, and with the protection of the curved walls and overhang, it stayed quite toasty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if we were not the apple of the men's eye already, Bralina and Van set about spreading out a huge buffet of hot food to further drive the chill from their weary bones. How they managed to pull a long table from my pack will probably remain a mystery, and the next people to scale this mountain, who happen to come this way, will, no doubt, see it and scratch their heads as to how it got high up on the mountain ledge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1013 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

Hot, roasted turkey, not a problem, complete with large bowls of mashed potatoes and gravy, easy peasy, pretty much whatever, so as I said, we were stuffed, and soon everyone of us four and all the soldiers slept peacefully under the ledge, warmed by our fires, also courtesy of my pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until.., \"What was that noise?!\" someone called off to my left. I opened one bleary eye, thinking it could be that dang crow I was just dreaming about. We'd not seen beak nor feather of the nuisance, sine we'd began our climb, and that was fine by me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" the same scratchy voice called out. \"What is it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time everyone was awake, and many of the soldiers were up and pacing, swords drawn, though they were only half dressed. Some marched about stocking footed, but soon donned their boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim and I produce a dozen torches from my pack, and we passed them out among the men. The captain selected  eight to go scout the surrounding area, four to a side. It wasn't  long though before we heard a terrible scream of pain, and one of the soldiers limped back in, supporting another, who's arm was bleeding profusely. He laid him down near one of the fires we'd re-stoked with fresh logs. Te other two that had gone left, came running back in, shouting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what it was, Captain, but it was big. It was very big, and it got Lokey, bout near tore his arm off. It was big, Captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mans eyes were like saucers, wild and darting all about as if something would try and grab him too, and sweat ran down his wide face, going round a large scar on his one cheek to drip off of his square chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a hold of yourself, Moss,\" The captain told the agitated and obviously frightened man. He motioned for another soldier to come over, and told him to sound his bugle to call the other four back. He took his instrument  case he'd slung over his back off, removing it from the wooden case. He put it to his lips, and gave three long blasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a time no one returned, and we all grew silent, watching, anxious that something had befallen them as it had the other four. But then, the four came running in. \"What is it, Captain?\" one of them asked, breathing in large draughts of the mountain air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something attacked Lokey,\" the burly captain said. \"Everyone stay within the firelight, and you, you...,\" and he continued to point out a dozen more guards, \"are to stand watch until sunrise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, after that, and listening to the man who'd nearly had his arm torn off, moan, no one got any more sleep. We finally gave the whole idea up, and Glim and I brewed pot after pot of steaming hot coffee, strong as they could drink it. For the man who'd been injured, Glim pulled a dark green leaf from my pack, and set about making him a very strong tea of it, and to it he added some willow bark. The man winced as he sipped it, finally taking the whole measure, he quieted then fell into a light and troubled sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made it not too strong, lest we need to move,\" the elf told their captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" he said, and went off to see to his injured man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun rose, finally, off to our left, and spread it warming rays in through the opening of our stone shelter. The wind seemed less brisk than last evenings, and we were all thankful for that. Scaling a trail around a slope, then traversing an ice bridge did not seem like a good idea in a strong wind, or even in any wind to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one had much of an appetite, but the captained warned us it might be some time before we'd have a chance for a bite again, so we all choked down some biscuits with strawberry Jam and a bowl of mixed fruit, and loads more of the strong coffee. The injured man had come to, saying his arm hurt bad, and so Glim gave him more of the concoction he'd brewed, but only a small sip, promising more when next we slept. Lokey gave the elf prince a weak smile, and a nod of thanks, then two soldiers propped him up for the short assent to reach the trail above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral times they had to pass him up, as he was unable to use his arm at all. Then he would cry out, and we all feared infection may have set in his limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a short climb more, we all stood with our backs against the granite wall, and, let me tell you, if the captain called this a trail, well, it wasn't. I leaned our the slightest bit and vertigo claimed me, there was a fathomless drop down into jagged snow crevasses, black and appearing to go straight down to hell or worse, The trail, as he called it, could not be more than two feet wide, and it wound steeply up, much of it covered in patches of slick ice. I gulped, locked ridged against the stone, not wanting to move at all. I saw the last of the front soldiers disappear round the first turn, and the rear guard was muttering and calling out for us to move, and so Glim said, \"It's okay, Tyrl. I won't let you fall, my friend,\" and with that, he turned me toward where the men had gone, and keeping his hand on my shoulder, he gave me a nudge. I took a tentative step, and Glim said, \"That's it. One foot, then the other.\" I kept the mantra going in my head. <i>One foot, then the other, one foot, then the other..., </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,023 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Round and round and round we went on that slippery trail as the captain had called it, extremely treacherous, and tiny, not much of a squirrel path, I called it. Since my bout of vertigo, I never once looked down again. I watched, staring straight ahead, one hand sliding along the face of the granite wall as one man up in front of me nearly slid off the side when his feet went out from under him on a patch of ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain,\" Glimmer called up ahead. We all came to a halt, as the elf went sideways past five or six men, their backs to the cold granite wall. He'd taken my pack along, and he knelt down in front of the captain, reached in and began pulling cloth bags full of something, these he told the captain to hand out, one to each of his men, and he said he'd do the same for our rear guard. When the captain plunged his hand in his and pulled it out, sprinkles of crushed gravel fell from it. \"Clever!\" was all he said to the elf prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim sidled back, then passes bag after bag back to the soldiers behind us, then finally one for Bralina, Van and myself, saving the last for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe going got much easier after that with all of us sprinkling our gravel ahead of our feet. Still, it seemed to on a long time before we finally turned a corner, and there was an very large meadow, filled with crusted snow so hard, we could walk across its surface with out our boots punching through,and there, across the way, was the famed ice bridge, glimmering in the full noon sunlight. <i>If you though that ledge around the mountain was narrow, Tryrl, then what do you call this, a shoe string?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone had come off the ledge and gathered in the center of the meadow, we all flopped down, dropping packs and other thing we'd carried along. Captain said we'd spend the night here and attempt crossing the ice bridge in the early morning before the sun had a chance to melt the top layer and make it more slippery and dangerous. I gazed over at it, thinking it would be dangerous no matter what time one crossed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slip! Slip! Slip!\" cried Van's crow as it flew into our group, and landed on Van's pack. \"Food, food, food,\" it said to him in it's voice it used only for him. He took our more nuts ans spread them on top of the crusted snow, and the bird set to gobbling them as if it were half starved. <i>How the heck did that bird find us way up here? I was hoping it would stay down on the ground. Well, maybe one of them snow worms will reach out of its snow hole and snatched the dang, annoying thing.</i> After thinking that, I felt pretty guilty, what with the little fellow being such a nice friend and all, but dang that bird gets on my nerves for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had a early dinner of roast beef and all the trimmings, the we all sat around. Someone had a deck of cards and another some dice, so we played games, since the captain gave the okay, but we kept the betting fun, and no one lost much. We were just putting out our bedrolls when the first tremor cause everyone to jump up. Was it an avalanche or had a section of the mountain collapsed. If it was the latter I hope our way down was still there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then a second one came in and the snow around the edge of the meadow spwed up in a great spray. It shot all the way over to us, burying us in huge drifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" I hollered at Glim, as I un-buried myself. He was dusting himself off, when we heard a angry roar.  That's when we both turned, an all the captain's men, and there on the edge was the most hideous creature, white and slimy, a huge gaping mouth full of rows of razor sharp teeth. When it roared, it spewed a slimy substance that melted the surrounding snow down to raw granite,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run!\" the captain of the guard yelled. Every grabbed what they could, but much of our gear was left behind. I grabbed up the magic pack, and my boots which had been drying by the fire. They were wet from sweat rather than any moisture that had fallen. Glim had everything he came with as did Van, but Bralina lost her entire pack in the scramble. I was glad to notice we all had our fur jackets, and we all said the word Kin Valaspar had whispered to u, \"Vasa,\" poof, one, two, three, four of the running pack simply disappeared into thin air. I saw shocked looks on the men's face's I'd been running next to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone dashed to the ice bridge not slowing a bit, and being the sun had mostly set, it had refrozen, so it wasn't quite as slippery, the captain went first and just as he got to it, he went into a deliberate slide, and slid three quarters of the way across in one smooth slide. \"He shuffled his fee the rest of the way and was across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on the other side, he now screamed, run and slide! Run and slide!\" And, by golly, one by one we did, and one by one we were across. The worm had made it slow crawling over to it, and howled in anger. Apparently it didn't trust it, or it didn't like ice as much as it did snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt kept trying to spew its slime across the ice, but it did not have the same effect as it did on snow, for the bridge remained solid with out even a hole or cracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy! Bralina said, \"I could have done without seeing the likes of that blasted creepy thing!\" We all shook our heads, even some of the captains men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe marched off a good ways, even going up the mountain more in the dark. Glim, with his great vision had spotted a cave up a hundred feet or so. We made the slow ascent as best we could with the falling shows all around us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,063 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a large cave, and the captain sent half his men in to be sure none of them foul ice worms had made it home. They came back after a thorough search, saying the coast, or the cave was clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all marched in, and the cave too a bend to the right, down a little descent, and we found ourselves in a second room, smaller but cozier too, and best of all, there was another path  through a section of wall that led out to the mountain, and that meant we had a second escape route, if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping everything, we all sprawled on the smooth cave bottom, still breathing hard. Once we'd recovered from the arduous climb, we set about taking stock of all we'd lost in the mad dash across the ice bridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang! I lost just about everything. I mean, my whole pack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everything, Glimmer said. \"You have your life. You were not eaten by that foul snow worm. Nor did you fall off the ice bridge or turn an ankle. So count your blessings, my friend. Besides we can get you a whole new pack, and replace every item you had, and all these men's items too, just by reaching in Tyrl's magic pack. And with that, he gave her one of his best Twinkling smiles. One of those heavenly smiles that made his green elf eyes shimmer. Then we all laughed, long and hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Glim,\" she said, giving the elf a playful punch on his long, thin arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I said, were all pretty lucky to have escaped with our lives. That was terrifying, and I hope we don't run across more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky! Lucky! Lucky! screamed Van's crow, and for once I had to agree with that dang bird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim and I took the magic pack around and built four small campfires, and everyone huddled about, talking in hushed tones, for fear of calling something upon us. Guards were appointed watch, and I offered to stand with the first. As everyone snuggled in for the night, We stood about the two entrances, watching for any signs of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this high up, the stars seemed very close indeed. I watched them pop into being, one after another, until the whole sky was a twinkle of lights. It was a rare sight, and one I will always remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, one of us went and woke the second watch, and it was our turn to catch as much shut eye as we could, for we still had high to climb in the morning. The captain thought we might make it to where 'Chalin the Chaste' kept watch over the artifact, and if not, then very close to it. I, for one, would be glad to find him, retrieve the thing, and then to get off of this blasted mountain with its snow worms, and who knew what else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Glimmer trot off for the second watch with another group of soldiers before my eyelids grew heavy as stones and I fell into a light sleep. More snow worms traversed my dream, and I know I kicked out several times as Van said, \"Okay. Yes. Tyrk, okay.\" \"Okay, okay, okay,\" I heard his crow whisper as if it knew men slept. <i>Funny bird.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke to the smell of coffee brewing, and I sat up and threw off my wool blanket. It was very warm in the small cave as someone had kept all four fires burning. The smoke rose to a small natural smoke hole, which kept us from choking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the soldiers were up, sipping on their coffee, some honing their swords and knives. Others were helping fetch water from a small pool that had melted a large pile of ice in the corner, which had melted from our fire. We washed as best we could, then all enjoyed crisp bacon Bralina and Van made on two flat stone set in one of the fires. Glimm, I spotted across the room, flipping pancakes like a pro, and sending them sailing onto men's waiting plates. Every time one landed, a quite cheer or thumbs up would be made. Everyone was still leery of drawing any attention to our party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up, and Van followed to go grab one or two of the elves fine smelling flap jacks. \"About time you got up, \" the elf prince said. He tossed one high in the air, and I only had to move my plate an inch, and it fell centered right on my plate. He smiled as did I.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the soldiers standing morning guard came in to report the sun was rising to the captain, and it was soon time to pack all our things up. I wasn't looking forward to another frigid climb. My legs were aching before we even set out the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we got going, the soreness worked its way out, but it was not an easy climb this day. No, many a time we had to pound in spikes and use ropes to haul or gear and then us and the soldiers up. It was very slow going. At least, no morbid monster had approached us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was amazed that out of a  group of twenty four, we had suffered no losses, and we only had the one injured man, whom Glimmer was tending. What ever the elf put in those concoctions he boiled and placed on the man, or had him drink, seemed to speeding healing to the long gashes he'd received on his arm from most likely a monster of some kind, though he never really could say exactly what had attacked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as soon as we hauled everyone up a rough stretch, and we walked a few paces around a bend in a field of snow, we knew instantly that we had stumbled upon the keep of 'Chalin the Chaste', and it was a marvelous site to see, perched their on the peak of the \"Snowy Watcher Mountain',<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,041 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

When we rounded that last bend and it came into view, it stole our breath away. Our packs were carelessly discarded, our eyes big and round, mouths hanging askew, and not just us four, but the soldiers too. I saw more than one sword slide from burly hands to lie in the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fairy Tale Castle n the Sky' would not do this place justice, no. 'Magnificent Monumental Marvel in the Sky'? Nope. Not even close to the wonder of it. Larger than any castle I had ever seen, had ever imagined anyone could think about building, let alone actually building it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt rose and rose and rose to staggering heights. Whether or not it had battlements or rounded domes or even flags flying from its many towers I could not say, for they were lost to the fast swirling mists and clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI craned my neck back, taking in the full splendor of the massive crystal blue ice! And not just one shade of blue, mind you, but a myriad of subtle shade changes, bedazzled one's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowzers!\" Now that is a good description of Chalin's Palace, in one tiny word!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" was all Glim could get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to live here,\" Bralina chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van, no. Cold. Too cold!\" the little gnome said, hugging himself and shaking in mock coldness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cold! Cold! Cold! cried the crow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I bet it is ice cold,\" I said, looking right at the bird, and to my surprise, he said, in his voice he only used with van, mind you, \"Yes. Yes. Yes, Tyrl.\" Well, my mouth fell open again as I stood staring at the smart bird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was totally unprepared for what it did next as well. He flew from Van's small shoulder to land on my broader one, then sat making little cooing noises. <i> Makes me feel a little guity for all the times I wished it harm! Maybe it's not so bad after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan smiled at me and said,\"Friend. Tyrl's friend.\" I smiled back and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we'd all had taken in the stunning beauty of the castle, the captain called four men out to go left, four to the right, to scout our the place. They took of a slow walk, approaching the massive buildings, but the had not gone twenty paces toward it when, \"Crackle, ZZZZT!\" and a blue light arch out and blasted all eight men back nearly ten feet. They landed with soft \"THUD! THUD! THUDS! in the deep snow, but I saw tendrils of smoke rising from their hoods to a man. Some had black smudges on their hands and faces, and all bore a stunned look of surprise on their windburned faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck!\" screamed their captain. \"What in bloody hell was that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that were not bad enough, a long resounding sustained blast of a horn began. It went on and on, until everyone to a man, and Bralina, had covered their ears to block out the deafening sound. The ground shook with the cacophony of it. It felt as if it were rattling my bones and my teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear Van's crow screaming in anger at it, \"Stop! Stop! Stop!\" then I saw it arc out and away from our group, seeking to get away fro the awful horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as suddenly as it had begun, the horn was cut off, and to our surprise, the massive wooden and iron bound doors of the keep began to swing open, though no one was seen with in. No one move, but we all stood watching, anticipating the arrival of someone. Anyone? No one came though, and still we stood gawking at the open doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour of nothingness, many of us had plopped back down on the cold snow. It was eerily quiet up on 'Snowy Watcher Mountain', the only sound being the roaring winds, which whipped our hair about, and tried to tear our scarves and hoods from us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, breaking the silence with such force, a voice cried out as those greatly magnified:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter Prince Glimmervan of the 'Secret Forest', and all of your companions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When we rose and the soldiers along with us four, the voice came again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Only the four on a quest for my sacred artifact may enter.\" That was all it said, then the silence once again swallowed any noise but the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does he know you name, Glim? And how the heck does he know we're on a quest for crying out loud? An about the artifact we seek? I don't know if I like this.\" <i>No. I don't like this one bit!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Glim, Bralina, Van , and I approached the blue behemoth, the voice called out a final warning:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave the magic pack where you stand!\" It was said with such authority that I immediately obeyed, dropping it with a thunk to the snow. We walked four breast, slowly as though we walked to the gallows, to our sure death, for we knew not what we were walking into. What if this 'Chalin the Chaste were mad as a dog. I mean, he'd been living up here all a lone, supposedly for centuries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he's mad?? I mean mad as in loony?\" Bralina asked, reading my exact thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mad! Mad! Mad! Van's crow had returned and alighted on the little fellow's shoulder. The voice did not complain, nor say the bird could not enter, so we proceeded toward the doors, slow as w could go without stopping completely. I gulped back my fear, staring straight ahead as did my companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1,019 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Two. Then one more, and we stood just outside the massive open doors of the keep. We could feel the cool air swirling within. And the curved tunnel looked even longer now that we stood before it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we?\" Glimmer asked, ushering us inside, but at the last second, he put his arm back out, and stepped across the frozen threshold himself. He stood there, still as a statue, but nothing happened. No arc of blue light zapped him, and no voice cried out to halt. He turned back to us three and gave us all a smile that only pulled half his mouth up, but both eyebrows raised as if in questions. He took another step, motioning us to come, and we did, each stepping through and pausing, to see if maybe we would be the ones to be zapped back, but no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone had ingeniously laid and anchored strips of some kind of thin wood slats across the ice of the floor for the entire length of the tunnel, and they had grit embedded in them, which made for a surefooted path. Only after we'd gone down this tunnel a long ways did it begin to curve, and when it did! Oh! Boy! If the outside had blown us away, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the bend we came to a slamming halt, one piling into the one ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim gave a whistle, long and loud. \"I never..., I never seen anything like this n my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you suppose carved all these statues?\" I said, looking at each of them in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea, but man, they're good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Good! Good! said the crow, flying from Van's shoulder to alight on a statue of a grim faced man-in-arms. Ever detail had been painstakingly carved on it, from shining breast plate to his powerful sword held aloft in a mighty fist. The look on his broad face both stern and brave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I didn't know it was ice, I'd almost expect him to swipe at us with that blade,\" I said, giving a small laugh, then stepping back a pace from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" The elf prince said, he sounded as if he'd been startled by something, and we all turned to where he pointed. Our faces grew white at the site, for their standing in a miniature sculpture of a tunnel stood the three of us, our expressions of wonder from a moment ago, captured on our faces. I gulped and goose flesh jumped across all of our arms and ran down my spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Bralina said, backing away from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic! Magic! Magic!\" cried the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is exactly right,\" someone behind us said in a deep and powerful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all spun around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Glim who recovered first, and the elf gave a low bow as he said, \"Good 'Chalin the Chaste', may I presume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this the giant of a man, for he stood well over six feet, gave a tremendous laugh, holding his sides and bending over, We stood silent, waiting for him to finish. He finally stood upright, wiping tears from both his eyes. His brad face was much more youthful than I would have thought, what with him supposedly being centuries old. He appeared as young as any of us. He had a rugged charm about him. Broad of shoulder, narrow of hip, and green eyes that  would almost rival Glim's in their ability to shimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, but I have not heard that particular nickname in half a century. I never was quite sure who pinned that one on me, though I'd like to know and have a few choice words with him. Yes. I would.\" he told us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued to stare at him, silent as children scolded twice in church. Then I worked up my nerve to speak to the man, \"You are Chalin though, right? Keeper of the ancient artifact we seek, one that will restore balance to the 'Good' and the 'Bad'?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the smile slid from his handsome place and was replaced by a fierce scowl. He took a step toward us and boomed,\"How know you of such an artifact or that it may be found here in my 'Crystal Palace'?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment I thought he might draw the long sword he had sheathed in his scabbard and lop of all of our heads, but he just stood there, feet spread wide, hands at his sides. Then he asked, \"Who has sent you on this mighty quest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim took a step forward, giving him another nod of respect, and said, \"We were sent on this noble task by my Father, King Fabellious', of the 'Secret Forest'. These are my travelling companions, Tyrl, Bralina, daughter of 'Jarode the Jolly' who is 'First Wizard' to my Father, and this is King Vandermiremire, 'King of the Gnomes', and 'Keeper of the King's' Forest' the forest of 'King Valaspar of the North',\" Glim said, finally getting out all the titles, though once again, I noted my lack of even one. <i>Tyrl of nothing? Tyrl of no name and no where, owner of nothing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of all I have seen and watched for many years, and this know I, he said, \"They are all good men, and men who seek to spread only the 'Good' wherever they go, and in all of their actions. I know, too, of the spreading of the 'Bad', and of the foulness of the swamp that you brave ones have cleansed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, how? How could you know of these things?\" Bralina was brave enough to ask for all of us. <i>That's why her father nicknamed her 'Bralina the Brave',eh, Tyrl</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brave little Bralina,\" he said, and she smiled and blushed, and I grew jealous. <i>Jealous! What do you fancy her now, Tyrl?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is time,\" he told us. We waited for him to go on, but he stood there as if deep in his own memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time?\" the elf prince asked. \"Time for what, good Chalin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is high time I left this beautiful palace of ice, high time I came down off of this mountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down! Down! Down!\" screamed Van's crow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It will not work with out me. No. It is tied to me, and to me alone. The magic within it, that may keep the 'Bad' in check, is my burden, and mine alone. At this pronouncement he hung his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something else you are not telling us good sir?\" Glimmer asked him. \"We are at your service in anything your may require of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No. It is just..., well, when I go down the mountain and finally enact the magic within the artifact, it will consume me. Oh, not instantly, I will have a year, maybe two, I was told, so long ago, by the mighty wizard who created it. I will age rapidly in that time, until my very bones turn to dust. But, I have lived longer than most, though much of it has been in solitude. After I have done what must be done, it would be my wish to have a bit of adventure, to see a bit of the world, perhaps dance, and laugh with others as I have so often dreamed of doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had tears in his big green eyes, and so did all of us. What a good man to have given up his entire life, and all of it to protect us, to protect the world from the 'Bad'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a hero, Chalin,\" Bralina said, rushing to him, tears overflowing from her sad blue eyes. She hugged him in a fierce grip, and he did likewise. They stood there wrapped up like that for a long time, and finally we all joined in a group hug, Van, Glim and I.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I depart my home I have grown to love I would show all of you have few of its many wonders. I have poured my heart and soul into this place, and I think you will be surprised by much. \"Come,\" he said, motioning for all of us to follow. Surprisingly we went to a small door, made entirely of ice, and one none of us had noticed, and with a word, it slid without a sound into a recess, and he stepped within as we did too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stood on an ice landing, before a massive winding staircase, yes, made of ice, but with the same gritted slats of wood, so that we need not fear tumbling down its myriad of steps. He took the lead and we began to descend. Down, down and down some more, until my knees began to ache. We came to another landing, and here he stopped, said another word, and an ice door slid open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a cool trick,\" I said to the big man\" and he beamed at me with his brilliant white teeth in a wide, but handsome mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the way to my private quarters within this vast ice castle, but here you will find many more creature comforts,\" he told us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where does the staircase continue down to?\" asked the elf prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, my new friends,\" he said, raising his eyebrows, will take us from this mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! You mean we shall not have to go down the face of the mountain? Not across that horrible ice bridge, nor face those grotesque creatures who tried to tear off one of the soldiers arms..., the soldiers!\" Bralina gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes. What of our friends waiting out side?\" I asked our big friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, and I shall let you call them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call them? From here? How would they hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shall see, oh, inquisitive one, oh 'Tyrl the Inquisitive One', \"he said, laughing, and we all laughed, for now I finally had a title of my own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as we stepped through a tall wooden door, reinforced with heavy iron bands, we stood within a massive network of caves. Gone was the ice, and this place radiated with warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw us smile and heard us make mention of how cozy the place felt, and said, \"Hot springs. The whole of this place is heated by hot springs, deep under the mountain and piped up here, magically, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowzers! That would save on a lot of work chopping wood and hauling it from the foot of the mountain,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, the big guy said, laughing another of his rumbling belly laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led us down a corridor of granite, and came to a smaller room. it had a plush carpet and many fine pieces of carved furniture, which Van notice immediately. The little fellow and his crow, for once, had remained mostly silent thus far, but now he oohed and wed over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty! Yes, You make?\" he asked Chalin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. Thank you, Van. It was something to occupy my time, and something I really enjoyed doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your adventure, I said, \"You will definitely want to include a trip to Van's wood shop, and home under the hill where he lives. It is quite something to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall plan on it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChalin stopped before a piece of furniture with a strange tube-like apparatus sticking out of it. It had a crank on the side of it, which he wound round and round, until we hear a click, then he motioned for me to step over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak into the tube, and tell your soldiers to approach the door in five minute, as that will give me time to turn of the bolts of magic they were hit with before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain? Can you hear me?\" I asked, feeling rather silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Loudly, Tyrl. Please speak softer, lest you break all of our eardrums,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI whispered my next words. \"We have met with Chalin, and all is well, and he is even now disengaging the blue bolt thingy, that had hit your men before. You may approach the double doors, and Glimmer or he will meet you at the end of the tunnel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Tyrl. I shall gather the men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He led us down another tunnel in the granite, and into a comfortable sitting room with cozy plush chairs and sofa in a matching calico pattern. Here, a fireplace crackled with burning logs, and the windows were painted to look real, one of a lake set deep in a wooded forest, and another of birds flying up from a marsh scene, and over these, little Van squealed in delight. It would seem the little fellow and Chalin shared many of the same passions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sipped on lemonade that had sprung up from the center of a round ornate table, complete with four crystal glasses, already filled with ice cubes! It had to be magic, of course. The whole ice palace had one wonder after another, though I doubted we'd even begun to see them all. He had lived here for two centuries, so what else did he have to do. Obviously, the blue bolts kept anyone from ever getting anywhere near the ancient object we had come to get, so he had nothing but time on his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sad to think that poor Chalin will age rapidly, and that in just two short years he will be nothing but dust.\" A tear slipped from Bralina's eyes as she went on, \"I mean, the poor guy's been up here all alone for all these years. It's not fair!\" she said, slamming her drink down and sloshing some onto the fine redwood of the magic table. \"Oh!\" she dabbed at the sticky liquid, before it could cause a water mark. Though who exactly would see it or care, after Chalin and all of us left, I didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe'd only been relaxing a few moments, when Chalin stuck his head in our little room. \"Come,\" he said in his commanding way as if he'd always been in charge, but then he really was, or had been all these many years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've left your soldier friends in a larger room, and I thought you'd like to join them there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks you,\" Glimmer said as Chalin led us to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain,\" I called out as we entered the room. \"Did you bring my pack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I did,\" he said hoisting it up and waving it at me. \"You certainly would not want to loose it, now, would you, Tyrl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Captain, that I would not. And, how would I ever explain such a loss to Jarode!\" We all laughed at this, except for Chain, who seemed preoccupied with  his own thoughts. Who could blame the poor guy, having to leave here, and then knowing what he knew his fate to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, Captain,\" Glim asid, striding over with his long legs. \"We have the best of news for you and the men!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the snow worms have been killed?\" the captain joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even better,\" the elf prince said. Chalin has a way down this blasted mountain, and it can all be done within the mountain itself! We shall not have to scale the mountain, the passes, the ice bridge, nor fear any more monsters from the snows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My word!\" the captain said, nearly choking on a bite of cheese. \"I think that is the best news I've ever received in my life!\" We all roared at this, but it was true. Had you ever in your life had to see and face one of those beasts, you'd be cheering too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The day grows late,\" Chalin said. Let us all get a good night's sleep, then proceed down the stairs, through a series of down ward sloping tunnels, then a short walk through a wide cavern, and we shall be at the very foot of the mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the different bedroom he assigned to everyone, you would have thought this man hosted large parties all the time. I mean, I saw at least fifty bedrooms, and he let us all choose. Some chose to sleep on their own, while our party chose a two room suite, one side for Glim, Van and me, and a lovely room for Bralina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat chatting in the sitting room attached to Bralina's quarters, which was connected our room via a wooden door with locks on both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What good luck, eh you guys?\" Glimmer said. \"I, for one, was so dreading another climb down this monstrous mountain. If I never set foot on it again, I will consider myself the luckiest elf on this planet. We all nodded, thinking how of that soldier had been injured, no doubt. I shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose we should all call it a night, huh?\" Bralina said, giving a big yawn. We've a long march ahead tomorrow. When haven't we lately. We all said, yes, and then we three headed off to our separate room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon all three of us were snoring loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing inside a cave, under a crystal ice palace, when we awoke, we had no way to gauge what time it was. The faux windows in our room were painted with both sunset and sunrise. When Bralina asked what time we thought it was, \"Take your pick,\" was the elf prince's answer as he pointed at one scene and then the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft knock sounded upon Bralina's door and she sprang up to answer it. It ws our host, chipper for whatever time of day it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my friends. I trust you all slept very well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and we thank you for your splendid hospitality,\" Prince Glimmer said. We all murmured our assent to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come,\" Chalin said in his usual demanding way. \"I have laid out breakfast, and Then I want to show you just a few of my wonders before I leave this place forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought his eyes looked rather sad at this, but he soon enough gave us a smile to banish it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonders! Wonders! Wonders! screamed Van's crow. He and Van had both been so silent, sometimes we forgot they were about.</span></div></div>",

He smiled broadly and rubbed his large hands together in anticipation of reactions. \"Oh! You're just going to love the first, and it's what I will miss most of all, once I have to go down and never return, he said,his face grew sad, but only for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe asked us to bring along everything we intended to take down the mountain as we would be descending and not returning to this level. Everyone gathered their things, and twenty four of us marched single filed down the now wooden staircase, for we had left the ice behind. Soon, we left the wooden stairs behind as well, for they became the granite of the walls and cavern, and here they were steeper and much narrower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far down the mountain are we right now?\" Glimmer asked Chalin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say about one-third, maybe a little less,\" he said. \"But, here,\" he said, pausing on a wide landing that had been carved out of the rock, \"This is the room I am most proud of. When he opened a tall wooden door, a thunderous rushing of water met our ears. He stepped in, and the four of us followed, and then the soldiers. We were in another natural cavern, but by far the largest we'd been in yet. A humongous double waterfall roared down from somewhere very high up. The whole room from top to bottom was hung with climbing vines, sporting huge tropical flowers, normally only seen in the very far south, certainly never in the 'North of the North'! Bushes, ferns and many colored grasses were arranged to be pleasing to the eye. Cobbled paths led one down to a lake, where benches and may brightly lit lanterns were hung from the vines that criss-crossed everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowzers! This is really something!\" I told Chalin, and he smiled his biggest smile yet, his green yes glittering just like like the elf's always did when he smiled. \"I can certainly see why you said this room was your favorite! It's the best room I've ever seen, anywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight filtered in and made the waters sparkle. They were teal, just a the water of the 'Hidden Lake had been in the middle of 'Lackamoor Swamp'! \"Beautiful!\" I told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! See! Swans!\" Van said, and sure enough a pair of rare black swans were floating in the middle of the beautiful teal lake. They were harder to spot than their white brothers and sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lt's have a farewell feast on this little beach!\" Bralina said,and with that she kicked off her boots and socks, and walked barefoot through the sand. She rolled up her breeches and strode through the teal water. \"Ooh! It's just right! A touch cool! Oh, I would so love a swim!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Chalin smiled as he pointed to the far wall of the cavern, where tall narrow little multi-colored tents had been set up. They looked like traveling carnival tents, only much smaller. \"Those are changing tents, and inside you will find an assortment of bathing suits. I always thought I might entertain a few guests, though it never happened until now. The red ten ts have male suits, the blue, girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Bralina had made her way to a blue one and disappeared inside, all twenty three of us decided to  join in on her idea of a swim.  We had a splendid time, playing with the brightly colored air balls Chalin provided, and even a disk that flew through the air, which he called an air slider. We must have been at it for hours when he called us out of the water. We all tromped out and stood dripping on the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it time you water babies dried off and changed back into your travelling gear, for we should have a light lunch, then be on our way. I've two more things to show you on our way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralina and Van, using my magic pack, soon had a feast fit for any king all spread out on two picnic table Chalin had placed off to the right of the beach. We had fresh bread sandwiches pile high with ham, roast beef, and thinly sliced turkey, cheeses, and chips and bowls of fresh berries with sweet cream on top, cherry tarts, of course, Balina's favorite, and loads of lemonade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe ate so much food, that Chalin relented and said we should all rest for an hour. Which we gladly did. Then we all packed everything up, made sure we had all we wanted to bring down the mountain, then we once again followed our host down more spiraling stone steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time w only went down a few steps before Chalin announced we were at the next of his wonders. He opened the door, and he told us all to place our hand on the shoulder of the one in front, and like that we all marched, single file into a pitch black room. Then! He must have done something magical for our eyes were hit with a barrage of colored lights! They danced up the walls and ceiling of the cavern in a spectacular light show. Some even spun free in whirling tornadoes of light. Bralina and Van both squealed and ran and jumped in one. They immediately burst apart, spreading dots of color everywhere. It was mind blowing to say the least! We stayed there for quite some time, thinking we'd never ever see such a grand explosion of color and light if we all lived to be a hundred. \"Wowzers! I said as we exited that wonder of a room. <i>Chalin's certainly got a fantastic imagination!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gathered on the large landing outside the room's door, congratulating Chalin on his awesome display. Never many said, had they seen anything to rival that! \"Good. Very good,\" Van told him, giving him a bear hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bird, of course, screamed, \"Good! Good! Good!\"  And we all laughed, feeling giddy from the dancing lights.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

None-the-less, Chalin assured us all as we descended a long way down this time, \"You will love and be very, very surprised at my next creation!\" He seemed so pleased that we all enjoyed each one. I tried to think what the next wonder could be, but I could not think of a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe must have went down a good hour's worth of the stone steps, before the large man stopped on another of the wide landings. <i>Man, did Chalin carve all these steps by himself? Well, he certainly had time, so I guess he could have. Maybe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I am afraid this one is the last you will see,\" he sounded pitiful, and we all sighed, and told him how much we appreciated what all he's already let us see. He opened another of the same kind of doors all the rooms had had. \"Now, it may seem a bit dangerous, but trust Chalin, it is not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I did not know if I though that could be true, for he led us all out onto a very long, very, very narrow walkway, with no railings! Below the ground was so far off, I could not tell exactly what was on the bottom, but I feared finding out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the big man lept from the ledge, free falling from our site! Gasps of all kinds went  up! We all looked over, me getting a big dose of my vertigo, and having to squeeze my eyes tight and wait for my heart to slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mighty gust of wind blew up, ruffling our clothes and tossing our hair about our heads, and there..., and there was Chalin! Floating on the air! A big grin of self amusement strode across his wide, handsome face. Some of us said, what a dirty trick this was, but he just continued to smile, encouraging us to give it a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo way was I jumping off this high ledge, but then, I was free falling, my stomach somewhere up near my throat. I screamed like a little girl and scrunched my eyes closed again. Then, just as suddenly, I stopped, and I flt my body being pushed back up, strong currents of air buffeted all around me. When I opened one eye, there was Chalin and the ledge just to my right. He belly laughed, then did a summer salt in mid air. Then, to everyone's amazement , he swam. That's right! He swam right through the air, making exaggerated motions as if he were breast stroking through the water. He flipped on his wide back, kicking his legs like a frog, and stroking backwards, just as pretty as you please, as if people swam on air all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it, everyone! Come on! When will you ever have this chance again?\" he asked as he made large circles around the huge cavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon every single one of us twenty four had joined in. Man what a sight it must have been had someone wandered in. People dong all kinds of stunts, pushing each other, laughing! OH! Man! it was a wild time, and one none of us will ever forget, no, not ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan's crow was the only one with any sense left, and it sat perched on the edge of the narrow ledge and screamed at us, \"Man! Man! Man!\", and we all laughed at the smart bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of, after about two hours of this silly behavior, followed Chalin back to the ledge by air swimming over. we grasped the edge of it and hauled ourselves on to solid ground. My legs felt rather odd at first, a bit wobbly and wanting to buckle. This made us all appear slightly well into our cups, and we all found this outrageously funny. We left the magical room, laughing like drunken sailors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, we pounded Chalin on his wide back, saying over and over how wonderful that experience had been. How we'd never expected anything like that. How none of us could choose which room had been our favorite, having liked each equally as much as the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only wonder at the ones we did not get to see, Chalin,\" Glimmer said. His green elf eyes were really dancing now. \"Oh, that we could stay and see them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but we must all remember the urgency with which you all came here for. To halt the 'Bad',\" he said, and a bit of his merriment left his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Yes, you are right, good Chalin,\" the elf prince said. \"Thank you for reminding us of our task. How far down the mountain do you estimate we are now?\" Glim asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well past the half way point by now,\" Chalin answered. \"We will be out of it altogether before nightfall, and we should be able to set up a camp in the pines that are scattered about the base. There are many rock shelters to hide us from rain and wind too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"We made camp in one of those before we ascended the mountain that first day. It had a roof overhang that kept the rain from getting us all soaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rain! Rain ! Rain! screamed Van's crow. The noisy bird flew down the stairwell and was lost to our sight, as we continued to spiral down and down and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two hours of going down, Chalin called another halt, and we all sat on one of the wide landings, sipping water and eating biscuits spread with jam. Van's crow reappeared and the little fellow spread an array of mixed nuts on the granite floor. The crow gobbled them up, swallowing them down his throat whole, shaking his feathers in obvious thanks. He made cooing noises at our friend. \"Van Nan. Van.\" it said. <i> I swear that bird loves him.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I saw a tear well up in the big man's eye for his beloved mountain that had been his home for these past two centuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlim put a hand on his shoulder and said, \"Chalin, never give up hope that there could be a way to return here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I have told you, once is use the artifact,\" and at this he this he tapped a large pocket in his coat, \"I will begin to lose the magic that has sustained me all these many years, my friend.\" He looked so very sad at this that all of us sighed, and many reached out to console him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still,\" and here the elf's glittering green eyes narrowed, and he fixed them on Chalin, \"Many times has my Father told me that there be a way in everything. I, Prince Glimmervan, pledge my whole heart in finding a way back for you, a way for you, good Chalin, to live one normal life span, if you will. Much have you served others, please allow me to serve you now in such a way as I can.\" Now the elf prince smiled, and gave the big man a low bow, sweeping his hand to the side with a flourish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My heart is filled to overflowing with your kind words an proclamations, my friend,\" and the big man bowed low in return to Prince Glimmervan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe rested for over an hour in the large cavern. It was cool and I could smell pine sap, so I knew he was right in how far down we'd come inside the mountain. Up on a ledge, I saw the crow sitting, he stared down at me with his beady black eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyrl! Tyrl! Tyrl!\" he called down to me. I nodded as if he were just another of our band of travelers. <i>That bird is too smart by half!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was anxious to be out of the confines of the mountain, to breathe in fresh air, to see that sky, to be free. So it was with a much brisker pace that we made our way across that long cavern, down through the narrow tunnel, and then we ran from the exit, whooping an hollering!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe found ourselves in the same kind of terrain as when we'd first went into the mountains, only going up the outside, rather than down the inside. Thin pairings of mid-size pines marched up the gradual slopes, and that is where we'd come out. We made but a short descent to the level ground below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired as heck, our one goal now was to find decent shelter for the night. It was Van who ended up finding the perfect spot, and that was due to his bird calling him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! Here! Here! it had called, and Van went running, his little legs pumping fast. It was funny to see him running so fast, but not gaining all that much ground. The crow sat on an overhang of granite, much like the one we'd all camped under. Here, too, it had a natural wall that had formed in a circle, with one opening in front, and one in back. It  would hold back the winds, and more importantly any rain, for we notice the dark clouds gathering overhead as we'd exited the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come. All come!\" the little fellow had called to us, and the twenty four of us had marched over, dropping our gear in the enclosure. No one felt like eating much, so we munched on fruit and nuts, then everyone said they were tired. Bed rolls were spread out in the spacious space, and soon, all but the night guards were sleeping soundly. Van's bird perched on a ow ledge up near the roof, watching over all. <i>He's probably the best guard of all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning dawned, crisp and cool with a hint of smoke hanging in the air, though our own two small campfires had died out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Tryl,\" both Glimmer and Chalin greeted me. Many of the soldiers were already up, enjoying coffee. Someone handed me a steaming mug, and I accepted it with thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smell that?\" I asked them, looking off to the southeast, where a column of smoke rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Glim said. \"I am concerned it is very close to where the 'Secret Forest' lies. He put his hand up to shield the bright morning sun, and said, \"Father will know if it is. He has many scouts who watch for forest fires. They have an elaborate plan in place, and water can be pumped from one of the many streams that run through our forest.} Still, his face was pulled down with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure it will be alright. Let us hope this wind will turn and move away from the fire. Perhaps we should break company with the soldiers and cut a path straight through to your home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would that we could, Tyrl, but by doing that, I am afraid we would lose even more time than going by the King's road, and the many game trails and meadows we crossed before. The wood grows very dense as the crow flies, and we would be marching up and down over those teats we found ourselves on that one time. Remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" I told the elf prince, and my legs began to ache even thinking about that horrible trek we'd made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe drank up our coffee, rolled up our bed rolls, and made sure every ember was out on our two fires. With all haste we marched briskly to exit the 'North of the North', making for the 'King's Road'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"South! South! South!\" screamed the too smart crow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By the time we made the North Gate, we were dragging our feet as though mired in quicksand. The gatekeeper saw the men-at-arms helms with the red and white plumes and had the gate opened before we even got there. We stumble through and collapsed in the cobblestone courtyard, dropping everything we'd toted for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arg!\" I complained. \"My feet feel as if they've been worn down to nubs, throbbing nubs I said, pulling off my hiking boots. I rubbed them with my thumbs, massaging the soreness from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear ya, Tyrl.\" Bralina said, copying me. She gave me one of her twinkling smiles that reached her pretty blues eyes, and the soreness was soon forgotten. <i>I thinks you loves that little wench, eh, Tyrl?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Valaspar's scouts must have reported us marching, for we had no sooner arrived than he was standing in the courtyard, congratulating his men and then coming over to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Glimmervan, I am so glad to see you, Tryl, Bralina and Van have all arrived back safely!\" He gave us each a hug in turn. \"You are a son a king may be proud of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you good King,\" You and I both\" he told the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come! You must all need a good rest, before you set out in the morning. You've no doubt seen the smoke, and you must be fearing for the 'Secret Forest', though I personally sent scouts that way, and they say they think it has skirted your home forest. Let us hope it is so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let us how, Your Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went in the small door n the wide stone wall of the inner keep, following the King down the long hall. At the intersection of two hall, he left us, and a servant took us along to our same old chambers, where we deposited our things and climbed into bed still wearing our hiking outfits. We didn't care,and we were snoring i minutes. The crow sitting on the bed post and watching over us. We never heard him say, \"Sleep. Sleep. Sleep, young friends.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Without your friendship to me, I would be facing death instead of him; he wasn't as wise as he thought when he chose me to take his place temporarily; now it will be all the days he had hoped to live; and, Lady Myst and I will be good leaders for the nation of Tartaryen and our heirs will continue to lead the nation in positive ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty, I am grateful to know that once again Tartaryen will be a good nation where the people are protected and are given the right to live their lives without fear.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people crowded the path to be taken by their new king before coronation at the Palace steps.  They were jubilant and hopeful as they sang songs and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new king walked with his troupe, waved and spoke to the people and when he reached the steps, he turned and bowed to his people before sitting in the golden chair waiting for him.  As the Bishop placed the crown on his head, tears filled his eyes; he knew many had died in recent days to cleanse the kingdom of vilians who  had followed the old king before he had disappeared.  \"Your Majesty, the kingdom is cleansed; only peaceful people will honor your days and enjoy the goodness of your reign.  Be true to them and the Kingdom of Tartaryen will prosper.\"  Then he turned to the crowd, \"Honor your new king.  Be true to him and this kingdom will prosper.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd bowed as one then a voice shouted as they stood again, \"Long live the King\" and the crowd joined in the shout.  It was clear to the new king as his heart was blessed, \"I will serve these people with my heart and seek only peace among them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 641 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The people began to gather out in the square, and I wrapped Joshua in a blanket and brought him out to hear the announcement.  Most were groggily finding their way through the streets, some of the old men still fighting off their drunkenness.  I, however, had already been awake.  A hush fell over the crowd as the vizier stepped out onto the royal balcony.  He unrolled a scroll, an unnecessary but formal action.<br>\r\n\"Ahem.  Last night, whilst a storm covered the moon, a vile assassin snuck into our palace, disabling the king's guards.  He managed to get into the king's bedroom and mortally wound him.  The king is dead.  In his final moments, King Tansigero named his replacement, and we have obliged.  Bow before your new king, Tyrl Kevander.  The king is dead; long live the king!\"<br>\r\nA shy-looking gentleman with a thick brown mustache and the kingly garments stepped onto the balcony, at which point the entire square knelt.<br>\r\n\"Long live the king!\" echoed through the square a thousand times.  I knelt with them, but this was not out of respect for King Kevander.  Things had not gone according to plan, and there was going to be hell to pay.  The shy new king raised his hands for the people to stop professing their love.  As silence fell once again, he cleared his throat.<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your love and respect.  I am quite honored and, honestly, quite surprised at this turn of events.  But, I vow to be a good king, to lead you through these troubling times, and bring our kingdom to victory against Bazallyn!\"<br>\r\nThe crowd erupted into cheers.  I cheered with them, but I could feel panic growing in my chest.  Joshua began to cry, giving me a wonderful excuse to leave the square.  I walked trembling back to my cottage.  Once inside, I hurriedly locked the door and bolted the shutters.<br>\r\n\"Reesa, how good to see you!\"<br>\r\nI yelped and swung around.  I was too late.  Midal Asafan sat lounging in my rocking chair.  \"My lord, you startled me.\"<br>\r\nAsafan let out a chuckle.  \"Apologies, I wouldn't want you to drop the baby.  How old is he now?\"<br>\r\n\"Seven months.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Asafan stood and walked over to me.  \"May I?\"<br>\r\nI hesitated, but then quickly remembered that Asafan does not like to be denied.  Reluctantly I relinquished Joshua to him.  \"Hello there,\" Asafan's voice took on a disgustingly sweet sound.  He cooed at the baby, who giggled, having forgotten what had made him cry moments earlier.<br>\r\n\"You seem like a very strong boy.  Are you going to be an assassin like mother dearest?  Here's a little something to get you started.\"<br>\r\nAsafan pulled out a tiny dagger, more of a dart than anything.  He placed it in Joshua's hands, who gripped it and shook it like a rattle.  He handed Joshua back to me.  I wanted to pry the dagger from his hands but I knew Asafan would react negatively.<br>\r\n\"You have made errors, Reesa.\"<br>\r\n\"I am aware.\"<br>\r\n\"The king was not to be left alive long enough to elect a successor.  Then it would've gone to our benefactor.  But he chose that no name Kevander, and it is entirely your fault.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry doesn't change anything.  Fix it.\"<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  But one thing is certain.  You will find a way to get Frago Anaximander on that throne, or we will be short a young assassin.\"<br>\r\nAsafan eyed the baby one final time and stepped out the door, leaving me with my thoughts and my child, who might not be alive much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n617 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

How was she to change fate? She was sure the King was dead when she slipped out of the castle. \"Who had claimed Tryl to be the chosen? Who set this untrained boy to be king?\"<br>\r\nJoshua began to squirm and fuss. She hummed a melody to quiet him and laid him in his bed.<br>\r\nSoft tapping at the door interrupted her thoughts and she stood to one side. \"Who is it?\"<br>\r\n\"Tanya.\"<br>\r\nReesa sighed and lifted the latch. The door flew open and the young girl flew into the room falling on the rough floor, tears streamed down her dirty face.<br>\r\nTwo giant entered and slammed the door behind them.<br>\r\n\"What were you doing at the castle yesterday?\" One of the Kings Guards demanded.<br>\r\n\"Castle? I was not at the castle yesterday. My son is ill and I need to keep him away from others as he is contagious.\"<br>\r\n\"Whats wrong with him?\" The smaller guard asked, moving closer to the door.<br>\r\n\"Ignore her. I have a passel of children and they're always sick with something. Don't lie. My sources say you were in the castle near the time the King became ill and died.\"<br>\r\n\"I wasn't there. You must have seen someone else. I had no reason to go the castle. The King has not called for me for over a month. I fear he had found some reason to be angry with me, but I have done nothing.\"<br>\r\nThe younger man tried to reach the handle of the door blocked by his superior. \"You are a liar!\" The last words were followed by the man's backhand slap. Reese wasn't expecting this and caught off guard her head spun as she fell across Tanya's legs.<br>\r\n\"Now you will tell me what poison you gave the king!\"<br>\r\n\"I tell you I wasn't there.\" Reesa's voice was muffled as she held her hand to her cheek.<br>\r\nThe large guard jerked her to her feet. \"You will come with me to the Captain of the Guard.\"<br>\r\nReesa pulled against him. \"Please believe me, I have been here with my sick child. I can't go with you. He'll be awake soon and want to feed.\"<br>\r\n\"Let him go hungry for a little while. Its good for him. He won't be such a momma's boy.\" The guards laughed and pulled Reesa from the house.<br>\r\n\"Tanya, get Getta, she will take Joshua.\"<br>\r\nThe girl nodded.<br>\r\nThe people stared at the two men marching a woman down the streets. When the women peeked out to see who it was there were some who laughed and others who just hid their face and turned away. No one stepped forward to help her.<br>\r\nAt the castle, Reesa was thrust into the room where the Captain of the Guard held audience. He waved the men to leave them alone and fear began to slowly thicken her veins. She said nothing, but bowed her head so she could see where his feet took him.<br>\r\n\"Welcome little Reesa. Since the King is dead, May he rest in peace, you are no longer under his care. In fact you are no longer needed around here. You did your job well. Not for our side, but we managed to make that mistake work for us.\"<br>\r\nShe raised her head slightly and eyed him.<br>\r\nHe saw her reaction. \"Yes, sweetheart, we know what Asafan had you do. The king knew there was a plot also. He was so besotted with you he didn't care. I'm not so stupid. I can make things happen. I know Asafan visited you. What does he want?\"<br>\r\nReesa pressed her lips together and stared hard at the point where the Captain stood. His boots moved bringing the man so close her head touched his chest.<br>\r\nHis gloved fist moved to her chest and up to her chin. His fist pushed against her <br>\r\nchin forcing it up and her gaze to meet his.<br>\r\n\"You don't have a choice any more. You are now mine. I'm in charge now and you will do what I say. From now on I want to hear every word of every meeting you have with Asafan and Frago. I will feed you the information you are to give them. Do you understand?\" His voice softened and his breath caressed her cheek. \"Do I hear a yes, sir?\" Fingers pinched her chin but she wouldn't open her mouth to speak.<br>\r\n\"You want to play hard to get?\" His free hand gripped her breast and she groaned aloud in pain, her mouth opening and his smashing hers filling it with his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled into her home immediately looking for Joshua. His crying brought her milk down and she held the globes searching for relief.<br>\r\nGretta slipped through the hidden door and laid the boy against his mother. \"He wouldn't take from me. Are you alright?\"<br>\r\nRessa shook her head.<br>\r\n\"Someone is waiting to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 844 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Then, one day, the boy's father died.  The boy was heartbroken.  But, never fear, the king adopted him.  As the boy became a man, he began to realize his potential.  He was in a position to be in great power.  The only thing standing in his way were his playmates.<br>\r\nThat was an easy fix.  One hunting accident and one poisoned goblet later, there was only one man waiting anxiously for the throne.<br>\r\nFrago Anaximander.<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nI was really trying to cry.  I knew there was a part of me that loved the old king, even though I had ordered his assassination.  But as I gazed into the casket on the dais, I could only feel one emotion.<br>\r\nAnger.<br>\r\nThis man, who had adopted me at age eleven, loved me as his own son, had not declared me king!  Of course, I knew this was coming.  This was why I had ordered his assassination in the first place.  But perhaps my secret meetings aroused too much suspicion, or perhaps the assassins had sold me out for higher pay.<br>\r\nThe assassins.  There was another group of people to blame for this.  I had sent clear instructions:  unfit to name a successor.  And what did they do?  Leave him alive long enough to declare that no name Tyrl as the king!<br>\r\nSpeak of the devil, here approaches Tyrl now.  He looks so unseemly in his kingly vestments.<br>\r\n\"Frago, I am deeply sorry for your loss.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you.  The pain of losing one father was enough, two fathers is too much to bear.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, you may live in the castle for as long as you need.  I'm sure you have some inheritance somewhere, but I know transitions can be difficult whilst grieving a loss.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my liege.\"<br>\r\nI kissed his hand and walked away, barely containing my rage.  I stalked out of the hall, done with my viewing of the king, although I'm sure everyone thought I could not bear the sight of my dead adopted father.  I retreated to my room in the southern tower.  Within moments, a knocking on my window came.  I opened it.<br>\r\n\"Asafan.  You have failed me.\"<br>\r\nThe assassin bowed before me.  \"I apologize, my lord.  The assassin sent failed her job.\"<br>\r\n\"Her?\"<br>\r\n\"One of our best, before she gave birth.\"<br>\r\n\"An assassin as a mother?  The poor child.\"<br>\r\n\"What's more, no father to speak of.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" I let loose a devious grin, \"Nasty, are we?\"<br>\r\n\"I have my suspicions on who it is but she will not say.\"<br>\r\n\"And has she been punished?\"<br>\r\n\"I have told her to fix it.  I don't know how she plans to do so, but her infant's life hangs in the balance so I imagine she'll work out something.\"<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" I smiled.  \"In the meantime.\"<br>\r\nI withdrew a dagger from my robe and stabbed the assassin in the stomach.  He collapsed, clutching his belly.<br>\r\n\"I do apologize, but there must be someone to distract the guard from this mother assassin.  What was her name?\"<br>\r\nAsafan refused to answer.  I kicked him and he winced.  \"The name, or I kick again.\"<br>\r\n\"R... Reesa Hav... Havensporth.\"<br>\r\n\"Reesa Havensporth.  I will have to send someone to pay her a visit.  Until then...

I leaned in for a closer look.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t recognize the symbol, my lord.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNor would you, it is beyond your time.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not that much older than me, my lord.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOld enough\u2026\u201d he said, looking into an imaginary distance.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever heard of Lilyana Baroo?\u201d<br>\r\nI drew back.  \u201cThe witch?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA braja, actually. The last of her kind.  You know, our people used to worship brajas, back in the day.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIn the dark ages?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, the dark ages.  Brajas were slightly more than human, slightly less than angel.  We feared their powers, and submitted to them.  But brajas, by nature, are darker than pure humans.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is why they must be destroyed with fire or purified water.  Any weapon not of pure light would not work.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and so when they became too oppressive, we turned on them, and hunted them down.  Lilyana hid well for many years, but my stepfather ferreted her out.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI do not understand why this is pertinent.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBecause, at the stake, Lilyana was defiant.  She boasted.  I was but a boy of five, but I remember.  She calmly insisted that she had established a new organization of followers, a group of skilled assassins.  And that she had entrusted something very important to these followers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would that be?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA daughter.\u201d<br>\r\nI took a step back.  \u201cSo, another braja lives?\u201d<br>\r\nLord Anaximander stood up and walked over to his bookshelf.  \u201cAt the time, everyone believed this was the last desperate plea of a mad braja.  But, I have seen this symbol before.\u201d  He picked a book of the shelf and opened it.  He turned the painting towards me, and I squinted.<br>\r\nIt was a burning.  A witch burning.  The burning of Lilyana Baroo.  And around her neck, though miniscule, I could make out the same talisman that now dangled from Lord Anaximander\u2019s grasp.<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, it is true then.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Brer-Jak, it is true.  We now must assume that she was telling the truth.  Another braja lives among us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis is where you come in.  Deliver this talisman to Reesa Havensporth.  Say this, and this exactly \u2018Three days, regards from Lord Anaximander.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReesa Havensporth?  What has she to do with this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou know her then?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe and I were childhood friends.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 really?\u201d Lord Anaximander raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\nI nodded nervously.  \u201cYes, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDid you hear she recently gave birth?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, my lord.  I have not spoken to her in several years.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh.  She is an unwed mother.  Such a shame the poor child will never know it\u2019s father.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cKnowing Reesa, she\u2019s not one to let that type of thing happen.  I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll find a proper father for the child.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Anaximander smiled.<br>\r\n\u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does Reesa have to do with this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIn our line of work, Brer-Jak, it\u2019s not the best to ask questions.  However, I will ask you one in parting.  Perhaps it will answer your question.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy lord?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDid you ever meet Reesa\u2019s parents?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, my lord.\u201d<br>\r\nLord Anaximander smiled again.  \u201cInteresting.  Well, off you go.  Deliver this pendant to her as quick as you can.\u201d<br>\r\nI nodded, reached up, and took the pendant.  I excused myself, bowing quickly before I left.  This whole assassin/braja business was way too deep for me to dive into.  Although I felt as though I was being pulled in anyways.  Perhaps just delivering this pendant to Reesa would safely cut me out of the situation.<br>\r\nA small voice told me that wasn\u2019t true, but I hushed it and made my way through the village.  Reesa\u2019s cottage wasn\u2019t that far from the palace.  I desperately wanted to see her, and that baby.<br>\r\n\u201cGods above, please keep us from danger,\u201d I muttered.  I rounded the corner and approached Reesa\u2019s cottage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n702 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

The earth shook as he landed upright and advanced toward the fallen knight.  \"Oh you speaky speaky much ugly.  I KILL!\" shouted the giant and the knight thought, though not articulate, the great beast-man was likely capable of homicidal violence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Marvis struggled to rise, shoving his sword into the ground and levering himself up, but the giant was too quick.  He kicked at the man again and caught his foot on the swords sharp edge as he kicked again sending the sword, sir Marvis, and a great gout of blood hurtling through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAaaah,\" howled the giant, \"Sharp poker make much hurt my foot.  You hurt Org, nasty metal man.  Org smash, Org KILL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed and disarmed, sir Marvis lay stunned upon the ground while the giant held his wounded foot hopped around cursing, \"OOOooh, much blood much blood, ohhhh nasty metal man.  You die, You die, Org Kill!\" but instead of making good on his threats the giant jumped and howled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squire, my lance!\" cried Sir Marvis, and his faithful squire, Nobbits, ran forward with a great warlance in his hands despite keeping a wary eye on the monster.  In horror the brave lad saw that the beast-man had noticed his advance and was charging toward the knight struggling on the ground and they were likely to arrive at nearly the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man yelled a war cry and continued to carry the lance toward his master despite the giant's approach.  But it was impossible to look away from the charging monster and he ran headlong into his master with the long lance just at the monster reached down to trap them both.  So it was that both men held the lance as it caught the giant in the eye as it bent to seize them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lance drove deep, but there was little enough brain for its point to find.  Still, the giant howled unconsolably and drew the lance out, cast it away, and clamped its huge hands over its ruined eye.  \"AAAaaaaah, so paining much hurt to Org.  Much cruel.\"  Thus uttering the giant stumbled off bleeding from eye socket and foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobbits, ever faithful, dashed to retrieve the bloody sword that the giant's foot had sent flying with Sir Marvis.  The knight, much shaken, continued to try to gather himself.  \"There's a good man!  Aye, bring me that sword.\"  The young man handed the knight his sword and steadied him.  The kick seemed to have done the knight a grevious hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else might I do for you sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh lad, I fear the monster has done me damage, I feel all torn apart within me.  Still, I have enough sense and mindfulness to do my duty by you my boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobbits looked at the knight expectantly, ready to help anyway he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kneel good Nobbits,\" said the knight and the boy sank down before him.  The old knight was shaken and had to support himself for a moment on the young man's strong shoulders.  \"I should have liked to serve with you longer, to see you win your spurs, and aid you on your holy quest as a knight.  But I fear I can only give you this last thing afore I must needs go, to heaven or hell, I know not which.  This is in my power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing at the pain the knight straightened and stood tall.  \"Only a knight can make a knight, and so I dubb thee, Sir Nobbits, giant slayer.\"  Sir Marvis tapped Nobbits lightly first on one shoulder then the other.  \"Now rise, take what you can from me, I only ask that you bury me so I am not dishonored, fed upon by the beasts. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sir, you must not die.\" Nobbits cried as he struggled to his feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take my sword, take too the armor and the horses, you know their care and their use,\" the old knight whisper as he fell against Nobbits and clung to him in an embrace.  \"Do good, protect weak\" he mumbled and then crumpled.

She knew something that he didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls were an impenetrable dark grey stone, covered with moss and towered a good twenty feet above Laura and Steven. There was one entrance, a large path, with similar walls continuing in different paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, what's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A . . . A l-labyrinth, a cursed maze. . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way we are going in there! What do you mean cursed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This whole place is cursed, I can see it, I can sense it! This maze is a monster, it feeds on our souls, our deepest regrets. It will destroy both of us. That is only what I have been told, there's so much more that I can sense. . . \" Laura spoke grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how do you know all this?\" Steven moved in front of Laura, looking at her, questioningly, a mixture of emotions on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've all got our secrets, Steven, we've all got our secrets.\" Laura didn't meet Steven's eyes, not once, her head kept forward, her eyes set on the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If, <i>if</i>, what you say is true, then let's go back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura strongly gripped his hand as she whispered, \"We. Can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" Steven looked back at the forest and his knees faltered seeing the sight, a wall that never seemed to finish was there, it continued high in the sky, the mist hiding its true length. Steven stared again at Laura, how did she know? She never even looked back and she spoke as if she already knew this would happen.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>543 Words</b> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Her lips didn't move but her eyes, which had a glazed look in them, moved sideways to perhaps point at something. Or someone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven couldn't understand it but before he could ask her about, she started to move slowly towards something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it a door?\" he wondered, as he noticed a little black entrance door some twenty feet away. Laura had increased her pace considerably and was already nearing the door which almost shined when moon's silvery night hit it. Steven ran towards Laura so that both of them could enter the maze together, if they had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Laura, wait,\" Steven's yell to stop Laura cut through the misty silence which engulfed the place. Laura on the other hand, seemed to be stooping down to enter the maze, rather oblivious to the cries of Steven. <br>\r\nLaura might as well have been a zombie because she was surely behaving like one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven, breathing heavily with mouth open, kept running towards her but just before Steven could pull Laura back, she slid like a slithery long snake into the maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven stood at the entrance, hands clutching the side of his belly, badly panting for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What has gone into her?\" he wondered. Just then, he heard a wailing of a lady, the kind of which reaches to your heart, the guts and then slides a knife into them both. It was a horrendous cry, as if someone had died in a house.Or as if someone was suffering dearly and was on the death bed. Every now and then, the wailing would stop only for some murmuring to start in its place followed by another set of mourning.It was sickening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was she?\" he wondered and what he heard next answered it. He wished he didnt hear the answer because it made him feel sick to the stomach, <br>\r\n\"You let me die, Steven. Why?\" Steven shuddered as he realized whose voice was it. \"Why you left me to burn in the hell when you could have taken me with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mamma,\" Steven called out aloud recognizing the voice. He slid hastily into the tiny entrance, bruising his knees and elbows in the process. He banged his head against the tiny concrete piece too and started to bleed as a result. But he simply didn't care. It was as if some madness overtook him and all he wanted was to see his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mamma,\" he cried out again. He must have surely been out of his senses else he would have remembered that his mother had died some seven years ago. Some said she died when their cottage caught fire. Other said that somebody had set her on fire as she practiced witchcraft. Till date, he didn't know the real truth about it. All he knew was that he regretted it to this day and missed her the most in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(565 Words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

He couldn't believe it. How come his mother was here? It was not possible, there was no logic. She was dead, long ago, when he was six years old. It must be a trick. No matter how much Steven wanted to believe this was some kind of game, he couldn't come to it, it was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the shadows, he saw a figure emerging, a woman with a burnt face, her brown hair spread across her shoulders, those hollow eyes, he couldn't believe it, he didn't want to believe it. She wore the same clothes she did at the time of her death, a light pink maxi skirt with brown sandals and a kitchen apron which had mud smeared on it, it was his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it was because of you, Steven, you forced me to do it. It was you. . . \" She pointed at him, taking a step closer to him each time as he took a step back, shaking his head slowly, not believing the sight before him. He felt nauseous. He wanted to throw up. He was furious, he was sad, he was broken, he wanted to die, he wanted to scream at her, he wanted to hug her, there were so many things he wanted to do but he continued to move back as she came closer. Something about her was creepy but he couldn't put a finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you are my mother! MOTHER! You cannot blame your own child, for god's sake!\" For a long time he thought it was his fault but no, it was not, his mother had said those words before she died, 'It isn't your fault Steven, you are a child.\" and after reminding himself of this, he forgave himself after a few years but it was all coming back to him, the guilt, the pain, the crime he had done, he had killed her. \"NO!\" His mind screamed back at his own thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am blaming the person responsible for my death! I am not blaming my son, I have no son. My son died the day he killed me.\" A tear fell from her hollow eye as she continued to proceed. Her voice was shrilling and ear-piercing. What she said broke Steven's heart as he stopped and moved his hands in front of him, pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, - mama, please don't do this, you said it wasn't my fault, I AM your son, please. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I said it so that you could live but it is time you realised your mistake, you need to suffer, you need to feel what I felt. And you will do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know what happened. He was engulfed in flames as the same scenery replaced the one of the labyrinth's around him, he was in their old kitchen where the fire spread and consumed his mother. Only this time, it was the fire consuming him as his mother watched him burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't move, he wanted to scream to the top of his lungs but he couldn't, he felt tied even though there were no chains, he felt trapped whereas there were no cages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother crept closer to him and then sat on her knees taking his face in her bony hands, \"My child, I knew you would accept your punishment and your fate, do you feel the pain I did? His mind screamed out as the pain drove through his back and everywhere in his body. Every thought he just had became confused as the burning pain licked up his back like scorching fire. His throat gurgled as he struggled to breathe, spitting blood. His body was shaking he was sweating. Slowly breathing hard he dragged himself into a sitting position, but he couldn't escape the flames no matter what. He heard the word \"burn\" echo everywhere as he surrendered to the darkness, his soul departing from the world.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n681 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Steven couldn't see it from where he stood but beyond the point where the shadow stood, was a pit which was as deep as a lake, no water, but a reservoir of bubbling lava. Shadow didn't move back any further; waiting for Steven to come near it so that it could hug it, suck the soul out of it and take a form of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Mamma. Sorry for all what I did to you,\" said Steven moving within arm's length to the shadow and the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" scream of Laura echoed through the maze. The shadow snapped its head to look into the direction of the voice but Steven didn't. <br>\r\n\"Mamma,\" said Steven as he stretched out his arms to hug the shadow in front of her. Another footstep forward and his soul would be shadow's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Steven is mine,\" Laura's scream drill through Steven's ears. This time it hit him like a wave and his feet stopped mid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come son,\" the shadow pestered, trying to divert Steven's attention, \"come to your mother.\" \"One step more,\" it almost whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura?\" Steven finally spoke up. \"Where is she?\" he wondered aloud. \"Wh-What is this\" he shuddered and jumped back two steps as he finally felt the sensation of the bubbling heat from the pit. \"Where am I?\" he wondered for a brief while. The shadow had disappeared as if it were never there and what remained in its place was a vague recollection of it in Steven's mind. He might have stoked those memories again if it were not for another shrill cry from Laura who was fighting against her own demons - his fear of losing Steven to another woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura! Get away from there\" yelled Steven, who was coming to his senses now. He yelled again to warn Laura against moving another step because from where he stood, he could see that she too was standing on the edge of the pit which lead to the pit of the bubbling lava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven ran towards Laura who was standing some thirty feet away from her. <br>\r\n\"For God sake stop Laura,\" he shrieked yet again when he saw Laura raising her right feet forward, possibly trying to strangle the shadow she was fighting with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will kill her, Steven,\" she answered back, \"I will kill this bitch now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was still some five feet away when Laura lost her balance and ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(492 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She was going to kill that bitch, how dare she touch him, how dare she tried to lure him! If only Steven could see her real appearance, it wasn't his mother . . . but then this happened. The wind in her face made it impossible to breathe, she felt like she'd suffocate..Everything was black. She found herself falling in this darkness, hurtling to an invisible floor. A floor that would most likely kill her if she continued to fall at this speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air pushed against her face, she closed her eyes, preparing for the inevitable. Steven was too far, he couldn't save her. So many things ran through her mind, she shouldn't have kept <i>it</i> a secret, she should have told him that she was a witch. Even after she had it, the magic, she wasn't perfected in it, it would go wrong if she used her magic to protect herself, it would have hurt Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe braced herself and closed her eyes tightly, everything going numb around her. Just then, she felt strong grip on her waist, manly familiar hands, which pulled her closer to a body sharing the warmth, protection against the wind. It clicked in her mind, <i>\"Steven!\"</i>. She couldn't believe it, she wanted to but she couldn't. She was afraid to open his eyes and find herself falling, it was her mind fooling her. She wasn't going to open her eyes but then she heard him chuckle,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you can open your eyes, Laura.\" Her eyes went wide and she opened them at once staring at the beautiful, familiar face, that looked into her blue eyes, it left her breathless, all she could manage to say was,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, what kind of questions are you asking me?! Well, I don't know the how too, but the who, I am Steven, silly! Let's get us down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura held on tightly to Steven, her nails digging into the cloth of his shirt, no wait, it wasn't a shirt, it was flesh, bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's your shirt?!\" She had never held him this close, her heart was racing fast. Steven didn't reply, then she felt the wind stop, were they on ground?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Laura, we are . . . um, we are on the ground, you can leave me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at his face and below, shit, they were on the ground, her cheeks were red as she blushed and fidgeted. She looked at him to apologise but then her mouth hung open, her words trapped inside her mouth, the sight was unbelievable incredible and magnificent! Wings, beautiful, blackest as the colour can get. They shone lightly, their texture like the one she saw in the angle movies and which she always yearned to touch. She instinctively, ran a hand over them, she loved the smooth, fluffy texture. They were wings. . . Steven's wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven grinned and winked at her expression, \"You've got your secrets, I've got mine, love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I don't understand . . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's run away from here, then we will tell each other everything, deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing more she wanted than to run away from this place, without stopping to think, she spoke, \"Yes, deal.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>591 words</b> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Steven caught her in her arms and slowly carried them out of the Maze of the Fear and Regret. While in mid-air, Laura looked for the last time towards the white marbled floor of the maze and a shudder ran through her spine. She considered that if it were not for Steven, the marble floor could very well have been colored in shades of ghastly blood red. If it were not Steven! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Steven, what to say about the little trickster? To be honest, she had felt something was wrong \u2013 or, well right \u2013 with Steven right when they started their journey towards the magical realm. She remembered distinctly that on the first night when the darkness engulfed the forest, Steven \u201csomehow\u201d managed to capture hundreds of fireflies in a jar out of nowhere and used to light their path ahead. How could she have not guessed it; fireflies are known to be out in summers and not in these harsh wintery times, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis is no damn summer,\u201d she whispered as a fresh gush of cold stream of air hit her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then also remembered his smile as he had said \u201cThis is to keep you safe from the forest beasts and the shape-shifters.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did he know that shape shifters dwelled in this place when he had never been to the forest before. Now she could connect the dots perfectly. He was the Guardian Angel who protected the passersby of the travelers through the forest. She smiled looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were about to descend onto the outskirts of the maze when she caressed the silky wings of Steven. Steven with damn Wings! She could barely believe that this person who appeared as a coward at times to her was in fact a messenger of God, an Angel. She giggled to herself at how clumsily she had treated Steven sometimes. He deserved a sorry \u2013 a grand one; instead she threw a mock punch at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what is you secret, Madame Laura?\u201d he said, raising his left eyebrow playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine, nothing,\u201d she giggled like a school girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really? I too am a normal human being, then,\u201d Steven said and his wings folded back into his back and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed and kept looking at Steven for sometime. It was time to tell her part of the story now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you be able to handle what I say, Steven?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I handled you pretty well, didn\u2019t I? Your secret wouldn\u2019t be nearly as weighty, that is for sure,\u201d Steven flashed another of those toothy smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura drew a long breath and said \u2013 \u201cI am a Witch, Steven. The Witch of the Silvery Circles.\u201d<br>\r\nLaura didn\u2019t look at Steven because she didn\u2019t had it in her to look into his eyes. She knew that Steven had kept a secret from her too but that was something which couldn\u2019t have harmed anybody. Her secret on the other hand had the potential to create havoc. She cringed a little as she prepared herself to a barrage of questions. She knew another deep breath.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven looked at Laura for a moment, as if to consider whether to say something which was going on in his mind, but decided against it. He tilted his head again towards her for a moment but jerked it back straight, fluttered his golden wings and took a little hop in the air as if climbing a ladder and then set sail towards the sky. Laura was sure that there was something going on in Steven\u2019s mind, something which he wanted to say but couldn\u2019t. It pricked her because she believed that the revealing of her secret was what had given birth to this feeling of uneasiness between them. She winced a little and closed her eyes, to curse her ill judgment and jus then, she felt a gust of wind caress her face accompanied with sound of flapping. A little stunned, she opened her eyes and saw Steven with a smile on his face, flying some one arm away from her, hovering a feet above the ground. He had his hand outstretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what is this about, Steven?\u201d Laura said, still a bit stunned but she knew that it wasn\u2019t bad for sure because of that reassuring smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you come with me to do a quick recce of this place?\u201d Steven asked with those puppy eyes, head tilted to his right, possibly playfully. Laura\u2019s eyes twinkled and she nodded as she took his hand, gently tugged at those velvety wings of his and climbed onto his back with a little effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat took you so long to ask, huh? Grrr \u2026\u201d she kidded, mocking a growl. Steven\u2019s wings were now flapping those huge wings at near full pace, and as they both started to rise above the ground he said, \u201cI am scared of the witches, you know!\u201d suppressing his smile, somehow. Laura gnashed her teeth as she pinched him in his ribs and an \u201couch\u201d escaped Steven\u2019s lips. Soon, they both shared a moment of laughter which flooded away all the moments of uneasiness which had been building till then and washed away those doubts which were starting to burden Laura\u2019s mind. She was at peace now, and she closed her eyes and felt the fluttering breeze against her face. A tear escaped her eyes and fell onto Steven\u2019s wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo spitting \u2013 no spitting bad girl, \u201cSteven mocked her again, fully knowing that it was Laura\u2019s tears. He also understood what must have been going through her mind all this while because more or less he was facing the same demons in his mind. But it didn\u2019t matter what mattered was they had both slayed their dragons. They both continued with their naughty, playful ways under that bluest of skies as Steven went higher and higher till they were above the tallest trees of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, there,\u201d Steven pointed at a river stream which looked like a waving blue ribbon tied to a girl\u2019s pony from this height, \u201cwe should move by the side of the river stream till we reach that \u2013 oh, what is that? a building, yeah maybe \u2013 till we reach that structure we see there. Must have been a fort in older times, for sure,\u201d Laura nodded. It was the eyes of Steven and Laura - blessed with their own special and some common powers \u2013 which were able to see that tiny structure from afar. No mortal would have been able to even contemplate the kind of clarity with which they were seeing the fort which lay at a distance of more than forty miles from the spot where they were. But they were no mortal, after all they were special.<br>\r\nSteven didn\u2019t need to elaborate more and she understood the plan exactly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will reach that abandoned fort structure and then, do a quick recce again, right Steven? But what makes you think that the fort is an important \u2013 ok, I get it,\u201d she paused to complete herself, \u201cIn old times forts were built near rivers for two main purposes. The first one \u2013 the obvious one \u2013 was to get an unlimited water supply for all the soldiers and residents of the kingdom and second is to \u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Secure the fort, exactly, my thoughts\u201d Steven completed Laura\u2019s lines. She smiled. \u201cAnd if there is fort, be sure that there must be some secret or some quicker way to get out from these thickest of forests,\u201d said Steven smiling at the teamwork in the plan formation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, of course, else they wouldn\u2019t have lasted long, you know, and would have been easily susceptible to warfare tactics which would take the advantage of this thick forest cover,\u201d  Laura said, nodding. She  wished to reach that Fort as soon as she could; something about it intrigued her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Laura, the fact that there seems to be nothing in that fort is jarring my senses a little, you know! Do you see what I see?\u201d said Steven but Laura was so engrossed in the thought of reaching the fort and then getting out of this sickening forest that she moved her sideways and uttered \u201cNo\u201d without even considering Steven\u2019s question in her mind. Steven glanced at her and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see that this robust and magnificent structure would have been the most secure fortification in its time? It has the best of the nature\u2019s protection all around it \u2013 a gurgling violent river blocking it from one side, thickest of forests protecting it from other and those mountain ranges offering the protection from East to West. But still it succumbed, didn\u2019t it? I can\u2019t think of one reason that it must have failed to prosper and grow as a kingdom. Can you, Laura?\u201d Laura thought for a while but kept mum. Steven took it for a \u201cno\u201d. Such was the curiosity burning through his heart that he wanted to fly to that place, just now, but his wings were feeling heavier with every passing moment now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice had a sense of disappointment in it as he said,<br>\r\n\u201cWe will have to go down, Laura. Can\u2019t fly with a hippopotamus sitting on me,\u201d he joked hoping to get Laura\u2019s attention but no word came out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura?\u201d Steven checked with Laura, as he stretched his right hand to pinch her leg which touched the sides of his right wing to startle her. Laura didn\u2019t say a word but he did manage to get a heavy breathing out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Laura?\u201d Steven was now descending at a rapid speed because he wanted to check with Laura about what had happened. He didn\u2019t had to wait that long as he heard laura say \u2013 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, it was cursed by some Witch,\u201d she paused,\u201d a witch of Silvery circles.\u201d Steven felt warm tears falling on his back which burnt his heart. His mind echoed with endless possibilities which hammered it and they neared the ground at an even rapid pace than before. Steven didn\u2019t know what to say; his head threatened to explode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1169 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon in a matter of seconds, they stood standing face to face under big Oak tree. The shadow of it fell on Laura in such a way that it covered half of her body. Steven moved towards her and placed his bony palm around her warm cheeks.  He then, moved his right hand towards her hand, got hold of it and then squeezed her palm gently. Laura looked towards him, fighting a sad shade of red which threatened to float in her eyes. She was losing the battle against the tears, clearly. Steven wiped away a tear which was about to roll down her cheek. He said \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me Laura, what happened there, what is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn even stronger sob enveloped her and shook her body like that bunch of leaves which are struck with a fierce gust of wind.  She held his hand tight, as if preparing herself to say something to him, as she tried to suppress her sobs which were still overpowering her. Steven wiped away another torrent of tears flooding her cheeks, and then patted gently on her forehead before caressing it in a fatherly way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis Fort was of the great King Tusco,\u201d she paused to look at Steven, \u201cever heard his name?\u201d she barely managed to complete what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven\u2019s eyes narrowed at first unable to find any reference to the name in his mind but then they started to grow wider \u2013<br>\r\n\u201cTusco Hunt?\u201d his eyebrows curved upwards as he checked his guess with Laura, \u201cKing Tusco who ordered public execution of sixty-six practitioners of black magic some seven decades ago? That King Tusco Hunt aka \u2018The Witch Hunter\u2019?\u201d he checked again, unable to relate this collection of facts in his mind with the current situation. Laura nodded her head and said \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that King Tusco which history glorifies as \u201cThe Great Hunt\u201d,\u201d her eyes were swollen Red and they had a rage in them which Steven hadn\u2019t seen ever before. It was if someone had wronged her and she was having trouble forgiving that person. <br>\r\nSteven was seemingly confused with this rage which seemed misplaced to him. He said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut those Black Magic practitioners were wreaking havoc all over the kingdom and the forest,\u201d he nearly howled, \u201cI remember getting to know about them from Goddess Lyria \u2013 the protector of Tree Souls. The trees were dying all around and so were the animals in the forest. Would you call that fair, Laura?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Steven turned to look towards Laura he saw her shaking with anger. She yelled \u2013<br>\r\n\u201cForests of the Tree were a source of wood called as \u201cchavara\u201d \u2013 a kind of wood which turned blood red when sprinkled with the potion prepared by the black Magic Practitioners . Upon feeding it to patients who were infected with terminal diseases which had no cure back then, resulted in their magical recovery. Yes, the trees had to die but they were resulting in saved lives of people of that kingdom, Steven. Do you call that as unfair, Steven?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven stood there not able to comprehend the fact that which of these stories were true \u2013 the one which he got to know from Goddess Lyria or the one which Laura had just told him. His heart said Laura but before that his mind wanted to clarify more \u2013 <br>\r\n\u201cIf that was the case, Laura, and the magic was saving people of the kingdom,\u201d he took a deep breath to ensure he was not over agitated as he said it, \u201cthen why would he want something which would go against the welfare of his kingdom? He had always looked after his king- \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not his kingdom but just his back, Steven, this is all what he did,\u201d Laura thundered as she cut his statement in half. \u201dHe had plans to use the Black Magic for his own personal selfish gain. He had his eyes set on the realms  \u2013all Seven of them \u2013 and wanted to win over them. He knew of the might of the House\u2019s forces but he also knew that those realms had never ever dealt with something which had the power of Satan with it, something which they couldn\u2019t comprehend. He had plans to set three of the realms under the Black Magic\u2019s spell and then make them fight with each other. He knew that the noble houses would stand nowhere when confronted with the blackest of magic from the Darkest of Worlds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura paused for a moment to wipe away a stray tear which had rolled down her eyes, \u201cHe always tried to push the Magicians in his kingdom, each and every noble soul of them, to meet his selfish demands. But this group of black magic practitioners had set their mind to rid this world of the taboo of Black Magic. They wanted to make their black magic the most silvery, most radiant form of magic the world had ever seen and what better way to use it for fellow humans, they thought. They worked day in day out to cure each and every person who fell ill to that incurable infectious disease but still people died with increasing frequency. It startled each and everybody person in that kingdom because there was nothing to suggest that the disease could be born in that purest of environment of the Kingdom,\u201d she paused, as if living that time in her own mind. She continued - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is when leader of the Black Magicians in the kingdom insinuated King Hunto of spreading this disease himself \u2013 for hiw own selfish gains. Maddened by those accusations King Hunto ordered not only the executing the leader of the group but each and every member of that sixty-six magician clan. Next day, in front of a gathering of men and women of whom many had been treated by the sixty-six clan themselves, King Hunto executed all of them, one by one, laughing and enjoying every moment of it as he did it, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s voice had grown heavier as she fought back the lump building in her throat but it was proving to be near impossible now. <br>\r\nSteven listened intently to what all Laura had to say to him but one thing bothered him - \u201cBut why would the King do that to his own ki--\u201c But even before Steven could complete his question, his mind raced around to find an answer for him, \u201dThat is because,\u201d he said in a hushed tone, \u201che wanted to test the curse which he planned to inflict on the three realms. His large kingdom was his one big Guinea pig!\u201d Steven felt little prickly hair on the back of his neck stand up upon this revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hugged Laura tightly as she sobbed against her chest. He now understood the whole plan and the glorious misjudgment historians had committed in respect to King Hunto\u2019s credentials as a ruler. He wondered whether from now on he would be able to respect any kingdom, any person or any monument just because the history told so. As he considered the execution of the 66 Magicians who stood against the King he couldn\u2019t help but applaud not only their bravado but also their unflinching resolve to remove the stigma related to their names and their professions. He kissed Laura on her forehead and asked her in the most hushed of voices,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was that Grand Magician who stood against King Hunto and lifted the veil from his devilish plans?\u201d Steven asked, with anticipation drenching his shaking voice. He looked at Laura whose lips quivered as she tried to gather strength to say those words - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was my Grand Mother,\u201d she paused to regain breath, \u201cShe was who placed the curse on this kingdom just when the slaying sword spluttered her divine blood on the ill-deserving king and his devilish wishes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven\u2019s heart sank and beads of liquid formed in his eyes. He didn\u2019t know what to say. All he wanted was to hug Laura so tightly that their hearts may press and become one. And that is what he did as both of them shed tears sitting under the Grand Oak tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1361 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

It was if a magical orb of light \u2013 a meteorite - was making its way up towards the sky. Laura stood there under the Oak tree, looking at him, still as amazed as she was the first time she saw him fly. Maybe it was that smoothness of flapping muscular wings had something about it and it made it the spectacle which it was. He was now flying up and over the trees, away from the impressed eyes of Laura. As he flew further towards the Eastern part of the land, exactly opposite to the direction where the sun was, he saw something which intrigued his eyes and mind alike \u2013 stretches of mysterious shadows spread across acres of land but nothing in the view which was causing that shadow! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the name of God is that?\u201d he muttered as he flew closer for inspection. He cursed himself for not bringing Laura with him to share this wondrous moment which stood before his eyes. How happy and curious that little adventurer would have been, he wondered. As he zoomed closer to that place of shadows he found his eyes seeing a new shadow with every feet of flight he took. A moment before the shadow which looked the claw of a Giant Eagle now looked like the face of a Gargoyle. Another feet later, it changed its formation to form a shadow shaped like a structure which closely resembled a space-ship with a semicircular dome, complete with a set of windows. He couldn\u2019t believe a single shard of what he was seeing and his brain was getting fuzzier with every moment of flight towards those shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do they mean? What are they saying? Are they communicating to me?\u201d \u2013 these were some of the kind of questions which were plaguing his head now. Maybe it was a result of intense physical stress that he was placing his body into, he now felt as if his eyes were now turning bleary. There was a growing fog in the air around him and he was trying his best to fly on despite it but the worst part of it was that he was not sure whether it was real or was that his exhausted mind losing control of his body. It was a matter of mind over body now and he had seemingly started to lose it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(420 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven eyelids threatened to cover his eyes for a second and Steven lost his balance. He had a free-fall of about five feet when his senses returned to him. Surely, he wasn\u2019t this  fatigued \u2013 or was he? But that wasn\u2019t the question he wanted to waste his energy upon \u2013 he would rather think of how Laura would react when he would tell her that he had found a way out of the forest. How her black eyes would twinkle like little stars on a windy night, how she would hop like a kid on a springy toy ; and what to say of the gleaming grin of hers would make an appearance on her face washing away his fatigue, his every problem. He wished to bottle that energy in her smile sometimes so that he could resurrect broken spirits if he found one. Her smile had that power in her which could set things straight. Steven\u2019s mind dashed back to the present moment and he felt a lot better than he was feeling some moments ago. He smiled at the fact that she was still her pillar of support even when she was miles away from her \u2013 if this wasn\u2019t love he wasn\u2019t sure what was! He felt a surge of energy rushing through his body and his eyes which threatened to close any second before were now on like a set of flashlights. He moved around the fog which had been building around him and surprisingly it had now started to change colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now at least sure that it wasn\u2019t his mind which was conjuring up the fogginess but it was happening for real; though he wasn\u2019t really sure whether to be happy about it or to think who was behind the fog changing color and why was it happening at all. The fog currently purplish blue in color swirled around him like a mass of cotton. It was also getting increasingly thicker now with every minute which Steven flew through it. If he really squinted his eyes and used his more energy reserves he could still see the mysterious shadows which he had seen earlier. But energy reserves weren\u2019t his strong suit exactly at this moment of time. As the fog was getting heavier it was becoming more and more difficult for him to navigate through it; also, there was a distinct smell which was clouding his mind now \u2013 a smell of Jasmine, a whole garden of them. Such was the sweetness in the air because of the fragrance which laced every pore of the air that it was almost getting impossible to breath. However high the fragrance, it clouds the mind after a while and this is what was happening with Steven. He had to think of a way and he had to do it quick, before the fragrance consumed his mind in totality. <br>\r\nHe took a deep long breath which filled in more of fragranced air in his lungs and then closed his eyes to concentrate. Not surprisingly, what all he was seeing in his mind\u2019s eye was Jasmine \u2013 hundreds of them, gardens after garden of them. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t get his mind to go away from the Jasmines. He opened his eyes with a jerk and good thing he did else he would have missed an important event -  not that of changing of purplish blue haze to Sun orange- but someone\u2019s shadow which was now falling across the length of his body. He looked up instinctively only, a little shocked, but only found a hazy figure flying across the fog. The length of the figure was approximately equal to a fully grown horse but it\u2019s head was anything but horse since he could clearly see the horns on the shadow\u2019s head. He wanted to fly even upwards, to see this creature from up close but he feared that it might rob him of his precious little energy which was fueling his body. He thought for a little while, looked upwards and screamed \u2013<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you Shadow being,\u201d he yelled on top of his voice, not knowing a better name to call it with. He felt the Shadow being moving its head down as if looking towards him, \u201cWant to play a little game of cat and mouse?\u201d he yelled again, teasing him. He looked closely and he was sure now that the shadow had started to move towards him, stealthily but surely. And now, was the time to do something which was totally counter-intuitive; it was to let his body free fall through the fog.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let his body as lose as he could, and turned to look upwards at all times to keep a close eye on the Shadow being. For the first few seconds, he felt a terrible churn going on in his stomach as if he would vomit. This was something he had never felt in his life, not even tried doing it since it might have been too risky for his soft wings which were not accustomed to sudden jerks. But he felt like that this was his best chance of surviving and exploring the secrets of the shadow realm. Whirls and whirls of fog was passing him by as he was falling towards the ground at the pace of light, he closed his eyes for a second imagining what if the plan didn\u2019t work out but thankfully his negative stream of thought was interrupted by the image of the Shadow Being whose body frame became more and more visible as it approached his free falling body. It was a horse sized wasp and its eyes were redder than the stain of blood on its wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven knew that they were closer to ground now but just to be sure of it, he looked around with the corner of his left eye to see if it was the fog he saw or the fast approaching ground. His heart jumped up to his mouth as he saw the ground only some forty feet away. He tightened his body as he looked towards the monster wasp which was flying towards it. Steven had his plan and it was to let his wings take action at the last possible instant before hitting the ground and veer away from the path of the attacking Wasp. Little did he know that the Wasp had a plan too \u2013 a plan for which Steven wasn\u2019t prepared and the horror of the Wasp\u2019s plan showed in Steven\u2019s eyes as he noticed the Wasp disappearing, as if dissolving in thin air, as Steven\u2019s free flowing body approached the ground. Only six feet separated Steven, the invisible Wasp and the death. Steven took in a deep breath and tightened his wing muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1128 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With the hole in his wings getting bigger with every passing moment he still kept it fluttering with all his might. His head was spinning even more now and the blood in his wings threatened to reach his head. Just inches above the ground, Steven\u2019s free fall descent stopped and as soon as it did, he simply turned towards his left at the last possible instant to evade the incoming wasp. The wasp thudded onto the ground and its skull blew to smithereens. Steven laying there on his face, curled up into a small ball to evade the heavy organs and body parts rebounding from the collision towards him. The horse sized wasp\u2019s limbs lay near him, at some ten arms distance from him. Still in shock at this sudden turn of events, he lay there on his face and breathing from his mouth. He inhaled some dust along with it and it made him cough. Every coughing hurt not only his ribs which were strained like never before but also his torn apart wing. A wail escaped his lips as he lay there writhing in pain, tossing and turning to his sides. More than the pain, it was the trauma of having seen death from up close which had moved him. He knew it pretty well in his heart that those could have been his last moments and a stream of tear ran down his face as his mind replayed the possibility again in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay there, with his face looking skywards for some and time trying to regain his composure but the ghastly scene all around him \u2013 the shattered body of the monstrous wasp and the blood splattering \u2013 made it very difficult for him to concentrate. Also, there was the 'small' matter of his wing which felt like it a blade had been run through the center of it. He took deep breaths again, trying to get his mind away from it all she he slowly pushed himself to sit. His head was still spinning like a top as if had thudded into a rampaging bull. He looked around himself and saw nothing but a mountain range. It was a curious piece of land where he was sitting, there were mountains, no greenery, no animals, not even birds around. It was if this place was cursed by someone such was the eeriness it had in its spirits. The further he looked into the distance the more it he felt alone. In a way it was good because it made him forget his agony a little as he focused his mind to get out of here. And more importantly perhaps, he wanted to know what was the Wasp that almost killed him? Whose command was it following \u2013 if at all \u2013 or was it a land of monster wasps and that is why the place was barren? Could be, he considered the possibility. It was not a normal creature of course, because its every little feature right from those transparent wings to those little black eyes appeared as it had been carved by hand at first and then assemble haphazardly to resurrect a monster. Why would anybody do it and if they would do it then why would he be their target? There were so many things to consider and so many questions to answer but he had no answer yet, at this moment. All he knew was that he was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat should be good enough news, Steven, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he chuckled as he talked to himself, to encourage and take his mind away from it all. He stood now facing the forest as that was the only hope he had of meeting Laura. His eyes twinkled as he considered the possibility of this happening however improbable it looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould she be still waiting for me, there?\u201d he murmured as he squinted to look towards the sun, in order to gauge the time of the day. It was half past six nearly and he had left Laura somewhere around four pm.  That meant some two and a half hours had passed since he had left her. He thought whether if it was even a remote possibility of finding her there, still, because knowing Laura\u2019s restlessness he knew that she had trouble being in the same place for long times even in normal scenarios and this was no normal scenario \u2013 not by far. She must have moved already and he was almost hundred percent sure about it but what remained to be answered was where to go searching for her and that too with this state of his wing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut is it that bad, anyway?\u201d he thought to himself and hopped up towards the sky and let the fluttering of wings take over. Sadly, the wing simply couldn\u2019t do it as his latest attempt tore up another artery of his wing and he landed to the ground with a thud. Still lying on the ground, he cursed himself for not being strong enough to take even the gentlest of loads. He knew he wasn\u2019t right in doing it but this is all what he could do to use up the angst that had been building in him. The worst part of it was that he couldn\u2019t use his own magic because angels are not allowed to use it for their own good. He reasoned with himself that this wasn\u2019t for his own good and neither was he misusing it but for some reason his morals stood in between him and his magical cure. He looked around to see if he could find something which could stop the blood flow but what would he find in this land of King Barrenness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will walk to you, Laura, nothing could stop me from coming to you,\u201d he mumbled to himself as he started to walk towards the general direction of where the forest was. His legs were aching too and so was his body but he told himself that this was the time when the toughest of men survive. He would nose ahead and there were no ifs and buts regarding it. He walked with a limp towards the forest but his mind and will was still untouched. He knew that meeting Laura was not an option but a necessity. He imagined her rose like lips and those tender cheeks and was soon lost in her thoughts before he even knew. This helped him move with his mind not on pain for some distance but there was one more thing which was pulling his mind towards itself now and that was the smell of Jasmine. <br>\r\nHis feet stopped as a fresh gust of jasmine hit him. He had sensed this smell \u2013 in fact too much of it and it almost made him go giddy - when he was flying towards the shadowy lands, too. The curious thing about the smell was for miles and miles away there was not a single speck of shrub on the ground, or in the sky for that matter, leave alone something as exquisite as Jasmine but still the smell which was filling his nostril was so strong that it felt to him that a garland of Jasmine was somewhere near him. He was looking all around with those suspicion laced eyes when out of nowhere something appeared and landed around his neck.  <br>\r\nHe jumped up in the air a little, stunned that the though in his mind had proved true \u2013 it was a garland of Jasmine which was sitting prettily around his neck. As sweet as its smell was, it appeared to Steven like a cobra and his hands jerked the garland out of his neck and threw it some distance away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is there?\u201d Steven hollered, turning around his back searching for the one who had done this trick. \u201cWho is it?\u201d he exclaimed yet again when he couldn\u2019t see a single soul in miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe garland lying at some distance disappeared into thin air as Steven grew even alert. But whatever alertness he had couldn\u2019t prepare him for what happened next.  The garland which had disappeared away just a while ago appeared on his neck but with one more Jasmine garland. Steven threw both of the garlands away in frustration \u2013<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck. What is this happ-\u201c he couldn\u2019t say any further as he saw an outline taking form in thin air. He could tell via the large bun on the head and the curves in the body that it was a lady but what he couldn\u2019t tell from that outline was that how beautiful she was. The lady stood there now in front of him, with the most beautiful of eyes he had ever seen \u2013 the almond shaped hazel eyes which never go wrong. As his eyes moved towards her nose and then to her lips he felt a sense of euphoria building up in his body as if it would explode him. Her chin had a little mole onto the right which accentuated her beauty even more \u2013 if that was possible. Steven stood there speechless, with petals of flower still in his hands. He was dumbstruck and didn\u2019t know what to say apart from \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-who are y-you?\u201d It didn\u2019t feel right to say anything as it felt like disturbing the purity of the moment which was shared between them. The lady clothed in purple robe smiled \u2013 that slant smile which mystifies more than gladdens \u2013 and kept looking towards Steven. She moved even closer to Steven and only a few breaths separated them. She said \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am the Queen of Purple Haze,\u201d she breathed inwards and her eyes looked at Steven intently, as if trying to say something to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1692 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven tried to flutter his wings to set sail but he couldn\u2019t not because he was fatigued but it felt as if something had clutched them and was struggling to keep them at one place. He could see nothing but felt gentlest of hands touching his wings. He tried to break free of those hands which were trying to hold him but he was proving ineffective against those hands too. A hollowness in the soul had crept in him by now and no matter how hard he tried to shoo it away it kept coming back to him. He closed his eyes for the inevitable to happen seeing nothing but Laura\u2019s face in his eyes. No way he could survive this fall, he thought, which was true but what was also true was that no part of his body touched the ground as he was whisked away, when he was just a feet away from the ground. The sudden jerk away from the ground led him to open his eyes as his eyes struggled to make sense of what was happening. He was dragged for some time, in a way which prevented his body to be in contact of the ground almost as if he was levitating and moving horizontally. He felt a fragrance enter his nostrils now, a perfume which reminded him of Laura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it you, Laura?\u201d he exclaimed but instead saw a horse sized wasp taking form before him. His pace was slowing now and the wasp placed him with gentlest of motion down on the ground. Steven\u2019s heart was still racing ahead and a shadow of darkness was enveloping his eyes. He knew that the fact that he had survived was no less than a miracle particularly with the kind of helplessness which had crept up in him during those last seconds. He looked at the wasp which was standing in front of him. The wasp\u2019s eyes gleamed as it looked towards Steven, as if it was preening, and the wasp let out a little purr. Steven was startled by the purring sound from the wasp and obviously by the humongous size of a creature which looked something like a wasp but sized like a horse. What was this? Was it an animal sent from the heaven to look after him? He did not remember seeing an animal of this kind in heaven and neither had he heard of such a creature ever in his lifetime. It was as if somebody had made him, drawn him by hands. But who had the powers to do such a thing and more importantly what was the motive. He wasn\u2019t even sure that wasp had saved him because he remembered the hand which had gripped him during the free fall was surely a human hand \u2013 a lady\u2019s to be precise. He looked at the hooves of the wasp to double check his assumption. Wasp was fluttering its wing now, as if taking offense at the non-stop staring from Steven. Steven walked towards the wasp and said \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you friend,\u201d and planted a kiss on its forehead, \u201dthank you for saving my life.\u201d He caressed the wasp which reciprocated with a little neigh which almost startled Steven. The wasp had stopped its fluttering of the wings now but it sure looked intently in a direction diagonally opposite to where Steven was standing. Steven was a little surprised by wasp\u2019s sudden head movement; it was almost as if the wasp had seen somebody standing there, it was that sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomebody there, friend?\u201d Steven asked only to see that Wasp was now rotating his head slowly as if  it was tracing the movement of somebody. Steven grew a bit concerned and looked in the direction which wasp was staring at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked again and now Wasp stood there looking not at Steven but in Steven\u2019s direction \u2013 somebody standing behind him. Steven turned his head to find nobody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think you need a little break my dea-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoo,\u201d screamed a voice from behind and Steven almost fell to floor, stunned. He turned his head around to see a lady\u2019s hand appearing out of thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou \u2013\u201c and he ran towards the hands and clutched them like little kids do when they go out with their parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour observation skills are not that good for an angel, Mister,\u201d giggled the voice.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s not fair,\u201d Steven waved his finger at the figure standing in front of him, \u201cI asked if it was you, Laura, I guessed about you the first time I saw the \u2013\u201c Steven paused , not knowing what name to call the wasp with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWaspey, her name is Waspey,\u201d Laura told her smiling, as her whole body had appeared out of thin air now. She stood there with her <br>\r\nlovable naughty smile which made Steven go hug her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you do it, Laura?\u201d he gasped still hugging Laura, \u201cI could have died \u2013 No, I would have died,\u201d he said correcting himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she paused for an effect more than anything else, \u201dIt is a long story, Steven. But first you tell me that what made you do that stupid trick you did up there in the sky?\u201d Steven blushed a little but Laura kept rubbing it in, \u201cYou realized that I called out your name when I first saw you up there in the air but the next thing I knew was you were rushing head-wards to the beloved Mother Earth. You know that Mother Earth is not too gentle on things falling in her lap from a four hundred feet, right? What made you do it, silly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell,\u201d Steven paused searching for words which would make him feel less stupid than he was,\u201d let us say it was an error judgment on my part and - \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOf course it was, Steven,\u201d Laura cut him through even before he could say the rest of it, \u201cyou know you would have died if Wasp had not put in the last dive towards you just some five feet away from you. We were hoping for some kind of action from you but no, Mister Steven lay still as if a dead man sleeping in his corpse,\u201d Laura giggled. She clearly couldn\u2019t have enough of the fun.<br>\r\n\u201cErr- Hey did you see those shadows there up far when you were flying over me?\u201d Steven tried his best to think of a topic to divert the attention from his mistake and thankfully he had plenty of topics to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlying over you?\u201d Laura\u2019s eyebrows curved downwards to question him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, come on Laura. Don\u2019t fool me now. You have had enough fun, already, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d Steven smiled as he pinched <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s cheeks, naughtily. Laura still stood there thinking, as if considering something.<br>\r\nSteven laughed \u2013 \u201cSo you are saying you were not there, Laura? Now, come on I saw the outline of the horse sized wasp \u2013 I mean Waspey \u2013 too,\u201d he was a little embarrassed having said that but he continued when he saw no difference in reaction from Laura, \u201dI saw it across the fog, clearly, Laura don\u2019t kid me anymore, now.\u201d Steven said the last line more in hope than out of any real conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteven,\u201d Laura\u2019s voice had a seriousness which wasn\u2019t seen until that moment, \u201dwe saw you when you were some forty feet away from the ground and not before that. In fact, we had just reached here, crossing the purplish haze which came in the path of ours. We tore through it, miles and miles of it and that is when we saw you, some forty feet away from the ground,\u201d she kept looking at <br>\r\nSteven as he mind worked overtime to solve the mystery behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Steven exclaimed, \u201cso what was that thing which jumped towards me some four hundred feet up in the sky?\u201d Laura shrugged her shoulder, kept silent for a while and asked \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that your mind didn\u2019t imagine it all, Steven? Are you sure of that thing?\u201d Laura\u2019s ears wanted to hear unsure answer but she got none of it as Steven emphatically defended what he had seen floating in mid-air \u2013 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow come on Laura,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cDo we see a wasp this big in size every day?\u201d he said pointing towards Waspey, \u201cThat shadow was so clear, dear, I couldn\u2019t forget it. Those hooves, those wings, that streak of blood,\u201d he paused for a moment to search for the blood stain on Waspey and he couldn\u2019t see it. He turned towards Laura \u2013 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, does she have a blood stain, somewhere on her body? Anywhere and \u2013 oh my, I remember that the figure I saw in the air had 12 horns too and Waspey sure doesn\u2019t have it. What was that then?\u201d<br>\r\nLaura looked more disturbed than confused to him. She looked a bit rattled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter honey?\u201d Steven asked as he placed an arm on her shoulder, \u201cdon\u2019t worry we will find that thing, whatever it was and then \u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what that \u201cthing\u201d was, Steven,\u201d she looked towards Steven with a hint of fear floating in those eyes. Steven looked at her with his eyebrows curved upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1538 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven had been away for little over 15 minutes but Laura felt years pass by her. She need not worry about him yet, and she knew that, but there was something in her mind which kept telling her that it wasn\u2019t going to be that easy. Her legs were shaking from the nervousness which was gripping her body. A thin veil of sweat was starting to cover her face. She was getting restless and she was sensing it building since some 10 minutes ago. The rustle of the leaves wasn\u2019t helping her either and she felt as if somebody was watching her; she literally could feel eyes on herself. She took a deep long breath to calm herself down and pushed back her head, as if to inhale the calmness from the sky. She felt a little better and she did it again. She thought that is she could be at this place for another half an hour or so then it was a reasonable chance that Steven would return by then. But what to do of her restlessness was her only question? She looked around a neat enough area, somewhere where grass covering was sprouting over the dust so that she could probably sit down and relax. Some ten steps away to her left she saw a lush covering of grass on a raised little mound. The mound was not unnatural and she had seen many of such throughout the forests. So there was nothing to think twice about resting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked towards it with thought of Steven still making a passing by in her mind and plopped down on the grass which didn\u2019t feel any less than the leather sofas she had used in those homes of affluent people; only that it the current seat of hers was more cushy perhaps. She closed her eyes to feel the wind caressing her face, to hear what the wind sang in her ears and stretched her legs. There was a cocoon of calmness which she felt to be passing into with every passing second. It was so peaceful, full of bliss and not a single thought on her mind. She was now lying down on the ground, stretching out and yawned. Her eyes felt heavier and the breaths normal. She was now drifting into the dreams \u2013 not necessarily a bad thing considering the restlessness she was feeling a little while earlier. She had no thoughts yet but that was more because of her control over them; it wasn\u2019t natural yet. But slowly as the subconscious mind of hers took over, she began to drift into the past. Thoughts were now sneaking into her serene mind as she slept peacefully. What a journey this had been, she reminisced in her sleep with images of the curious light fellows which lightened their path on the first night together! Then she thought about those Dragons she and Steven had encountered and the chase for the egg that had ensued. She had a smile on her face in her sleep. The next in line was this forest itself, thickest of them all by far which they almost stumbled into. She remembered Steven\u2019s reaction when she had told him that they would have to go through this forest in order to reach their destination. Another smile sat on her lips as she relived it in her subconscious mind. Then, there was the turning point \u2013 hopefully the last of this trip \u2013 when they both revealed their darkest of secrets to each other; well, hers was way darker than his, at least. She relived the heart ache she felt at that moment and it almost broke her sleep. Surprises after surprises, revelation after revelation and nothing to prepare them for them! What more lay their way on their path to the ultimate glory, her mind was now taking full control. And what made her mind show her next in her deep sleep is what brought back the restlessness she had felt some thirty minutes before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her mind, she saw the scene when Steven flew to do a quick recce of the place. She saw those beautiful wings of his, his angel face, those daggers in her heart which she felt as he flew away. She then saw herself, looking skywards admiring his flight to the sky, exactly how she had done just minutes back. The mind didn\u2019t stop at it though, it then showed her Steven\u2019s path of flight. She saw what Steven saw- that tree cover all around him which he saw as he rose up, those expressions in his face when he saw the shadow for the first time \u2013 what was that? Her mind questioned itself in her sleep -  and then she saw the fog which started to build out of nowhere, enveloping Steven and clouding his mind. She also felt the tiredness of Stevens as he tried to almost will his way through the forest \u2013 those droopy eyes of his, those aching muscles in his rib and the heaviness in his wings, she felt it all. And then, she experienced that free fall of Steven, falling towards the ground, almost conscious. Forty feet to ground, thirty feet to ground, twenty feet and then before she could see anything more, she heard a scream. It was a scream of her own and it sprang her up from her deep sleep, with her hand covering her face in pure horror. Her eyes searched for Steven all around but he was nowhere to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe should have returned by now, shouldn\u2019t he?\u201d she murmured, \u201cCould it be that this nightmare was true?\u201d she was almost in tears as she said that, a lump already forming in her throat. A fresh nervousness was now taking her in its arms. She was sweating profusely, just like she was when she was feeling that panic attack sometime before she went to sleep. Her eyes were watery and her breath haphazard. Her stomach had so much churning going on it that she could feel it in her brain, buzzing and ringing like an alarm of some sort. She jerked her head, as if trying to push the thought away from her mind but it only made it come with even more vengeance. She saw Steven crashing to the ground and a beast sitting on top of him, just before Steven crashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNooo,\u201d she wailed as she sprang to her feet, \u201cI am coming Steven, I am coming for you.\u201d<br>\r\n WC 1087 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

She had already lost so many people already in her life even though no one knew, not even Steven. He was the only closest person to her alive and safe and she didn't want to lost him at any condition. Especially not waiting for his death, she would have to do something, something that will save him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast pounded on Steven's chest and continued to hit him as both of them fell down. the sight was dreading, Steven had bruises all over him and his shirt was torn, she watched his shirt fly away with the wind - it was bloody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped as she thought of something, she had to do this, she had been practicing magic privately without anyone knowing but it was time - she had to save him. She didn't care if he would see her true self, she was determined to save him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yelled to the top of her lungs as a strong force caused her to fly into the hair with the speed of light and there she was, in the horizon watching everywhere where the two of them had. Her eyes turned a shade of red as her hair colour changed to golden and her appearance changed, her clothes warrior-like. She had two golden bracelets on her wrists which sparkled. She didn't care for anything, her eyes scanned the area as they landed on the beast and Steven, his Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to suffer, beast.\" She flew down the same way ans the wind whooshed. She was by the beast's side in no time, \"How dare you! What foul creature are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature turned and it was a kind of Minotaur but larger. He scowled as he proceeded to attack her, \"Stay out of it, witch or I will crush you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed like a maniac as with the flick of her finger held the creature hanging in the air, he was struggling, he tried to pry whatever it was off with his hands but he didn't realise it was magic, \"You fool, you think you can win against magic?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a second with the movement of her finger, she sent him flying away, crushing him the trees as they fell down with the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fell the pain now? Or do you want more?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature stumbled but got up and was furious, he was breathing heavily and he ran towards Laura with everything he had, he tried to hit her but failed as she dodged him until he managed to touch her, clawing her skin as three sharp scratches formed on her arm and the blood started flowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, beast, you are going down.\" With a swift move, she used her magic to bring out old branches out from the ground as they gripped the minotaur and held him straight. She looked at him for a second to see if he would plead, she would have forgiven him but no, he was such an arrogant bastard. He deserved what was coming for him. Just then, the branches twisted his neck as a clack sound came and he was motionless. He fell to the ground as the branches slowly made their way back into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran towards Steven who was not moving, she held his head as she caressed his face with her other hand. She felt his pulse, thank God he was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, you are going to be fine, trust me, just stay with my, okay?\" She kissed his cheek as she watched Steven open his eyes, squinting, struggle to remain conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-laura? I-is it you? Y-you look so different. . . \" He spoke with a lot of difficulty. He couldn't believe if what he saw was correct, he recognised her by her sound, it was Laura, when he saw her, she was a beauty, she was already beautiful before but she looked even more exquisite, unique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh,\" She put a finger on his lips and held him tightly, \"It's me, you will be fine. Just rest, okay?\" And Steven surrounded himself to the darkness.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n699 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura was particularly chuffed that she had protected Steven but was also concerned for his health. He had been displaying symptoms of Larara Disease, the disease in which the patient suffers from the post-trauma symptoms of black magic. When a mortal sees a black magic for the first time his or her senses are not strong enough to comprehend it , to make sense out of it or to make peace with it and all what happens then is a struggle of senses , of logic over feel which is not a pleasant feel for the inflicted. Steven didn\u2019t say it, not one bit about the black magic, but it was his eyes which told his story, as with all patients of Larara. His one eye pupil had changed color to red while the other pupil was yellowish in color with some of part turned to red. She knew that as soon as those both pupil turned to red Steven was going to lose it and he would be nothing less than breathing corpse. The stress could last for hours sometimes weeks even and she didn\u2019t want to lose Steven at this juncture of the trip. <br>\r\nShe looked at the nearly unconscious Steven and stroked his hair. Steven had now closed his eyes, almost as if he had found peace with that first touch of Laura. He lay there in a world conjured by his mind, where black magic was wrecking havoc all over the kingdom. He would see flashes of the monstrous minotaur which Laura had just defeated, but the one in dream would just not be defeated. He was destroying buildings after buildings, killing people after people and destroying cities. Even as the minotaur did it, he would look into Steven\u2019s mind\u2019s eye and tell him that he was coming for him. And that thing was causing the constant shivering of Steven\u2019s body. The worse part was that his mind was only accentuating the worst of things, the Minotaur, the destruction, the killing but it showed no traces of Laura to her. If it would have then maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 the brain would have co-related the dream with the real life events and caused a closure but that wasn\u2019t happening \u2013 by a long distance no. And that was the one of the major symptoms of the Larara disease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at Steven who had sweat accumulated on his face, with his body shivering. He would also murmur something every now and then, something inaudible on the lines of \u201cHe is coming for me. He will kill us all.\u201d A tear ran down Laura\u2019s eyes. She stooped to Steven and planted a kiss on his cheek. Steven\u2019s body shuddered as his mind had made out this kiss to be a kick to his face by Minotaur. The more you loved him, the more the patient went deeper into the disease and that was the problem which Laura was faced with. How could she not show love to him, or care for him when all she had was him. If had not been Laura and some other person who didn\u2019t knew black magic then probably Steven would not have reacted negatively but since she herself was a source of the black magic which had inflicted this disease on him, the body kind of insulated itself from any further influence of the black magic practitioner. And this was body\u2019s way for self-defense \u2013 to not react to any emotions from Black Magic Practitioner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing that Laura\u2019s grandmother had taught her all of this \u2013 not so much as taught as in instilled in her. She remembered seeing this all as a kid when hordes of people would come to her house, in hope of the black magic to cure them of the diseases which had no cure. Her Granny never used magic for the benefit of herself but always for benefit of others. She knew that this was the only way to get rid of this stigma associated with Black Magic. After all, black magic was never meant to be used for ghastly purposes. It was always meant to do something which no other form of magic could and this was its specialty. A thing or person under the influence of black magic could never have an influence of any other kind of magic on him. Nothing erases the effect of black magic and this is what led some Magicians to explore the dark sides of the magic. They knew that since nobody practiced it and probably nobody would be able to gauge symptoms of it, they would be in good demand from the men in highest of authorities. Kings of Realms, Ministers in high hierarchy these were the kind of people who would avail their services and in return for their services they would ask for kingdoms or a part of it. The greed had gone into their heads and that is what gradually led to the stigmatization of Black magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at Steven and thought in her mind,\u201d I could do nothing else to save you, Steven,: she bowed her head <br>\r\nwith a torrent of tears flooding her eyes,\u201d I knew this was coming but in this circumstance there was nothing which I could have done differently to save you. I am sorry,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cI am so very sorry.\u201d She raised her hand to put on Steven\u2019s forehead but remembered that her love and affection would only make it worse. She placed her palms around her face and sobbed in them till her tear glands went barren. Steven was still lying still on the ground, nothing on his face to suggest whether he was alive or dead. She was on her knees now, bending even more to say something in Steven\u2019s ears and she said - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing happened, Steven,\u201d she said in a tone carefully devoid of any emotion or traces of love or care, \u201dit was just a bad bad dream,\u201d she figured out that this way she might be able to trick his mind into believing what was good for him. She was trying to reverse what he had just seen. This seemed to be the only try which Laura had at treating him. Steven\u2019s body showed no change because his Larara inflicted mind totally ignored the incoming words from Laura, not because it were from Laura, but because his senses were all engaged in eking out the most horrific scenes possible in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Laura was no ordinary human as she knew how and when to place things. She closed her eyes to call in the powers of the other world for her help. At first all she could see was Minotaur and him charging towards her but soon, in a matter of seconds her mind was blank as a black canvas appeared in her mind\u2019s eye. She told her mind to then find the most effective cure for Steven, something which didn\u2019t involve anything exotic for she knew that she wont be able to find it in here in this place. Nothing was painted on the canvas for a little while, just the blackness of it \u2013 so black that it seemed to be staring at you with hundred eyes \u2013 but then slowly, something started to take form as a silvery streak illuminated the black canvas. At first, it appeared to be a random zigzag strokes of silver sprayed here and there for effect but then, slowly it started to make sense to her. She saw a water reservoir \u2013 a lake perhaps- with doves and ducks hovering around it. She saw some deer, hiding behind the trees as if in anticipation of something , something big to happen. The butterflies of hundreds of color circled the lake, played with the flowers and the animals alike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn near distance \u2013 too near in fact \u2013 the rainbow stood there emerging right out of the Lake\u2019s belly and going towards the Horizon. It was as beautiful a scene she had ever seen and her eyes couldn\u2019t just have enough of it but the problem was that she didn\u2019t know if such a place existed in this forest. She opened her eyes and tried to make sense of the direction. She remembered that in flashes of image she just saw, she didn\u2019t see the sun and she needed the sun to find the direction. But hey, she saw the rainbow, didn\u2019t she and if a rainbow is there this means that the Sun was right behind it. Her goosebumps moment was even more pronounced because at the same time as she made this revelation she also figured out a way to cure Steven, after all. The rainbow was in South west direction and she decided to move in that direction. She got hold of a wooden log lying some place near her, enchanted it with a mantra and then touched it to her body and lo \u2013 she was flying in the sky, through the thick forests as lightly as a soul would. She hadn\u2019t brought Steven\u2019s body because she knew his body wasn\u2019t needed to be cured but it was his soul which must be. Steven\u2019s soul said nothing but smiled as they glided up and over the forest cover. She knew that the lake would be soon upon them as she could hear the quacking of the ducks from afar and along with it she could see the beautiful white doves, flying with their wings wide open as if painted across the blue sky, crossing their paths.<br>\r\nShe looked at Steven\u2019s soul and smiled . As they gently lowered to the lake, she realized that the place which she was now seeing was even beautiful which the mind\u2019s eye showed her.. The pleasant noise of the inhabitants of that lake intermingled with the nature and produced a sound so soothing that her little stressed soul was immediately at peace. As they stood towards the lake in all its wonder, she thought of what she would do next to cure Steven\u2019s soul. She sat down on the grass by the lake and so did Steven\u2019s soul as they looked towards the lake which gleamed. She looked towards Steven\u2019s soul and saw the apparent relief which the soul was feeling in those shut eyes and the glowing Aura around the soul which had diminished to almost nothing since the Larara disease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmotion ran through her, wanting to hug him but she was careful to not do it since it could have affected the spirit adversely. Instead, she did the exact opposite; she stood up from where they were sitting \u2013 carefully enough to not break the trance Steven\u2019s soul was seemingly in \u2013 and then, walked towards the Lake, even nearer to it. She turned her head away from the soul and instead looked towards the Lotuses which were floating on the lake. A bunch of butterflies were now playing with her, sitting on her nose, then on her face and her eyelids. She giggled and almost instinctively turned towards Steven to show him the scene \u2013 forgetting that it was  soul not Steven \u2013 when she saw something which made her heart filled with bliss.<br>\r\n(1866 words)  <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still shivering of the sheer panic which was engulfing her, she tried to calm her. It didn\u2019t work as those images still flashed by in her brain, bombarding her as if her own mind was working against her, prohibiting her from thinking.  Reality of the situation was that Laura had absolutely no idea of what she was going to do about it. She shut her eyes forcefully trying to shoo away the thoughts and although it didn\u2019t work in removing the thoughts altogether, she was having some ideas about the stuff she could do. She pondered whether she would try searching for Steven randomly tracing the sky for the presence of some feathers from his wings or whether to search for some clues related to him in the forest itself, if any, to get to him. In her mind neither of the ideas seemed too helping, not because she didn\u2019t have a clear plan regarding them but because she knew that it would take too much time to implement them. So she did what she not wanted to but had to, which was to use her greatest power, her greatest gift - the black magic. The only hiccup which now remained in this plan was that she was not entirely clear of its effect on something as pure as the angle Steven himself. She hadn\u2019t done it ever for anybody except humans who were terminally ill or those innocent animals such as wild cows, deer and peacocks in the wild who had no defense mechanism of their own other than to run away from the hunters. As she considered the plan in more depth she grew even worried as it occurred to her that rather than helping Steven, it could end up doing the exact opposite of what she intended to do because the \u201cReversibility field\u201d she had heard of the Angels. She didn\u2019t know what to do and every second which was passing by was precious to Steven\u2019s survival. Then, it occurred to him that she could use her black magic on something which she had tried before and then use it to help Steven. That wouldn\u2019t be a bad plan \u2013 not at all. A smile floated across her face as she looked around for something which could help her execute this line of thought of hers. All she could \u2013 no surprises \u2013 trees and more trees, one after the another lining up in the thickest of forest she had ever been into but her eyes kept searching  though for that one little alive thing apart from trees which could help her. When some five minutes passed by and she couldn\u2019t spot one single bird or animal, she considered another line of thought. Now, she was not searching for a big animal or a bird \u2013 heck, she could do it using her magic \u2013 what she was searching for now was even a minutest of creature which was moving.  She stooped to the floor and moved her hand around the thick grass to look if they hid something from her. She was now crawling on the ground, scanning the grass for that one little thing which could make her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAha,\u201d she chuckled, there \u2013 she noticed it. She curved her fingers around the little wasp which was hovering around the grass searching for food probably. The wasp tried to fly away when Laura\u2019s fingers touched its wings but Laura was quick enough to clasp the wings between her fingers, just before it could let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, little boy. Easy,\u201d she tried to calmed it, as her eyes scanned the wasp who was still thrusting its head outwards, fluttering its free wing as it was trying mighty hard to get away from firm grasp. The of-white colored almost transparent wasp had some of the characteristics she could use. She had decided to make this wasp completely transparent, so that even the predators blessed with best of eyes couldn\u2019t see it. What now remained were two things; first to make the wasp grow horse sized and second to give it some kind of defense mechanism apart from the transparency she had decided to provide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the clasp still clutched between her index fingers and the thumb of her left hand, she stooped to the ground and uprooted some of the grass which was all over where she was standing. She had to uproot the grass so as to uncover an area large enough for the version which would be produced after the black magic had been abracadabra on the wasp. She kept pulling the grass until she had uncovered enough ground from beneath the grass. Then, she waked to the middle of the bare land and placed the wasp there but not before carefully numbing its wings but not its rest of the body lest the magic wouldn\u2019t work. Once the wasp lay there with its tiny head moving forwards and backwards and those eyes of its rotating in their tiny sockets, she stood up, walked backwards with her fixed to the Wasp \u2013 not because she thought it would fly away, it couldn\u2019t but because in order for black magic to work you should be looking at the thing you have to work your magic on, all the time - and went out of the patch of the barren land which she had prepared by removing the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stooped to the ground, picked up a twig and standing on the edge of the barren land, she started to draw something. As she drew those muscular legs, a scream echoed across the forest as the wasp\u2019s legs strutted out abnormally from its tiny body. She hurriedly drew the head now in proportion to the body and wasp\u2019s head bust through the previous tiny little skull. The wasp\u2019s eyes were still original but not for long as with another flick of the wrists she drew the most beautiful of eyes. Now the only body parts which remained original to the wasp were its wings. <br>\r\nLaura knew she had to be careful now, because as the rules of black magic say the prominent part of a creature should be created in no more than 3 strokes. She had to find a way out to draw the big wings which would be able to support the body of a horse in 3 neat strokes. As she considered the point on the wasp body she would attach wings to she saw a streak of red flowing down the wasp\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no,\u201d she gasped as she remembered that a creature could not retain any former body part of its for more than 3 minutes else the magic would reverse completely. If the blood oozing out from the back of the wasp had dropped own the ground where it lay, then it would have given birth to thirty three more such creatures and also their behavior would have been not governed by Laura by pure free will. The more droplets of blood would fall the more creatures in multiple of thirty three would be birthed. She had to it in a hurry, and in that panic rising in her stomach she drew the wings of the wasp in 4 not 3 strokes. A horror reached her eyes as she saw the wasp struggling to get itself on its feet and it screamed in a shrill voice which pierced the soul of the forest. In her panic, Laura had drawn unbalanced wings and the left wing was the wasp was much bigger than the right one. That was the reason that the wasp was not being able to stand up on its legs as it didn\u2019t have enough power in both of its wings to thrust it into the air and then fly away. Tears ran down Laura\u2019s eyes as she realized what she had done \u2013 not only because she had wasted some precious time in the complete process but that she had made the creature go through all this agony just because of her haste. She ran towards the Wasp as it wriggled its pain around the dusty ground. The legs had come out just perfect and so had the eyes but it was the wings which were disturbing its whole anatomy. She quickly wiped away the drop of blood which threatening to touch the ground \u2013 that was the last thing she wanted to face at this point of time. <br>\r\nShe stooped and pushed the wasp from her right side to help her comparatively smaller wing to push the body up to stand on its feet. She knew as soon as she would do it, the wasp would try to fly away because all black magic does is change the anatomy but not the innate behavior of an organism. So, she was ready to put her palm around the eyes of the wasp as soon as it would rise to its feet to prevent it from seeing anything and panicking. She pushed the wasp again with all her might as the fluttering of the wasp\u2019s mighty left wing buzzed in her ear. The wasp was now halfway erect and almost ready to go much like Laura who was ready to put its palm around its eyes. And then, it happened exactly as Laura thought it would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as all the four hooves of the wasp touched the ground, it fluttered its new wings with all its might. It had started to rise from the ground just when the palm of Laura covered its eyes and the fluttering stopped. Wasp are by nature not accustomed to look into day light and more so because this was still as Wasp at heart, she knew what she needed to do to make it feel at home. The fluttering of the wings had stopped now and slowly, almost unnoticeably Laura climbed onto the horse sized wasp. The wasp\u2019s body shuddered a but it was not out of fear but out of surprise. Still covering Wasp\u2019s eyes with her both hands, she pulled out her handkerchief from her pocket by just staring at it. By the magic of stare in her eyes, she made the handkerchief fly in the air and towards where her hand were and then, she clutched it with one hand and quickly tied it around the wasp\u2019s eyes. The wasp was a little stunned by the constant movements on the top of its back and hence fluttered her wings a bit to unnerve itself. Laura saw that reaction from the wasp and understood it. She gently patted the wasp on its forehead and the milt fluttering soon gave way to a little purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1776 words)   <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The purr from the wasp sounded curious, it was if the wasp\u2019s mind was fighting against its natural reaction of flying away. It was a restrained purr like that of a Cat \u2013 a big cat \u2013 who had had her share of food but wanted more although knowing that it wasn\u2019t going to happen. Laura patted the Wasp again and this time she heard a purr of content. She could see the wasp connecting with her soul; she could feel it all over her soul. Wasp was as still as if it was built out of porcelain. It stood there, waiting for a command from Laura who was contemplating the right moment to do it. Her original idea was the send this wasp on its own to search Steven while she planned to stay back at this place, waiting for him just in ace he made a miraculous return which her heart knew wasn\u2019t going to happen. She checked the blindfold tied around the wasp\u2019s eyes and the wasp moved a little but not before Laura was able to check and felt okay with the arrangement. This was the time to decide now \u2013 does she latch her spirit onto the wasp\u2019s body and send it searching for Steven or whether it would be more suitable to ride along the wasp to search for Steven. But how would the wasp fly along Laura atop on her. Its unbalanced wings made it difficult \u2013near impossible \u2013 for it to carry its own weight leave alone carrying another full grown human with itself. With blindfolds still securely in place, she slid down slowly from the Wasp. She looked at those legs of the wasp which she had conjure, some chunky muscles though which would have given a race horse a proper run for the money. Why couldn\u2019t she ride it to Steven instead, what so if those wings prevented her from flying along with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly arranged a piece of rope to tie her securely onto the top of wasp and took a deep long breath. Now was the moment \u2013 <br>\r\n\u201cGo,\u201d she commanded, digging her shins into the sides of wasp and not surprisingly it jolted ahead. It was a natural reaction of the animal more than anything else. The more suddenly Laura would dig her shin the more speed the wasp would run at. She was careful enough to not dig too deep into poor wasp\u2019s belly because she knew that since the wasp wasn\u2019t accustomed to it, it was doing more han bad than good to him. But she had to do it anyway once or twice as the Wasp jolted like mad on the narrow path between tress after trees. They were now running at the speed of over a hundred miles per hour \u2013 almost as good as flying \u2013 but what bothered Laura was that she didn\u2019t had the advantage of height which was necessary to search for anyone in this forest covering. She still kept commanding his wasp to run as fast as she could while her mind contemplated the alternatives at an even rapid pace. She moved her hands twice to remove the blindfold and possibly push the wasp into flying but she knew that a being never does what it should until it is pushed to its limit and at present the wasp wasn\u2019t being pushed to its absolute limit. All the while navigating the horse through the narrow paths, her eyes was searching for a narrow opening of daylight from any direction as she knew that if in this forest daylight could enter then it could be from somewhere there were no trees. She kept riding in the westward direction some more when she saw a place which met her expectations; a place where light was managing to sneaking in not in thin streams but in floods. She dig the left feet deeper into the Wasp\u2019s belly as it let out a little wail and pushed the ground beneath its feet even harder. She knew that it would be soon that wasp would be tired as its mind was still not adapted fully to its new body and hence she kept pushing the wasp for more and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow less area was some fify gallops away from the place where they currently were but it intrigued Laura that how suddenly the forest was going to end. She thought about the reasons for his sudden end but before she could answer herself her mind got tangled in other intrigue that of a sound as if hundreds of horse carriages were running through the road. Laura looked around to find those carriages but she saw nothing. The sound had grown even louder now but she decided to keep it at a backburner until she reached the end of the forest \u2013into that flood of light. Wasp let out a little wail again and stumbled a bit but nothing serious as it rattled along to the place of no shadows. It was such a relief for Laura to see no tree around her. Only the mountains in the front of her eyes but some distance away and the drowning sun were her natural compatriot but nothing else \u2013 that is if the gurgling sound of something big, something humongous was to be discounted. Laura looked around for the source of the sound when she realized that they were nearing a cliff and that sound was coming in from that direction. Panic gripped her and she dug the balls of her feet even deeper into the wasp\u2019s belly. The wasp let out a heart wrenching wail and kept running towards the end of the cliff and then as gracefully as it had reached there it kept jutting its legs haphazardly until its feet touched no ground. Laura couldn\u2019t believe her that she didn\u2019t see that coming. As they leaped from the cliff and into the thin air she couldn\u2019t help but look down where the ground stood but she couldn\u2019t see that either as all she saw was a waterfall which was so big that it could have engulfed cities in it and it was the source of the sound which had hit Laura\u2019s ears sometime back. A cry left her lips as she held on tight to the wasp\u2019s body. She looked around in panic and then is when she saw a purplish haze in near distance. She couldn\u2019t understand it the first time she saw it and something in it struck her \u2013 it was the same haze she had seen when she dreamt earlier in the day, wasn\u2019t it! It was true after all, and if this part was true then that part about Steven falling from the sky must have been true too. A shudder ran down her spine. So both of them were going to die? She couldn\u2019t believe what fate had done to her. What about all those dreams she had in her mind regarding her future with Steven, all those little things which she planned to do for him, all those moments of joy she wanted to share with him. A stream of tears had started to run down her face but instead of softening her it hardened her resolve. <br>\r\n\u201cAll right, Waspey,\u201d she patted on the Wasp\u2019s head, \u201dwe will do it.\u201d Her hands moved towards the blindfold which was securely in place around Wasp\u2019s eyes. With a little jerk of her wrists, she unfurled it and lo \u2013 the wasp saw that it was in mid-air. If the Wasp could talk it would have told Laura about the content in the heart which it felt upon seeing itself in mid-air. It started to flutter its wings gleefully gut the pace with they were falling ensure that the fluttering had no effect. They still were falling towards the ghastly black structure at the foot of the waterfall which welcomed them. The wasp didn\u2019t realize the seriousness of the situation but what it understood was that its wings were not able to lift her body upwards in the air as it would have liked to. It gave the wings a renewed flutter, a mighty strong effort. Laura\u2019a legs which were touching the point where wings were attached to the bodyo f the wasp, felt the sensation of whirring of the wings and Laura readily patted the wasp and said \u2013 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, do it Waspey,\u201d she egged it on patting its head and caressing the place were wings were attached to , \u201clets show the world how the Black wasps fly.\u201d The wasps let out a neigh as it flapped its wings so hard that all what Laura could see was a general outline of the wings. Then, the wasp did something which it hadn\u2019t done till then, which was to slightly rotate the body towards the right side as if to cancel out the stress falling on the left wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike it this way?\u201d Laura asked the wasp and the wasp seemed to purr. At that moment, Laura who was still clutching the belly of the wasp with her legs, tilted her body with a jerk which rotated the wasp\u2019s body along with it. Now, they were some forty five degrees inclined to the left and had stopped falling down as with a sudden jerk the gravity lost the battle to the black wasp.  Laura let out a cry of victory as Wasp fluttering its wings like a maniac, enabling them to hang still in mid-air like a hummingbird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Laura stretched her arms out like a bird, taking in the sprinkling of the water from the waterfall and closed her eyes. What an experience this had been and she had a smile on her face to prove it but she knew more things were in store as this journey was far from over. She caressed the wasp\u2019s neck the wasp shivered a bit, probably out of realization of what it had done. <br>\r\n\u201cReady for another trip, Hon?\u201d she tilted and hung from the wasp\u2019s left side as if to look the wasp directly into the eyes as it did it. She continued \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook that purple haze there, fella?\u201d she paused as if waiting for an answer, \u201cthere is where the master is,\u201c she was now seeing those images of Steven falling from the sky, again. She shook her head and said - <br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d as she dug her back of the feet gently in the Wasp\u2019s belly and they zoomed out towards the land of the purple haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1751 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura knew Steve was gawping at her, probably wondering just <i>who </i>she really was. She swallowed, did her best to keep her gaze on the yawning entrance, seeing patterns in the moss and ivy that covered the walls. A memory was hidden around a dark corner in her mind; whenever she tried to grab it it slithered back into a darker corner. With all her being she knew the memory was going to split her and Steve up, but she also knew it would be the key to them getting through this monsterish-maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only Steve wasn't staring at her like she was something to be wary about. Even if she was, maybe, possibly.... She drew in a deep breath and turned to Steve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We need to enter this maze, Steve,' Laura said, 'but I think our best option is to spend the night outside. You look exhausted and I'm sure I'll drop into a deep sleep the moment I close my eyes. We need to be on top form when we cross the threshold.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pointed at the ground and Steve noticed a huge piece of stone planted there, spanning at least ten foot. Grey, just like the of the walls, and clean but for one thing. Was that a footprint? He edged closer. 'Someone's been here,' he got out, surprised and wary. They hadn't been chased through the forest but... obviously someone was about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Steve, please... come back from there,' Laura said. 'I told you I sense something wrong, I told you the monster sucks souls. I <i>know </i>it does. Don't cross that threshold, don't even get close.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How do you know all this?' Steve asked. He did step back from the threshold and the footprint, spine tingling for a second as if he was being watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura hunched her shoulders, hugged herself. She shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Whatever you know, you have to tell me!' Steve said. 'Whatever secret you're keeping, if it's about getting us through this maze, you have to reveal it. I have the most horrible feeling our lives are at stake!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course they are, Laura thought. It's a monster's maze. She refrained from reminding Steve that. He was wound up. No need to make him worse. She was going to need him as much as he needed her. \u2018Come,\u2019 she said. \u2018We might as well make ourselves comfortable. I\u2019ll try to tell you things, Steve, but it\u2019s all blocked in my mind. Maybe just sitting here will help.\u2019 She moved a bit further from the entrance, where the pull to go inside wasn\u2019t as strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Steve came with her and sat down, leaning against the wall that prevented them from returning to the forest. \u2018I know I\u2019m nagging,\u2019 he murmured, touching Laura\u2019s hand briefly, \u2018but\u2026 god Laura, I\u2019m not the hero you think I am!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her brows shooting up, Steve felt a flush rise on his face. About the first warmth he\u2019d felt all evening! \u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing half the time, I keep thinking about that darkness thing the man told me, and now <i>this</i>!\u2019 He waved a hand down to the entrance. \u2018And this.\u2019 He tapped the wall behind him. He pulled a face and sighed. \u2018You\u2019re right, we should rest. We\u2019ll both be better for it.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pecked his cheek. \u2018You\u2019re always a hero, Steve.\u2019 Which was why she was a little worried about revealing her secrets. Heroes had certain morals and ethics, and she wasn\u2019t sure her secret would stand in concert with them!! As much as she wanted to rest, she was going to have to dig for that memory, and reveal some of it \u2013 the bits that would still portray her as \u2018normal\u2019 to Steve. And, she thought, I need to take his mind off things for a while. As she shrugged off the knapsack, she said, \u2018How about you try to get a fire started?\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were bits of wood around, broken from the trees in the forest, somehow left this side of the wall. Wasn\u2019t lighting fires something men loved doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Yeah, okay,\u2019 Steve said, glancing around. \u2018But I want to talk, Laura.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded. \u2018When we\u2019re warm and have full stomachs,\u2019 she said. Well, maybe full stomachs\u2026 the knapsack was depressingly light in the food department. Pickled pork in greaseproof paper, some wizened mushrooms and a small block of cheese. Why had they not thought to stock up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Laura prepared the \u2018meal\u2019, Steve scavenged for wood and detritus and put together a decent pile. It wouldn\u2019t burn through the night but it would help stave off the chill for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of them watched the flames, reds and oranges leaping about in the small breezes that would come and go. It provided some warmth and as twilight gave way to deep blue and then black, the fire became their little beacon of hope. Steve glanced up once, but the sky was without stars. Not cloudy\u2026 just without stars, as if the darkness had suffocated them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve drew in a breath, tried to block what else the man had told him about the darkness. He turned to Laura, as she shifted slightly to lean her head on his shoulder, and opened his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could speak, however, he heard an odd snuffling sound. A footfall? A rodent? The Monster????? \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What\u2019s what?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018That noise, like something\u2019s coming.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I heard nothing,\u2019 Laura said. \u2018It\u2019s just your imagination, Steve. Nothing\u2019s here but us.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What about what\u2019s in the maze?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018It won\u2019t come out here.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018How are you so sure?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, why would it? Its power is in the maze, not outside it.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve frowned. As good as that logic sounded, he didn\u2019t like it. \u2018Laura, what secret are you hiding from me?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(word count: 967) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Laura could answer ('I'm not hiding secrets' was her immediate gut reaction) a dragging, stepping sound came from their left. Loud enough that even she heard it, and couldn't deny that she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'See?' Steve hissed, rising onto his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's probably just a rat,' Laura murmured, even if she didn't believe it. The sounds were definite steps and not hesitant, not like a rat who would be sniffing around, trying to decide if it should come closer or not. She looked at Steve; he knelt like stone in front of her as he listened. 'Steve?' she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he turned to look at her the snapping flames made him seem mechanical and made his dark brown eyes black and glassy. She caught her breath but then he swallowed and blinked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Get behind me,' he said softly, rising and pulling the dagger from his boot. They were woefully under-armed for any sort of encounter, woefully unprepared in general. But then he'd never expected to come across a labyrinth with a monster and a wall springing up out of nowhere to prevent their retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve shifted in front of the small fire, closed his eyes briefly so as to better get used to the dark that now stretched out in front of him. He didn't look to see if Laura had moved but then she said, 'should I put out the fire?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No,' he rasped with a shake of his head. 'If whatever it is has to look into the light, that's to our benefit. But, Laura, try not to stare into it yourself, alright?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura mumbled an agreement to that, and shifted to the other side if the alley space so that the fire was more to her side than in front of her. She crouched to the ground; in her dark greens and browns she might be hard to see there and could act as an element of surprise to help Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd fallen still, silence settled. Steve was standing, left foot slightly forward, dagger loose in his right fist. She'd seen him in this stance many times; he looked totally relaxed and uninterested but he could let that dagger go in an eye blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter maybe two minutes they heard the sound again, steps. Slow but unhesitating. Whatever was coming meant to come, whether it had heard them or not. Surely they had the advantage, having been round a slightly curve in the alley. The thing would not know there were two of them unless it had heard them talking earlier, and both Steve and Laura had kept their voices low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve flexed his fingers around the dagger's hilt. His heart was leaping about and he drew in a steady breath to try and calm it. Despite his fears about the darkness and the monster in the labyrinth he felt mostly calm. He'd faced enemies before - human and otherwise. Better prepared, usually, but shortened odds did bring out the best in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steps stopped just beyond the curve and then started forward again, and a large yet low shadow slid around the curve with a shuffle. Steve took a step sideways in an attempt to let the fire shed some light, and he blew out a breath at what he saw. 'It's a rat!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot ten feet from him, crouched now against the wall was a rat. A large one, maybe not even a rat but some other giant rodent, its fur hanging in dreds down to the ground. Steve shot a glance at Laura and prepared to laugh. Then the rat fixed him with its beady black eyes and said, 'don't insult me, I'm a mongoose.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve choked on a swallow and Laura squeaked out a half-voiced scream. She scuttled back across the alley to the fire and their knapsack, now positioned behind Steve. She didn't mind rodents but talking ones were not something she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And unless you give me some respect - such as putting away that knife - you're not going to make it out of this night alive.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ex<i>cuse</i> me?' Steve demanded, raising the dagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't act like a man who is deaf,' the mongoose grumbled. 'Oh blast it, if I must I must.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve glanced back at Laura, totally bamboozled. She held one handover her mouth, pointed with the other. Steve turned back, and swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of him the mongoose was distorting with growth, sprouting longer limbs, while the dreds were shrinking and lengthening in random order. In a half minute, where the mongoose had crouched, a young man now crouched. 'You better give me some clothes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve probably would have just stared all night, even if he <i>was</i> used to weird stuff. A rodent-come-man wasn't something he'd seen a lot of! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come on,' the man said. 'I can't be of help if I freeze to death.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here,' Laura said and Steve wasn't quick enough to stop her stepping passed and holding out a cloak. 'We don't have much,' she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man took the cloak, mumbled a barely-there 'thank you' and slung the cloak around his shoulders. Once decent, he rose on two perfectly human feet and both Steve and Laura were somewhat surprised that the man was about Steve's height and only young. Maybe twenty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How about an explanation,' Steve said, 'before you take one step further.' He jabbed the dagger outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How about you let me come closer to that pathetic excuse for a fire and warm my bones first?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steve was opening his mouth to condemn the newcomer to his foulest words, Laura touched his arm. 'He's shivering,' she said, 'let him come closer.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve grimaced. Laura was a soft touch often, but right now?? Then again, she had secrets... what if she and this mongoose man knew each other? Not that they'd shown any recognition. Steve rubbed his brow and shifted away from the fire, pulling Laura with him. He waved the man forward with his dagger wielding hand. 'Be our guest.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn't respond to the tone, just moved forward and then sank to his knees. He held his hands out to the flame and closed his eyes. Next thing, the fire was worthy of being called a fire - three times as large and giving off heat that Steve and Laura could feel even from their distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What...' Steve began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Have you got any food?' the man asked. 'I wasn't able to find anything once the wall sprung up. I'm starving.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We're pretty low,' Laura admitted. 'Let me see though.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Laura...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Steve,' she responded in a tight tone. 'Just come and take a seat. Let our guest make himself comfortable before making him explain.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled at Steve, which Steve read as <i>she's got you whipped!</i> and scowled. He did crouch at the fire side, though, and when he felt the warmth running through his body he even set the dagger on the ground by his knee. 'What's your name?' he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Darius,' the young man answered easily enough and thanked Laura for the pieces of meat and cheese she held out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why do you sneak about as a rodent?' Steve asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A mongoose is not a rodent,' Darius said stiffly around a mouthful of cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then why do you sneak about as a mongoose?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was hardly sneaking,' came another stiff answer. 'I was trying to find the end of this damn alley. The wall is too smooth for me to climb.' He pointed up at the stone at Laura and Steve's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why don't you move about in your human form?' Laura this time, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because I can run faster the other way,' Darius responded wryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alright,' Steve growled, 'enough with the riddles. You look like a twenty-year-old kid in need of a bath and a barber, wearing just a cloak. Yet you reckon we won't survive the night without you. Start explaining before my patience wears out.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I said you wouldn't if you didn't show me respect,' Darius corrected mildly. 'But your interpretation is true too,' he added quickly, when Steve moved a hand toward the dagger. He took another bite of the cheese then rearranged the cloaked so it covered his crossed legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1373) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'I was out hunting,' Darius said as an opening line of explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve and Laura looked at each other, trying not to grimace. Mongooses were carnivorous animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But I didn't find much; there's a darkness in the air tonight,' Darius said. 'Did you see there were no stars?' He looked upward, and the other two did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the same expansive black that Steve had noted earlier. He wasn't sure if he liked the mongoose feeling the darkness like he did. 'What do you mean, a darkness?' he asked, to see what the young man would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Evil,' Darius said, voice low. He leaned toward the fire, holding his hands out. 'Like life is being sucked out. I felt it more in my other state than this one but animals are more attuned. In any case,' he added after a short moment, 'there wasn't much to hunt. I came back to the labyrinth to check some of my traps, but nothing there either.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Traps?' Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not for eating as a mongoose,' Darius said. 'But as a human. Rats, mostly, things I can roast.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve squinted at the young man, unsure he was keeping up with this tale. 'Riddles,' he murmured just to put it out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, probably,' Darius agreed quite calmly. 'But that's how it was - I can think as a human even while I'm a mongoose. I was in fact human when I was checking the traps, but I changed when the wall sprung up. Easier to run, as I said. Easier to hide too, normally.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve rubbed a hand over the blade still sitting on the ground, not in a threatening gesture, but for some sort of comfort for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Go on,' Laura said gently when the young man looked like he might stay silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's as I said,' he continued. 'I started along the wall in order to get out of this alley; it can't go forever.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why not?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why <i>not</i>?' the young man asked Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve looked at Laura. 'How big did you say this maze was?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked surprised a second. 'I don't... think I did,' she said. 'But... look at those walls; they're massive. Why are you asking?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If the maze is big, then the wall is probably just as big, surrounding the thing, don't you think?' Steve actually wasn't sure where he was going with this, was probably trying to make sense of it by thinking of the wall as finite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was aware of Laura and Darius looking at him, and shrugged. 'If you were trying to get out, I presume you're not from around here?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not,' Darius said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But you hunt in the forest.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes,' Darius said, with a shrug. 'What of it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You hunt around this labyrinth too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes,' the young man replied again. 'So?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Isn't that dangerous?' Steve asked, picking up the knife. 'How do we know you're not from inside the labyrinth?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I guess you don't,' Darius said. 'But if I lived in the labyrinth do you think I'd choose the form of a mongoose?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He makes a good point,' Laura murmured softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How do I know what you'd choose?' Steve said. 'Monsters can take any form. You threatened us earlier, you came from the direction of the entrance.' He turned the blade over in his hand. He should have had the newcomer shoved against the wall the moment he'd turned human!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius sighed. 'I don't come from the labyrinth, but I take this form because of it. Because of a curse.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sucked in her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My father and a raiding party went in one winter's day to try and learn the maze's secret. There's gold rumoured to be inside, did you know?' Darius cocked his head. 'My family wasn't rich, most of the town folk weren't. One night they'd had too much ale and went on a mission.' Darius swallowed hard. 'They lost three men and for the price of the rest of their lives they lost their sons.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sons?' Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius nodded. 'I don't mean dead. Well, not real dead, but this...' He waved a hand at himself. 'Turned us into various animals and because we could change at will we considered \"touched\" and cast out. We might as well have been dead to them.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drew in a breath. Laura sympathised but she could see Steve arching his brow and barely believing anything. The tale <i>was </i>odd, but she had heard of things like this happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'All that aside,' Steve said, 'you threatened us - that we wouldn't last the night. Why should we believe you won't try something?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was nothing,' Darius mumbled. 'I've learned to go on the offence first. You didn't know what I might be able to do, I hoped to buy some time.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You still don't know what we might do,' Steve pointed out. 'And what was that whole \"if I must I must\" babble?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, once I'd spoken, would you have stayed calm if I'd stayed a mongoose?' Darius demanded. 'I doubt it. At times like this' - he waved around the alley - 'I prefer the other form. It feels safer.' He didn't need to say that he was better 'armed' and 'clothed' as a mongoose. He hadn't really been planning to turn human, not tonight with this darkness, not without preparation. He regretted leaving his little hut at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So you won't try to kill us?' Steve said, skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not while you're the one with the knife,' Darius responded. 'Look, this is odd, yes. Say what you like, I've heard it all before. But I mean no harm now. I just want to get out of this place.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve opened his mouth, and Laura squeezed his arm. 'You're welcome to stay here with us, make use of the fire to warm yourself,' she said. 'Thank you, by the way, for... increasing it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius gave a funny smile. 'One of my skills now,' he said. 'Fire. I'd rather I could conjour up clothes.' He tugged the cloak tighter around himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, we're grateful for the fire,' Laura said. 'Hopefully it'll keep up through the night.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius nodded. 'I won't harm you,' he said softly. 'I don't run with the monster in the labyrinth.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is that what people thought when they first realised you could change?' Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No,' Darius said. 'They just thought we were cursed.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And there are more of you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded but didn't say how many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are they all mongooses?' Steve asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura frowned but he was curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Some,' Darius said and again didn't explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve geared up to pester for proper answers but Laura was giving him a considered look that told him to stop upsetting the young man. She nodded at the fire and he realised that it had been bobbing high and low and low and high through the conversation as if he flared at the man's moods. It was low now and, to be honest, they couldn't afford to lose the fire (or the heat). 'Sorry,' Steve mumbled. 'It's just... I'm probably at my day's quota for strange things. If I'm being rude, I apologise.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius shrugged. 'I've faced worse,' he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire dipped and then flared. Steve had plenty of questions and he wanted answers but he also just wanted to suck up the heat from the and pretend he was sitting near the hearth at home. Just for a few hours, anyway. God, this day had been WEIRD, and he realised suddenly Laura hadn't revealed her secret. Well, he was too tired now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the young man turned on them in the night, even after the promise that he wouldn't, well, dying would at least end the weirdness. Steve shook his head. He may not have been a hero as much as he wanted, but he wasn't a quitter. He'd fight. Now he just groaned. And then he said, 'Laura, I think I've an extra pair of pants in the bag. Give them to Darius, will you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blinked, making him grimace, but scrabbled through the bag and did come up with a pair of pants. True surprise flashed across the youngster's face and they heard a stuttered 'thank you.' He rose and turned his back on them, quickly pulling on the pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura treated Steve to a brilliant smile. He just grimaced again. It wasn't all chivalry; he didn't want to catch any sight of nudity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man returned to his place by the fire. 'I have good hearing,' he said, 'in this form and the other. If something approaches from either direction, I'll know.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve gave a stiff nod, and wondered if the man <i>had </i>heard their conversation. That would be something they'd have a chat about in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1463 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night passed without incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve knew this because he didn't really sleep a wink. There were several reasons for being awake:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. He couldn't get comfortable no matter which way he lay, and he preferred to be on his side facing the odd-ball stranger. His stiff leather belt dug into his flesh, and the rough ground seemed to carry stones no matter much he moved about. The arm he was using for a pillow went numb very early, causing him to shift about to find a new position. (He was surprised he didn't wake Laura with all the maneuvering about.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. He did not really trust the stranger. Laura seemed to take the mongoose's story to heart and Steve had to admit it had sounded authentic, and the man <i>could </i>clearly transform. But..  to be able to sleep in the presence of a man who could transform and who remained mostly a stranger was not an ability Steve had. He didn't want it either. He had to remain wary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. He was worried about Laura. She'd managed to get away with not spilling what she knew about the monster and the labyrinth, or what was bothering her. She seemed to have calmed down quite a bit during the evening, but who knew what was going on in her head right now? Steve wasn't bothered so much about his safety around her but her own safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. He didn't want to dream. For a couple of nights now he'd had at least one nightmare about an all-consuming darkness, and having no stars overhead unsettled him. Hearing Darius mention the darkness didn't ease his concerns at all. (Though he had to admit that he was kind of grateful the mongoose had spoken about it; it meant that he himself wasn't crazy.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as dawn lightened the sky in the east from black to dark grey to light grey, and clouds were pinking up overhead with the as-yet-unseen sun, Steve rose on stiffened pins and shook himself out. God, if they were going to enter the labyrinth today he wasn't going to be in great heroic form. He rolled his shoulders, wincing at the creaking, cracking sounds. His stomach rumbled awake and he rubbed it, thinking that they might have used the remainder of their food last night. He narrowed his eyes at the sleeping (still human) form of the young stranger. He'd scoffed his fair share too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve thought on the traps the man had mentioned, and took a couple of steps to put him on the turn of the alley. He couldn't see anything that looked like a trap and didn't remember anything from yesterday. Dawn had this area still cloaked in dim grey light so perhaps things were just not visible yet. In fact the only thing that stood out from the universal greyness was the entry to the labyrinth. It had a dark colour all of its own and Steve had the sudden thought that even in the pitch black of night, he'd have been able to see that entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis skin crawled, and he back-stepped out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he returned to the makeshift campsite and the two sleeping forms, he kicked a stone at the wall. The ricochet was loud enough to make Laura and Darius start but not leap up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura mumbled something, clearly not 100% awake, but Darius stretched an arm out from under the tightly wrapped cloak and suddenly the fire was pumping again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Steve didn't trust and didn't like the young man, he was grateful for the fire. He'd been cold in the night whenever the wind had shunted down the alley. He knelt down beside Laura, giving her a little bit of a shake, even though his gaze stayed on Darius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man looked thin and pale, even with the golden flames flicking in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Does keeping this fire up sap strength?' Steve heard himself croak out. He swallowed back the frog, and rustled in the knapsack for one of the canteens. Finding it, he took a couple of swigs and then held it out to Darius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius blinked, looked as if he wasn't sure what the thing was, but then he got himself up on an elbow and took the canteen. He swallowed deep, then recapped it and handed it back. 'Thank you,' he said quietly, 'and no, it doesn't sap my strength. Or at least it hasn't before.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You look pretty poorly.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius grimaced. 'I've been out hunting three days,' he murmured. 'Barely found anything to eat, even in my other form. And when there's nothing for even a mongoose to eat then something is up.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Up?' Steve said carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think you know what I mean,' Darius said, sitting himself cross-legged as close to the fire as he could. 'You know what I mean about the darkness, don't you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve nodded. 'I've heard stories. Thought they were legends.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius shook his head, then inclined it. 'Well, legend maybe, but something real too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Has it got anything to do with the monster?' Steve thumbed over his shoulder toward the labyrinth's entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But you know what the monster is?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No,' Darius said. 'I don't. I haven't seen it. And those who came back from that terrible mission would never say. They just looked haunted. When my friends and I turned we didn't have much warning; it wasn't until after it happened that we got told about the bargain.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Your fathers made a bargain?' Steve felt stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'To save lives,' Darius said quietly, gaze on the orange flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve sucked at his teeth but before he could question any further, Laura squeezed his knee. She didn't speak but when he looked down at her he saw the <i>stop grilling</i> him expression. Steve pulled a face. 'How'd you sleep?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like a log.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really?' Steve blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura managed a half shake and then rolled over and sat up. She smoothed down her hair, glancing at Darius and offering a quiet 'good morning.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answered back, smiled, then returned to his own thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Steve looked at each other, then Steve said, 'we have a choice to make.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura arched a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do we go into the labyrinth or do we continue down this alley to find the end, all the while hoping this wall somehow disappears.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sucked in her breath. Darius lifted his head, watching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1075 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura held her breath a moment, fighting within herself about the best option to take. During the night memories had been teasing her, torn and tattered, like a puzzle she had to put together to reveal the whole. And what she'd managed to put together made her all the more sure that they needed to go into the labyrinth and that Steve needed her in order to survive it, but that she was also a danger to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow that worked, she didn't know. What the outcome would be, well, that was even more obscure. Except a fragment from the night, dark and misty, made her think that she wouldn't be leaving the labyrinth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was she going to explain what was going on in her head and have Steve not think she was totally insane? She glanced at the <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">mong</span>... Darius. His gaze was on her and for a moment she thought he was aware of the struggle within her, knew things that were going on inside. Well, he'd been transformed by the monster; maybe he did know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he said, 'thank you for letting me stay her with you, for the food and clothing.' Maybe he'd been looking at her with gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's not a problem, Darius,' she murmured, glad for a second to be taken away from her own thoughts. 'I wish we had a top for you, but Steve's wearing the spare. The original is lying in tatters somewhere in the forest after a fight with a thorn bush.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius looked startled a second and then he smiled. Steve scowled. 'If you hadn't wanted those berries,' he told Laura, and turned away so neither saw the flash of a grin/grimace on his face too. Ah, two days ago - back when life wasn't quite so terrifying and unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura watched Steve sort out a morning meal - not much different from last night. A bit of the pork remained and some cheese, and a small flask of alcohol. As much as she longed to swallow it back, it probably wouldn't do to be impaired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made the most of the meal, in silence, Laura contemplated how to start her tale. At the end of it, she still didn't know so she just blurted, 'I think I'm part of the labyrinth,' and shook her head because that wasn't quite it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men stared at her, reflecting the same stunned expression. Then they glanced at each other and Laura felt a speck of wariness; such a tiny statement and the two men, previously not exactly friends, had formed some sort of alliance. She was going to have to tread carefully here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do you mean, <i>part </i>of the labyrinth?' Steve asked slowly, trying to just sound curious, even if the hairs were up on his nape. He shifted onto his left hip, which gave better access to the knife he'd slid into his right boot. Not that he thought... He drew breath. Laura looked scared, he best not react before he got the details. Best not let his imagination get the better of him. He noticed that the mongoose had stiffened up slightly; probably reasonable given his unpleasant association with the labyrinth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know,' Laura said. 'I didn't really mean <i>part</i>. I mean, I'm not...' She pressed her lips together. 'I sense the evil in that place,' she began after a short moment, 'and I think somehow I'm part of it. Not evil, but... god, I don't know! I've got all these fragments of things in my head, I think they're memories but I don't know. They <i>feel </i>like memories.' She looked at Steve, pleading for some sort of understanding but he looked blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis right, she did sound a bit crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius, on the other hand, looked afraid. His right, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not evil,' she whispered, voice catching. 'I think... I think you need me to get through the labyrinth, Steve, but that I can't... leave it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura reached for the little flask, hands shaking. She flinched, bit back a cry, when a hand took hers, prevented her from picking up the flask. Steve froze a second too and then he let her go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I never thought you were evil,' he rasped out. Which was true, but maybe because he'd been hoping beyond hope that what he felt was wrong. 'Laura, I've known you for a long time now.' (Ten years, in fact.) 'I trust you.' He was aware he didn't sound quite convinced, and winced. 'Well, I'm doing my best.' He picked up the flask, unscrewed the cap and held the flask out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura hesitated, then took it and drew in a deep swallow. Her throat and eyes burned. Steve took two mouthfuls of his own and then he surprised Laura by holding the small silver item out to Darius. 'Alcohol,' he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius stared at him in total surprise but took the flask. He eyed the neck and sniffed it, making Steve feel just a little insulted, but then took a small mouthful. Did well not to spit it out over the low fire. He swiped the back of his hand over his mouth and held the flask out. 'Thanks,' he croaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve gave a half smile, sat the flask between his knees, and then looked at Laura. She seemed a bit more calm but maybe the alcohol was reacting quickly on himself. 'What do you mean about fragments?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Exactly that,' she murmured. 'Bits and pieces of things, nothing complete. It's like a massive puzzle I have to put together but nothing fits and bits are missing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So... how do you think you're...' Steve glanced backwards a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sagged. 'I have this really weird feeling I belong with the labyrinth. I don't know if that means I belong to the monster. I don't even know what the monster <i>is</i>, really.' She held her hands out to the fire and it flared. She gave a tiny smile toward Darius whom she knew had made that happen. 'It's like I'm part of the labyrinth; that's how I think you need me in order to get through. Like I know the way. I don't remember ever being here, but I must have been at some point.' Another shrug. Still not making sense, she was sure, but it was helping calm her in an odd way. 'And... and if I go in there with you, to help, then I can't leave. It's like a trap and home or something all in one.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve inclined his head. 'What if we don't go in?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't think you've got a choice,' Laura said quietly. 'The more I think on it, the more I feel <i>you </i>have to go through it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't want to lose you,' Steve said before quite realising it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Laura's face was beautiful for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What if I go in on my own?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No,' Laura said immediately, reaching out as if to keep Steve still. 'You will not survive.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The monster will get you,' Darius said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve scowled at him but Darius didn't back down. 'It killed <i>six men</i> in my father's mission party.' His voice cracked, and the fire dipped low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura crawled around to him and wrapped him in her arms, murmuring to him while he dragged in choppy air. Steve sucked on his lips in order to keep quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura glanced up. 'I have to go with you,' she said softly. 'I know the tricks of the maze. The monster knows things too but not as much as me.' She felt puzzled by that statement but also that it was true. The more she spoke, the more she had a feeling that she <i>was </i>the maze. And how did that make sense? The labyrinth had always existed, and she couldn't remember a moment when she wasn't human. Her head hurt. She focused for the moment on comforting Darius, was relieved that though he was wary he no longer seemed to be wary of her. As if he knew that the labyrinth and the monster were two separate things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(words: 1352) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

She had no weapon at all, bar memories feinting in and out. But she didn't think she'd be the focus of the labyrinth in any case, well, not of the monster. She glanced at Darius; he was pale and nervous, shifting on his feet. He had every right to stay behind but he'd refused. 'I want to see this monster dead,' he'd said and no one had balked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever... 'I don't mean to be insulting,' Laura said softly, 'but you might be better off in your other guise.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius' brows rose, so did Steve's. Laura felt a flush heat her face. 'I just think you might be safer that way,' she mumbled. 'No so easy to catch but also, not so noticeable.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius cocked his head now. 'I don't understand.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's lips pressed tight. 'Darius, you might be our only hope. I don't know how this is going to go, at all, but if there's trouble, you might be able to escape.' She looked over at Steve, then back at the young man. 'And perhaps bring aid.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'From whom?' Steve asked. 'I doubt anyone's just going to leap up for the task.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I don't know,' Laura returned, 'but if push comes to shove, lets not all three die!' And she stormed off a few feet, trembling, eyes filling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve looked after her and then turned back to Darius. 'Is there help you could bring?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius shook his head. 'Not from my village,' he said. 'I don't live there any more anyway, but they wouldn't come even if the King himself asked. Not now.' He rubbed a hand down his cloak-covered sleeve. 'I'm not a coward,' he said to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, well, Laura's talking some sense,' Steve grumped. 'Maybe you should stay out here. It's not your...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't tell me it's not my fight!' Darius cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve stepped back, startled by the sudden fire in the young man. 'Alright, alright, nobody's saying nothing.' He turned away, managing to keep the rest of his thoughts to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second he heard the same shuffling from last night and turned. The mongoose was glaring at him. 'Laura was talking some sense,' Darius parroted at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve frowned but nodded, then conceded that the mongoose guise was better than a half-dressed young man. He grabbed up the pants and cloak and stashed them in the pack. He caught sight of Laura returning, stopping for a second when she saw their companion's new form. Then she knelt down in front of the animal and thanked him for everything he'd done thus far. Which, Steve, thought, only went so far as keeping the fire up - though that had been a decent benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Darius replied, Steve didn't hear it as he swung the knapsack over his shoulder. Once it was secure, he stepped forward. 'Guess, the time's now?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded, rising. She gave Steve a quick kiss on the cheek. 'Keep close to me, but behind,' she said. 'Darius, you stay behind too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mongoose chittered in reply, which made Steve frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned and took a breath, then started down the corridor towards the maze entrance. Chills were chasing up and down her spine now, but she was sure that was just nerves, not the precursor of something else. Behind her Steve and Darius followed, Darius keeping to Steve's side (but not within kicking distance).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the entrance of the maze, that huge threshold stone still showing the footprint, the three of them stood for a moment. The mongoose held its head to one side, listening and Steve found himself doing the same thing. He could hear nothing. He turned to look at Laura; she was pale but seemed calm enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When you're ready,' Steve whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced a tiny smile at him. She drew in a deep breath and started forward. The dirt over the threshold swirled slightly as she stepped over it (not on it) and Steve and Darius followed, the mongoose leaping the stone. Once in, they stood still again as they considered left or right. The corridor looked the same either way and in fact it didn't look too much different from the created corridor <i>outside</i> the maze!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve kept his silence, even when the mongoose sat right at his side. Actually, Steve thought, it might pay to keep the mongoose close. Animals were suppose to be able to sense things humans couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned to face them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(word count: 769) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

In fact, left and right both looked like they just continued on and never ended. Laura knew that wasn't so. Along these inner walls there were gaps; they just couldn't see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown at Steve's feet, the mongooses chittered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Look,' Steve said, 'we don't speak mongoose.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Steve,' Laura warned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wasn't speaking,' Darius said. 'That was my teeth chattering.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head at Steve, forcing him to mutter out an apology. The mongoose moved further from him. How was it that a rodent cold make him feel so bad? Steve shook his head and looked at Laura. 'Which way should we go? I don't think standing here will do us much good.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Left,' Laura said, and made sure she sounded certain about it. As much as she wavered on which way to go, she wanted Steve and Darius to at least feel like she was backing herself. What a thin line!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve didn't query her choice and at their feet Darius remained silent. Steve snagged Laura to him and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. 'Lead on,' he said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trusted her, he had to. She had experience within the labyrinth and he didn't. Laura managed a tiny smile and they started down the left corridor, her right hand trailing lightly over the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What are we looking for?' Steve asked quietly, eyeing the wall. He saw nothing but stone. A glance down found Darius trailing beside him (not behind him) eyeing the stone at that level; probably nothing different there either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ambiguities,' Laura said. 'It looks like it goes forever, but it won't. At some point this wall will give way to another twist.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve sucked on his teeth. 'That's why you're touching it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Should we...<i> I</i>?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It might help,' Laura said with a glance over her shoulder. 'This can change in an instance. I might miss something that you catch.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay,' Steve said, and moved closer to the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe refrained from mentioning that Darius could find his human form and help out too, but he didn't really want to see a flash of nudity and have to scramble in the knapsack for clothes. Besides, he thought that Laura had been right; Darius might manage an escape if needed. Remained to be seen if he'd come <i>back</i>....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mongoose shifted sides, so that he kept on Steve's outer side, always near his feet or in front, never behind though he often looked over his shoulder. Steve presumed he was listening for things. Since he didn't ever turn around Steve presumed that what he might be hearing wasn't a problem. But then again, what did the mongoose know about the monster? Nothing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Laura,' Steve called after a moment. 'This hazy thing you mentioned you saw with your sister. Is that what we are expecting at some time?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't really know,' Laura said. Then she stopped and turned, making her companions do the same. 'I don't really know if it's the monster.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve cocked a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shrugged. 'If it <i>was </i>then how am I still here? Why didn't it suck my soul too?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve felt at a loss and ended up saying the very stupid, 'maybe it has a limit?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pretty sure the chittering from the rodent meant <i>stupid ass</i>.  He shifted a foot, which made the animal turn to him, baring his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Gentlemen,' Laura admonished, though right now neither of her companions warranted that title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mongoose came to her side, and said, 'it killed six men in my father's party, and would have kept going.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do you know how they died, Darius?' Laura asked, crouching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mongoose shook its head. 'All we were ever told was that men had died and the rest had made the bargain.' His voice dropped at the end. 'They never said <i>how</i>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And they didn't say by what?' Steve asked, crouching now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No,' Darius said, and shifted a little closer to Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wasn't going to kick you,' Steve mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat only made the creature stiffen, and earn him a frown from Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sorry,' Steve said, 'but I'm really on my wit's edge here!' <i>I'm in a dangerous maze with my girlfriend who thinks she might be the maze, I'm waiting for a monster to jump out at me and I'm talking with a giant rat!</i> Fortunately for all involved, that was all in his head. He grimaced; the day was only going to get worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We're all on edge, Steve,' Laura said but she gave a smile too lessen the blow of her words. Then she said, 'I don't know if it was the soul-sucker or something else, but if it should appear then try your best not to look at it directly.' Which felt a bit odd out loud since Laura was pretty sure she had looked at the thing directly. But it hadn't even moved toward her, just laughed. She shivered. She so didn't want to hear that sound again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was thinking that she noted the hair raise along Darius' spine and he stiffened. She opened her mouth but Steve pressed a finger to her lips. 'Quiet,' he mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't heard what Darius had but the animal was rigid; that meant there was something coming from somewhere. And as much as he might be uncomfortable with the shape changer, he had to acknowledge Darius had skills. He and Laura held their breath, watched as Darius tilted his head slightly behind them. Or, rather, behind Laura; so, to the left in the direction they'd been travelling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve strained his ears but he could hear nothing that might indicate something approached. And when he lifted his gaze at least he didn't see smoke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The wall,' Darius whispered in a very faint voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve nearly yelped out 'what wall?' but more in shock than annoyance. They were surrounded by walls and as far as he could see nothing had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That one,' Darius said and his nose poked to the left. 'Just behind Laura. It's... moved, I think.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You <i>think</i>?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Steve,' Laura admonished quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I heard a grating sound,' Darius said, 'but I can't see any different. I didn't <i>see </i>it move.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't hear anything else, Darius?' Laura whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey crouched like they were for another half minute before Steve and Laura caught each other's gaze. We can't stay here, Laura seemed to say. I know, Steve offered. Laura nodded and rose, keeping a hand on the wall. Behind her, Steve shifted his knife from one hand to the other so he could wipe the sudden sweat from his palm. Steve looked down at the mongoose. The hair wasn't so stiff along his spine any more and he appeared to have relaxed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh wow,' Laura breathed and got his attention. 'Darius was right, the wall has moved.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve watched her hand slide around an edge, while the rest of her body stayed back. She glanced over her shoulder. 'We need to follow this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, swallowing. He came up beside her and still had to look hard to see that there was indeed a gap. God, if not for the mongoose's hearing they would have missed this. Maybe it wouldn't have even happened. Steve shook his head; not the time to think about that. 'Let me look first,' he murmured, clutching the knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No,' Darius said, moving up. 'Let me. If... if something's there it won't expect me.' At least, something so low to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay,' Steve said, 'but <i>don't </i>go out of sight.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe animal blinked and Steve might have felt embarrassed just a second for saying that to a rodent! Then he watched Darius take slow, cautious steps through the gap, hesitate a long time (ten seconds!) before continuing until he stood mostly within the next section of the labyrinth. He glanced left and took a longer look right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is it?' Laura whispered, heart crashing against her ribs with concern and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A garden,' came the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Steve could prevent her, she had stepped forward and was soon staring too, her mouth open in a perfect O. That didn't leave Steve much choice! But he took his move slowly, sliding around the edge of the gap, keeping his eye on Darius and Laura for any change in their stance or gaze. But they didn't look transfixed, just surprised. And surprise on a mongoose's face was odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Steve felt his own mouth drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA garden, the mongoose had said. But that didn't really cover what they were seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA click made them all jump and Steve flung a hand out, met solid stone. 'Well,' he croaked. 'No going back that way.' And he realised Darius had taken a short look left because there was a solid wall that way. They could only go down the corridor toward the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve swallowed, then took Laura's hand a moment. Darius crouched between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(word count: 1520) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura seemed amused, which was totally out of place right here, right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What are you thinking?' Steve asked, voice low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Something I remember from my childhood,' she responded. 'Left is right, but right is wrong.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great</i>, Steve thought, <i>more riddles to mark the occasion</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, we go right?' he heard from his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced down, gaze narrowing at the mongoose who had its beady little eyes on Laura. Laura was nodding. 'Wait,' Steve said. 'You're going to go right just because of a riddle?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If you have better reasoning, Steve, now's the time to spill it.' Laura's tone tried to be light, but failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Steve was aware of the mongoose looking at him. 'I'm just saying,' Steve said stiffly. 'If \"right is wrong\" why are we going right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because if \"left is right, but right is wrong\" then left is wrong,' Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mongoose chittered, and Steve stepped away before he could react with a boot. He regarded Laura. She seemed calm, even if she was spouting riddles, and to be honest, he had absolutely nothing to tell him left or right so what right did he have to quibble. He was probably going to die either way. Right at least sounded a bit more positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay then,' he said, 'right it is.' He took a step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pegged him back. 'Me first,' she said. 'And, Steve, please, if I tell you to do something don't question it. You either, Darius,' she added, pointing at the mongoose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alright.' Steve frowned and the mongoose glared. They'd said that in unison, and now Laura had a tiny smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve sucked in a breath, tightened his hold on his knife. 'Lead on,' he said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura squeezed his arm, realised this would be hard for him. He was the \"man\" after all, needed to be a hero. Well, he'd probably get that chance sooner rather than later anyway, but Laura would do her best to keep them safe until then. If she was part of the labyrinth like she thought, she wasn't sure how long it would be before she'd <i>really </i>start to become it. Physically. She ran a hand over the smooth grey stone with her left hand. Majestic and cold all in one.<i> I'd have used limestone</i>, she thought, <i>if I'd built this</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head of that stupid thought. A labyrinth was never designed to be warm and welcoming! And she had to keep her mind clear, in any case, so she could cope when those memories came clean in her head. She could feel them pushing at the edges of her mind, like a tentative finger poking at something unknown. Like when she and her sister had poked the jelly puddings. Laura hesitated mid stride, but continued before Steve could notice and speak. Sister. <i>Oh my god, I have a sister</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow had she forgotten that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura frowned to herself, straining through the mist of memories. There she was, emerald-eyed Rena. Good heavens, how had that memory been hidden? Her <i>sister</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with it came a flood of other memories, including the day she and Sam had come home from their date to find Rena had taken up a dare and entered the labyrinth. And had had her mind sucked dry by... Laura drew in a long, long breath, trying to calm herself down. She remembered now - a hazy, smokey thing with distorted limbs, a vague human shape but not all in one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If you see smoke, try not to look directly at it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve yelped out 'what?' in startlement at the sudden noise and at what he'd heard. A squeak had him shift sideways and he realised he'd stepped back and trod on the mongoose's foot. The mongoose was giving him a look he didn't really appreciate. 'Hey, I didn't mean that!' he got out quickly, annoyed, and hoping like heck the rodent wouldn't bite him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura took his arm to hush him, waggled a finger at Darius who had crouched low to the ground as if to protect himself. She apologised herself, and then crouched down too, drawing Steve with her. He didn't look at all comfortable and she probably wasn't about to make him any less uncomfortable. 'I've remembered something,' she said quietly and revealed what she'd recalled about her sister. 'The monster was there - at least what I thought was the monster. No one had really seen it before and survived to describe it. But it was hazy, a smokey sort of form. Vaguely human but with distorted limbs. Not solid anyway.' She swallowed and looked at Darius. 'Did you father or the others ever describe what they'd seen?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No,' Darius said. 'They refused to say anything about it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did the men who died,' Laura began. 'Were they left in the maze?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mongoose seemed to freeze for a second, eyes glassy. Then its tail curved around its body is what looked like a defensive gesture. Steve felt himself stiffen but he heard nothing but their own breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes,' Darius said. 'They were left there.' He looked left and right as if he might suddenly be faced with them. 'I hadn't thought about them still being here. Surely they...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The monster sucks souls,' Laura said quietly. 'I don't think he needs the bodies. My sister was put back into the maze.' She screwed her eyes closed at that memory. 'She might still be here, for all I know; the men of your village too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mongoose looked like it might be sick, which was a fascinating sight. Before Steve knew what he was doing, he'd reached out and stroked down the animal's back. Darius flinched but his teeth didn't show, perhaps because Steve said, 'it'll be okay,' at the same time he'd touched the mongoose. Honestly, he didn't know what was wrong with him. He got out a wry smile, but felt a little okay at Laura's smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura apologised quietly. 'I didn't mean to hurt you, Darius, I just wanted to warn you it might happen.' She was worried about it herself, remembered she'd worried about it long ago when her sister had been left there 'I can't...' She shushed herself. She'd been going to say that she couldn't sense them, but even if she <i>was </i>part of the labyrinth, without a soul a person didn't really exist. She wouldn't be able to sense them like that. And, really, she wasn't sure if she could sense <i>any</i>one else in the maze anyway. She didn't now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Anyway,' she said after a moment of silence. 'If you see a hazy thing, look away.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve and Darius both assured her they would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't tell them she'd looked the thing in the face because she couldn't explain why she was still here. And sane. <i>At least, I think I'm sane.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay,' she said. 'Let's carry on.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose, rubbed a knee free of dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(word count: 1157) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

You must too'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve considered her, and Laura said softly, 'you've got that feeling about the darkness and I don't.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not sure we should be playing a tit or tat game here,' Steve commented, and then sighed. Laura was right on a certain level. She didn't know half about the darkness that he did and he certainly hadn't revealed everything to her. If she pushed, and found that out then she'd have even more reason to keep quiet herself. And... 'Yeah, I feel something evil in there.' He nodded at the stone wall in front of them, moss creeping up the mortar. A daisy-like flower sprouted out about half way up, and he stared at it like it was a total oddity. Well, it seemed like one. Something so pretty in a place like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve sighed, and then he caught sight of a mouse rounding the corner and tracking toward them. It huddled close to the wall. 'There's the monster,' he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gave a soft giggle into his neck, and they watched the mouse scuttle passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Probably should have caught it,' Steve said. 'Could have eaten it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Steve!' Laura slapped his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve had only been half kidding, though it probably wouldn't have done them much good. He changed the subject. 'Have you seen the monster in the labyrinth?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No,' Laura said. 'Have you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course not.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then why do you think <i>I </i>have? Just because I know that it sucks souls?' Laura straightened off Steve's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No,' he said, even if it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura eyed him a moment before shifting closer to the pathetic excuse for a fire. It didn't provide much warmth but the brightness at least gave a tiny bit of cheer. Laura frowned, stupid memories just out of reach again. Except for the one that let her know the monster's soul-sucking punishments. 'I had a sister,' she began and then stopped, shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, Steve was silent. Laura bowed her head, drew in a breath. 'I had a sister,' she said again, 'until she strayed into the maze one day.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve drew in a sharp breath, and Laura turned. He reached for her and she readily moved back to his side, let him put his arms around her. 'I'm so sorry,' he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It was years ago,' Laura said. 'I was no more than fifteen, Rena twelve. Always a sprite, she was, getting into trouble. Getting me into trouble too.' Laura felt a smile try to pull her lips up. These memories were unhindered by blocks and corners and dark spaces. Sometimes she wished that wasn't so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve waited, finally realising that to get Laura to talk required silence on his part and patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There are very many entrances to this labyrinth,' Laura began again, after a while, stating a fact Steve knew. 'There was one just a couple of miles from our village. The best pasture lay beside the maze, and we grazed sheep there. They never wandered in; animals have a sixth sense about danger, you know. I was never particularly bothered about the place either though I knew not to go near the entrance. Our parents had always told us stories about young people being forced inside by some magical pull of power, how roars of things unknown could be heard. Well, you know how it goes,' Laura said, twining hands with Steve. 'On the one hand we all stayed away, on the other we secretly egged each other on, though no one was ever brave enough to test theory. Not until my sister.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura closed her eyes. She'd been on a date with a handsome young man and what a perfect day it had been, until they'd come home to find the place in an uproar. Rena and a couple of her friends had been playing jacks with stupid dares. Someone had dared Rena to step over the threshold of the maze. Rena being Rena, and without Laura there to act as her common sense, had taken up the dare. Especially since one of the rewards was a kiss from the boy she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve maintained his silence, couldn't say the sister was silly because he'd done stupid dares at that age for much the same reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When Rena stepped over the threshold, nothing happened,' Laura began again. 'So they egged her to go further and she did. Apparently she stepped out of sight and didn't come back. No one dared go in after her. When Samuel and I returned, she'd been gone about a half hour and no one had dared even get our parents.' Laura realised she had tightened her grip on Steve's hand, and let go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he didn't speak she watched him flex his crunched fingers. Then he curved his hand around hers. 'You went in, didn't you?' he asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded. 'She was my only sister, I couldn't not.' She drew in a deep breath. 'She wasn't far from the entrance, just a couple of feet down a corridor. Out of sight but they'd have found her if they'd <i>looked</i>. Just kneeling on the ground, eyes wide open.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't dead. She'd blinked when Laura had called her name but there was no recognition in her gaze. A grey haze of smoke seemed to waft around her and as Laura had drawn closer, the haze coalesced into a shape. Horribly human, but distorted in the limbs so that the arms were massive. It seemed to take on solidity and then reverted to haziness, held its ground when Laura screamed at it to back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It laughed,' Laura said in an odd voice. 'When I told it to back off, to leave Rena alone it laughed, and said it was too late. She'd paid the price. I didn't know quite what it meant then. We still thought the soul-sucking was part of a myth. But once I got Rena outside of the maze and lay her on the ground, I realised. Her gaze was blank, nothing...' Laura shrugged, not quite able to explain what she'd seen. 'The colour was gone too. Rena had gorgeous green eyes but they were milky grey. The village doctors could do nothing and no form of magical charm they knew helped. Rena was a husked, somehow living still but soulless.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura drew in a deep breath and let it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did she die?' Steve asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know,' Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Steve could question that answer, Laura revealed the final piece of that puzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The doctors said she was cursed and recommended that our parents put her back into the labyrinth. She could not harm us there - as long as we stayed away.' Laura swallowed a lump. 'They did it, they believed the doctors and dad and another man put her back in the maze. They said she never said a word or moved or anything. She... she might still b-be there. My s-sister...' Laura broke down into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve tightened his arms around her, horrified at the images invading his mind. He was sorry he'd asked, but he also felt a little more calm. These memories were what was making Laura nervous and uncomfortable around the labyrinth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A couple of days after they left her there,' Laura broke into his thoughts, 'I left the village. I couldn't stay there and think of Rena so close to me and yet so far away, just lying on the ground. For all I know, she's still there and I... it's my fault.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What? How?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I should have been watching her,' Laura cried softly. 'Sam and I were only supposed to be away for a couple of hours, but we were way half the day. If I'd...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No!' Steve cut her off. 'It's not your fault, Laura. Don't think it is. Your sister sounds very strong willed; you wouldn't have been able to stop her from that dare. I'm sure of it!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sniffed. Probably, that was right, but it didn't stop the guilt. God, she'd done so well burying that memory and those feelings they now sliced at her as if just yesterday, as if the fifteen years of guilt she had buried was giving her a one-day hit. And yet those other memories, the ones that made her feel like she was connected to the maze somehow stayed just blurs in her mind. Rather like that smokey haze that had hovered over her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura cried herself to sleep on Steve's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(words: 1431) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was so much worse when you were tired but couldn't sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat for a moment, hearing Laura's soft even breathing near his ear, feeling the rise and fall of her breathing within his embrace. God, what a horrible memory she'd just revealed. And he hadn't had any inkling of her close attachment to the labyrinth, outside what she'd already revealed. They'd been together three years at least and she'd never said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again... they'd never had any need to discus the labyrinth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve ran his tongue over his teeth and recalled what Laura had said. Mostly that she hadn't seen the monster, but then had said she'd seen the hazy thing with her sister. Well, that didn't mean they were one and the same and by the time Laura had reached her sister her soul was already gone. Perhaps the hazy beast had been there for another reason?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver shunted down Steve's spine. Laura hadn't mentioned that her father and the others had seen the creature when they'd put Rena back into the labyrinth. God... what a harsh thing to have done. And to have done it while kids looked on! Steve brushed hair back off Laura's forehead and sighed in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shifted slowly, until she was curled on her side, had on the knapsack. He settled his cloak over her, tucked it around for warmth, then slowly rose. While she was sleeping he was going to check out a bit of the corridor they now found themselves in. He felt almost certain the wall had sprung up to force them into the labyrinth but if so, why hadn't it closed off the ends? They could still wander along either way, perhaps come to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to recall what he knew of the labyrinth. It was immense, yes, had several entrances (and therefore exits) and seemed to always be this grey stone. Smooth as if it was just one large block, though Steve was certain he'd seen it at times looking like ashlar masonry put together. Man made? Legend always said there was a Creator, but a magic sort rather than human. That was how the place distorted, shifted, changed depending on who was looking at it. Damn it, it was how a stonking great stone wall had slid up blocking their retreat into the forest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone was, unsurprisingly, cool to Steve's touch as he trailed it along the wall. A light layer of dust on parts of it where dirt had stuck and become rather like stone, letting dust pile up. Ivy plants climbed from the ground but as far as Steve could see it never reached the top of the wall. Thought there'd been ivy at the entrance, Steve was also pretty sure none of the ivy that might be growing on the inside of the labyrinth had climbed over the wall. Once they were in the maze they wouldn't be climbing the walls to escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve swapped sides to get a closer look at the new wall but frankly it didn't look or feel any different to that of the maze. And for a moment Steve wasn't sure which wall he was focusing on. He bent over his knees for a moment. Then he heard Laura calling for him, and he hurried back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting up, looking around. The remnants of the fire showed the panic on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm here, I'm here,' Steve called as he came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't leave me like that,' Laura cried, reaching out for him. 'I heard noises and you weren't here!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry,' Steve said, kneeling and holding her tight. 'I just wanted to do a bit of sleuthing, checking the walls. Did you have a nightmare?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No,' she said, 'not until I woke and didn't see you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve apologised again, said he'd stay beside her this time. As he settled more comfortably he asked the question on his mind. 'Laura, you said you'd not seen the monster.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I haven't.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then what was the hazy thing you described?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not the monster,' Laura said. 'It <i>can't </i>have been. Surely I wouldn't be here if it was? Why would it let me take Rena?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremble in her voice told Steve she was hurt at the accusation, but he'd had to ask, to get it clear in his mind. 'I don't know,' he murmured. 'Maybe it didn't need you? Or maybe it wanted you to take her, to show the others?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's... horrible,' Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it was, and it gave the monster some sort of brain activity that Steve wasn't comfortable with, a cunning. And a little tiny part of his brain wondered if Laura hadn't been affected <i>some</i>how. The sensible part of his brain told him that of course she had been affected. She'd seen her sister vacant! She'd seen her father heed \"warnings\" and put her sister back into the maze. Who wouldn't be affected by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'God, Steve,' Laura sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve apologised again, and wrapped her tighter in his arms. 'Honey, try to sleep again. I'll be right here. Tomorrow's another day. Things will be better in the dawn.' Wished he could sound a little more confident about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was still a moment, then she wiggled more into his space and let out a sigh. 'I love you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I love you,' he said and hoped it be enough to get them through tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow when things were supposed to be better, but also when they were going to go into the labyrinth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(word count: 940) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm beginning to wonder if maybe you think I'm blond.\" <br>\r\n\"Blond?\" Steven said as the darkness crept up behind him. \"What does that mean.\" Steve wasn't about to say he knew the old joke about blonds not being too smart. \"There's nothing wrong with blonds. Some of my best friends are blond.\" <br>\r\nLaura chucked. \"Sure, Steve, I believe that.\" <br>\r\nAs Steve and Laura were talking, they didn't notice the set of burning green eyes that flanked their path. As they moved the two forward, so did the eyes. <br>\r\n\"Did you see that?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n\"See what?\" Steve said. He looked around trying to figure out what Laura was talking about, but saw nothing except the fact that the flame was indeed slowly extinguishing itself. <br>\r\n\"I thought I saw something, that's all.\" Laura didn't want Steve to think she was being paranoid so she just ignored what she saw. Maybe I didn't really see anything, Laura told herself. Stop being such a little girl. <br>\r\nAs they traipsed further, the darkness crept closer to them with each step they took. Laura noticed that things were getting darker and darker, but telling Steve would only cause an argument, so she remained quiet. <br>\r\nSuddenly the torch gave one last blast of light and blinked out.<br>\r\n\"What the heck?\" Steve said and lowered the torch as if he would be able to see what was wrong. And that's when he saw that thousands of bright green eyes surrounded them in the dark forest. \"Oh my God,\" he mumbled and began backing away.<br>\r\nLaura, finding herself in total darkness turned around but Steven wasn't there anymore. She reached out as she began walking back the way they came, until she touched something slimy and cold. Whatever it was opened its eyes and Laura screamed, as the monster pulled her until her body was absorbed by it. <br>\r\nSteven gave a scream and as he slowly disappeared the monster who grew bigger with Steven's body inside of him opened his eyes to reveal flames of green eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 414 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

'Look, you have to pull yourself together, sis.\" He looked around slowly. \"There is no one out there but us.\"<br>\r\nLaura bounced on the balls of her feet. \"Why don't you ever believe anything I say?\" She exhaled loudly. \"I'm telling you, there is someone out there,\" her gaze scanned the dark woods. \"I just know it, Steven.\" <br>\r\nSteven frowned. \"Come on, Laura. We must be at least halfway out of here,\" he said. \"It's probably the same distance whether we go forward to is we turn back.\" He ran a hand through his dark hair. \"If we keep moving in that direction,\" Laura followed Steven's arm as he pointed in the direction they were headed. \"we're bound to find our way out of here.\" <br>\r\nLaura's shoulders sagged as she let out another long sigh. <br>\r\n\"I just want to go home, that's all.

What language would you talk to them in \u2013 the Lightish cum English?\u201d she blurted the worst joke of her life, but it was probably speaking and not she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will see,\u201d said Steven with a conviction which made Laura stop and watch him. There was something in the way he said it, as if he  knew something which he didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven simply folded his palms, closed his eyes and bowed his heads. A few deep breaths later, he said,<br>\r\n\u201cWe all are a part of this cosmic energy which surrounds us and protect us and we know that you too feel the same way,\u201d Steven smiled which made Laura believe that he was fooling around with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow stop it, Stevie. Are you cra-\u201c But before Laura could finish what she was saying she heard a buzzing grow near her. A buzzing which was not gibberish but felt like it meant something as it had a kind of a rhythmic pattern to it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no words, no vowels just plain vibrations in the air which seemed to connect to the soul and soothe it. She concentrated even harder into the buzzing sound, trying to take it more and more; and the buzzing reciprocated as it went into her body, her soul, her heart and every strand of her living consciousness. It was a joy beyond anything she had experienced till that time. Such was the purity in that state that something in her consciousness knew that this is how it felt to be united with a superior cosmic power, a superior energy source. She felt a lump building in her throat as if being overwhelmed by the constant washing of her soul. Tear welled up his eyes \u2013 tear of absolute bliss \u2013 and a catharsis hit her as she broke down. The more she gave into that power the more the buzzing grew in her head and more it didn\u2019t sound like buzzing anymore but like a message from the higher powers. <br>\r\nIn no time, she had totally surrendered herself into that sound, totally forgetting who she was, what her purpose was, where Daniel was and all she remembered was she was a soul in a body rather than body in a soul. Now, she could hear the message echoing in her heart too. It said \u2013 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaughter, come to the Lord and give in yourself for you are the Savior and you are the Saved. Leader of the lights shall lead to the Light itself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message echoed in her heart like forever and now as she felt peace like never before, she slowly opened her eyes to see a scene she was not going to forget in a hurry. The Green source of lights \u2013 the Hararas \u2013 had carefully arranged them all around Steven and formed a halo on top of his head. And what to say about herself? The Hararas had not only arranged them all around her but formed a wing like formation around her which gave her an angelic look. In the purest sense of the word, the Hararas  looked as if they were nothing but the extension of their individual auras. She moved towards Steven who was appreciating the scene and probably wondering about the reason behind it all. What were the Hararas trying to say to them? Were they angels from heaven? He certainly didn\u2019t remember anything like this. Laura got her out of his trance like state as she approached Steven. Steven looked at Laura and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, I could talk to them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou talked to them alright,\u201d said Laura, winking at Steven. The Hararas were now slowly disappearing, as if they had met the purpose they had come for. Hararas might have left but that feeling of calmness, of completeness and that of being blessed didn\u2019t leave Laura or Steven for one bit. Neither did that question leave them which echoed in their head \u2013 <br>\r\n\u201cWhy were they called as Leader of the Lights?\u201d<br>\r\nSteven clasped Laura\u2019s hand and said-<br>\r\n\u201cShall we get moving, dear?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded along, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(693 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

There were no words, just the sound of an organ, but it was a human voice. Laura looked at Steven in surprise as he slowly sank down onto his knees and sat back against his heels. Laura did the same. <br>\r\n\"Can you hear that?\" Steven asked, his voice filled with awe. <br>\r\n\"Of course I can hear it,\" Laura replied. \"My God, it's beautiful, whatever it is.\" <br>\r\n\"It sounds like a voice, but it also sounds like an organ.\" Steven began to slowly sway with the soft, slowly changing rhythm of the sound. \"It's an angel, and she's singing,\" he said. <br>\r\nLaura and Steve fell silent as they listened to the singing. They closed their eyes, no longer afraid that someone, or something, might sneak up on them in the dark. The beautiful sound lulled them and made them both feel safe. <br>\r\n\"I can't make out where it's coming from, Laura,\" Steven asked. \"Can you?\"<br>\r\nLaura tilted her head and listened intently for a moment, then she turned and looked at Steven, her eyes focused on something far away. \"It's coming from everywhere, Steven,\" she said, her voice dreamy. <br>\r\n\"I think you're right,\" Steven replied. <br>\r\nThe singing grew louder, but the softness in the voice remained, nudging Laura and Steven further into the trance that had overtaken them. The voice rose to a crescendo, its high pitch never wavering, and then it softened further as the volume of the voice lowered. <br>\r\n\"I have never heard anything like it before,\" Laura said. <br>\r\n\"Me either,\" Steven replied. <br>\r\n\"You are safe with me.\" <br>\r\nSteven opened his ears and looked at Laura. \"What did you say?\"<br>\r\nLaura's eyes opened slowly. \"I didn't say anything.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, you did,\" Steven said, but his eyes were narrowed with uncertainty. \"Didn't you?\" <br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Steven,\" Laura said. \"I'm just listening to that angelic voice. It's the most beautiful thing I have ever heard.\" <br>\r\n\"I know,\" Steven said as his gaze slowly scanned the dark clearing where they knelt. \"But I heard something.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, the voice, the beautiful voice that is singing.\" <br>\r\n\"No,\" Steven said too quickly. \"No, I mean yes, I can hear the singing. But I heard another voice. Just as soft and soothing. But it said something.\" <br>\r\n\"What did it say?\" Laura asked. <br>\r\n\"It said, 'you are safe with me.'\" Steven combed his fingers through his hair. \"Didn't your hear it?\" <br>\r\n\"No,\" Laura said. \"Are you sure you heard something? Couldn't you just be mistaken? I mean it has been one heck of a long day.\" Laura's gaze lingered on Steven. <br>\r\nAfter a short minute, Steven replied. \"Maybe it was my imagination after all.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, maybe,\" Laura said. <br>\r\nLaura and Steven remained silent as the singing continued. There were no words, only the sweet tones of what had to be an angel. <br>\r\n\"You are safe with me.\" <br>\r\n\"There it is again,\" Steven said as his eye shot open. \"You must have heard it that time, Laura.\" Steven turned and looked at Laura and he felt a sudden fear grip his stomach. Laura's eyes were so wide Steven was afraid her eyes would pop right out of her head. <br>\r\n\"What is it, Laura?\" When Laura didn't respond, Steven followed her gaze off into the dark. There was nothing there for him to see. \"Laura?\" Steven reached out and touched Laura's upper arm. Her skin felt warm, very warm, and it felt like her entire body was vibrating. \"Laura, are you okay?\" <br>\r\nA slow smile began to work its way across Laura's lips. Her eyes softened and she tilted her head. Steven had never seen her so relaxed. She had never looked so at peace, and that made him feel strange when he asked if she was okay. She was obviously okay, more than okay from what Steven could see. <br>\r\n\"You look like one of those paintings,\" he said. Laura slowly turned her soft gaze on Steven.<br>\r\n\"What paintings are you talking about?\" Her voice was soft, just above a whisper, and seemed to come from far away. <br>\r\n\"The ones we see in churches, you know, the ones painted hundreds of years ago. The sky opening up in a rapture, winged angels coming down from the heavens, and the people looking up with an adoring gaze at the whole scene. That's what you look like now.\" Steven leaned in closer to Laura and looked into her eyes. \"Are you sure you feel okay?\" <br>\r\n\"I have never felt better, Steven.\" Laura kept her gaze on Steven, the soft, adoring smile remained unchanged, her eyes sparkled like ice. <br>\r\n\"You are safe with me,\" the soft voice said again. But this time, Laura turned her gaze to the place where she believed the voice had come from.<br>\r\n\"So, you did hear it that time,\" Steven said. <br>\r\n\"Yes, Steven,\" Laura said softly. \"It's the angel.\" <br>\r\n\"How can you tell?\" Steven asked. \"How do you know?\"<br>\r\n\"I just can,\" Laura replied. \"I can't explain it, but I feel so peaceful, as if nothing can harm me.\" She looked around the clearing where they knelt and a smile stretched her lips. \"I'm not even  afraid of being here anymore.\" Laura put her hand on Steven's shoulder and pushed herself up. \"I think the voice is coming from over there,\" she pointed into the darkness. <br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Steven called after her, as Laura began walking away. \"Where are you going?\" <br>\r\n\"I want to see her,\" Laura said. \"I want to talk to her.\" <br>\r\n\"Laura, you don't know what you're doing.\" Steven grasped Laura's arm, but she tugged it away and kept walking. \"This could be a trick,\" Steven said. \"With all the strange things that have been happening around here today, this could be anything.\" <br>\r\n\"I don't think so, Steven,\" Laura said in a soft voice Steven had never heard her use before. \"It's okay, I just know it is. It's safe.\" <br>\r\nSteven jogged a couple of steps to catch up with Laura, but stayed one step behind her just in case something wasn't as it seemed. He felt the same things Laura obviously felt. There had been an unmistakable peace that settled in his mind when the singing began. He felt no fear, felt no reason to be afraid. The only unsettling thing about him now was that little sliver of caution that he seemed to have been born with. While the rest of him let go, allowed the peace and tranquility to envelope him, that one sliver, call it an instinct to stay alive, whatever, but there was that one little thing that kept him vigilant. <br>\r\n\"You are safe with me,\" the voice said again. <br>\r\nBut this time the angelic voice sounded as if it was coming from further away. Was it leading them? Was it getting them to follow it? If so, why? And where was it taking them? <br>\r\n\"Wait, Laura,\" Steven called after her. \"We don't know what's happening here. Let's go slow until we understand what's going on.\" <br>\r\nLaura stopped walking and turned her body around to face Steven head on. An eerie smile played on her lips, and her eyes seemed to be completely unfocused. Her lips began moving, but no sound came out. Steven rushed to Laura and grasped her by the shoulders. Shaking her gently, Steven said, \"Laura, snap out of it. Please. You're scaring me.\" <br>\r\n\"You are safe with me.\" <br>\r\nThe voice sounded like the person speaking was standing right next to Steven, he even thought he could feel the person's breath as she spoke. <br>\r\n\"You heard her, Steven,\" Laura said, trancelike. \"We're safe with her.\" She shrugged Steven's hands away he stood still as he watched her slowly walk into the darkness. <br>\r\nThe darkness swallowed Laura as she walked away. Steven wasn't sure what to do. Should he follow her? Should he remain where he was in case something went wrong. <br>\r\n\"You are safe with me,\" the voice said again. But instead of feeling a sense of peace, Steven felt a wave of cold fill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1354 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Up ahead, Steven and Laura were unaware of what was going on behind them, as the lights slowly undulated in a language only they understood. It was when Laura turned around that she saw something that stopped her cold.<br>\r\n\"Steven,\" Laura said, looking back over her shoulder. \"I think we should g...\" Her eyes widened as her words trailed off into silence. Steven frowned and followed Laura's gaze but saw nothing.<br>\r\n\"What do you think you see now,\" he said, his voice filled with impatience. <br>\r\n\"Steven,\" Laura replied testily. \"I don't <i>think</i> I see something, I <i>know</i> I saw something.\" She pointed into the now dark woods. <br>\r\nSteven let out a long exhale and turned, his eyes searching the darkness as he spoke. \"Where? I don't see anything.\" <br>\r\n\"They were there, I saw them,\" Laura said as her gaze scanned the darkness. \"That is,\" she said thoughtfully, \"until they went out.\"<br>\r\n\"Went out,\" Steven said. \"What are you talking about. Who went out?\" Steven turned back to Laura. \"What does the even mean?\" <br>\r\nLaura's eyes continued to scan the dark woods, and her voice sounded like she was thinking of something else as she spoke. \"When I turned around I saw these little greenish dots of light, several of them.\" She turned to Steven as if seeing him for the first time. \"Steven, I know what I saw. When they knew I could see them they blinked out.\" <br>\r\n\"So let me see if I have this right?\" Steven said. He put his forefinger and thumb together and used his thumb to each finger as he ticked off the list. \"One, you thought you saw something, or, no, wait, you thought you felt the presence of someone. Two, we move on and the little niggling voice in your head says, 'hey, there's something out there.' And three, and most important because I think you still want to turn around and you know I don't want to. And four, and this is a goodie, you say you turned around and saw, what was it you said? Several little green lights? And they're following us, I suppose.\" <br>\r\nAs Steven talked, he watched Laura's eyes slowly widen and focus over his shoulder. Slowly a greenish glow began to reflect in Laura's eyes. Steven's eyes now began to widen, and then he slowly turned around, fearful of what he might see. <br>\r\nThe light emitted a slow hum, as Steven's eyes fell upon it. It hovered at eye level with Steven, its glow reflecting from Steven's eyes and staining his skin with an unearthly greenish glow. <br>\r\n\"What the heck?\" Steven said.<br>\r\nLaura stepped behind Steven, hiding herself from view. Steven could feel her trembling behind him.<br>\r\nSteven stared at the light. Funny, he told himself. I'm staring right into the bright light but yet it's not hurting my eyes. His private reverie was interrupted by Laura who was cowering behind him.<br>\r\n\"Steven?\" she said slowly. \"Now do you believe me? Can we just go back<i> now</i>?\" <br>\r\nSteven didn't answer, he just stared into the light hovering just out of reach in front of him. Slowly, a smile began to stretch his lips. He tilted his head and reached out, forefinger pointing, and tried to touch the light, but the light back even more out of reach. <br>\r\n\"Steven!\" Laura said as her head peeked around Steven's shoulder. \"Don't antagonize it. It might be dangerous.\" <br>\r\n\"Dangerous?\" Steven chuckled. \"If it wanted to hurt us we'd already be.... well, we'd already be hurt.\" <br>\r\n\"Maybe it wants to take us captive,\" Laura said as she tucked herself behind Steven again. \"What if it wants to take us up to his space ship.\" She gasped. \"Oh, my God. What if it takes us up there and they do all these crazy experiments on us. Poking and prodding, sticking needles and things in us?\" She paused and her eyes widened even more. \"Steven, oh my God. What other things might they to us, to me?\" <br>\r\nBy now several more things had come out of hiding and were hovering in front of Steven. Steven couldn't have explained it even if his life depended on it, but he suddenly felt safe. Somehow he knew he did not need to fear these lights. It was then he remembered the old folk tale. \"Only, as it turns out, it's not a folk tale,\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n\"Did you just curse, Steven!\" Laura said quickly. \"Just because we're lost out here in the woods about to be eaten alive or taken to some alien space ship, that you can start using dirty words.\" <br>\r\n\"I said folk tales, f o l k. And we're not going to be eaten alive or taken anywhere, least of all to some space ship that you just conjured up in your imagination.\" His shoulders sagged with relaxation. \"They're friendly, and I think I know who they are. If I'm right then we have nothing to fear. They might even help us get out of here.\" <br>\r\n\"Now who's imagination is conjuring things, Steven,\" Laura said as she took another peek at the lights hovering off the ground in front of Steven. \"And how do you know they're friendly?\"<br>\r\n\"Think about it Laura,\" Steven said, his voice light and friendly. \"Don't you think that if they intended us harm that they would already have done something to us?\" He turned back to the lights. \"No, they're friendly, and I think they are that bunch of people that came to live in the woods but one day just vanished.\" <br>\r\n\"Vanished?\" Laura said. \"You mean like one day they were here and the next they were gone?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, vanished, just like I said.\" Steven stared at the lights in front of him.<br>\r\n\"So one morning they got up, packed up their stuff and walked away,\" Laura said. \"People do it all the time.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, of course I know that,\" Steven said. \"But they didn't pack their stuff. They left it just as if they had intended to come back. Bed rolls were still stretched out near where they kept a camp fire burning. Pot and pans were lined up near what had been their small, outdoor kitchen, some with food still in them. Their clothes were still here, piles of clothes where I heard anyone of them could select anything they wanted to wear.\" Steven turned to Laura. \"Don't you see, they vanished. There never was an explanation. The village people had been coming up here and bringing them food, clothing, things like that. The campers and the village people got along very well, some even became friends.\" Steven turned back toward the light and spoke, his voice thoughtful and his words slow. \"No, this is them, I just know it. Something happened to those people, something we just don't understand. Something turned those people into what we are now looking at. <br>\r\nThe lights began to move up and down with a definite rhythm, their humming increased. A feeling of friendship rolled over Steven, something he couldn't explain.<br>\r\n\"Steven, I think you've lost your mind.\" Laura peeked again around Steven's shoulder. \"Let's just turn around and walk away. Maybe if they know we are just looking for a way out and not here to stay they won't bother us.\" <br>\r\n\"You mean, tell them were not taking their land, we're just passing through,\" Steven's voice was filled with sarcasm. \"Just like the blue coats did with the Indians?  Is that what you mean?\"  <br>\r\n\"No, Steven, that's not what I mean.\" Laura stepped out from behind Steven. She stood with her hands on her hips, her legs wide apart, her posture aggressive, a scowl on her face. \"Shoo, go away,\" she said to the lights. The lights just moved to the side so they could see Laura better. She moved back behind Steven and tucked herself behind him for protection again. <br>\r\n\"I'm sure of it, Laura,\" Steven said, his voice sounded far away. \"It's them, those people from so long ago.\" <br>\r\n\"S t e v e nnnn, Laura said. <br>\r\n\"No, really, let me tell you about them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1380 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Before long, she could no longer be seen. Her feet banged against roots that protruded upward above the ground. She slid on something slimy and lost her footing. Falling to the ground in a heap, Laura screamed. \"Steeeveeennnn!\" <br>\r\nHer scream, it's high pitch like a death rattle, made all living creatures in the forest fall silent. <br>\r\nLaura found herself lying prone on the ground, her ankle throbbing beneath her hands that were kneading the soreness. As she looked around, she could hear thrashing, as if someone was making his way toward her. <br>\r\n\"Who goes there?\" she asked. \"Who is there?\" <br>\r\n\"It's me, Laura,\" a disembodied voice said. \"Little Jack Horner.\" <br>\r\n\"Who?\" Laura's voice was just above a whisper. <br>\r\n\"Little Jack Horner,\" the voice said, coming closer. \"You know, the little boy who sat in the corner, eating his curds and way.\" <br>\r\n\"Is this some kind of a joke?\" Laura asked. <br>\r\n\"No,\" Mr. Horner said. \"And if it is a joke, it's not a very funny one.\" <br>\r\n\"What would make you say that?\" Laura replied. <br>\r\n\"Well, for starters, there are many hunters in these woods tonight.\" Mr. Horner looked around the darkness nervously. <br>\r\n\"Hungers?\" Laura asked, fear brightening her eyes. \"Why are there hunters here at night? No one is allowed to hunt at night.\" <br>\r\n\"Then I can see that you are not aware of the game.: Little Jack Horner said.<br>\r\n\"The game?\" Laura said. \"What game is that? And why are people playing games in the woods at night?\"<br>\r\n\"I think it's mostly because people are busy with their jobs during the day,\" Horner replied. \"You know, people need to make a living.\" <br>\r\n\"So they can play games at night?\" Laura asked. \"In the woods?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, especially the game everyone has been so busy with over the last month.\" <br>\r\n\"What game is that?\" Laura asked. \"One that takes up so much of people's time must be really special.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, it is, Laura,\" Mr. Horner said. \"It is for sure. <br>\r\n\"Can you tell me what this game is while you patch up my ankle?\" Laura flinched when Little Jack Horner's fingers came into contact with the soft flesh of her ankle. <br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Little Jack Horner said as a light came on in his eyes. He could feel his excitement burst as he touched Laura's soft, warm, ankle. When she flinched in pain from his touch, a spear of excitement pierced him. <br>\r\n\"Go ahead, then, Jack Horner,\" Laura said. \"You can multi-task can't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Multi-task?\" Horner said. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n\"That's when you do more than one thing at a time,\" Laura said and smiled. \"like now. You can massage my ankle, work the pain out of it, and still you can tell me about this game you speak of.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" Little Jack Horner said with a smile. \"The Throne Game.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, is that what it's called?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Little Horner said. \"The Game of Thrones.\" <br>\r\nLaura smiled shyly as Jack's fingers stroked the warm flesh of her ankle. \"That's a catchy name.\"<br>\r\n\"But the game involves so much work, Laura,\" Little Jack Horner replied. <br>\r\n\"Really?\" Laura said and tipped her head to the side. \"Like what kind of work?\" <br>\r\nLittle Jack Horner ticked off each item as he spoke. \"Well, there's those things they call spoils.\" <br>\r\n\"Spoils?\" Laura said as if she had just sucked on something sour. \"Why would they call them spoils? That sound so yucky.\"  <br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Jack Horner said. \"It has nothing to do with food or anything like that.\" <br>\r\n\"Well what is it then?\"<br>\r\n\"Each day of the month it's either someone's birthday,\" Little Jack Horner said, \"Or it's some kind of an anniversary.\" He cleared his throat. \"So if you find out who's birthday or anniversary is and you do something good for them--\"<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Laura interrupted.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, exactly,\" Horner said. \"Things like reading them a bedtime story, or making dropping them a little note under their door.\" Little Jack Horner paused for a moment, and then continued. \"Or maybe you could send them either a birthday or anniversary card.. Things like that would get a player points.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, my,\" Laura said distastefully. \"I've heard about players. Those guys are not very nice. They meet a girl and kick her to the curb after their first... ah, ummm, after their first date.\"<br>\r\n\"You sound like you know a few players, Laura,\" Mr. Horner said.<br>\r\nLaura's eyes widened in surprise. \"Me? Lordy no. I have never been out with a player.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that.\" <br>\r\n\"So what other things does the game entail?\" Laura clasped her hands on her lap and stared at Jack.<br>\r\n\"Well, you can also get points by reading another player's mail.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n\"You must be kidding,\" Laura said. \"The players are actually allowed to read other player's mail?\" <br>\r\n\"Yup! All you have to do is find out where the player keeps his correspondence. Once you find it all you have to do is read it. And after you read it, you just tell the player what you thought of it.\" <br>\r\n\"That doesn't make sense,\" Laura said incredulously. \"If you read someone else's mail you better keep it to your self or you'll get put in jail. Reading someone else's mail is a federal offense.\"<br>\r\n\"Not in the throne game, it isn't.\" Little Jack Horner's fingers began a slow movement up Laura's calf. <br>\r\n \"The throne game sounds kind of crazy, to me,\" Laura said. She smiled as Little Jack Horner's hands moved above her knee. She smiled shyly at Jack, and said, \"Is that part of the game too?\" she nodded toward Jack's hands.<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" Jack said. \"I failed to mention that I'm a playa.\" <br>\r\n\"You mean you're a player, don't you Jack?\" Laura asked as she felt her skin warm.<br>\r\n\"No, sweet lips,\" Jack said and puckered his lips for a kiss. \"I said it right, I'm a playa.\"<br>\r\nA STARK feeling spread over Laura's flesh as her face reddened with excitement. <br>\r\n\"Well then, Mr. Horner,\" Laura said. \"Good luck in the throne game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count 1042 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The lights followed Steven and Laura, staying back far enough so the they could not be seen. They hovered over the ground, bunching up when the stopped to because they got too close to Steven and Laura. But as soon as the distance opened, the lights moved forward, creating a long line of glowing green light like an emerald necklace. <br>\r\n\"Steven,\" Laura turned around to say something to Steven, but suddenly stopped, her eyes locked on the deep darkness of the forest. \"There!\" she shouted and pointed. Steven turned around and stared.<br>\r\nThe lights blinked out, but not before Steven and Laura had seen them.<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God,\" Laura said, fear constricting her voice. \"I told you there was someone out there.\" She stepped forward so that she was hidden behind her brother's back. She peered around his shoulder and stared at the light. <br>\r\n\"I may be wrong,\" Steven said slowly, \"but they may actually be something that will help us.\"<br>\r\n\"Help us? Have you lost your mind, Steven?\" Laura tucked her head behind Steven again so that she was completely hidden from the view of the lights. \"They are definitely not human.\" <br>\r\n\"If I'm right,\" Steven said, \"and I think I am, they used to be human.\" <br>\r\n\"Now I'm really worried about your state of mind, Steven,\" Laura said, her voice shaky. \"I knew I should have just turned back even if Steve didn't want to,\" Laura mumbled to herself. <br>\r\n\"Wait, one is coming over,\" Steven said. He could feel Laura's hands grasp his upper arms and yelped when her nails dug into his flesh. \"Ouch,\" Steven said, his voice whiney. \"That hurts, Laura. Ease up.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm scared, Steven.\" Laura peered over her brother's shoulder and with one eye she followed the green glowing light as it slowly made its way to where she and Steven stood as still as statues. <br>\r\n\"Shh,\" Steven admonished. \"Let me do the talking, okay sis?\" <br>\r\n\"I won't argue that, Steven,\" Laura said. \"I'm finding it hard to talk to you, I probably couldn't talk to the light even if I wanted to.\" <br>\r\nThe glow cast a sickly green glow over Steven's face as it came to within a few inches of Steven's face. There was a low hum emitting from the small light that changed in volume in a definite rhythm. Louder, quieter, quieter still, then lower, quieter, and then low again, but moving louder and holding the volume for a moment before going quiet. It was a tune that Steven recognized, but he couldn't place it. It must be my nerves, he told himself. But he definitely knew the tune, and given time he would remember it. <br>\r\nHis eyes locked on the glowing light, and he tried to stop his body from shaking. The light hovered in front of Steven for a moment later, and then moved back away. <br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Steven asked, his voice soft and tentative.<br>\r\n\"Don't antagonize them,\" Laura whispered from behind her brother's back. <br>\r\n\"I'm not antagonizing anybody, Laura,\" Steven said. \"I just think it would be a good idea to try to communicate with them. If they are who I think they are, then they might be able to assist us.\" <br>\r\nLaura's head slowly rose above Steven's shoulders until her eyes were not only visible, but also reflecting the green glow of whatever it was hovering in front of her. As she gazed at it, the hum began to form into a rhythm again, and it's volume rose and fell. <br>\r\n\"I recognize that tune, Steven,\" Laura said. \"Maybe it is trying to communicate with us.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm glad you finally came to your senses, Laura,\" Steven said. \"I once heard of a group of people who had moved into the woods somewhere around here.\" <br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with what we're confronting now?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n\"Maybe nothing,\" Steven said slowly. \"Maybe everything.\" He took a step closer to the glowing light. <br>\r\n\"What... what are you doing,\" Laura asked and shuffled forward too so that she remained hidden behind Steven.<br>\r\n\"Shhh,\" Steven replied. Instead of answering Laura's question, Steven reached out with his forefinger and slowly moved it toward the light. His finger began to glow green as it neared the light, and Steven could feel the skin of his finger warm. A feeling of friendliness, kindness, serenity, came over him, and a smile slowly stretched his lips. <br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Steven asked.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Laura said quickly. \"You know who I am.\" <br>\r\n\"I don't mean you, knuckle head,\" Steven said. \"I'm talking to the glowing light. He could feel Laura press herself tighter against his back, as if she was trying to hide inside of him instead of behind him. \"Take it easy, Laura,\" Steven said back over his shoulder. \"I have this under control.\" <br>\r\nSteven turned around again and raised his finger until it was nearly touching the light. He took a quick glance over his shoulder as if to say something to Laura, but instead of speaking, her turned back to the light. <br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" he asked, his voice just above a whisper. \"have you come to help us?\" <br>\r\nThe light flickered, the volume of its hum increased as it a vibration had increased. <br>\r\n\"Laura, look,\" Steven said back over his shoulder. \"I think it's trying to communicate with me.\" With a big smile stretching his lips, Steven continued speaking. \"I think I know a way to communicate back.\"  Steven turned back to the light.<br>\r\nSteven paused as if trying to find the right words, but when he raised his arm straight out from his side and opened his palm, it was obvious that he had something else in mind. <br>\r\n\"Um, um, um, ummm,\" Steven hummed as he opened and closed his fist with the rhythm of his humming. But there was no response from the light. Steven did it again, but using a different tune this time.<br>\r\n\"Ummmm, um, ummm. um. um. um. ummmm,\" and again with each hum, Steven's fist opened and closed. Steven let his arm fall to his side as he gazed silently into the light. Suddenly, the light grew brighter.<br>\r\nThe light's vibration of sound repeated the same tune Steven had just hummed. Steven's mouth fell open as he watched the light's glow become brighter and duller, brighter and duller, with each different tone it emitted. <br>\r\n\"This is great, Laura,\" he said, his voice now filled with excitement. <br>\r\n\"I think these things are aliens from another planet,\" Laura said. \"Don't trust them, Steven. You don't know why they are here or what they are capable of. <br>\r\n\"Don't be silly,\" Steven admonished his sister. \"If they wanted to harm us they would have done that already. Right?\" <br>\r\n\"You are asking me to be intelligent, logical, and fearless as we find ourselves in a dangerous, stupid, and illogical situation.<br>\r\nBut Steven wasn't listening. Instead, he raised his arm out to his side again and held his hand flat, his palm facing the light. <br>\r\n\"I'm going to ask him another question, Laura. Let's see what we can find out.\" <br>\r\nAs he began to hum like he had done before, the light grew intense, brighter than it had been before. Steven assumed the light had suddenly become afraid of something, because is back away a couple of feet and it was joined by a number of other lights that had been hovering in the near distance. As they merged together, it was as if a large light had suddenly appeared out of the darkness.<br>\r\n\"Oh, sh.....\" Steven's voice trailed off as the group of lights began humming and vibrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1267  <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I can't stand this any more,\" Laura shouted and ran into the darkness of the woods. <br>\r\nSteven watched as the nigh swallowed Laura. He wasn't sure what he should do. The lights that had coalesced from many points of light into one large beacon was now undulating and shimmering. Steven wasn't sure if he should be afraid and run like Laura had, or just stand there and keep whatever it was from pursuing Laura. A moment later his mind was made up for him, as two small orbs of light broke away from the beacon and flew in the direction Laura had fled. Steven turned and took two quick steps to follow the lights, but suddenly a loud voice stopped him in mid-stride.<br>\r\n\"Every thing will be alright,\" <br>\r\nSteven slowly turned expecting to see the bright beacon of light, but instead, what he saw made his jaw drop open and his eyes bulge. <br>\r\nShe stood before him, her dark eyes clouded by something Steven believed had to be drug related. Her long, curly dark hair fell down past her shoulders to the middle of her back in a riot of bouncing tendrils. Her thick lips formed a wide smile that revealed two rows of large, white teeth. Steven's eyes moved down from her face, as he continued to take in her form. The woman was a bit on the heavy side, and a long, loose-fitting, multi-colored dress hid her round hips and ample thighs. Her feet were clad in flat sandals that exposed her crimson-tipped toes, and a leather strap wound its way around her ankles and up her calves. She wore multiple gold hoops around both wrists that jingled when she moved her arms. <br>\r\n\"Hi, baby,\" she said. \"Where did you come from?\"<br>\r\n\"Where did I come fr...?\"  Steven blinked, swallowed, then blinked again. \"This can't be. No, this is not possible.\" <br>\r\n\"What's not possible, baby,\" the woman said in her sweet, smooth voice.<br>\r\n\"Janis Joplin?\" Steven ran both of his hands through his hair, pulling at the strands behind his head. \"No, no, I'm seeing things. I'm hallucinating.\" <br>\r\n\"Hallucinating?\" the woman said. \"Now you're talking my language. She smiled and looked around conspiratorially. \"Just between you and me, baby,\" she turned and gazed at Steven, her eyes brightened by anticipation. \"You got anything to share?\" <br>\r\nSteven stared at the woman for a long second. His lips moved as if he was saying something, but no words came out of his mouth. He wiped his palm over his mouth, swallowed, blinked several times, then ran his tongue over his dry lips. <br>\r\n\"Something...\" he blinked. \"Something to share?\" He shook his head vigorously as if he could clear the image of the woman standing not three feet away. A woman who had been famous during the 60's. A woman who had captivated millions of people with her voice and with her crazy, unpredictable antics. A woman who had lived a wild life of abandonment of drugs and casual sex. <br>\r\nA woman who had died many years ago. <br>\r\nSteven looked back over his shoulder trying to find Laura, but the woman pulled his attention back to her with her words.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about her, baby,\" the Janis Joplin look alike said. \"Just say, Bye, Bye, Baby, and then let my friends find your girl.\" <br>\r\n\"She's not my girl,\" Steven said a little too quickly.\" He looked over his shoulder again. \"And who are your friends who have gone looking for Laura?\" <br>\r\nOne is name Bobby McGee,\" she said. Her gaze, still unfocused, searched the darkness where Laura had disappeared. \"The other one is my Big Brother. He owns a Holding Company, somewhere in Port Arthur in Texas.\" <br>\r\nSteven just stared at the woman, his mind racing in all directions. This woman, no, this visage, could not be a real person, and certainly not the dead Janis Joplin, he told himself. <br>\r\nWhen Steven didn't say anything, the woman's shoulders sagged as if she had become suddenly sad. <br>\r\n\"You don't believe me, do you/\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Don't believe you about what?\" Steven asked. \"You mean about you being Janis Joplin?\"<br>\r\n\"No,\" she said and smiled. \"You didn't believe me when I told you that my brother owns a holding company in Texas.\" Her smile faded. \"You think I'm lying to you, don'tcha?\"<br>\r\nSteven's lips moved rapidly, but the only sounds coming out of his mouth were unintelligible animalistic grunts. <br>\r\n\"What are you on, baby?\" A wide smile returned to her face. \"And do you have any left to share?\" <br>\r\n\"Any what?\" Steven was finally able to put words together. \"What am I on? Do I have any to share?\" Steven shook his head again. \"What the hell is going on here?\" <br>\r\n\"You seem to be having some kind of nervous breakdown, baby,\" the woman calling herself Janis Joplin said. She reached out and took a hunk of his cheek between her thumb and forefinger and pinched. \"But I'll look after you. You'll be fine.\" <br>\r\nSteven touched his cheek where he had just been pinched. A red mark was beginning to take shape. \"I'm not having a nervous breakdown,\" Steven said, his voice rising in volume, \"I'll have you to know that--\"<br>\r\n\"Look!\" The woman said. \"Here comes you girl.\" She jutted her chin out. \"I told you that you didn't have anything to worry about.\" <br>\r\nA sweaty Laura emerged from the darkness and walked slowly, tentatively, toward Steven. Behind her, two men followed.<br>\r\nWhen Laura reached Steven, she tucked herself behind him, her hands grasping his arms from behind. <br>\r\n\"Why did you run off like that?\" Steven asked Laura. <br>\r\nLaura's voice was edgy, nervous. \"I just couldn't handle any more setbacks.\" She looked at the woman who had just been joined by the two men who had found her in the woods and convinced her to come back. \"These people are weird.\" <br>\r\n\"Do you know who they are, Laura?\" Steven waited several seconds before adding, \"Did they tell you their names?\" <br>\r\nLaura pointed to the taller one, and said, \"That one is Bobby McGee. At least that's who he says he is.\" She swung her arm to the other man standing there, and said, \"And he has something to do with some kind of holding company in a place called Port Arthur in Texas.\" Laura let her arm drop to her side. \"But to tell you the truth, Steven. I think they're all crazy.\" <br>\r\n\"I heard that,\" said the woman who had introduced herself as Janis Joplin. <br>\r\n\"Me too,\" said the guy so-called Bobby McGee. The other man, the one who owned the holding company stood there quietly, his eyes taking in Laura brazenly. <br>\r\n\"What are you looking at?\" Laura said when she felt his withering gaze moving over her body. \"What are you, some kind of freak?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" the holding company guy said. \"I am a freak. Want to freak out together sometime?\"<br>\r\n\"Groovy,\" Bobby McGee said. \"We've only been here a short time and already we're putting a party together.\" <br>\r\n\"Slow down, you guys,\" Joplin said. \"It sounds like you got Trouble in Mind. And this guy,\" she pointed to Steven, \"he looks like he's got Trouble in Mind. But I'm gonna try Just a Little Bit Harder to not be a Cry Baby. You know how I am, I Need a Man to Love. So Move Over while I search for my Mercedes Benz.\" The woman let out a long breath and said. \"Somebody should name some songs after what I just said.\" <br>\r\n\"Will everyone please stop this nonsense?\" Steven said, his voice strong and authoritative. \"We're still lost, Laura and I, and we need to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n\"That's no problem, baby,\" the Joplin lady said. \"I already have a plan to do just that. After all,\" she waved her hand indicating her and the two guys with her, \"we came her to help you guys.\" <br>\r\n\"So what's the plan?\" Steven asked. \"How do we get out of here?\" <br>\r\n\"Well, baby,\" Joplin said, \"it's like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1342  <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The light blazed, its rays reaching beyond the tree tops, and a hum began like a vibration. The hum grew in volume until it became a screech.  Laura began to whimper and she grabbed Steven's arm. <br>\r\n\"What is happening, Steven?\" she shrieked. She put her palms flat against her ears to block out the noise. \"What is happening, Steven?\" she shrieked again. <br>\r\nThe noise became so loud it was as if another being was present. The hum vibrated, shaking the trees, and Steven could feel the ground under him shaking. He turned to Laura and saw the terror in her eyes. And just then there was a loud boom so powerful that the trees swayed as if a great storm were pushing against them. <br>\r\n\"Get down, Laura,\" Steven shouted. He grabbed Laura's arm and pulled her to the ground with him. Steven saw that Laura still had her hands covering her eyes, so he placed his arms over his head and tried to block out the noise. <br>\r\nAnd then, just as suddenly as it had started, the noise stopped. The vibrations had been so powerful it took a minute after the noise abated before the vibrations slowed and then stopped. <br>\r\n\"What are you doing down there on the ground,\" a voice bellowed, causing the ground to shake around Steven and Laura. Slowly, Steve opened his eyes and looked across the short distance to see Laura's eyes slowly open. They both just stared at each other, not knowing what was happening. Finally, Laura spoke.<br>\r\n\"Is this ever going to end?\" Laura's voice was filled with fear, anger, and impatience. <br>\r\n\"Get up off the ground,\" the voice bellowed again. \"You do not have to bow to me.\" <br>\r\nSteven and Laura turned their head in unison, then at the same time they slowly raised their gaze. The first thing they saw was a pair of brown boots that looked like they were made of soft leather. Probably calf skin, Steven thought. As his eyes continued upward, he took in a pair of old, ripped, faded blue jeans. Further up and he saw a wide waist circled by a wide, black belt ending in a huge silver belt buckle. That's so big if can be used as a picnic table, Steven told himself. But he couldn't stop his gaze from moving higher. He had to know who this person was. As his eyes rose he took in a faded, multi-colored shirt. There were reds, blues, greens and yellows running as thin straight lines across each other making small square patterns that were filled with a color Steven couldn't identify. Again he felt his attention being drawn upward until he saw a great, dark, matted beard that hung to the creatures chest. Moving further Steven saw a wide, crooked nose that looked like it had been broken, twice, and above that he saw the bluest eyes he had ever seen. The form was topped by long, curly, brown hair that disappeared behind the creatures massive shoulders. The thing must have been six feet sex inches tall, and he looked powerful. He held an axe casually, it's wooden handle resting on his left shoulder.  <br>\r\n\"Get up,\" the big thing said. \"You must not bow down to me,\" a smile broke out on his face and his face reddened. \"It would be embarrassing if someone saw you down there like that.\" <br>\r\nSteven looked over at Laura and said, \"We'd better do what he says.\" Steven took a glance up at the man again and said, \"We definitely don't want to make him mad.\" <br>\r\n\"He won't hurt us, will he, Steven?\" Laura asked as fear shook her voice. <br>\r\n\"I don't think so, Laura,\" Steven said. \"After all, he could have stepped on us and crushed us. But he didn't, thank God.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank God is right, Steven,\" Laura said.<br>\r\n\"Up!  Up!\" The huge man said. \"I do not intend to hurt you.\" <br>\r\n\"B-b-b but that axe?\" Laura stammered. \"Why do you have that axe?\" <br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha,\" the giant laughed. \"The better to chop you us with,\" he said, then laughed again. <br>\r\n\"Steven! I thought you said he wouldn't hurt us.\" <br>\r\n\"I am only kidding, miss.\" The giant said and laughed again. \"Believe me, it's a joke. I jest. I am making fun. You know, a joke?\" <br>\r\n\"It's not funny when you scare people,\" Laura said, showing more courage than Steven ever thought she had. \"So don't do it again!!<br>\r\nThe giant lowered his gaze and pushed out his lower lip. \"Sorrrryyy.\" he said. \"I didn't mean to scare you. I was just having a little fun.\" <br>\r\n\"If you feel like having fun,\" Laura said. \"Then help me up.\" <br>\r\nThe giant's fingers wrapped around Laura's wrists like thick ropes. She felt herself being lifted, but when her feet rose high about the ground, fear gripped her again. Before she could protest, her eyes were even with the giants and there was at least two feet of space between the soles of her feet and the ground. <br>\r\nLaura's eyes squinted and her face pinched with anger. \"You put me down,\" she shouted into the giant's face. \"You put me down this instant.\" <br>\r\nThe giant smiled but didn't put her down. <br>\r\nSteven pushed himself up from the ground and shouted up at the giant. \"You'd better put her down if you know what's good for you. She's tougher than she looks.\" <br>\r\nThe giant looked from Laura down to Steven, then back to Laura. His lips, half hidden behind his beard, slowly stretched into a wide smile. \"Sorrrryyy,\" he said shyly. \"I was just having fun again. I didn't mean any harm.\"<br>\r\nLaura drew her right hand back behind her head, balled her fingers into a tight fist just like Steven had taught her, and then exploded a right cross that connected with the giant's nose. <br>\r\n\"Take that you brute,\" she said. She watched a huge tear gather in the corner of the giant's eye. \"Who do you think you are coming around here and scaring people. Why I ought, I ought, why I ought to give you another right cross.\"<br>\r\n\"Or a right hook, Laura,\" Steven called up to her.<br>\r\nThe giant slowly lowered Laura to the ground. He rubbed his nose with his thumb and forefinger, and the tear that had been sparkling in the corner of his eye finally spilled out and ran down his cheek. The tear fell from his cheek and landed on Steven, soaking him. <br>\r\n\"Oh, now look at what you've done,\" Steven said as he tried to brush the water from him. <br>\r\n\"Don't yell at him, Steven,\" Laura said. \"Can't you see he's sad? Can't you see he's crying?\" <br>\r\n\"Wow, are you ever fickle,\" Steven said. \"A minute ago you gave this guy a right cross, threatened him with a right uppercut, and now, a minute later, you're giving me heck for yelling at him. Some women, I swear!\" <br>\r\n\"And just what do you mean by that, Steven?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" the giant said. \"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\nSteven stared at Laura for a long second, then he raised his gaze to the giant's eye, then he looked back down to Laura. \"So that's how it's going to be now?  Two against one? Okay, then, maybe I should just leave.\" <br>\r\n\"Sure, Steven, you could just leave,\" Laura said. \"But you're lost. You have no idea which way you should go to get out of here.\" <br>\r\n\"I know, I know,\" Steven said as he looked around the small clearing where they stood. \"But I can find my way, don't you worry.\" <br>\r\n\"Steven,\" Laura shouted, her eyes glaring at Steven. \"You're lost. You don't know how to get out of the woods.\" <br>\r\n\"I do,\" the giant said softly. Laura and Steven turned to each other and smiled. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Word Count:1303</b> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Some little guy?  Chasing him?\" Steven frowned. \"You must think I'm a fool.\" <br>\r\n\"No, it's true,\" the giant said. \"If you like, I could tell you the whole story.\" <br>\r\n\"The whole story?\" Steven's skeptical look was not lost on Laura. She put her hand on Steven's upper arm.<br>\r\n\"Let him talk, Steven,\" Laura said. \"I mean, we don't exactly know where we are. If giving him,\" she shook her thumb in the direction of the giant, \"a chance to get us out of here, what do we have to lose?\" <br>\r\nSteven's lip puckered and slid to the side as he thought about what Laura just said. \"Okay, we'll let him talk.\" He turned to the giant. \"How long will this take, anyway?\" <br>\r\n\"Not long,\" he said. \"The story isn't that long.\" <br>\r\nSteven and Laura stepped to the nearly oak tree and stepped under its wide, protective branches. \"Come over here,\" Laura said. \"Let's get this over with.\" <br>\r\nThe ground shook a bit, as the giant walked under the tree. He lowered himself onto the ground. Laura and Steven sat on the ground across from him. <br>\r\n\"Okay, we're listening,\" Steven said. <br>\r\nThe giant took a deep breath, and began speaking.<br>\r\n\"His name was Jack, and he lived alone in the forest with his poor mother. They didn't have much, but they always felt that since they had each other, they had all they needed. They had a few chickens, but their most valuable possession was their cow. They had the kept since it was a calf. Well, one day Jack's mother told him there was nothing left to eat. She told him to take their prized possession, the cow, to the market and sell it for as much money as he could get. Jack wasn't happy about it, but he didn't want to see his mother go hungry. Well, having no choice, he tied a rope around that old cow's neck and trudged into town. <br>\r\nJack and the cow arrived in the little village of Chicago, a city that is growing and thriving. I wouldn't be surprised to see that village become a town one day, and maybe even a city. The only drawback to the town is that it's very windy there.\" <br>\r\n\"Can we get back to the story,\" Steven said. \"Can you just stick to the story?\" <br>\r\n\"Steven!\" Laura said. \"You're being rude.\" <br>\r\n\"It's okay, little miss. It's okay,\" the giant said, embarrassed. \"He's right. He wants to be on his way out of the woods. I can see he's afraid of staying here.\"<br>\r\n\"I am not afraid,\" Steven said pointedly. \"I'm hungry, sure. And tired? You have no idea. I just want to get out of here and have a hamburger or a hot dog.\" Steven seemed to get lost in the thought. \"Ummm, a hot dog smothered in sauerkraut...lots of Gulden's mustard. Wow, I can taste it now as if enters my mouth.\" A drip of saliva dripped out of the corner of Steven's mouth. <br>\r\n\"You're disgusting, Steven,\" Laura said. \"Wipe your mouth. And just so you know, hot dogs are filled with carcinogens, they're no good for you.\" <br>\r\n\"Why is it that the better something tastes the worse it is for you?\" <br>\r\n\"That's not necessarily true, Steven.\" There are lots of good tasting foods that are good for you.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah?\" Steven said. \"Like what?\" <br>\r\nThe giant looked back and forth between Steven and Laura as they took turns speaking. He felt as if he was in the stands of a tennis match. <br>\r\n\"Well,\" Laura said and raised her gaze to the branches above her head. \"Let's see...there's French fries--.\"<br>\r\n\"French fries?\" Steven interrupted. \"They taste good, but they're not good for you.\" <br>\r\n\"Sure they are, Steven,\" Laura said. \"French fries are made from potatoes, and potatoes are a vegetable! What could be better for you than eating vegetables?\" <br>\r\nThe giant, suddenly having heard enough, said, \"Okay, okay, you guys wanted me to stick to the story about where I'm from. Can we just get back to it? Please?\" <br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Steven said. He turned to Laura. \"We can pick up our conversation when we get home.\" <br>\r\n\"If you guys don't stop it,\" the giant said, \"you will never get home.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Steven said. \"We get it. Go on, tell us the rest of the story.\"<br>\r\n\"Right,\" the giant said and thought for a minute. Then he shook his head, and said, \"I forgot where I was.\" <br>\r\nSteven sighed, then said, \"Jack was in the little village named Chicago. He went there to sell the cow.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" the giant said. He plucked a blade of grass from the ground and put it between two lower teeth. \"Okay, so Jack went to Chicago,\" he stopped, then said, \"Did I mention how Chicago is growing and thriving?\"<br>\r\n\"Yesss,\" Steven and Laura said in unison. \"You did.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, I just wanted to make sure.\" The giant sighed, then exhaled slowly before beginning again. \"So when Jack got to,\" he paused and glared at Steven, \"Chi-ca-goo, the village was throbbing with crowds of people selling everything from vegetables,\" he smiled at Laura, \"vegetables like potatoes.\" He frowned at Steven. \"People were selling hogs, chickens, ducks, everything you can imagine. Like I said, Chicago is a thriving village--\"<br>\r\n\"We know!\" Laura and Steven said in unison, interrupting the giant. <br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" the giant said. \"So Jack wandered around the markets trying to find someone who would give him the best price for his cow. He went from stall to stall asking how much the vendor was willing to pay for his cow. Some of the vendors offered a few paltry coins worth only enough to feed him and his mother for only a short time. Some offered him merchandise instead of money. But Jack knew the vegetables would spoil before long, so he turned those men down. But when he returned to the vendors who had offered him a few coins, they had seen that no one offered him much money and so they took advantage of him. <br>\r\nThere was one vendor that called Jack over and spoke to him in whispers. <br>\r\n\"Jack, you want to sell that cow, right?\" the vendor said.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" Jack said, looking at his cow sadly. \"My mother and I need food.\" <br>\r\nThe old vendor looked around conspiratorially, then said in a low voice. \"I can give you these.\" He opened his palm to reveal 10 beans.<br>\r\nJack just stared at the beans in the man's palm before turning his gaze to the vendor. \"My cow is worth much more than a few beans.\" <br>\r\n\"Ahhh,\" the vendor said. \"You are right. You cow is worth much more than a few beans; regular  beans that is.\" He shook his hand making the beans giggle. \"But these beans,\" the vendor looked around again before continuing, \"These beans are special. They're magic beans.\" <br>\r\n\"Magic?\" Jack asked the vendor. <br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right,\" the vendor said, his voice just above a whisper. \"Magic beans. These beans will make you richer than your wildest dreams.\" <br>\r\n\"How can they do that,\" Jack said. \"They just look like regular beans to me.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, they do,\" the vendor said. \"But take my word for it. These beans are magic, and they'll make you rich.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you sure they're magic?\" asked Jack.<br>\r\n\"Without a doubt.\" The vendor held the beans out to Jack. He waited. <br>\r\n\"Well....\" Jack turned and looked at his cow, then turned and stared at the beans. \"And you promise? Those are magic beans.\" <br>\r\n\"Just plant them,\" the vendor said. \"And watch what happens.\" <br>\r\n\"What will happen?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n\"You'll just have to plant them and see.\" <br>\r\nJack held the rope out to the man, but skepticism filled his eyes. \"Okay,\" Jack said. <br>\r\nThe vendor tipped his hand and let the beans fall into Jack's open palm. Jack closed his hand around them. <br>\r\n\"You won't regret your decision, Jack,\" the vendor said. \"You'll see.\" <br>\r\nJack stared at the beans in his hand and hoped he had made the right decision. <br>\r\nThe giant yawned and stretched his arms over his head. <br>\r\n\"Let's take a break,\" he said. \"I need a rest.\" <br>\r\n\"But...but,\" Steven said. \"I want to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n\"In due time,\" the giant said. \"In due time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1532  <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's not like we've just been sitting around, Laura,\" Steven continued. \"I mean, we have every reason to be just as worn out as he is.\" Steven looked at the giant and watched his chest rise and fall with each breath. \"How can he sleep so soundly with everything that's going on?\" Steven asked with a frown. <br>\r\n\"You don't like him much, do you Steven?\" Laura asked, glaring at Steven.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Steven replied, his eyes narrowed. <br>\r\n\"You are always complaining about him,\" Laura said. \"He's not doing this, he is doing that. We have no idea how much energy was sapped from him when that light spewed him out. Maybe it's you who needs a nap!\" Laura crossed her arms over her chest and huffed.<br>\r\n\"Your like the pot calling the kettle black,\" Steven said, anger filling his voice. \"You accuse me of picking on him,\" Steven poked his forefinger into the air in the direction of the sleeping giant. \"But then you pick on me constantly.\" <br>\r\n\"I do not,\" Laura replied.<br>\r\n\"Yes you do,\" Steven countered.<br>\r\n\"No I don't, either,\" Laura said.<br>\r\n\"Sure you do,\" Steven replied.<br>\r\n\"Don't,\" Laura said.<br>\r\n\"Do,\" Steven countered again.<br>\r\n\"Don't either,\" Laura said and stuck her tongue out at Steven.<br>\r\n\"Do so,\" Steven said. \"As a matter of fact--\"<br>\r\nOne of the giant's big, grey-blue eyes was open and staring up at Steven, then it moved to Laura. \"Can't I even take a nap without you two acting like a couple of spoiled kids?\" <br>\r\n\"She started it,\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"I did not!\" Laura said, her anger turning her face red.<br>\r\n\"You did, too,\" Steven said, matching her anger. <br>\r\n\"Did not!\" Laura said again.<br>\r\n\"Did!\" Steven said, and this time it was he who stuck his tongue out. <br>\r\n\"Paaaleeese,\" the giant shouted. \"I can't take any more of this.\" The giant sat up and scooted back against the tree trunk. He glared at Steven, and said, \"You are behaving like a child.\" <br>\r\n\"See?\" Laura said. \"It is your fault--\"<br>\r\n\"And you, little miss,\" the giant said turning to Laura. \"You're not acting much older than he is!\" <br>\r\nLaura started to say something , but the giant put his hand out to silence her. \"Don't even start, little miss,\" he said. \"Both of your are behaving badly.\" <br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Steven said. \"I'm sorry.\" <br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Laura said, hanging her head. \"I'm sorry, too.\" <br>\r\n\"Good,\" the giant said. \"Now you two shake hands and say you're sorry to each other.\" <br>\r\n\"What?!\" Steven said. \"But I really didn't do anything.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes you did,\" Laura said.<br>\r\n\"No I didn't,\" Steven countered.<br>\r\n\"Did,\" Laura said and crossed her arms over her chest again.<br>\r\n\"Did not!\" Steven said. \"It was --.\"<br>\r\n\"I can't take this anymore,\" the giant said, his voice betraying his exasperation. \"I think I'll just leave.\" <br>\r\n\"Noooo,\" Laura said. \"You can't leave us here, please.\" <br>\r\nThe giant looked at Steven. \"What about you? Do you care if I leave?\" <br>\r\nSteven tried to look like he was considering his answer, but in reality he didn't want the giant to leave, but he didn't want the giant to know that. He didn't want the giant to think he could take over. After considering his answer for a short minute, he said, \"Okay, I'll say it. Please don't go. You're probably our best chance to find out way out of here.\" <br>\r\nThe giant took a long time to answer, but he said, \"Yes, I am your best chance to find your way home. So let's just stop the nonsense and concentrate on me finishing the story so we can get started.\" <br>\r\n\"Why do we have to waste time with the story?\" Steven asked. \"Why can't we just go?\" <br>\r\nThe giant took a deep breath, and then looked at Laura. \"You were right when you said he picks on me.\"<br>\r\n\"You heard that?\" Laura said. \"I thought you were asleep.\" <br>\r\nThe giant wiggled his eyebrows at Laura, and said, \"I can always hear your sweet voice, even when I'm sleeping.\"<br>\r\nLaura blushed. \"You're just making that up to make me feel good.\" <br>\r\n\"No, I'm not,\" the giant said and smiled.<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are,\" Laura said as her face reddened.<br>\r\n\"I'm not,\" the giant said.<br>\r\n\"You are,\" Laura countered.<br>\r\n\"Not,\" the giant said.<br>\r\n\"Am...\" Laura countered. <br>\r\n\"Stop!!\" Steven shouted. \"Now you're doing it!\" He turned to Laura. \"You can get on anybody's nerves, you know that?\"<br>\r\n\"He started it,\" Laura said.<br>\r\n\"I did not,\" the giant said.<br>\r\n\"You did, too,\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Did not!\" the giant said.<br>\r\n\"There you two go again!\" Steven rubbed his eyes with the knuckles of his hands. \"I can't take this.\" He turned to the giant. \"Look, if you have to tell this story before we can leave, which I think is weird, then let's get the story started so we can get it over with.\" <br>\r\n\"Well,\" the giant said. \"You don't have to get all huffy about it, Steven.\" <br>\r\n\"Look,\" Steven said, his patience at an end. \"Tell us your story, let's get this show on the road.\" <br>\r\nLaura looked at the giant and shrugged. \"Okay, let's just appease the little baby.\" Steven opened his mouth to complain about what Laura had just said, but realizing that would only waste even more time, he decided to swallow the words that were on their way to his mouth. Instead, he smiled and nodded. <br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the giant said. \"Where was I when all the foolishness started?\" <br>\r\n\"Foolishness,\" Steven almost exploded. \"You stopped telling the story because you said you needed a nap!\" He crossed his arms tightly across his chest. \"The foolishness began when Laura started it after you went to sleep.\" <br>\r\n\"That's not fair, Steven,\" Laura said. \"You were doing foolishness as well.\" <br>\r\nAll three of them fell silent for a moment, then the giant said, \"Now that everyone is done, where did I leave the story?\"<br>\r\n\"Jack has just traded his cow for a handful of supposedly magic beans.\" <br>\r\n\"They were magic!\" the giant glared at Steven. A second later, the giant exhaled slowly. \"Okay, anyway, Jack put the beans in his pocket and started home.\" The giant smiled at Laura, and she smiled back. Jack wondered what was going on between them. \"Needless to say, when Jack arrived home his mother was very upset when she saw what Jack had received in trade for their prized possession. <br>\r\n\"Is that what you got for old Nellie?\" Jack's mother said.<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jack replied. <br>\r\n\"That's not even enough beans for us to have supper with,\" his mother replied.<br>\r\n\"We're not eating them, ma,\" Jack said. \"They're magic beans, and they are going to make us richer than our wildest dreams.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, Jack,\" his mother said. \"You've always had your head in the clouds.\" She clucked. \"Go ahead, plant the beans, you might as well. They're not worth cooking.\" <br>\r\nJack lowered his head in sadness. \"I'm sorry, ma,\" a tear fell from his eye. \"I thought I was doing the right thing.\"<br>\r\n\"No need to apologize, Jack,\" his mother said. \"Just go outside and plant the magic beans. We'll see what happens.\"<br>\r\nJack stepped out into the yard, the beans held tightly in his grasp. He walked to a sunny spot near the barn and knelt down. Using his fingers, he dug a hole about six inches deep in the ground. <br>\r\nHe opened his hand and stared at the beans, then spat on them. He tipped his palm sideways and watched the beans drop into the hole he had dug in the ground. Using his other hand, he covered the beans and then said a prayer. Afterward, he stood and as he walked back to the house, he mumbled. \"I hope those beans really are magic.\" <br>\r\nThe giant paused and Steven said, \"Okay, go on, go on. Let's get this story out.\" <br>\r\nThe giant's eyes widened as he glared at Steven. \"I'm not going on until you apologize to me.\" He crossed his massive arms over his barrel chest and harrumphed. <br>\r\n\"Well,\" Steven said. \"I have nothing to apologize for. So I'm not going to.\" <br>\r\nLaura's gaze traveled from the giant to Steven, then back to the giant. Neither man looked as though he was going to give in. <br>\r\nTaking a deep breath and letting it out slowly, Laura sat back against the tree and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Word count: 1548</b> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Laura sat next to the two men, nodding. <br>\r\n\"Okay, but if you interrupt me again,\" the giant said, \"the deal is off. Understood?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Steven said, reluctantly. <br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you boys are getting along again.\" Laura gazed at the giant. \"I think your story, at least so far, is sooo interesting. I can't wait to hear the rest.\" <br>\r\nSteven watched Laura and wondered if she meant what she said, or was she just trying to get things moving forward again. He felt foolish for arguing with her, but more foolish for arguing with the giant. Sure, Steven told himself, the story the giant was telling was stupid. Who would ever believe that there was such a thing as magic beans. But letting the giant get through the story he was telling was the only way they could get him to guide them out of these God-forsaken woods. <br>\r\n\"I'm all ears,\" Steven said and smiled at the giant. \"I'm looking forward to hearing the rest of the story.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm glad you've finally come around,\" Laura said. \"I think the giant's story is fun, and filled with mystery. I mean, think about it. Magic beans. That's an amazing thought.\" <br>\r\n\"Magic beans?\" Steven said. \"The only magic I've ever gotten out of beans is the tooting it created after I ate them.\" He smiled sheepishly. \"I remember one time I was actually able to play <i>Give Peace a Chance</i>, by the Beatles.\" <br>\r\n\"That's gross,\" Laura said.<br>\r\n\"That is not the kind of magic I'm talking about here, Steven,\" the giant said. \"I hope you are taking my story seriously. Otherwise I might change my mind.\" <br>\r\n\"Why is telling this story so important to you, anyway?\" Steven asked. \"I mean, it's just a story, right?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, that's true,\" the giant said. \"But it explains how I got here,\" he swung his hand in a wide arc. \"It's how I found you and Laura.\" He smiled  at Laura. \"And I am so very glad I found you... and you too, Steven.\" <br>\r\nLaura returned the giant's smile. \"I'm glad you found me... ah, us, too.\" <br>\r\nSteven stared at Laura and burned inside. She was so obviously flirting with this guy, this giant. After all he and Laura had been through, Steven resented the way she was treating him. Who was it that took care of her and kept her safe since their ordeal in the woods began. He was, he told himself. Who was it that put himself between Laura and all the danger they encountered since their ordeal in the woods began. Him, he told himself. And who was it that would continue to keep her safe and care for her after the ordeal in the woods had ended. He would, he thought to himself as anger welled up inside of him. <br>\r\nBut Steven knew that unless they were able to get out of these woods, unless their ordeal ended in a good way, there was nothing he could do to garner Laura's respect. He had to relent, he had to do whatever the giant wanted. He had to do whatever it took to get him and Laura home.<br>\r\nSwallowing his pride, Steven said, \"I have to admit that I'm also interested in what happened that brought you to us.\" Steven tried to put as much sincerity into the tone of his voice. It was not an easy thing to do, because he was making this up as he went. <br>\r\n\"I'm asking you to go ahead and tell us the story.\" Steven winced inside, because the last thing he wanted was to listen to this gibberish coming from a man way too tall to be normal.  <br>\r\n\"I'm glad you finally came around, Steven,\" the giant said.<br>\r\n\"Me too, Steven,\" Laura said. \"I'm glad to see that you have come to your senses\" <br>\r\nSteven wanted to get up and scream as he ran head long into the woods. These two were driving him crazy. He took a deep breath, forced a smile onto his face, and nodded at the giant. \"I'm ready,\" he said, \"start whenever you're ready. There is no rush.\" <br>\r\nA wide smile opened on the giant's face, revealing two rows of large teeth that looked like crooked tomb stones. \"That's very nice of you, Steven.\" <br>\r\nLaura was all smiles as she gazed lovingly at the giant. <br>\r\n\"Okay, now I remember where I was.\" He inhaled and let it out slow. <br>\r\n\"Jack went to sleep that night and had no idea what to expect in the morning. If the beans were just that, beans, then he knew there would be nothing outside in the morning except the disturbed dirt where he had planted the beans. But what kept him awake most of the night was the thought that if the beans were really magic, what would he find in the morning. He couldn't wait to see the result of all of this.<br>\r\n\"Jack.\" Jack heard his name being called but thought it was part of the dream he was having. He pulled the blanket up to his chin and rolled over. <br>\r\n\"Jack!\" <br>\r\nThe tone of voice told him that the voice was not in his dream. It was the voice of his mother. He knew better than to turn over and ignore her, even though he hadn't slept much last night. <br>\r\n\"Jack!!\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, ma,\" he said, pushing the word through his sleepiness. \"What's wrong, ma?\" <br>\r\n\"Get up,\" she replied, her voice hoarse and tired. \"Get out side and look at the mess you created.\" <br>\r\nThat got Jack's interest. What mess had he created except for the planting of those beans. Magic or otherwise. <br>\r\n\"I'm on my way, ma,\" he said. Jack threw his legs over the side of the bed and sat up. The smell of last night's dinner wafted into the bedroom; onion, beets, and chicken broth. His stomach gave a shift at the thought of the gruel he had eaten last night. <br>\r\nJack pushed himself up onto his feet. He quickly got dressed and walked out into the kitchen. He could tell that something was wrong. The kitchen was also bright with sunshine this early in the morning. But this morning the kitchen was bathed in shadow. <br>\r\n\"What is happening, ma,\" Jack asked his mother. <br>\r\n\"So, you've noticed, have you?\" she asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, ma, I noticed,\" Jack said. \"Something isn't right.\" <br>\r\n\"You're darn right something ain't right.\" She stepped to the kitchen window and pulled it open. She leaned her hands on the window sill and stuck her head out through the opening. Jack noticed that his mother turned her head and looked almost straight up into the sky. When she pulled herself back into the kitchen, she stared at Jack with wide, red-rimmed eyes. <br>\r\n\"Well, you've really done it this time.\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Ma,\" Jack said, impatience coloring his words. \"Can't you just tell me what I have done? Admonishing me isn't helping me to understand anything.\" He went to the closet and pulled out a box of Frosted Flakes, then stopping, he changed his mind and put the cereal box back into the closet. Reaching deeper into the closet, Jack pulled out a box of Lucky Charms. <br>\r\n\"I can't believe you eat that stuff,\" his mother said. \"Don't you know it's loaded with high fructose corn syrup?\" <br>\r\n\"Ma,\" Jack said as he poured the sugary cereal into a large bowl he had placed on the table. \"If I worried about everything I ate, I wouldn't eat anything.\" He looked at his mother from head to toe. \"Besides, you're one to talk about eating badly. You could stand to lose about fifty pounds yourself.\" <br>\r\nHis mother came at him with a polenta stick. a wooden paddle used to make polenta in the special copper pot she owned. \"You can't talk to your mother like that, you little brat. Why, if you father, God rest his old bones, was around he'd whoop you to within an inch of your life.\" <br>\r\nJack saw the wooden weapon coming his way and thought, discretion is the better part of valor. Quickly putting his shoes on, Jack ran for the door. Turning back he saw his mother still coming for him. Jack jerked the door open and ran outside. He took no more than ten steps and suddenly stopped. His eyes widened as he looked at the stalk sticking out of the ground exactly where he had planted the beans yesterday. <br>\r\nHis eyes settled on the spot where the green stalk came out of the ground. His gaze rose, and rose, and rose even higher until the green stalk disappeared into the clouds drifting by in the sky. <br>\r\nJack felt a shock go through his spine. \"What the hel.....?\" <br>\r\nJack couldn't believe his eyes. But his reverie was interrupted when his mother walked up behind him.<br>\r\n\"See what you've done, Jack?\" she said. <br>\r\n\"But ma, those beans were magic, just like the guy said. <br>\r\n\"Magic, smadgic,\" she said, and handed her son the axe she had been hiding behind her back. \"Get rid of it Jack.\" she dropped the axe on the ground at his feet and turned and walked away. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<b>Word Count: 1570</b>  <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",

And that's what I say about this story.\" <br>\r\nThe giant was becoming visibly upset. He gave Steven a sideways glance, and it looked like his eyes had become blue gas flames. <br>\r\n\"Are you calling me a liar?\" the giant thundered. <br>\r\n\"What if I were to ask for proof?\" Steven said. He watched as the giant scratched his head. \"Well? What proof can you give me that a bean stalk actually grew up into the sky.\" Steven laughed. \"Overnight!\" <br>\r\n\"I told you they were magic beans,\" the giant said. \"And don't you dare give me that magic smadgic thing again.\" <br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Steven said. \"if it was good enough for Jack's mother it's good enough for me.\" <br>\r\nThe giant looked at Laura, and said, \"Can you help me out here? You know him better than I do.\" <br>\r\nLaura frowned. \"Steven is skeptical about everything,\" she said. \"But what is most important is that <i>I</i> believe you.\" <br>\r\nThe giant reached out and let his thick, rope of a finger stroke Laura's cheek. \"Aw,\" he said, \"that's nice.\" He turned to Steven. \"If I could, I would show Laura the way out of the woods, but not you.\" <br>\r\n\"Why?\" Steven asked. \"Because I'm being honest?\"<br>\r\n\"You're not being honest, Steven,\" Laura said. \"You're being a pain in the--\"<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" the giant interrupted. \"He's right. Why should he believe what I'm telling him? Steven doesn't know me from anyone. And I will admit the story of where I came from s difficult to believe.\" The giant turned to Steven, but now his facial features took on a softness. The muscles relaxed and the hot light in his eyes seemed to cool. \"I'm sorry, Steven,\" the giant said. \"I can't provide you with any proof at all. I'm just asking you to believe me, nothing else. I mean, what do you have to lose?\" <br>\r\n\"Time!\" Steven said. \"That's what I have to lose. Time.\" Steven tried to ignore the look of disappointment that Laura was sending his way. It took him a few minutes, but eventually Steven softened as well. He told himself it wasn't because of the way Laura had looked at him. Well, maybe it was, a little. But he had finally figured out that if he wanted the giant to show him and Laura the way out, he needed to shut his mouth and let this huge man tell his story. The giant, Steven finally realized, was not going to show them the way out of the woods until he finished telling his story. Steven looked at Laura and smiled. Then he turned his gaze on the giant.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Steven said, his voice soft and sincere. \"I'm just tired, hungry, and I just want to go home.\" Steven turned to Laura. \"You must understand, I bet you're as tired and hungry as I am.\" Laura nodded but would not look at Steven. <br>\r\n\"So what are you saying, Steven?\" the giant asked. <br>\r\n\"I'm apologizing, you big lug,\" Steven said. \"Go ahead with your story. I won't interrupt anymore.\" <br>\r\nThe giant looked at Steven, turned to Laura who was smiling at him, her eyes soft, an expression of rapture in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to continue, Little miss?\" the giant asked Laura. \"Because if you don't I'll stop right now.\" He gave Steven a perfunctory glance. \"But if you want me to continue, just say so.\" <br>\r\nLaura reached out and put her small, petite hand over his massive hand and looked up at him, her eyes full of surprise. \"My, my, but you have big hands. And strong too.\" Laura let her eyes travel over the giant, as a warm glow emanated from her soft, blue eyes. \"You are such a big guy.\" <br>\r\n\"You're making me blush, little miss,\" the giant said.<br>\r\n\"And you two love birds are making me sick,\" Steven broke in. Laura looked away, but the giant's face reddened with embarrassment. <br>\r\n\"uh, um,\" the giant stuttered. \"I never did ask,\" he looked at Steven with a steady gaze. \"But are you two, ah, um, are the two of you... what I mean is, are the two of you a thing?\" <br>\r\nSteven's eyes narrowed in confusion. \"A thing? What do you mean by a <i>thing</i>?\" <br>\r\n\"You know,\" the giant said, \"a thing. A thing.\"<br>\r\nLaura spoke up, turning her blue eyes on the giant. \"Don't let him,\" she nodded in Steven's direction, \"stop you from doing or pursuing anything. Whatever we are,\" she nodded at Steven again, \"is not something that you should consider. It's not important to you.\" <br>\r\n\"But you are becoming important to me, little miss,\" the giant said. Laura's hand disappeared when the giant placed his hand over hers. Laura's eyes widened when she noticed that her hand could fit in the giant's hand several times over. <br>\r\n\"You really are a big guy,\" she said. <br>\r\n\"Will you look at this!\" Steven said with a sneer. \"You two are embarrassing me.\" He turned his gaze on Laura. \"You have only known him,\" he nodded at the giant, \"for what, two hours? And you're throwing yourself at him. Next thing we know you'll be running off with him to elope.\" <br>\r\nThe giant looked surprised. \"Would you really run off with me and elope, little miss?\" Desire flared in his eyes.<br>\r\nLaura glared at Steven, and said, \"What is wrong with you?\" She turned and smiled at the giant, but her words were meant for Steven. \"You're right about one thing. I do like him very much. And I have become very enamored with him in just a few short hours.\" She turned to Steven and sneered. \"But there is a good reason for that.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Steven said. \"And what is that good reason?\" <br>\r\n\"Have you ever heard of the Stockholm Syndrome?' <br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Steven and the giant said in unison. <br>\r\nLaura exhaled and her shoulders sagged. \"Don't either one of you know anything?\"<br>\r\n\"I know lots of stuff,\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"And I know all about Jack and that pesky bean stalk that showed up in my kingdom early one morning,\" the giant said. <br>\r\nLaura harrumphed. \"No, I mean don't either of you know about worldly things?\" <br>\r\nSteven and the giant looked at each other and shrugged. They were suddenly comrades, glued together with their stupidity. <br>\r\n\"The Stockholm Syndrome comes from a bank robbery in Sweden.\" <br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with our present circumstances?\" Steven asked.<br>\r\n\"You wanted to know how I could have feelings for him,\" she nodded at the giant, \"so quickly. And I'm telling you why.\" <br>\r\n\"Any your explanation is that it was caused by Sweden?\" Steven asked.<br>\r\n\"No, you're not listening,\" Laura said. \"Just shut up for a minute and let me explain.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Steven said. <br>\r\n\"I'd like to know about this too,\" said the giant. <br>\r\nLaura looked from Steven to the giant and sighed. \"Okay. It was many years ago. Two men entered a bank to rob it. There were customers in the bank as well as employees. Someone triggered the alarm and before the robbers could get away the cops had surrounded the bank.\" Laura looked at Steven and then the giant to make sure they were listening. When she saw that she had their attention, she continued. <br>\r\n\"Anyway, the robbers knew they couldn't leave the bank,\" she said. \"The cops would have shot them. So instead, what had started as a bank robbery had changed into a hostage situation. This went on for like three days, but eventually the robbers surrendered, and the hostages were released. Sometime after their release, some of the hostages, the women I think, told the police investigators that they didn't want the robbers charged with a crime. And because this request was so unusual, a psychiatrist was brought in to examine the women.\" <br>\r\n\"You mean a shrink?\" the giant asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes, if you must call him that,\" Laura said. \"But he is a real doctor. <br>\r\nWhen the interruptions ended, Laura continued. <br>\r\nThe psychiatrist examined the women and filed a report,\" Laura said. \"In the report, the doctor said that because they were held in captivity, and because the robbers held the women's lives in their hands, the women, or hostages as the doctor called them, began to have feelings for the robbers. Investigations in similar cases bore out the same thing. It was determined that if a person is held long enough, and that could mean only days in some cases, the hostage becomes aware that the hostage taker had their lives in his hands. He determines their fates. And because of that the hostages develop strong feelings, just like a child has about his parents who hold the same sway over the child.\" Laura took a long breath. \"And because the first investigation was over the bank robbery in Stockholm, they dubbed it the Stockholm Syndrome.\" Laura finished and looked at both men.<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Steven said. \"That's amazing.\" <br>\r\nLaura looked at the giant.<br>\r\n\"Can I finish my story now?\" the giant asked as if Laura hadn't said a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Word Count: 1612</b> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We have been stumbling around the woods for days now,\" he looks at Laura. \"And then when someone comes along who claims to know how we can get out of here, what do you do? You flirt with the guy and tell us some cockamamie story about some women over in Stockholm that has nothing to do with anything.\" <br>\r\nLaura turned her gaze down to the ground, embarrassment coloring her face. \"I didn't know you felt that way, Steven,\" Laura said. She turned to the giant and said, \"Do you know the way out of this place?\" <br>\r\n\"Little Miss,\" the giant started, but Laura put her hand out to stop him. <br>\r\n\"We have been sitting here talking as if we have no worries,\" she said. \"Steven is right. We have pressing problems that need to be addressed, and quickly.\" She turned her eyes on Steven. \"And you have been very patient. You have taken all sorts of grief without complaining. My hat is off to you, Steven.\" Laura sighed.<br>\r\n\"But Little Miss,\" the giant said. \"What I'm telling you and Steven about isn't nonsense. There really was a bean stalk that grew right through the clouds into my kingdom.\" The giant wiped the back of his hand across his lips, something he did when he was nervous. <br>\r\n\"Look,\" Steven said, his voice not at filled with anxiety as it had been before. \"All I want to do is get out of here. All I ever asked for was that we find our way out of the woods.\" He turned to Laura. \"And when we're out of here,\" he said. \"You can do whatever you want to do. You can go where ever you want to go.\" Steven turned his gaze on the giant. \"And you can go where ever you want, when ever you want, <i>with who ever</i> you want to.\" Steven let out a long sigh. \"I hope I'm making the two of you understand where I'm coming from with all of this. I. Just. Want. To. Go. Home.\" Steven spoke each word separately and succinctly. <br>\r\n\"Wow,\" the giant said. \"That was some special kind of speech.\" <br>\r\n\"It was not a speech,\" Steven said. He threw up his hands and shut his eyes tightly. \"Just do whatever you two want to do. I don't care anymore.\" <br>\r\nLaura looked over at the giant, and shrugged. The giant shrugged back. Steven watched them both and then he shrugged. <br>\r\nA heavy silence fell between the three lost souls. There were no sounds from the birds, for they had all long ago fallen asleep. The insects had also been sleeping for quite a while, too. But what made the scene worse was that show began falling. <br>\r\nIt began slowly, just a few flakes that drifted down hardly noticed. A few flakes lighted on the tips of pine trees and when the moonlight hit them it appeared that the pine tree lit up like a holiday. <br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Steven said, throwing up his hands in disgust. \"This is just great.\" He pushed himself off the ground and stood. Looking down at Laura and the giant, he said, \"I'm leaving. You two can do whatever you want to.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cacophony of sound and light slowly fell away, leaving silence and darkness in its wake. <br>\r\n\"What the hell is happening now?\" Laura asked from behind Steven's shoulder. \"What's going on? I can't look.\" <br>\r\n\"They seemed agitated there for a minute, sis,\" Steven said thoughtfully. \"But I think they've calmed down now.\" He took a step closer to the light and watched all but one light scatter away. <br>\r\n\"Wait!\" he called out and watched the lights stop suddenly and hover. \"Don't go, we don't mean you any harm.\" <br>\r\n\"<i>We</i> don't mean <i>them</i> any harm?\" Laura said with a shaky voice. \"That's a good one.\"<br>\r\n\"Look, Laura,\" Steven said without turning around. \"I'm just trying to communicate with them. We want to feel like they are not here to harm us. Maybe they want the same thing.\" <br>\r\n\"They're hovering lights, Steven,\" Laura said, impatience staining her voice. \"Don't you think they are advanced enough that they could just make us disappear? Don't you think they're not possibly afraid of us?\" <br>\r\n\"You just don't understand,\" Steven said. \"I think I know who these people are.\" <br>\r\n\"Right, I'm sure you do,\" Laura said. \"You got us lost, you have no idea where we're going. You are a mess. But suddenly you know what these strange lights are. Pardon my skepticism.\" <br>\r\n\"It's pardoned,\" Steven said. \"Now listen to me.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Laura said. \"Everyone is entitled to their last words.\" <br>\r\nSteven choose to ignore his sister's sarcasm. Instead, he took a deep breath and turned to Laura. \"A long time ago--\"<br>\r\n\"In a land far, far away,\" Laura interrupted. <br>\r\nSteven glared at Laura, causing her to fall silent. <br>\r\n\"As I was saying,\" Steven said slowly. \"A long time ago, a group of people came to live in these woods. They called it a commune, but the local citizens called it a cult.\" Steven paused, expecting Laura to say something sarcastic. When she didn't Steven continued. \"Anyway, they wore something called tie-dyed shirts that used every color of the rainbow. They wore pants that were called bell bottoms, whatever they are.  The boys let their hair grow as long, or longer, than the girls wore theirs. They had no permanent spouses, they just all lived together, sleeping in large dormitory tents, eating in cafeteria style areas. They even had a slogan, well, a couple slogans.\" <br>\r\n\"Slogans?\" Laura asked. \"Why would they need slogans?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think they felt like they needed slogans, but just like things like that usually happen, the slogans just appeared.\" <br>\r\n\"What did the slogans say?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n\"Things like 'make love not war.'  'Drugs, sex, and rock and roll.' I'm sure there were others, too.\"<br>\r\n\"Umm,\" Laura said. \"Those slogans don't sound like they would belong to dangerous people.\" Laura slowly peeked around Steven's shoulder and gazed at the single light hovering in front of her and Steven. \"He looks friendly, doesn't he? I mean, he's green, not red.\" <br>\r\n\"Good point, Laura,\" Steven said, his voice growing in volume as if he was suddenly beginning to laugh.  \"Do you want to hear the rest of the story?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, by all means,\" Laura said. \"Go on.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Steven said and gazed at his sister to see if she meant it, or if she was being sarcastic again. When she remained silent, Steven continued. <br>\r\n\"They came from all over America, all over the world actually. People said they didn't bath regularly, but they did. The people in town saw them after they had walked many miles and hadn't had a bath is several days, several months for some of them. But they were clean. They kept the bug population down as best they could--\"<br>\r\n\"But population?\" Laura said. \"What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" Steven said. \"I'm just telling you about the things I heard. I remember someone saying that they had a whole bucket of what they called 'roaches' and that they burned them at night.\" <br>\r\n\"uggghhhh,\" Laura said, then placed her palm over her mouth, and spoke through her fingers. \"Sorry.\" <br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Steven said. \"I think it's gross too.\" Steven took in a deep breath and let it out slowly. \"So they congregated here, in these woods, and set up their living situation.  It wasn't all bad, either. They kept the area free of debris by gathering fire wood, and scrub bushes to burn. They kept their trash in one place. They swam in the stream that's supposed to be nearby. It's also where they washed their clothes. They used no soap, they didn't want to contaminate nature.\" <br>\r\n\"If they were that concerned, then they couldn't have been all bad,\" Laura said.<br>\r\n\"Oh, some people thought very highly of them. Some people brought them food, old clothes, and even blankets and cooking utensils. They cooked over open fires, slept out under the stars, and in general respected nature.\" <br>\r\nLaura gazed at the light that still hovered just out of her reach, but she noticed the light had softened. It was almost as if, she thought, the light had become thoughtful as it listened to Steven's words. Could it be, she asked herself. Could those kind, unassuming, nature loving people have somehow become the lights that hovered in the darkness of the woods? It was a question she hoped she would one day find the answer for. But for now she wanted Steven to continue his story.<br>\r\n\"Go on, Steven,\" Laura said as she stepped closer to the small, hovering light. <br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he replied. \"But I don't know too much more about them.\" He closed his eyes as if he might be able to see the memory of his hearing the tale about the people who had come to live here. It came back to him slowly. <br>\r\n\"They weren't welcomed by everyone. Some of the village people resented them. They called the forest people bums, crazy, dirty, pigs, but eventually they came to be called by a name that stuck with them. No one knows where the name came from, how originated it, or why it stuck. But soon everyone was calling them by that name. Hippies. Do you have any idea, Laura, what that means?\" <br>\r\nLaura tapped her finger against her lips as she thought, then she said, \"No, I can't say that I know what that means. But I have heard the word before.\" <br>\r\n\"Hippies,\" Steven said slowly. \"I wonder what it means.\" <br>\r\n\"Does it really matter, Steven,\" Laura asked. Her gaze slid through the darkness until it settled on the hovering soft green glow. \"Do you really think those lights are, um, hippies?\" <br>\r\n\"Um, could be,\" Steven said thoughtfully. \"After the forest people had been here for about a year or so, one day they just disappeared.\" <br>\r\n\"What do you mean, disappeared?\" Laura asked. <br>\r\n\"Just what I said. \"One morning a group of the village people strolled up here and entered the woods, expecting to speak with some of the hippies. But it quickly became apparent that the hippies had simply disappeared. There was no trace of them.\" <br>\r\n\"No trace at all?\" asked Laura.<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Steven turned his attention to the glowing light. \"I wonder,\" he said thoughtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1193 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven paused and fell silent for a few minutes and turned his gaze to the black sky. He seemed lost in thought, but after a few moments, he took in a long inhale, held it, then ballooned his cheeks as he exhaled slowly. He turned to the light that still hovered just out of his reach.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to try something that might be helpful,\" Steven said. \"I want to try to communicate with them.\"<br>\r\nLaura said nothing, she just watched Steven move so that he was standing in front of the light, but just to the right a bit. Steven's arm rose until it was straight out from his shoulder, and then he opened his hand so that his flat palm was facing the light. <br>\r\n\"Hmm, hmm, hmm hmmm.\" The hum sound a lot like the song they played when communicating with the aliens in Contact. <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind.</i> Laura giggled. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to communicate with the light,\" Steven replied. \"I figured this was worth a try.\"<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just talk to us?\" the voice said. Steven turned around and stared at Laura. \"What did you say?\"<br>\r\n\"I, I, ah, I didn't say anything,\" Laura said as she took a step back, her eyes locked on the light. <br>\r\n\"I thought you didn't,\" he said. \"But then who did?\" Steven began slowly turning his head until he was face to face with the light.<br>\r\n\"Was that you who spoke,\" he asked nervously.<br>\r\n\"So you can talk to me as if I'm actually here,\" the light said. \"I hate it when people talk about me as if I'm not present.\" <br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" said Steven. \"If I had known you had the capability to speak I would have talked to you.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, now you know,\" said the light, it's voice thin, and he gave a short squeak at the end of each word. <br>\r\n\"I can see that,\" Steven said. <br>\r\n\"I assume you want to know what's happening,\" the light said and lowered its intensity.<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course I do,\" Steven replied. \"But let's start with you name.\" Steven touched his chest. \"I'm Steven. What's your name?\" <br>\r\nThe light seemed to stretch itself into what appeared to be a smile. \"That's cool, man,\" he said. \"My name, well, my name after I left the world of materialism, is Moonbeam.\"<br>\r\n\"Moonbeam?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah man, groovy, right?\" <br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Steven said. \"So how long have you been here?\"<br>\r\n\"A long time, man.\" Moonbeam said. \"I mean, if you count before I was this beacon and after I became a beacon.\" <br>\r\n\"So you consider yourself to be a beacon? Is that it?\" <br>\r\n\"What else would you call us?\" The light continued after a moment's pause. \"Is it that hard to believe that there are several planes to living? You live in a plane that keeps you here on earth. But there are two more planes, the one I occupy. Here, in this plane, we are small lights, or beacons, as I prefer to call us.\" <br>\r\n\"How many of you are there?\"<br>\r\n\"That's easy, dude,\" Moonbeam said. \"There's only one like me. And that's me!\" Moonbeam smirked at Steven.<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't mean how many are there like you as in like you,\" Steven said but he sounded confused. \"What I mean is how many are there like you... No, I'm saying the same thing again.\" Steven paused and looked like he was trying to think of way to phrase the question to eliminate the confusion. Recognition slowly seeped into his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Moonbeam, I was asking how many small lights, beacons, are there?\" <br>\r\n\"I'm not sure how many of us exist,\" Moonbeam said. \"But in this little group here?\" he turned and shot a beam at the group of lights hovering near a tall oak tree, \"There are twenty-five of us.\"<br>\r\n\"Twenty five,\" Steven said, drawing out each word slowly. \"How did you guys become light?\" <br>\r\nMoonbeam leaned over Steven's shoulder and peered down at Laura. He smiled. <br>\r\n\"Well, dude, I can say for sure that we were not captured by space aliens and examined.\" He laughed. \"No, there are no space aliens around here.\" He glanced down at Laura and looked into her nervous eyes. \"At least none that I know of.\" <br>\r\n\"I was only speculating,\" Laura said defensively. \"I didn't say for sure.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, that's good, starlight. Do you might if I call you Starlight?\" <br>\r\nLaura slowly rose up so that she could see over Steven's shoulder. \"My name is Laura. L a u r a. So no, I mean yes, I do mind if you call me Starlight.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Moonbeam said. He turned to Steven and said, \"Did someone pee in her post toasties this morning?\" <br>\r\n\"No, she's always this...\" Steven's words trailed off when he saw Laura glaring at him. \"I mean,\" Steven could see the smirk on what passed as Moonbeam's face. \"We've been out in these woods all day. We've been out in the woods all day. Then we got lost. Then when it got dark out we got even loster.\" <br>\r\n\"Loster?\" Moonbeam's face pinched in distaste. \"There is no such word as loster. You might have gotten more lost as night fell, but there is no such word as loster. But you won't need to use that word again anyway.\" <br>\r\nSteven felt threatened, but the feeling didn't last long. As soon as Moonbeam put his hand on Steven's shoulder, all concerns melted away. He wasn't worried that he had stained his clothes earlier, he even didn't care that he and Laura were lost. He just seem to be in a perpetual good mood. It has to be due to these little, greenish lights, Steven told himself. <br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm just nervous,\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"Understandable, under the circumstances,\" Moonbeam said. \"Now, what is it you want to know?\" Moonbeam paused, then continued. \"About us, I mean.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, for starters you can tell us how you went from human beings to this,\" Steven waved his hand toward the group of lights that hovered nearby. \"How did you guys become these little points of light?\"<br>\r\n\"Ahh,\" Moonbeam said. \"Little points of light. I remember there was someone who used that during a campaign speech.\"<br>\r\n\"You guys have a government? You run for office?\" Steven asked.<br>\r\nThe light looked at Steven as if it was him that looked strange. \"Dude, are you partaking of the herb?\" <br>\r\n\"The herb?\" Steven asked.<br>\r\n\"Never mind,\" Moonbeam said. \"I guess I was just thinking out loud.\" The light seemed to lower its glow. \"Okay, so you want to hear how we ended up like this? You want to know what happened\"\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, I do.\" Steven pointed back over his shoulder with his thumb. \"And so does she.\" <br>\r\nThe light moved forward until it was peeking over Steven's shoulder too. \"Hi there, little moon flake.\" <br>\r\n\"Moon flake,\" Laura said as she rose slowly. \"There is no such thing as a moon flake.\" <br>\r\n\"There are many things in our world that you don't know about,\" Moonbeam said. \"So keep an open mind.\" <br>\r\n\"Open mind my as--\"<br>\r\n\"Laura!\" Steven interrupted. Pasting a big smile on his face, Steven turned to Moonbeam and said, \"My sister is very excitable. And she's scared--\"<br>\r\n\"And hungry, too,\" Laura interrupted.<br>\r\n\"And hungry,\" Steven said and smiled. \"We're listening. Go ahead, tell us what happened. <br>\r\nMoonbeam made a sound that sounded like he was clearing his throat. A moment later he began speaking. <br>\r\n\"Well, dude, as you know not everyone in the village liked us. Oh, there were a lot of village people that liked us, but as usual, there is always a few haters. <br>\r\n\"One night we were all sitting around the camp fire. We were singing kumbaya. Do you know the song?\"<br>\r\n\"I think I've heard of it,\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to hum a few bars?\" Moonbeam said. <br>\r\n\"No, no,\" Steven held his hands up, palms out. \"That's okay, I get it.\" <br>\r\n\"So anyway, we were all sitting around the campfire,\" he glared at Steven, \"singing kumbaya, when suddenly a bunch of car headlights were coming up the road toward us. With the headlights blazing in the dark it looked like a diamond necklace.\" Moonbeam shook his head. \"But it wasn't a necklace, instead it was the cops and a bunch of village people coming up here to turn us out. Make us leave, man!<br>\r\n\"Why is it that when all people want to do is live closely with our brethren,\" he paused to smile, \"and our sisters as well. Why do people have to feel threatened by that.\" <br>\r\n\"I think it's because people--\"<br>\r\n\"The question was rhetorical, Steven,\" Moonbeam said. \"Should I continued?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, by all means,\" Steven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1458 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Moonbeam's gaze, which was more a beam of light than anything else, moved from Steven to Laura, then back to Steven. Moonbeam exhaled. \"So we were just sitting around the fire. We had finished dinner and were just hanging out. And then we saw all those car headlights coming our way. Needless to say we were all a bit nervous. We had never been visited at night, well, we did have some girls show up one night and they stayed for a few days.\" Moonbeam smiled with a memory Steven could only guess at. But a moment later the smile evaporated and Moonbeam continued. <br>\r\n\"As I watched the headlights come closer, I just knew there was trouble brewing. I mean, that many people coming up to the hill where our camp was, at night?  No, something was wrong and I knew it.\" <br>\r\nThe light began to elongate and then it began taking on the shape of a man. Laura quickly jumped behind Steven for protection, and Steve put his hands in front of his face, just in case the light became too bright he didn't want to harm his eyes. <br>\r\nBut then the light began to undulate, picking up speed, until the shape of a man became crystal clear. He was a good looking young man of about twenty, not tall, about five-feet-eight, and very slender. He had long, curly hair that flowed down his back and framed a face that looked more innocent that anything. Half his face was hidden beneath an unruly beard and mustache. As the light's glow dimmed, the man stepped forward. His tie-dyed shirt showed all the colors of the rainbow and his bell bottom pants had stripes going horizontally and vertically, creating small boxes in the material. <br>\r\nThe man who had just emerged from the light reached out to shake hands with Steven. Steven, his mind still racing over what he had just witnessed didn't initially reach out and take the hand offered to him. But Moonbeam kept his hand out, waiting. He seemed to understand that Steven would need a few minutes to get ahold of himself. Over Steven's shoulder, Laura's eyes peered at the image in front of Steven. <br>\r\n\"It's okay, man,\" Moonbeam said through a bearded smile. \"I understand that you are having trouble understanding what you just saw. It freaked me out the first time I saw it too.\" He looked from Laura to Steven, watching their eyes, a smile wavering on his lips. <br>\r\nSteven was the first to come around. His shoulders relaxed and his fists unclenched. He tilted his head from side to side trying to loosen the muscles of his neck. Steven turned around to see if Laura was okay, and when his eyes met hers he could see the fear residing there. <br>\r\n\"It's okay, Laura,\" Steven said. \"He's obviously harmless. We're going to be fine.\" He turned to Moonbeam and said, \"Right?\"<br>\r\n\"We're cool, man,\" Moonbeam said. He waved his hand, palm open, toward the other lights that hovered in the near distance. \"We're all non violent. We wouldn't hurt anyone. Never could. That's why we never understood why the village people did what they did.\" <br>\r\nSteven felt his body come back to the moment. \"What did they do?\" Steven asked. \"The village people, I mean?\" <br>\r\n\"We were all apprehensive about what was happening when we watched the cars coming closer. Some of the people who had been with us for weeks ran and hid, obviously too afraid to wait and see what was happening.\" <br>\r\nMoonbeam turned back to the hovering lights that had appeared with him. \"But most of us didn't have any fear. I don't know if that made us stupid or just too trusting. But anyway, there we stood while the cars pulled up at the edge of the woods. I knew there was going to be trouble as the people began piling out of the cars.\" Moonbeam seemed to be lost in the memory.<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Steven asked. \"Did the village people cause trouble?\" <br>\r\n\"Man, did they ever,\" Moonbeam said. \"We were willing to give the village people the benefit of doubt. We waited for them to reach us where we stood. But our eyes never left the weapons the village people carried.\"<br>\r\n\"Guns?\" Steven asked, shocked.<br>\r\n\"No, something worse than guns.\" <br>\r\n\"What could be worse than guns,\" Laura said. It was the first time she spoke since the light had become the man standing in front of her and Steven. <br>\r\n\"Well, welcome my lady,\" Moonbeam said and reached out a hand. When Laura took Moonbeam's hand they shook for a long time, much longer than usual. Moonbeam couldn't take his eyes off Laura. <br>\r\n\"Why are you staring at me?\" Laura asked and moved back behind Steven. <br>\r\n\"Groovy, Moonbeam said, a wide smile that revealed his teeth, some crooked, some broken, some missing. \"You look exactly like a girl who was with us that night. The night the village people came to see us. She was beautiful, just like you. Her and I spent a lot of time together. Man, she and I had so much fun--\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I get it,\" Laura interrupted. \"You don't need to go into detail.\" <br>\r\nMoonbeam smiled, his eyes moving from Laura's eyes to her lips, then back to her eyes. \"I'm sorry,\" Moonbeam said. \"I get carried away sometimes when I think about her,\" he whispered. Leaning in closer to Laura, he said, \"Don't tell my girl over there, she wouldn't understand. She's very jealous.\" Moonbeam took a quick look over his shoulder and smiled. Laura gazed at the lights hovering in the distance and wondered which one was Moonbeam's girlfriend. <br>\r\n\"Can we get on with this, please?\" Laura said. She looked in the direction they had been traveling, and said, \"We still need to get out of here.\" She turned back to Moonbeam, and said, \"The sooner the better.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" Moonbeam said. \"Where was I?\" <br>\r\n\"You were about to tell us what the village people did. They were walking up the hill to your camp.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, God,\" Moonbeam said. \"We're you there?\" <br>\r\n\"No...\" Steven answered.<br>\r\n\"Then how did you know that?\" <br>\r\n\"Because you just told me,\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did,\" Moonbeam said. He seemed to be a bit confused, but then the cloudiness in his eyes cleared. He shook his head and resumed his story. <br>\r\n\"They really put us off guard, the village people, I mean,\" Moonbeam said. \"As they approached they were smiling and waving at us. It took our attention away from the things they carried.\" Moonbeam paused, and then shivered. \"Baseball bats, axe handles, home made clubs, braided ropes, chains.\" He sighed long and noisily. \"You name it and they had it with them.\" <br>\r\n\"No guns?\" Steven asked.<br>\r\n\"They were smart enough to know that they could hit us with a bat and the pigs.... um, the cops would not be able to match up a bruise with a particular bat. It could never be proven who had hit whom. But a gun? Now that's a different story. A gun has ballistics. If they shot one of us the... ah, cops would be able to know who did the shooting. They were smart, those village people.\" <br>\r\n\"How many people were hurt?\" Laura asked. <br>\r\nMoonbeam smiled widely at Laura. \"A lot of people were hurt. Those village people waded into the camp and began swinging those bats and clubs. There was a lot of screaming. A lot of shouting. My people were dropping into the dirt one after another. It was brutal. It was awful.\" Moonbeam fell silent and his gaze dropped to the dirt below him. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Laura said. <br>\r\nMoonbeam slowly raised his head and looked at Steven and Laura in turn. <br>\r\n\"That's nice of you guys, man,\" Moonbeam said. \"But as it turned out, it wasn't so bad.\" <br>\r\n\"How could that be?\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"After the village people left, we all sat around nursing each other's injuries. It was late, and I remember it was very dark that night. But we took care of each other, bandaging each other, finding wood to make splints for broken arms. Everyone found something to do.\" He paused, sighed, then continued. \"Luckily enough we still had some, ah, some medication left from the previous night's party. We all partook of the medication and found a place to sleep.\" <br>\r\nMoonbeam looked back over his shoulders and then turned back to Steven. \"It happened at around three o'clock in the morning.\" He paused.<br>\r\n\"What happened at three?\" <br>\r\n\"I was never really quite sure, actually,\" Moonbeam said. \"I remember I woke up and there was an eerie silence. I mean, it was a silence that was different. There was no wind, not even a soft breeze. It was just silent and still. No one said anything even though everyone was walking around in a trance. The next thing I knew I was buzzing around inside a great big ship. All my friends were doing the same. It was amazing.\" <br>\r\n\"What happened next?\" Steven asked. <br>\r\n\"I found myself standing in front of you, trying to communicate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1525 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She pointed to a spot beneath a horse chestnut tree. \"Over there,\" she said. \"There's no roots sticking up above the ground.\" She put her hands behind her and rubbed her back side. \"I can still feel the last time we sat under a tree. You should see what it did to my--\"<br>\r\n\"Okaaay Laura,\" Steven said. \"No need to go into great detail. I'm sure Moonbeam gets the idea.\" <br>\r\n\"Well,\" Moonbeam said as he peered around behind Laura. \"you know man, it would be groovy to see Laura's backside.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure you'd like that Moonbeam,\" Steven said. \"But we have a lot of work to do to figure out how to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n\"Damn, dude,\" Moonbeam said. \"You need to loosen up.\" He reached into his back pocket and pulled out a bent cigarette and held it out. \"This will calm you down,\" he said through his smile. \"Come on, let's sit down and talk this through.\"<br>\r\nAs they walked to the tree, Steven noticed that Moonbeam walked slow and was walking behind Laura. Steven turned and could see where Moonbeams eyes were focused and a pang of anger rose through him. He had heard about the old rumors about the hippies. They practiced what they called free love. Well, Steven told himself. Maybe that worked for them back then, but today that would not work. He would have to keep a close watch on Moonbeam to make sure he didn't get out of hand. <br>\r\nSteven turned his gaze on Laura and he could tell that she was enjoying the attention being shown by Moonbeam. He didn't think that it was Moonbeam's looks that she liked, he had a rough looking face what with that scraggly, matted beard and drooping mustache. But Steven thought he knew what it was about Moonbeam that Laura liked; it was all that kindness she felt when she was around him. Kindness! Steven thought. Well, I think kindness is overrated. <br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the tree, Steven, Laura and Moonbeam sat down. Moonbeam waited to see where Laura was going to sit before he took his seat, right next to her. Steven had no choice but to sit across from them. Now I'm going to need to watch what he's up to, Steven told himself. And I'm sure he'll be up to something.<br>\r\nMoonbeam lit his cigarette and took a long inhale, and then he did something Steven had never seen anyone do. Moonbeam passed the cigarette to Laura. Steven knew that Laura didn't smoke, so he wasn't surprised when she passed it to him without taking a drag. This elicited a frown from Moonbeam. <br>\r\n\"Hey, Moonspeck,\" Moonbeam said. \"Why don't you partake? It will make you feel better. <br>\r\n\"Moonspeck?\" Steven said. He turned to a smiling Laura, who seemed suddenly taken with Moonbeam. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, why not dude?\" Moonbeam said. \"I mean, just look at Laura. She's a fine babe. Her blond hair is so silky smooth.\" Moonbeam reached up and touched Laura's hair gently. \"And it's so soft.\" Moonbeam shivered. \"And look at that angelic face. The high cheekbones, the smooth forehead,\" Moonbeam's eyes began to glow. \"And look at those beautiful, pouty lips.\" He reached out and ran a finger along Laura's cheek, across her lips, then along the line of her chin. \"And there's something else, Steven,\" Moonbeam continued. \"Look at that slender body, the gentle feminine curve of her hips, those long legs.\" Moonbeam's gaze moved upward. \"And look at those...\" his words trailed off as his hand began moving toward Laura. <br>\r\n\"Okaaay,\" Steven said loud enough to wake every animal living in the woods, as well as all the other things that seemed to be thriving in the woods as well. Steven grabbed Moonbeam's arm and tugged it back. \"I think we get your gist, Moonbeam. But we were talking about the name you seem to have given to Laura...Moonspeck.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, man, Moonspeck.\" A wide smile opened on his face when I passed the cigarette back to him without taking a drag. \"She's smaller than me and I'm Moonbeam, so since she's small, and the light in her eyes reminds me of the moon, I decided to call her Moonbeam.\" He turned and smiled at Laura. \"If that's alright with you... Moonspeck.\" <br>\r\nLaura seemed to be completely taken by Moonbeam, and Steven couldn't figure out why.  <br>\r\n\"Moonspeck,\" Laura said slowly as if she was turning it over on her tongue, in her mind. \"Moonspeck. Yes, I like it. I do.\"<br>\r\n\"Woo. woo,\" Moonbeam said. \"Let's not get any strange ideas.\" <br>\r\n\"Ideas?\" Laura asked. \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n\"All I did was give you a name, Moonspeck, nothing more.\" Moonbeam frowned. 'But already you're talking, I do. I don't want to get married.\" His gaze dropped to Laura's body. \"I mean, I wouldn't mind playing married, but for real. No thanks.\" <br>\r\nA light of recognition entered Laura's eyes, as she listened to Moonbeam. \"Oh, no, I said I do... like the name Moonspeck. I don't want to get married either.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, Moonspeck,\" Moonbeam said, \"What about playing married. Do you like that too.\" <br>\r\n\"Well,\" Laura turned to Steven and gave him a nervous look. \"Let's just wait and see.\" <br>\r\nMoonbeam took another drag and held it in. \"Okay, her said, his voice strained. <br>\r\n\"So you were going to tell us what happened after the fight in the woods,\" Steven said, his voice filled with annoyance. <br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, oh yeah, Moonbeam said. \"Well, like I told you, them village people came up here and beat us all senseless. But it wasn't until much later that the thing happened.\"<br>\r\n\"The thing?\" Asked Steven.<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know what else to call it,\" Moonbeam said. \"I can't really call if a happening, because there was no music. And you need music if you're going to have a happening.\" Moonbeam took another drag from his cigarette. \"You guys must know that.\" When neither Laura or Steven answered, Moonbeam continued. \"Don't you see? A happening is where everyone dances, there's lots of music, you know, sitars, guitars, things like that. It's fun, man. All the girls dress up in their best tye dyed dresses and blouses. The men wear the jeans that have the least amount of holes in them. You know, stuff like that.\" When no one answered Moonbeam, he continued. \"But a thing, well, that's something else. A thing in not usually a good thing. I mean, people get hurt sometimes. People don't dance, and it doesn't matter what you wear. As a matter of fact, during a thing you should wear clothes that let you run, as in escape.\" <br>\r\nMoonbeam fell silent for a minute. Steven looked at Laura and shrugged. He tipped his head toward Moonbeam and raised his eyebrows as if to say, what's with him?<br>\r\nLaura shrugged in return. <br>\r\nMoonbeam's body jerked as if he had been startled. \"Where are we man,\" he said, and looked around slowly. Eventually his gaze found Steven and he smiled. When he found Laura a smile opened on his lips. <br>\r\n\"Hi moonspeck,\" he said. \"Did, ah, um, did we?\"<br>\r\n\"Did we what?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n\"You know, did we?\" Moonbeam said.<br>\r\n\"If you mean did we as in did we,\" Laura said as she glared at Moonbeaam, \" as in <i>did we</i>? Then, no we most definitely did not.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, too bad,\" Moonbeam said. \"I guess it was only a dream.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, everybody,\" Steven said. \"What about telling us what happened?\"<br>\r\nMoonbeam stopped talking and put his fingers to his temples. He began to hum. Slowly he opened his eyes, and in a voice that sounded far away, he said.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I see it now,\" he said. \"Bright lights, little funny looking people with long, long arms all around me. They had shaved heads, too. They were there and they were...\" Moonbeam's voice trailed off. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 1361 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura stared at a silent Steven for a long second, then she asked, \"You wonder what?\"<br>\r\nSteven slowly turned his head toward Laura, his eyes told her he was deep in thought. He blinked his eyes and said, \"I wonder if those lights could have anything to do with the people who lived here in the woods.\" <br>\r\n\"You mea, the hippies?\" Laura smiled. \"That's the right word, hippies, isn't it.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" Steven said slowly, his mind obviously stuck on some other thought. \"I don't know why I feel that it is, but for some reason I just think those lights have some kind of significance. Something to do with either our safety, or in our danger.\" <br>\r\n\"Our danger?\" Laura said and backed up a step. \"Then maybe we should get away from those lights.\" <br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?\" Steven said. \"Those things could catch us no matter how fast we ran.\" He looked past Laura and watched the small lights buzzing around each other like bees. \"And we both know there's no way we can hide from them.\" <br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm trying to decide.\" Steven took a step toward the lights, and instead of backing away, the lights all stopped moving and formed a circle as if they were all facing him. \"Look at that, Laura,\" Steven said. \"See how they seem to be watching us?\"<br>\r\nLaura turned and gazed at the lights for a moment, then without turning her gaze away from them, she said. \"Yes, Steven, I see what you mean.\" She turned to Steven, and said. \"If I didn't know better, I would think they are trying to communicate with us.\" <br>\r\n\"That's my impression too,\" Steven said. \"I mean, they formed a circle that looks just like a face staring back at us.\" <br>\r\n\"What should we do?\" Laura asked. <br>\r\n\"I don't know if we should do anything,\" Steven replied. \"We definitely don't want to scare them off.\" <br>\r\n\"No, that wouldn't be good,\" Laura said. \"Maybe we should just wait and let them make the first move.\" <br>\r\n\"That's a good idea, Laura,\" Steven said. \"Let's just act like we're taking a rest. Maybe just sit for a while, let them see that we're not dangerous.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, that's a good idea, Steven,\" Laura said. <br>\r\nLaura and Steven walked beneath a large oak tree whose limbs spread out forming a canopy. Steven smiled once he was standing in the shade. <br>\r\n\"What are you smiling at?\" Laura asked. <br>\r\n\"This,\" Steven waved both hands indicating the tree limbs above them, \"reminds me of the fort me and Brian built in the woods when I was about six years old. <br>\r\n\"I remember him,\" Laura said. \"You know, when he was sixteen I had the biggest crush on him.\"<br>\r\n\"On Brian?\" Steven asked. Laura nodded her head. \"Well, in case you didn't know it, Brian had a crush on you too. He told me so.\" <br>\r\nA line of red rose up Laura's cheeks, and she smiled shyly. \"I know,\" she said. \"He kissed me once.\" She sighed noisily. \"My first kiss ever.\" <br>\r\n\"When did he kiss you?\" Steven smiled. \"I mean, he was always talking to the guys about how girls were yucky. They smelled bad, their hair was too long, they had to sit down to pee.\" <br>\r\n\"We don't have to sit down,\" Laura said. \"It's just less messy that way.\" <br>\r\n\"Let's talk about something other than pee,\" Steven said. <br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" Laura sat down on the ground and patted the packed dirt next to her. \"Sit, Steven,\" she said. \"Let's just sit here quietly and see how the lights react.\" <br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan,\" Steven said. He let out a soft groan as he lowered himself to the ground. He wriggled his back against the tree trunk trying to find a comfortable way to put his back against the bark without causing too much pain. After several attempts, he was still not comfortable.<br>\r\n\"Will you please stop doing that!?\" Laura said. \"You're driving me crazy. Just sit still for a while.\" She turned and looked at the lights that were now a little closer. \"There's no telling what those things think we're doing the way you're bouncing around.\" She turned back to Steven. \"Stop moving.\" She said each word separately and distinctly. Steven stopped wriggling and pressed his back against the tree.<br>\r\n\"Okay, tough guy,\" Steven said to Laura, \"I'll just ignore the pain. Whatever makes you happy.\" <br>\r\nLaura let out a long, slow exhale. She turned to Steven as her ears warmed with irritation. \"Are you trying to start a fight with me,\" she asked. \"Is that it?\" <br>\r\nSteven backed away and propped himself up on the palms of his hands that he placed flat against the ground. \"Now why would I want to start a fight with you?\" he asked. \"I mean, you don't seem to be bothered by the rough tree bark pressing into your back, and you seem to be able to stand the pain in your skin. You don't seem as worried about those lights over there,\" he pointed. \"Which by the way seem to be coming closer every time I look at them. So pardon me if I think you're much tougher than I thought you were before this whole ordeal began.\" Steven lowered his gaze to the ground as if he was afraid of what Laura might say in reply. <br>\r\nA smile slowly crept across Laura's lips. \"Do you really think I'm tough...tougher than you thought before all this?\" <br>\r\n\"You just want to hear me say it again,\" Steven said. Laura's gaze remained on Steven, to the point where Steven began to feel uncomfortable. He raised his eyes without moving his head. \"What?\" he said, and picked a blade of grass and put it between his lips. \"Why are you looking at me like that?\"<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Laura replied.<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Steven said. \"You're looking at me like I'm some sort of a baby that can't take care of himself.\" <br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" Laura said. \"It's just that I feel almost like I'm seeing you for the first time.\" She smiled and her eyes lit up. \"It's like you're someone I'm meeting for the first time.\" <br>\r\n\"You're losing it, Laura,\" Steven said. \"You know that?  You are losing your mind.\" <br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine, Steven,\" Laura said. \"It's you who is changing.\" <br>\r\n\"I am not,\" Steven said and pushed out his lower lip.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes it is,\" Laura replied. <br>\r\n\"Is not,\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"Is too,\" Laura replied.<br>\r\n\"Is not,\" Steven said again, more forcefully this time. <br>\r\n\"Is too,\" Laura said showing no signs of backing down.<br>\r\n\"Not!\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"Is!\" Laura countered.<br>\r\n\"Not!\" Steven said again.<br>\r\nThe strong voice shocked both Laura and Steven into silence. <br>\r\n\"Will you two please stop acting like little children?\"<br>\r\nLaura put her hand over her eyes to protect them from the strong sunlight. Whoever it was standing in front of her was only a silhouette because the sun shone behind him. Or was it a her? Steven could see the black form, a shadow silhouette, as the sun's rays radiated out from behind him. He nearly looked as it a halo beamed above his head. <br>\r\n\"Who...who...\" Laura didn't seem to be able to form a complete sentence. Steven tried. <br>\r\n\"Look mister, what ever your name is,\" Steven was trying to act tough. \"I don't know who you think you are, but you can't just pop up here in front of me and Laura and not expect one of us,\" Steven's gaze turned to Laura,\" by one of us. Maybe you should just back down and move on. We are having enough trouble finding our way around without putting up with someone like you who just shows up and tries to scare us and doesn't think we're capable of, of, of, well, you just don't know what we're capable of.\" <br>\r\nThe voice of the stranger was calm, serene, and dripped understanding when he spoke. \"You don't have anything to worry about from me,\" he said. Then in a voice just above a whisper, he said, \"I've been sent here to help you two,\" his gaze moved from Steven to Laura, then back to Steven, then back to Laura. Then, one final time, his gaze moved to Steven where it stopped. <br>\r\n\"Sent by who!\" It was more a demand than a question. <br>\r\n\"Actually, Steven, Laura said, \"it's not who, it's whom.\" She stared at Steven and then raised her eyebrows. \"Sent by who is not correct.\" She turned to the stranger and smiled. \"It's sent by whom?\" She held up a finger of admonishment. \"And you could stop this tough guy shtick and just be yourself. No one believes you're tough. I read somewhere that when someone tries to act tough but everyone around him can see right through him, it means the person trying to act tough is actually trying to mask his own fear.\" <br>\r\n\"Is that right?\" Steven asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right,\" Laura replied. <br>\r\n\"But it's not,\" Steven said and stuck his tongue out.<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" Laura said and stuck her tongue out too. If Steven was going to play that game, so would she.<br>\r\n\"Is not,\" Steven said, his voice edgy.<br>\r\n\"Is too,\" Laura replied. <br>\r\nThe stranger's face move back and forth from Laura to Steven and back again as each one spoke. To someone passing by who didn't know what was going on, it looked like the stranger was watching a tennis match. <br>\r\n\"Is not!\" Steven said forcefully.<br>\r\n\"Is too!\" Laura said just as forcibly. <br>\r\n\"Paleeese,\" the stranger said and place both of his hands against the side of his head. \"You two are like small children.\" <br>\r\n\"We are not!\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"Yes you are,\" the stranger said.<br>\r\n\"Are not!\" Steven said. <br>\r\n\"Are too,\" the stranger said. <br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Laura shouted. \"Both of you, just stop.\" <br>\r\n\"I can't believe he has me doing it now,\" the stranger said.<br>\r\n\"You started it,\" Steven said. <br>\r\n\"I did not,\" the stranger said.<br>\r\n\"Did too,\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"Please, both of you stop, please!\" Laura stood and looked at the stranger. As she took in his warm eyes, the curls that fell across his high forehead, the slope of his nose and the full lips just below the planes of his high cheeks, a sudden feeling of calm came over Laura. She reached out and touched his face and felt a warm flood into her as if warm water was filling her. She looked down at Steven and didn't feel the usual exasperation she always did during times like this. She felt as if she was standing in the presence of greatness, of someone special, a spirit. <br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" she asked in a whisper. <br>\r\n\"I'm a spirit,\" he replied. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWord count: 1795  <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Steven lowered himself to the ground and then pulled Laura down to sit next to him. They sat with their backs against the tree, their legs outstretched. <br>\r\n\"Okay, so tell me already,\" Laura said and then took a deep breath.<br>\r\n\"I was at granny's house one night,\" Steven began. \"She had been having trouble with her electricity, something to do with blown fuses or shorts or something like that.\" Steven looked around the dark forest, searching for the green light. Seeing nothing, he sighed and continued. \"Anyway, when it got dark we sat down to have supper and about half way through the lights just went out. The room was in complete darkness. Granny chuckled in the darkness. <br>\r\n\"What are you laughing at?\" I asked her.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing,\" she said, but she kept laughing.\"<br>\r\n\"Where are you going with this, Steven,\" Laura said. \"You know granny sometimes lapsed into some strange state of mind where she didn't make sense when she talked.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know,\" Steven said quickly. \"But this was different.\" <br>\r\n\"Different how?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, for one thing,\" Steven paused for a couple of seconds while he searched once more for the light. He turned back to Laura and continued. \"Granny's laughter was a happy laughter. She sat there in total darkness and she wasn't afraid.\"<br>\r\n\"That's because you were there with her, idiot.\" <br>\r\n\"No, no,\" Steven said, chagrined. \"That had nothing to do with it.\" Steven exhaled a long, slow breath. \"Look, do you want to hear this or not?\"<br>\r\n\"Just tell me the truth first,\" Laura said. \"Is there really such things as Haraara? Or are you just making this up so I won't be so scared?\" <br>\r\n\"Well,\" Steven said slowly. \"Actually there are more than one Haraara.\" He turned to Laura and reached out and took her hand. \"Granny told me the Haraara are good, they help people. But first you have to believe in them.\" <br>\r\n\"How can I believe in them if you won't tell me what granny said?\" Laura slid her hand out of Steven's. <br>\r\n\"If I won't...?\" Steve leaned his head back against the bark of the tree and smiled ruefully.  \"You keep interrupting me, Laura. If you want to hear the story about the Haraara then you will have to be quiet for a few minutes and let me talk.\" <br>\r\n\"So who's stopping you,\" Laura said. Steven just looked at Laura for several seconds. His face was masked by surprise. <br>\r\n\"You are stopping me, that's who.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, you don't have to get so testy about it,\" Laura said. \"Go ahead, tell me this story you supposedly heard from granny.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm not getting testy.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes you are,\" Laura replied.<br>\r\n\"No I'm not,\" Steven said a bit more forcefully. <br>\r\n\"You are,\" <br>\r\n\"I'm not,\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"Are,\" Laura countered.<br>\r\n\"Are not,\" Steven replied.<br>\r\n\"Are too.\" <br>\r\n\"Can we stop this, please?\" Steven said exasperated. <br>\r\n\"You started it.\" <br>\r\n\"I did not!\"<br>\r\n\"Did too,\" Laura said. <br>\r\n\"Did not!\" Steven countered.<br>\r\n\"Did,\" Laura said forcefully.<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" Steven said and fell silent. <br>\r\nAfter a long minute, Laura said, \"Well, when are you going to begin?\" Steven just stared at Laura, but when Steven said nothing, Laura continued. \"Okay, I understand. I'm the one keeping you from telling me the story. I'm sorry.  Why don't you go ahead and tell me what granny said?\"<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Steven said skeptically.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure.\" She put her fingers to her lips and made the motion as if she were putting a key in a lock and turning it. Then she tossed the imaginary key over her shoulder. She mumbled a sound that sounded like, \"Okay?\" <br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Steven said. Steven leaned back against the tree, outstretched his legs and crossed them at the ankles. Laura pulled her knees up to her chin and wrapped her arms around them. <br>\r\n\"Okay, like I said, it was one night at her house,\" Steven said, his voice growing softer. \"The lights went out and we were pitched into total darkness. Granny began laughing and then told me not to worry. She said the Haraara would watch over us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's voice grew lower in volume and he seemed to enter some kind of a trance as he spoke. It almost sounded like it was granny talking to Laura.<br>\r\nSteven continued. \"There were a band of people who lived in the forest. No one knew who they were or where they came from. Very few people saw them, actually saw them. Oh, there were traces of them, clues really, that people found when they went into the woods to walk. Foot prints, bits of material dyed with strange colors. I think granny called it psychodeic or something like that. A shoe was found once, a small one. But actually seeing them, no, no one ever really saw them.\" <br>\r\nSteven uncrossed his ankles and re-crossed them.<br>\r\n\"It was said that they were a kind people. Everyone believed they were some kind of cult, some kind of small group that that been wandering around since the 60's, you know, drugs, sex, and rock and roll?\" <br>\r\n\"You mean, hippies?\" Laura asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes, kind of.\" Steven took a deep breath and continued. \"Anyway, it seems that the people would hear strange music coming from the woods at night, weird guitar music, voices reading poetry really loud. Lots of clapping. One night a couple of people decided to sneak into the woods when they heard the music. They wanted to see who these people were, what they looked like. So they sneaked into the woods and no one heard from them again. Well, I shouldn't say they were never heard from again, but it was a long time before they were seen again.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? Were they killed?\" Laura shivered.<br>\r\n\"No, no, will you please just let me finish?\" Steven's gaze scanned the surrounding. \"Anyway, I think granny said it was about a year later when these same guys came stumbling out of the woods one morning. They walked through town without saying a word to anyone. People stopped and stared, followed them with their eyes. But if the guys saw anyone, it didn't show on their faces. <br>\r\nAbout a week later the guys who had returned from the woods after a year began showing up in town. You know, like at the barber shop, the hardware store, two of them were seen in the movie theater one night. It was strange. But slowly they began to come out of whatever trance was holding them. Another week went by and they began telling people about what happened.\"<br>\r\n\"What did happen?\" <br>\r\nSteven turned to Laura and raised an eyebrow, a motion that made Laura become silent. <br>\r\n\"They told people that they found the cult in the woods that night. But they weren't really people after all, well, not all of them anyway. It seems that they had to reach some sort of spiritual plain before they could change--\"<br>\r\n\"Change into what?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n\"Into an intense green light.\" Steven paused, expecting Laura to interrupt again. But when she didn't he continued. \"The guys said that the forest people gathered mushrooms and boiled them, and when they drank the brew they would act all mellow and lazy, they'd see strange colors all around them. And that's when the ceremony would begin. The one that changed them into the green light.\" <br>\r\n\"Did granny tell you what the ceremony was?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, she did,\" Steven said with a voice just above a whisper. And it was the spookiest thing I had ever heard.\"<br>\r\n\"Tell me Steven, I'm starting to get interested in this story.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, good.\" Steven looked out into the darkness and then spoke in an almost reverent voice. <br>\r\n\"While they were still in this strange trance, the forest people would dance around the fire...\" <br>\r\nThe darkness swallowed up Steven's words, and deep in the forest hundreds of intense green lights shimmered in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1534 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sky was finally visable again, hues of orange, red and blue as the sun appeared barely visible over the horizon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought there would be something here,\" Laura murmured to Steven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy fluttered in front of Laura's face. \"Of course!\" She squeaked. \"You can't see it. Hold on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small fairy, with baby blue wings and a matching dress began to chant something incomprehensible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharing a confused glance, Laura and Steven watched as the fairy's features began to change from a soft porcelain, to a tomato red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Laura asked, offering her hand for the fairy to rest on when she'd finished chanting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting comfortably on Laura's hand, the fairy spoke, \"Close your eyes. Both of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComplying, they closed their eyes, no idea what to expect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey opened their eyes and were greeted with a small but bustling market place. Eyes widening, they hungrily took in their surroundings. None of the stalls were manned by humans, each manned by a different creature. Genies, goblins, fairies, imps, centaurs, even a vampire, all selling different wears. At the centre of the madness, a regal tent stood tall, shadowing the rest of the market. The red and gold material of the tent screamed important and expensive, and Laura and Steven were dying to find out what was inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Steven immediately bee-lined for the tent, ignoring the vampire, selling many goods, most likely stolen from his victims. Ignoring the genie, offering to grant a wish in exchange for ten years of the person's life. The amount of people surrounding the genie worried Laura, but she had to find out what was inside the tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a single person stood near the tent, as if it wasn't even there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you two going?\" The fairy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the tent,\" Steven pointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy looked, frowning at the tent. \"What tent?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right in front of us,\" Laura said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" the fairy pickd itself up from Laura's hand and flew off. \"Thanks for your help, but you'll be okay from here.\" She was gone before Laura or Steven could utter another word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her eyes adjusted to the lack of light in the tent, her jaw dropped open. An old man sat at the centre of the tent on a golden throne. Surrounding him thousands of pieces of gold, pure gold coins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greying man stood, greeting them with a bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke, \"... </font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Word Count - 445</b> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can get there the fastest and...\" she looked hopefully at the dragon.  He knew she wanted to make up for her thoughtlessness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. Make is quick. Tell him what has happened and if he can come to speak to the forest.\" the dragon smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have begun,\" she said, \" and apologized.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then , so will I,\" the dragon bent his head, closed his eyes, raised his head and began to sing as the fairy flitted off to find the keeper of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n708 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\nmartell house</span></div></div>",

Just for that...,\" she waved her tiny magic wand, and the Rottweiler became covered in pink sparkles. \"There. Now no one will take you seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy stuck her tongue out at the big dog, then called to Laura and Steven, \"It's okay, this is my sister, Matilda. She was cursed by the Crone, too, that's why she's a big dog right now. She won't hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big dog sat on the path and offered her paw to shake. Laura couldn't help but laugh.

Alright, so this might not have been the best choice - but she would never admit to that. A vine entangled her ankle, snagging the cloth of her deerskin trousers.

It could be worse - it could be....the first drop of rain fell through the tree cover, hitting her neck and slithering down her back with icy precision. She hated this day.

She hated it all - more with every minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, Stop moaning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had enough. She needed to yell at someone and he was there.

Clearing away leaves and brushing away branches with her hands, she searched for the man who was spying on her and her boyfriend, to find nothing.  The chuckle came again, to her left.  She began brushing away more leaves and branches in anger, ready to give the intruder a piece of her mind.  <br>\r\nA branch snapped.<br>\r\n\"Ow!

If that was what calmed Laura down, then he should probably let her be, he figured.

Mind your own freaking business!  Stay out of my life and relationship.\"<br>\r\nSteven had also heard the voice the second time.  \"What <i>are</i> you?\" He asked the voice.<br>\r\n\"It's not a matter of <i>what</i> I am, but more a matter of <i>who</i> I am.\" said the voice.<br>\r\nExasperated, Laura yelled back to the voice, \"That's what I've been asking you this whole entire flippin' time!\"<br>\r\n\"Now, now Laura.  No need to get mad.\" The voice sing-songed.<br>\r\nKicking a root out of frustration, Laura glared at the direction of the voice.  \"Just answer my questions and I won't be mad.\" she growled.<br>\r\n\"Well, you asked so many questions, I didn't know where to start.\"<br>\r\nLaura looked like she was about to explode.  \"Well.  You can start with an introduction.  That would be nice.\"  <i>Two can play this game</i> she thought.<br>\r\n\"Aww, now that's no fun, Laura.  That's not even a question.\"<br>\r\nSteven could tell the voice was just trying Laura's tolerance until she snapped.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?  Will you introduce yourself?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm just a tree.  With a voice.  And a relatively good sense of humor.\"<br>\r\nLaura scoffed.  \"Ha.  Humor.  Right.  Got that.  Next?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, what's your next question?\"<br>\r\n\"How can you talk?\" Steven asked<br>\r\n\"A witch put a spell on me once because I figured out her riddle.  Naturally, she wasn't happy, and she cursed me.  I can talk, but I have no brain to think anymore.  I can move, but I have no legs.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you were once... <i>human</i>?\" Laura asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n\"Indeed.  I was a wizard, actually.  She did not like that I had heard the riddle before and answered it with ease.  Then when I told her of her future, she didn't like that either, sadly.  So she turned me into a tree.  A talking tree.\"<br>\r\n\"This is getting weirder and weirder.\" Laura frowned.  \"I honestly don't know whether or not I should trust you.\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you and Steven here, Laura?\" asked the wizard-tree.  \"Isn't it to get out of the woods and away from the dragon?\"<br>\r\nThe couple nodded dumbfoundedly.  <br>\r\n\"If you ask me how to get out, I will tell you.

Maybe we'll find the dragon and its nest when we get to the center.  See, the trees are even closer together here than back there.\"  She pointed to the woods they had just run through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the trees trunks were almost touching those next to them.  Stephen and Laura squeezed through the widest space they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen, put his hand on Laura's shoulder, \"Wait a minute.  I'm seeing something in my head.  It's a cluster of trees surrounding a clearing.  Yes, and there are two baby dragons.  They must be just ahead of us.\"  Creeping slowly and softly, he led the way with Laura staying close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey squeezed through the trees until they were suddenly in a clearing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end of the clearing was the open mouth of a cave.  They followed the treeline to the cave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" said Stephen.  \"I hear voices.  They're really weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear them too.  It sounds like opera singers with high pitch voices but I can't make out any words.\"  Laura pushed ahead of Stephen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a large dragon came out of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 280 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

He had dreamed of dragons as a child even had an imaginary one, but was so ridiculed, he soon gave up the notion and the dreams stopped. Perhaps that was why he was so reluctant---fearing to be disappointed and rejected again.

Laura, is that you?\u201d Daniel yelled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura whispered a \u201cyes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the hell are you whispering? Didn\u2019t you see that that stupid red monster went to the right just after I sneaked through?\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSneaked through is fine but where are you now , Daniel?\u201d said Laura, still searching for Daniel who was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see from where I am. From where you are standing, come some ten to twelve steps to further right and then look up,\u201d Daniel hollered,\u201d and please make it quick. I can\u2019t hold out any longer.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura rushed through the narrow trail and there she saw him, managing somehow, clinging to the walls. \u201cDid you climb up the rocks, Daniel,\u201d squeaked Laura in joy, as she saw Daniel hanging there, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know my that my hobby would save my life one day,\u201d he smirked, \u201cnow come quick, stand there with your face to the stones. I will put my feet on  your shoulders and then jump off, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a superwoman, alright, ain\u2019t I?\u201d Laura giggled. These two sure had a sense of humor in toughest of times.<br>\r\nDaniel put his left foot on Laura\u2019s left shoulder and then right on her right shoulder. Laura balanced her against the stone. And there, he jumped off her shoulder to land carefully on his feet. He sat there stooping for some time. Laura knew he was recollecting what had happened over the past few minutes. She knew he needed a hug. She walked towards him and wrapped her arms around Steve who had just risen to stand upright. He was not accustomed to this closeness from Laura and nor was he comfortable with such display of affections, ordinarily. But today was no ordinary day, after all. He too held her close and squished her gently, playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you breathing so heavily?\u201d he asked Laura who was still had her arms around him. She let her a little loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I thought that it was you, nervous and all and possibly the fact that you had never ever h-,\u201d but her eyes widened and her mouth got shut when she saw what surrounded them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch out Daniel,\u201d she pushed Daniel\u2019s head down, just in nick of time as. Even stooped, Daniel felt a magnitude of heat on his body that he had never felt before. It was if he was walking inside a volcano. He jerked his head upwards to notice the stone set on fire. The Dragon was back and she was not alone. She had four other dragons with her and each of them was at least twice as big as the Red Dragon. Daniel could only say \u201cLet\u2019s run \u2013\u201c before all four of the dragon\u2019s let out there wraith at him, setting the path ahead of him on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was nowhere to be seen. Thoughts of varying emotions started to enter his head and he yelled out, \u201cLaura,\u201d more in hope than anything else. He was very surprised when he heard a voice in return. Not a human voice but voice of tapping of feet against the hard rocks. It was coming from the directions where the dragon were hovering over. He quickly stooped under a stone formation which formed a kind of a cave in which little dragons would play. He thought long and hard, searching for an opportune moment to go for Laura\u2019s safety. He knew she was out there somewhere and what he needed now was a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flapping of the dragon\u2019s wings could still be heard by him. Possibly they were still around, searching for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragons are not supposed to be this smart?\u201d he murmured,\u201d they are the dumbest of animals which have inhabited this earth. All they know is spitting fire but nothing more than that. I bet someone is control -\u201d Before Daniel could finish what he was saying, he saw something he never thought he would. Four Dragon\u2019s came zeroing in on him as he got his head out of the little cave, but that is not what surprised him. What surprised him was \u2013 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(897 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A shining thing was hanging through the teeth of the largest dragon of them all the blue spotted one. He managed to see it from afar since the brightness from that bling was noticeable or miles. The Dragons\u2019 increased the pace with which they glided towards Steven which had him rushing for cover;  He felt as if they were going to crush against his human body but of course that wasn\u2019t to happen for Dragons were not here to kill him; they were here to deliver a message to someone. Just nearby to where Steven stood, all the four dragons hovered over as if trying to ascertain whether it was for whom the message scroll was. Steven looked stealthily at them and then jumped to hide behind a tiny crevice in which his body could somehow managed to squeeze in. He peeped from behind the stone structure, now looking at the Dragons with a mixture of awe and reverence. There was something magical in the flight of a dragon, a grace which can\u2019t be comprehended until you see it from up close, like the place from where Steven was fortunate to be. <br>\r\nThe Dragons still hovered around that place and opened their tiny narrow mouth every now and then to let out a noise which was more soothing than shrill. When Steven saw the incessant flying and hovering as if waiting for something, he straightaway knew that something was different because if they were here to kill him they would have destroyed the whole place by now, turning the whole place into a Lava reservoir in no time. He had also managed to steal a look in the dragon\u2019s eyes, especially the Blue one. It was something which was totally different to what it was when he manhandled their eggs, a little while back. Unlike the narrow, black hole of eyes which they possessed before, now they were whiter and wider, as if a different saintly soul inhabited those body than the monster soul which resided in it before. The intermittent noise which escaped their mouth was also no longer like those war cries before but bore the softness of a hymn, or a prayer. It appeared as if they were calling out somebody; it had a hint of softness in it. One of the Dragon slowly descended and landed to nearby the place Steven was hiding. It made a different noise from its horse sized throat which brought others to the same place, too. Now, all four dragons stood on the tiny rocks surrounding the stone structure where Steven was hiding. Strangely, Steven was not worried. It was as if he knew that they were here for something good, something noble. And anyway, even if he hid behind the structure he knew he couldn\u2019t do it for long because sometime of the day he had to come out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not, now?\u201d he murmured. Just then, he had a noise from all the dragons as if they understood what he said and they welcomed it. Steven smiled and slowly crawled out, with his eyes still fixed on the Blue dragon which was the biggest of them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven dusted off his clothes and stood tall, trying to show to the dragons that he wasn\u2019t afraid. The Blue Dragon then moved towards him, as if trying to test his resolve. Steven\u2019s heartbeat went a notch higher. He hadn\u2019t seen Dragon from up close. The Blue plume shined in a mysterious gold color as did the scroll which hung from his teeth. The dragon crooked its neck towards Steven, sniffed him and then flapped its giant wings twice. To Steven it felt as if a mini gust of airwave had hit him. All the dragons flapped their wings twice and made a noise similar to the merry noise they had made just a while ago. The place was bustling with their noises in no time. For no reason that he knew or understood, Steven raised his arms in the mid-air, as if trying to calm them down. Strangely, the commotion stopped and the Dragons looked intently in Steven\u2019s direction for some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you here for?\u201d he asked, hoping that the dragons may understand it. Steven didn\u2019t believe if it was him talking to the Dragon. It was if he was in a trance, sleepwalking through the events and the conversations but yet he felt so alive and in a zone of elevated consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blue Dragon looked towards the other dragons and then moved further towards Steven. He bent his neck and placed the scroll at Steven\u2019s feet and then stepped back to where he was standing before. Steven looked till the blue Dragon went back to its original place and then and picked up the scroll. The scroll red in color shone in a radiant brilliance as he looked at it. A silvery white string hung from its right side. Steven pulled it and the Scroll flung open in his hands. On it, there were symbols painted in Golden color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were not alphabets but those symbols were something similar to what Steven had remembered from those prehistoric cave arts. Hundreds of lines zigzagged in the scroll with no apparent meaning which Steven could glean out from it. Steven downed the scroll from the front of his eyes and looked towards the Blue Dragon standing in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do not understand it,\u201d he said to Blue Dragon. The Dragon grunted and looked towards the other dragons as if reproaching the other dragons for some act of theirs. Slowly, it moved forward towards Steven and gently tugged the scroll which was in Steven\u2019s hands and took the scroll in its teeth. Then, it took out its blue wiry tongue and wiped it all over the scroll. With a gentlest of fire forced through his nostrils, he set the scroll on fire for a second or so and then exhaled to put it off. Steven stood there wondering about the activities of the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it some kind of a secret message which comes to life when put against fire?\u201d he wondered. He had heard of such scrolls and messages in folklore. But this guess of his nosedived, when the other Dragon standing nearby the Blue one, clasped the scroll in its teeth and did the same thing which was done by the Blue dragon. It then tossed it to the third dragon which did the same thing as the previous two dragons had. Finally, it reached the fourth Dragon which clasped in its teeth and let out fire from its open mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scroll was on fire for good few minutes this time instead of seconds. All the Dragons as well as Steven looked intently onto the scene. A minute later the whole scroll was gone and what remained instead were ashes of the most dazzling golden color he had ever seen. The fourth dragon which had turned the scroll into ashes looked up at Steven and then moved towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what?\u201d Steven asked but there was no change in the Dragon\u2019s behavior or its walk. It simply kept on moving towards Steven as the rest of the three dragons stood where they were. When it reached Steven it bowed its head in Steven\u2019s feet for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven didn\u2019t know what to do or say and instinctively reached for the dragon\u2019s head to caress it. The Dragon purred with the most satisfaction laced purr and then looked into Steven\u2019s eyes. Steven too looked into those pink pupils and then patted the Dragon its head, one more time. From then on till the time the Dragon didn\u2019t blink, Steven saw a human figure floating in those wondrous eyes of the Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1297 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWho was that?\u201d the words escaped Steven\u2019s mouth. Just then, the dragon blinked. Steven could distinctly remember that the human form floating in those eyes was of a child with a bush of golden hair. By the looks of the dress the kid was dressed in, it seemed to be a girl why else would it wear flowery dresses and pink bow on his tiny hair? <br>\r\n\u201cWhat was a figure doing in those Dragon eyes and that too a kid?\u201d he murmured to himself, \u201dWhat did he want to show me?\u201d Steven went towards the Dragon again and patted his head gently and then caressed it. He then looked into its eyes, hoping to see that human form again but instead what he saw was a whole lot of other images - a secluded cottage by the river, a tornado gradually building up to stand as tall as the mountains and that of a cottage being ravaged  and plundered by that vicious tornado. He kept looking the dragon\u2019s eyes, scanning and searching for those human forms in those eyes again but he couldn\u2019t find any. What he saw was more images of tornados plundering forest, the rivers the cities. The two set of images he saw one after another had no connection whatsoever to his fuzzy brain. He let out an exasperated sigh. The Dragon blinked and poof went the images in those eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA cottage, a tornado, plundering of the cottage by that tornado - what does all that mean?\u201d he muttered under his breath and looked towards the blue Dragon, more in hope than for answer. <br>\r\n\u201cCan you help me?\u201d he said but when the blue Dragon didn\u2019t answer Steven turned his back on it in frustration and hopelessness.<br>\r\n \u201cWhat is that they are trying to show me?\u201d he wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the Blue Dragon let out a noise which caught attention of the other dragons and they looked towards it. The sudden noise got Steven jerking his head in their direction, too. As if energized by Steven\u2019s act, they flapped their wings together vigorously once more and dust around the place started to rise along with the ashes. In no time, the air around them turned more golden than brown because of those ashes scattered on the ground which mixed with the dust. The Dragons kept on flapping their wings, letting out shrill cries till the gold dust interweaved with each and every dust particle surrounding the place they stood. If somebody would have looked that scene from afar, it would have looked as if the gold dust from the heaven was falling upon Steven. It was a beautiful, surreal and spectacular scene and something which would have been enjoyed by even those who were at peace in their heart which clearly Steven wasn\u2019t. As his mind was still trying to connect the dots of the human figure which he saw in the Dragon\u2019s eyes, he was brain was just simply registering the fact that there was dust all around him \u2013 not gold laced just plain old dust. <br>\r\nThinking about the mystery surrounding the human forms in those dragon eyes had numbed his capacity to notice, it seemed. As if realizing this fact, the Blue Dragon looked towards the other Dragon and they all stopped waving their wings at the same instant. The sudden vacuum after the incessant fluttering did the trick and caught Steven\u2019s attention. After being ensured of Steven\u2019s attention, the Blue Dragon waved its wings in a curious haphazard motion which for some reason didn\u2019t appear all that haphazard to Steven\u2019s eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have seen this before somewhere! Where?\u201d thought Steven as he kept looking at all the Dragons doing the same thing with their wings.  Apart from the pleasant harmony which tied their act together there was something which struck him. He saw these figures and lines in that scroll! And then, the Dragons stopped with their act. Not a single Dragon moved for some more time and curiously neither did the gold dust remained suspended in mid-air. Steven yelled out aloud,<br>\r\n\u201dWhat are you trying to say?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was not the Dragons which replied to him but the gold dust which arranged itself neatly into a kind of pattern. There was a magical feel all around the place as the falling gold dust arranged itself into a set of recognizable symbols, closely resembling the alphabets which clustered together to form words. A smile spread across Steven\u2019s face as he saw the beautiful scene unravel in front of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTill now, the words were,<br>\r\n\u201cThe Dragon Lord seeks your help.\u201d<br>\r\nSteven could surely read what was written but couldn\u2019t comprehend it. How could a normal person like him supposedly help the Lord of the Dragons, itself. Was he mistaken for someone he was not? Was he ready for it? Who was the Dragon Lord? Many questions swam through Steven\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(820 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven wondered what he could lose by undertaking such an adventure \u2013 his life? What else has he got to lose, anyway but if he lets go of this task he might lose two most important things to him \u2013 the self-esteem and then Laura. What would he without either of them? He had his answer and now all he could see the clarity of the situation in front of him. This was his chance perhaps to be the savior which he always craved for when he was a child. A faint smile flickered across his face as his mind went briefly to childhood days when he would fight with paper swords and against paper dragons. He took a deep, long breath as he prepared himself to use his palm sized dagger against Dragon\u2019s <br>\r\nLord. What Irony!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked into the eyes of the Blue dragon standing in front of him, nodded and said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am ready, friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the four dragons let out a roar, as if celebrating the homecoming of a great warrior. Steven moved towards the dragons as all four of them hopped towards him. He gave a hug to all of them and heard back a gurgling purr in return.<br>\r\nBlue put his head down to the ground and curved his back too to enable Steven climb onto him. Steven had never rode a horse leave alone a dragon and his nerves showed as he nearly stumbled in his first attempt to ride on top of him only to be saved by a friendly shove by the little black dragon who stood there, as if waiting for this to happen. Steven hung onto the zig zag fleshy thorn like structure on the Dragon\u2019s neck and pulled his body against it. Blue stooped further and gave his body a little jerk to the right and upwards to balance Steven upon him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew,\u201d Steven\u2019s feeling of relief came out of his mouth as he balanced himself on top of Blue. Blue craned his neck back to see Steven and he nodded back to him. Steven gently patted Blue\u2019s neck andc caressed the scaly structure on Blue\u2019s neck. Blue was now slowly and steadily rising up on his legs, trying his best to keep this act of his as slow as possible but such was the enormous height of this fifteen foot creature that a jerk or two were inevitable. Steven kept on clinging hard to Blue\u2019s rock like body and the jerks didn\u2019t harm him much apart from one or two leap of the heart. He was now preparing to ready himself for the flight of his life and he slowly closed his eyes in anticipation of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Blue\u2019s ravishing mane as the only thing to hold by Steven heard his stomach churn when Blue flapped its silvery wings which almost brushed Steven\u2019s legs. The flutter of the wings caused so much noise that the neighing of the dragon\u2019s as they took off from the elevated rock was subdued in it. All which remained now was a quick repetition of the sound made by the enormous wings of Blue and all the other dragons - \u201cPhat..Phick\u2026Phat..Phick..Phat\u201d Blue looked towards the other three dragons and revved up the wings even more and lo, Steven perched atop the most beautiful of dragons of the world began rising into the warm air which surrounded that place. Steven wrapped his legs around the Dragon\u2019s back as much as he could and away they went higher and higher into the ocean blue sky. Steven felt like he would vomit when he looked down to the ground amidst the jerky up and down motions of the dragon. It was as if a roller-coaster was set free to roam in the higher environs but Steven was not yet ready to enjoy it. They went yet higher into the sky and Steven closed his eyes hoping to cure the feeling of doom encircling his head. He was feeling like he could slip any moment from his far from safe seat especially because the he had not much to hold to. Just then, Blue tucked Steven\u2019s legs between his hind toes as if securing him before unleashing more adventures on him. Steven suddenly realized that he felt far more snug and comfortable on Blue now. Did Blue feel his insecurity and agony?, he wondered. But how could their be this connect between them when Steven had apparently no connection to Dragon or had never ever seen one dragon in his whole life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Steven could pain his head more with thinking about the non-existent connect, Blue raised his nose skywards and accelerated his ascent to the sky even further. At first Steven was stunned but now, he was feeling increasingly more secure with every passing second of ascent. In fact, he felt so secure that he freed his hand and let go the hair of Blue which he had held tight until then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used them to pat Blue, as if egging him on to go even higher and even swifter into the air. Steven was now completely in the moment \u2013 no fear, no undue thoughts was now near him and his mind was now a complete blank living in the present moment in all its glory. He let out a \u201cyoohooo\u201d as Blue chased the other dragons who were apparently racing with Blue now. Blue did a little somersault to cut through the arrow formation of the little black dragons and positioned itself to the head of the arrow shape. Together they tore through the air as Steven spread his arms wide, as if he was flying. If this wasn\u2019t flying then he didn\u2019t know what flying was! With his arms still spread out and his eyes open he looked down to see how far above he was and all he could see was little blue spots on the mother earth sprinkled between vast expanses of green. To top it all, the earth\u2019s curvature was visible from the height which they were flying. What a scene this was! He felt alive alright; alive and kicking the air some five hundred feet above the Earth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was the calmness which surrounded Steven in that moment, that it took some time for him to realize that the Dragons were no longer rising higher into the sky. They had decreased their velocity considerably too and all five of them \u2013 including Steven \u2013 were like gliding through the air more than anything else. Steven had now registered the fact that the time of the testing hour was to begin. Some fifty feet away, he saw a beautiful rainbow sparkling away in all its glory but it wasn\u2019t the rainbow alone which caught his attention; it was the fact that the rainbow had a silvery dab smack right in the center of the bend and the dragons were now lining up, one behind the another, as if to enter the rainbow one by one. Blue was the one leading them now as the rest three lined them up courteously behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sparkle of the Rainbow was now falling on the Blue\u2019s body and in the next five seconds it hit Steven\u2019s body too. He felt a definite shiver run through his body, as if somebody sagely had placed his palms on his forehead, and slowly all the seven colors bathed his body in the glory of the colors. A new sense of consciousness had pervaded his body and in that stream of consciousness he saw the figure of an Old man who was infinitely old if one went by the ripe whiteness which colored his hair and beard. His eyes too spoke of the years of wisdom he had accumulated in himself but the aura on his face and forehead betrayed the years \u2013 a youth, in the best of his health would have been exceedingly proud of the freshness his face possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Steven knew nothing about this old man, but such was the grace and calm in the old man\u2019s aura that Steven\u2019s head bowed almost by himself to the Godly figure in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Keeper of the Dragon welcomes you,\u201d he said, in a baritone which hit the deepest oceans of Steven\u2019s soul. <br>\r\nSteven felt a surge of emotions running through him and he exclaimed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFather!\u201d with stream of warm water running down his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1397 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t hear that voice again for some time and he wondered whether he was hallucinating because the voice he had heard a human voice. These dragons could communicate but not in humanly voice, he knew that now. He moved towards Blue and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure I should go there, Blue,\u201d Blue let out a feeblest of noises as if it was a horse not a dragon. As he caressed Blue\u2019s furry body, he heard that voice again \u2013 very muffled and breaking in between \u2013 but he kind of figured it out that it was either a young kid\u2019s or a female\u2019s voice that he had heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you hear that, Blue?\u201d Steven said as he waited for some time, trying to digest what his mind had registered.<br>\r\n\u201con\u2019t g-give u-up-S----there. I am st- there. C-come sa-\u201d that voice hit him again, breaking in between again yet making him aware of the presence of a human around him. W<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d Steven yelled, moving towards the edge of the terrain they stood. His voice hit the deeepest part of valley and returned back untouched, echoing in his ears \u201cWho was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, I know I heard somebody? Who w-was \u2013 L-Laura?\u201d Steven mind raced against the various possibilities and chose a name which gave him most comfort out of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura is that you?\u201d he bellowed again and got nothing in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-go t-to the D-dragon p-place, S-Steven. T-there l-lies the secret to i-it all. T-trust the -\u201c and the voice broke off in middle as if the speaker had been strangled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t know what to make out of it but one thing that he knew was that there was an honesty in that voice which had  touched him. Maybe it wasn\u2019t Laura who was speaking, after all but surely, it was somebody who knew how important Laura was to Steven and hence speaking in Laura\u2019s voice to get his attention and put its point across. Steven replayed what he had just heard in his mind and recollected the important points in that advice. He had to go the Dragon place for sure but what secret did that voice talk about to him? What did it wanted to convey? Whom should I trust and what was the voice\u2019s concern in that regards? Many such questions clouded Steven\u2019s mind and he gave his head a little jerk, as if to shoo away those thoughts from himself. He needed clarity at this point of time; clarity about what needed to be done next and that he knew was to go to the Dragon place the voice talked about. Maybe the answers to all the secrets lay in the journey to that destination. Maybe it was his destiny which was taking him there and it was high time he didn\u2019t fight anymore with his destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the Dragon place, Blue,\u201d almost commanded Steven, the first time he had the confidence in him to look at the Dragon and command it to do something for him. Blue looked up at Steven and then at all other Dragons. Together they all moved towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(556 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven needn\u2019t know what all questions he needed to answer since what was appearing before him next was the mother of all questions he had answered in his life. A sinuous dragon, red in color with green veins running through his body, appeared from behind where the four dragons stood.  A ghastly stench filled the place as the dragon rose up higher and higher in the air till he hovered over them all. The Dragons looked around to see the curious figure rising above them all. It was unlike anything they had ever heard or seen in their lifetime. It was as if the Red Dragon was afflicted with wounds which sat all over his body, waiting to be burst open. Steven was the most stressed of them all as he knew that whatever be the case he wouldn\u2019t sit and fly on this dragon, if that was the reason he was here. He knew that he had to go to the Dragon Lord but if he had to go search for the Dragon Lord seated on this beast then Lord save him. Or was he the Dragon Lord himself? This question stressed him even more. If this monster was the Dragon Lord then he was surely not a role model in terms of hygiene which other Dragons seemed very particular about. <br>\r\nFor instance, look at that Blue Dragon standing there. Now, although he is petrified of the Red Monster there is something of a class about him as he stoops down with that carefully combed mane flowing backwards, those white polished teeth as if he brushed thrice an hour and those super clean nostrils which were devoid of mucus or any stupid hair growth. Steven\u2019s hand quickly went to his nose to pluck the stray nose hairs which were hanging their tiny heads out from it. Then he looked at the little Black dragon whose feet looked more pedicured than Kim Kardarshian of the modern world and his wings \u2013 wow look at those spick-a-span wings \u2013 which danced ever so slightly every time the little one tried to block his eyes using it. He was afraid not only for himself but for his self-image too; think what would Laura think of him when she sees him with this ghastly Red Monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOff all the Dragons of the world, what did he do to deserve this rotten piece of Meat?\u201d he wondered but another train of thought which went something like \u201cWhat have you done in your life to deserve a dragon, Monsieur?\u201d quickly derailed the first train of thought. Of course he felt at peace now because he knew in his heart that he was a worthless piece of crap who deserved a limping rat to sit on at the very best and the fact that he was getting a dragon, however unsanitary, would do him more good than bad, anyway. The Red Dragon came down to sit between all of them, resulting in a stench equivalent to hundred tonne of rotten hen. Steven looked at the other Dragons and cursed them as they had big, long wings to cover their tiny nostrils whereas all he had was his shirt sleeve and that too let through some of the stench. He Red Dragon looked all around and opened his mouth to say something. But before he could say anything there was a large thud heard resulting from the little dragons going unconscious. Steven wondered what kind of magic was it but before he could consider more about it, the gust of rotten smell from the Red Dragon\u2019s mouth hit him and he vomited, instantaneously. He bent over to let out what all he had consumed which was primarily water and Dragon eggs. As Steven wiped of his last remnants of vile, he thanked the stomach for digestion which essentially hid the fact that he had sneakily feasted upon Dragon\u2019s egg while they were hiding in the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven heard a curious noise as if somebody complaining and he looked at the Red Dragon, who was wrapping around his torn wings around his own nose and glaring towards Steven with a look of disdain in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the matter with you?\u201d it said in a squeaky voice which hardly justified his ultra-sized personality. It was more like a horse was given a sparrow\u2019s voice \u2013 not even duck\u2019s!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me!\u201d said Steven who was offended by the stupid question. It was also a true fact that he managed to utter these words because had gained confidence having heard the squeaking little voice of the Red Beast. He felt his empty stomach could gurgle <br>\r\nway more loudly than the sound uttered by the stupid Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is plain disgusting,\u201d the Red Dragon squeaked again, \u201cdon\u2019t you have any regards for cleanliness or what?\u201d<br>\r\nSteven tried to search for traces of a practical joke in the Red Dragon\u2019s mannerisms but nothing felt comic about him \u2013 well, apart from his voice \u2013 and the dragon stared right back at him with the most serious of death stares. It is funny how a small little thing can change perspective about anybody and Steven was experiencing it to the hilt as he imagined himself pounding the Red Dragon on top of his head. How would he reach the top of the head was somebody else\u2019s problem at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked at Blue and to find what he thought of this Red beast. TO be fair, Blue was never intimidated by the Red Dragon and all what he bothered was for the safety of his own respiratory mechanism. He had held his breath for some five minutes now and he knew that he couldn\u2019t do it any longer. He held onto the last signs of breathlessness and prepared himself to inhale the putrid air all around that place. But before that Blue had to exhale the most he could so that he could inhale the most he could to be secure from the agony for as long as possible. Three- Two \u2013 One and lo, Blue exhaled with all his might and a Blue streak of flame shot across the smelly air, probably cursing its luck, and landed right on the foot of the Red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa \u2013 whoa, brother,\u201d Red Dragon exclaimed, \u201cdon\u2019t be too excited,\u201d he said as he hopped back five steps.  \u201cAnd anyways, I am not here to fight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the Red Dragon didn\u2019t say was that he was a yellow blooded mammal who didn\u2019t had it in him to fight \u2013 he never could. All he ever did was to attend the Live Portrait sessions by Chinese Artists who used him to create magnificent art. However, considering the enormous size of the Red he could never finish their portrait; that was the precise reason one of the frustrated Chinese painter had tried to set him on fire because seeing him reminded him of unfinished work, every single minute of his life.<br>\r\n\u201cBlue, do you know why is he here for?\u201d Steven asked Blue mistaking his fire throwing act as a sign of attacking. Blue wanted to shrug his shoulders but sadly evolution hadn\u2019t given him that option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou little mess,\u201d Red jumped into the conversation, \u201ccan\u2019t you talk to me directly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Steven\u2019s hand had slipped of his nose and he was now no longer covering it. He felt nausea hitting him as the fresh gust of rotten fish topped with rotten tomatoes smell entered his unlucky nose. He somehow balanced himself by taking the support of a nearby rock. He looked towards Red and opened his mouth to ask him \u201cwhy are you here\u201d but Red interrupted him and squeaked - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am here to help you little crap ball.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven didn\u2019t had it in him to face this fresh (or probably stalest) onslaught of bad breath and he slouched over to the rock nearby him ad went unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, this is why I don\u2019t help people. They are too sensitive,\u201d and Red jerked his head towards Blue who too was lying down on the floor, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed didn\u2019t know what to do\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1350 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He went towards Blue, caressed him with the fingers of his left foot. Since the Red Dragon considered Blue to be too dirty to be touched by his ultra-pure hands (or limbs as some humans may have called them) he used to his foot again to shake him up. If anyone had looked at what Red was doing, they wouldn\u2019t have taken a second to guess that he was hapless in sensitive emotional scenes. He never knew what needed to be done with sensitive people and sensitive situation. The most sensitivity he had ever felt in his life was his big teeth started to rot from the inside. Right there was his experience in sensitivity. The Red dragon obviously didn\u2019t know that and he whispered to himself \u2013 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I am something of an evangelist, am I not? I can surely fix this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed Dragon considered himself something of an evangelist \u2013 not the whole of it but \u201csomething\u201d (he was particularly fussy about the proportion of it). He didn\u2019t know what it meant but he had read this word in some novel and it had stuck with him. He especially liked the sound of it but he was also aware of the fact that he didn\u2019t know what it meant and hence the \u201csomething\u201d thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed Dragon looked around and considered the option to fly away from the scene. After all, who was to know what happened and they might as well think that they had seen a bad dream, after all. since he liked to be abreast with the latest writing trends \u2013 and this \u201cwaking up from a dream thing\u201d was as ancient as himself.  He knew these little tricks pretty well and he believed them to be true to tee. (He on some days wondered that what \u201cto the tee\u201d meant but it felt like his face could swell and his brain could explode if he overthought it. He was excessively concerned about his handsome face, without a brain he could live with. What purpose did it serve anyway?) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just flapped his wings together when he heard a little rustle, as if somebody was waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust stretching \u2013 nothing much. Not flying away surely!  Just stretching my sore muscles,\u201d  he said to nobody in particular and everybody in general , \u201cA-ahhh. O-o-ooohhh,\u201d he bent sideways a bit for the effect. From the corner of his eyes he saw Steven moving his legs a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went towards him he heard a giggle.   <br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I giggling?\u201d he said to himself but realized that he wasn\u2019t. \u201cThen, who is it?\u201d he yelled and obviously nobody answered him. \u201cAh, it must have been me,\u201d he sniggered and added, \u201cOld age does that to you. You remember a joke from day before yesterday which your tiny ancient brain couldn\u2019t process back then but it keeps working at it and bam \u2013 suddenly you understand it,\u201d he shook his head at himself. He heard another giggle then which he didn\u2019t even bother checking about and instead assumed it to be his own. Only if he could have turned his neck slightly towards his left, he would have seen the Blue dragon giggling like a little school girl who has heard the word tushy for the first time. <br>\r\nNow, Blue Dragon was not giggling for the same reasons as Red\u2019s but because he thought that Steven was faking that unconsciousness thing so that Dragon Red would go away and hence be saved from a plenty of migraines. While this was not entirely impossible but the fact that was Steven was unconscious, perhaps not fully, which must have led Blue to believe that he was faking it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHe is such a poor actor,\u201d Blue sniggered, as he himself too lay unconscious on the same spot still holding his breath, so that he didn\u2019t have to face the Red Dragon. He tried hard to clutch onto another giggle which was building in his enormous belly but failed yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHee hee hee hee,\u201d the voice echoed for a while but Red didn\u2019t even flinch for a second. All he was interested in was to know about the jokes which were causing this laughter. He stood there for a while as he ransacked his brain \u2013 or whatever was in that hollow pouch of his called cranium \u2013 and wondered what all lay in there. His lower lip went upwards in total astonishment of the finest of assortment his mind had accumulated. To make it even more of a spectacle, he was even talking to himself aloud as he carefully classified the various facts and secrets he had unearthed (or unbrained, rather).<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUpon seeing and hearing this most curious of occurrences, Blue like he wanted to pee. He couldn\u2019t control his laughter one bit and he was very sure of the fact that his belly was shaking like a pooch standing on burning firecrackers.  In fact such was the sound of the Blue\u2019s laughter that it felt like several thunderclaps, all at once, which was enough to shake Steven out of his unconsciousness. He held onto his head which still had traces of stench in it and sat up slowly on his place. He also saw Blue lying in the corner laughing like a rabid dog, kicking the hapless air with its legs and rolling on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered what this was all about. He looked at Red who seemed to be looking at the blue sky with eyes so full of happiness as if he had found a bottle of fruit jam in that stupid blue sky. For a split second, Steven thought that probably he was dead, in heaven and seeing a happy ending to his life\u2019s movie but he knew that it couldn\u2019t be probably true because of that stench which still was with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmelly heaven is not what the Lord would appreciate,\u201d he whispered, very sure of the factuality of this statement little did he know though that Garlic was a common ingredient used in preparation of Heaven\u2019s main course. But yes, he was right \u2013 this was no heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed had gone on with his reverie if he hadn\u2019t seen Steven from the very large room sized corner of his humongous eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Friend, you are awake!\u201d exclaimed Red and he ran towards Steven to give him the tightest of hugs. Steven stood frozen where he was and wondered as to what he had done in his life to deserve this. This is no heaven \u2013 might be hell, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1088 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven looked around to see a way out of this rampaging mother trucks \u2013 the biggest of them all. With his neck craned the most it could he didn\u2019t see a thing which could have proved useful \u2013 well that is if we discount the banana skin lying at some distance which surely too much of an innovation to prove useful. He knew that it wouldn\u2019t help him. Apart from the banana skin there was the dog-poo in some distance which again wasn\u2019t exactly gold dust in such situations \u2013 or in any situation, probably. All he could see was a tree which stood upright some twenty feet away. It hit him. He wanted to run to the tree and climb to the topmost leaf the tree and sit there till the end of time \u2013 end of Red Dragon\u2019s time that is. Just when he was about to pat himself for this wonderful idea, he realized that say even if he was successful in this act of his, the Red Dragon could simply fly to the top of the tree, pick him up from there, place him on the ground and then hug cum squish cum suffocate cum rot him to death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed Dragon was waiting at some five dragon feet away from where Steven stood. He stood there stooped, bent in half almost as if panting because of the exceedingly long runway for hug. As he did this, the Red Dragon lost all control on his lungs and the result was that he was exhaling fireballs all around him. It was quite a sight seeing a dragon about to be killed in his own fire and exotic photographers, if there would have been any, would have lined up for the front row seats of such a scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven stood their viewing that scene for some time; he wanted to clap and whistle and call all his friends to see the irony of the situation but some grey matter in the upper compartment of the head told him that this was his moment to run away to hide from the Red Beast. Although there was a remote possibility that the Dragon would die, but for some reason his heart knew that Red Beast was too huge to be consumed by fire. He also knew that once he would survive he would return to be the tall pain in the neck he was slowly but surely building into. He had to run and that moment was now. With his still fixed at the raging fire, he turned towards the tree to run away from the spot. Then, just when he had turned his back on the Red Beast, the human in Steven came to the fore; it made him feel that it was his duty to help the Dragon out. Or maybe, it was the little ego which craved for a Dragon sized boost. Whatever it was it made him stop and walk towards the Dragon, who was still hunched over his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven ran to his side, ignoring the giggling sound he was hearing from somewhere. Of course it was Dragon Blue who was overtly amused by something or the other. Steven gave Blue the most cursory of sideways glance and raised an eyebrow in recognition of the fact that Blue was seen rolling in the dusty ground. Strange, he thought to himself but kept rushing to be Red\u2019s side. When he was some three steps away from him, he took a long breath, preparing himself for the breathless experience which awaited him. Soon, he reached there to stand shoulder to shoulder (or shoulder to knee) with Red in his time of crisis. He tapped him on his knees (which certainly felt odd and yes, squishy) and said-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny issues, friend?\u201d What happened next was what Steven never expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha,\u201d Red said with the widest of smiles as he hugged his new friend Steven. All sixty ton of Red Dragon squeezed Steven to fill his heart with utmost glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven didn\u2019t know what hit him. So Red was faking the panting et al all this while so that he could trick Steven into his scrubby wings! Now he understood why Blue was seen rolling on the floor laughing. So he knew about it all; Or was it that he was just guessing that this was to happen. He marked it as a to-do thing in his head which was getting increasingly clouded by the smell of the beast wrapping him. The stench of the Red Dragon was now rapidly drenching every pore of his being and he tried to push back Red; but it felt like an ant pushing against a combo package of whale and a dinosaur. What was most strange about it all though was the reek didn\u2019t make him vomit, this time out. Maybe he was growing immune to it. Steven noted this point in his mind so that he could quote it when his mother would nag him about being stubborn and all. When Steven caught himself thinking about his mother while he was hugging Red it gave him a strange feeling, as if he was comparing his mother to a beast. Well however apt that description might have been, it didn\u2019t sound right in his head and he let out a cry of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026what.  w-what? H-hey are you, okay?\u201d Red said as he saw Steven\u2019s face had turned ghostly white because of the mixture of several emotions \u2013 anger, frustration, suffocation being the top three at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you care to leave me out of your crab clutch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrab, where is the crab?\u201d Red jumped with horror and looked around to search for the crab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said crab clutch, beast. Idiom. Heard it?\u201d Steven gnashed his teeth as he said it, standing tall on his own feet as Red still jumped around searching for the non-existent crab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not idiot, Steven. How mean of you?\u201d Red Dragon replied, with a look of hurt in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I said Idiom not idiot,\u201d Steven said, in reply to that insinuation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh,\u201d was all Red could manage to say as a look of embarrassment flashed in the Dragon\u2019s eye as he realized that it was his old malfunctioning ears which had felt him down yet again. It was too bad that that there was no hearing machine in production those days because if someone needed it then it was the Dragon clan, and mostly the older one of them \u2013 which they all were in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrab?\u201d said Steven and raised his eyebrow in order to ask him what was up with the crab thing he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no. I knew there was a crab, somewhere. Where is it?\u201d the Dragon dance had begun yet again and Red hopped all over the place, shook every single muscle to drop off the crab which he thought was perched somewhere on his body. Steven wanted to stop him from doing it but this was a scene which was not an everyday slice of life. A Dragon hopping and jumping as if running around to catch its own tail was a tale for the ages.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is why I hate my size,\u201d Red yelled as he shook those large wings but nothing dropped off from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could have gone on quite a few more minutes if not hours, if that human in Steve had not made another of those guest appearances. That human in Steve was a bloody party pooper but it knew how to choose its moments and it only arrived once the entertaining joke ran the risk of being run thin to its bare skin. This worked was doubly beneficial for Steve \u2013 firstly, Steve could enjoy the fun to the maximum and secondly, it made him feel good at the end, after all. <br>\r\nThis is what the human is about after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is NO crab, stupid beast?\u201d he yelled at Red Dragon. Red Dragon stopped in its step and looked back towards Steven, as if he would cry any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not stupid, Steven, I am j-just,\u201d a lump equivalent to three normal sized human formed in the Dragon\u2019s throat as he tried to complete his sentence, \u201cI a-am j-just Bloody old. Boooohooohoohoooo\u201d he couldn\u2019t control himself any further as buckets of tear ran down his flat face and thudded the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven knew he had to stop this crying soon \u2013 not because of the human thing \u2013 but because if he let Red cry, the place could be soon flooded with them.

He wondered if there was something he could so about it by talking to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought of a good enough name to call him with, since he didn\u2019t know his name yet. He thoutht some more and when it felt that his brain had surrendered trying finding a name for the ugliest  and hugest living structure ever he said - \u201cRed Beast, I am sorry.\u201d Well, the red beast thing did catch Red\u2019s attention for a while but only because he heard it \u201cBread Feast\u201d \u2013 his old eardrums embarrassing him and all. He looked around, still crying, and upon nothing which seemed like white bread his tear gland ejected tears even more rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was becoming a serious problem now for Steven who was struggling to stand still in its place because the dusty ground below his feet which had turned slightly muddy and difficult to stand upon since the tears had mixed with the mud and turned it gooey. He looked all around and a very small level of water was already forming in the pit besides Blue who was still lay unconscious. For how long that pit could keep the flood away from Blue, he shuddered. Just beside him was the valley in which he would fall \u2013 in fact they all would fall \u2013 if Red wasn\u2019t to stop with his crying thing. Steven was getting even more restless and he yelled at Red, leaving behind any semblance of politeness of his last dialogue with him - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it, you idiot. You will kill us, don\u2019t you see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed was seriously offended with the idiot word thrown at him again. Curiosly, Red\u2019s ear didn\u2019t malfunction then and he heard it loud and clear. A torrent of tears streamed out from his humongous eyes and in no time Steven was washed away in it and landed with Blue and the little black dragons who were one more burst away. Steven tried to hold onto a tree stump but couldn\u2019t and one by one they all fell into the deepest of valleys surrounding forest Re-Re.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(362 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

It was causing quite a commotion in the place and Steven had nothing in his mind to counter him. Red stopped for a little while, probably to breathe more than anything else and then spread open his mouth to resume where he had left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey wait,\u201d Steven yelled, and Red waited for him to say something. It was kind of strange because the brakes were so sudden that it made Steven wonder whether Red was indeed hurt. He wanted to ask him about it but was worried that he might start to sob again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou plan on saying something or can I restart with my tear thing?\u201d Red managed to slip through these words amidst his sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry, Okay?\u201d Steven said, \u201cI just meant to say that there was no damn crab in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Red heard it right this time but that didn\u2019t stop him from scanning the place from the corner of his eyes.<br>\r\nSteven gestured towards Red and made a cross sign with his arms to get his point through, just to be clear. Red nodded and came near Steven to hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr-\u201c is what Steven could manage to say before Red hugged him, not that tightly as before but tight enough for a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, shall we go, Steven?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you remember that place?\u201d he said, making a last attempt to somehow escape it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, obviously,\u201d said Red as he shrugged his wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I am not going without my friends,\u201d said he looking in the direction of the Blue and the other little Dragons which lay in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course \u2013 of course,\u201d said Red, \u201cI would carry them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how would you carry them \u2013 err- Red is that what is should call you?\u201d Steven asked Red who nodded vigorously, sensing a new friendship building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Red,\u201d Steven continued from where he had left off, \u201csee I would be riding you, so I would be okay,\u201d he gulped, \u201dbut what about Blue and the other dragons. Where would you carry them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on. How na\u00efve are you! I would carry them here,\u201d he flapped his wings up and down but Steven didn\u2019t get it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would be carrying them in my armpits, Steven, where else and \u2013 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are okay, we are doing great,\u201d all the four dragons who were supposedly lying unconscious till then replied back in chorus. They did a little acting of course, holding their heads with their wings and all that but it was worthless since Red\u2019s eyes were busy seeing their own dreams; dream of flying together side by side with all the other Dragons and of course Steven too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed rubbed his wings together in glee as he looked at them all, standing side by side. He had never had a family ever, and this felt closest to it. He walked towards them and wrapped his huge wings all around them. For some reason, neither of them felt any reek emanating from Red\u2019s wings. Steven in fact, took his deepest breath to check this fact and so did Blue but no, nothing. The little black dragons noted that that those wings also seemed redder and more polished than they looked before. They were wondering whether Red had gone under the knife or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what is the plan now?\u201d Steven said, jostling with Red\u2019s wings in the least impolite way possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did the trick as the huddle broke down. Blue dusted his wings and stretched them and so did the little black dragons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo ready for the voyage, Steven?\u201d asked Red and Steven nodded but the voyage couldn\u2019t start till five minutes later <br>\r\nbecause Red was asking this quetion to each and every voyager. The little black dragons were quite overwhelmed and honestly didn\u2019t know if they were ready to answer this question. In their mind, they were considering what all could go wrong on this trip. Hence, it took some time to get them to answer Red. Finally they nodded with a very heavy and a pounding heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed stooped a bit so that Steven could climb atop him. Steven wanted to go with Blue and he looked towards him. Blue stood there, looking away as if pretending to not see the difficult decision time for Steven. The little black dragon knew that Steven wouldn\u2019t be sitting on him but they hoped that they would choose Blue over Red, not out of some dragon love but because they wanted to confirm their hypothesis that Men always go with Blue. They almost clapped when they saw Steven go to Blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you take me to that place, Blue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue purred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if the Red Dragon created another of those scenes, then I am afraid I will have to go with Red,\u201d Blue\u2019s head went down a little, \u201conce we get there, I promise Blue I would never choose anyone over you. Promise,\u201d Blue looked in his eyes and opened his roundish mouth, as if trying to say \u201cPromise\u201d. At least, this is what Steven believed it to be.<br>\r\nSteven then moved towards Red, with his most melodramatic speech prepared. He was ready for an emotional blackmail if circumstances demanded it. He opened his mouth to say something but before any voice came out, Red looked at him with those big, watery eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was almost stunned, forgetting his complete speech in a moment. Instead he said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what? What is it, Red?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Red said and wiped away the tears by the edge of his huge wings, which almost wiped away Steven too from the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, friend. Tell me,\u201d he tried to put his arms on Red\u2019s wings but failed to reach them. So instead he stood on his toes and reached his moustaches and caressed them lovingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me, what is it?\u201d\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that, I am not sure of -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf being able to \u2013 \u201c Red coughed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf being able to do what, Red?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf being able to live without this family, ever. Promise me, you won\u2019t leave my side ever and you would always, always ride on me,\u201d Red broke into a series of sobs. Steven looked towards Blue with the droopiest of eyes and Blue let out a light mourning sound because he had overheard the conversation too. Steven patted Red\u2019s moustaches and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1110 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Folks thought I was crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so, young master . it is totally possible for you. Your loving concern for your friend translated already to Tek and assisted in her rescue. In fact , that is one of the reasons you have come to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a witch, controlling these dragons\" ' Stephen asked, a bit concerned because of what others taught.  He never believed dragons were stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smile and assured him. \"No, I would not control these creatures. They can perceive more than we and, while acting on instinct when threatened, can learn and understand us as other creatures seeking to live in peace or destroy. of course,  when you entered he<br>\r\n nest, they went to high alert and logic is not there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are sorry, indeed, if we have frightened you. We  are being hunted and many seek our nursery for the prize . Dragons borne away from dragon kind can be imprinted with all manner of attitudes,  even tortured to comply.  I have friends who will not ever trust human kind--they are wary and only come if our leader insists.  Other dragons , I am afraid, are already lost.  there be evil wizards who damage them for a price.\"  she hung her head in sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman stroked Yatoo's neck and hummed to comfort her.  \"It is time to return to your nest and watch now.  I will reset the warding, now our friends have been revealed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said, and bowed to Stephen and Laura.. \"and welcome, friends.\"  She turned then and spread her wings and flew off, followed by the others.  Tek lingered, but at a wave from the woman, joined the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three stood watching the beauty of the dragon flight until the dragons disappeared on the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come,\" she said. \"You must be hungry and tired. It is time for refreshment.\"  She turned and led the pair, still in awe, into the cave. They had to bend down to enter but once inside stood up and looked around.<br>\r\nThe cave was rounded and large enough for a dragon to stand in and on one wall there were carvings of runes.<br>\r\nThe woman stood there now and raised her hands to finger the patterns.

Two sleeping areas were arranged on either side of a long wall, each with a curtain at the end. In the middle of the room there was an ornate table and chairs. A water pitcher and glasses were set in readiness. Food was all ready in serving dishes and they could see the steam rising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot food!\"  Stephen rushed over. \"when was the last time we had that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sit\", said Savi.   \"There is also a place to clean up over there,\" she indicated the little nook in the wall that seemed to curve around a bend. \"There is water and all you require.\" She bowed and left them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!

So they ate their fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like magic.\" Stephen remarked. \"I mean, this was ready really fast. We only just go there and it was like they were ready for company. There are even night clothes..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and you think that is strange?\" queried a voice from above them. They looked up and saw the tiniest dragon they had ever seen. In fact, they had never known one could be that small. He was sitting on a rocky ledge on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? Why are you so small?\" Laura blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small?  mm. I am the size I am born to be. er...well I may grow a bit longer but...why do you ask?  Am I so strange too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't know dragons could be so small.\" Stephen explained.  \"We have only seen and heard about the great beasts and that most are not that friendly. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It figures! Showoffs, everyone of them. Well it so happens that there are a race of miniature dragons, though our number in diminished.

Where?  How many?\" he was talking faster as he got excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.

You see those small ones you saw were once real and by evil trickery were changed to stone and clay and frozen into solids. We were those who got away---well my parents generation anyway.  This magic is still active and now effects more than just small creatures but now even more dragons than before and your world.

One was at the foot of the young woman who sat at her mirror scrying her crystal orb, the other, a miniature, snoozing on her shoulder.  The flame burned low, casting ever decreasing shadow.  So absorbed in her work, she saw it not for it was carefully placed to the far left on the corner of the dresser to have the least effect on the images in the glass orb. Long at her task, her companions had drifted off into dreams.  The images fading, finally unclear in the mist, the reader stirred, rolling her shoulders and heaved a sigh.  The tiny dragon whimpered at the disturbance.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  \u201cSorry, Snark.\u201d  Deidre said. as she took the sleepy creature and placed him on the sheep skin near her feet, and started to stretch.  She nimbly stepped over the snout of Tak and walked around to shake out her legs.  Yawning, she reached for the ceiling, stretching her entire body.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTak snorted and woke at that moment.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWell, Tak,\u201d she said.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d  Tak lifted his head and shifted it to one side to look at her.  \u201cThe village is in great danger.  But Melnon won\u2019t listen. Says I\u2019m just a girl, a gypsy\u2019s daughter, no less, and what would I know.  I suppose he has a point, not realizing who I am--and he, so bound up with honours and government. Like the old days, eh, Tak?  Some things never change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing for it but to go around him.  Above him, really, though he\u2019d never admit it. I\u2019ll have to tell Rhea. She\u2019ll round up the others.  Orin will believe me. He knows the history.  Melnon won\u2019t like the interference but he has to get along with the council.  Rhea will know who to get to influence them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTak snorted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. But we can\u2019t wait around like they did last time.  There was nothing left.  You remember. You were there.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTak stretched and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeriel should have followed her instincts sooner. She left it too late-in her great regard for Mayor Tanol.  I don\u2019t know how I have such urgency about this.  There is no one to consult here. I just know.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTak growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?  Oh I know, Tak. If I could get to Crystal Mountain to see Ribeha The Wise--but it would take too long.  A warning must go out tonight.<br>\r\nSnark!  Snark, wake up.\u201d she tugged the little tail of the tiny dragon. He opened one eye and groaned,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am awake,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHow could one sleep with you babbling on and that giant snoring!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Snark. I\u2019m sorry but this is important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.  I heard.  What do you want me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake this message to Rhea Oberlot,\u201d she explained as she ripped a piece of journal paper and scrawled quickly in ink.  She\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Snark?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cBe careful. There\u2019s strange magic brewing.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cNo kidding.\u201d he quipped as he disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She slowly turned and raised a hand to stroke Tak\u2019s back.  \u201cHis humour doesn\u2019t change with age, does it?\u201d  she smiled.  Indeed , some things never change.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Tak raised an eyebrow in agreement and stretched out low to enjoy his mistress\u2019s absently given strokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n546words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">Martell house</span></span></div></div>",

You little beast, what are you up to?  Must you cause such a commotion when you show up?\u201d she ranted.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSnark flitted up to the mantel and dropped the note, which sailed down to the floor like a dead leaf.  Rhea reached down, almost tripping over a table to get it.  She read it quickly. \u201cOh great specks of fibremeal!  it can\u2019t be.\u201d Her face goes pale as she assumed the worst scenario.  A note from Seer was usually vital and they were rare recently,  but this call for the One Kin--that meant big trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Rhea looked at the time--three hours \u2018til dawn.  Just time enough she thought to rouse them.  She grabbed her over cloak and rammed her feet into her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Snark! Tell her we\u2019ll be there. Regular spot. Soon.\u201d<br>\r\n    <br>\r\nSnark, however, had already disappeared.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cDrat that creature!\u201d Rhea muttered and slammed out of the hut.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n  It took her three hours to rouse everyone, thanks to Topaz, the blind.  He offered to climb the path up to the forest to find Orin while she raced around the village.  She was utterly exhausted by the time she reached Silvertwine Arrow, the grove of sacred trees, the favourite meeting place of seers from all realms.  Already, Topaz, Orin and the Twins had assembled, the younger two wide eyed with excitement and curiosity.  It was their first call as heirs of Laddenstrike, their grandfather\u2019s estate.  The younger twin had also received his gift-and so the tradition continued.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  \u201cCalm down , you two.\u201d she said as they ran to meet her. \u201cThis is serious business if I\u2019m any judge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    By the 8th hour of the morning the gathering was complete, except for the Seer.  Snark had delivered the message a little late, as he had popped in for breakfast and forgot the time. She had been watching their arrival and waiting to see Orin, and timed her own entry with his.  She rode on Tak and dismounted just outside the sacred grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cFriends.\u201d she spoke as she walked into their midst, \u201cthank you for coming so promptly.  I wish it was for better tidings, but unfortunately...I need your help.  The whole village does, maybe even the far reaches.  A great destruction approaches us and we must warn the people, plan for defense.  The mayor will not hear me so it is up to you, the people of the Right.  The council must be pressed to hear me--prepare so disaster, as in times past, can perhaps be avoided.  I must leave you to do what you can here while I meet with others afar--to get better sight of the situation.  I do not want to leave.  My place is here--but we are small, I, yet young in power, only trust my vision in spite of my youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Orin, you ,who knew my parentage, my journey. vouch for me, old tutor. I seek most of all your wisdom in this though I am most certain of myself.\u201d  She bowed briefly in her plea.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n  \u201cYes , daughter, I do thee vouch.  My old bones tuned to earth\u2019s shatter, have felt the wind of shadow , too.  It reeks of old evil.  Memory fails not for hours of near death.  I fear,-<br>\r\nfriends, we must heed, before too late.\u201d<br>\r\n    <br>\r\nMany nodded.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n  \u201cBut what if it doesn\u2019t work? How can we possibly influence the council and will Melnon listen?  He has taken much power over them--more I think than you realize.\u201d<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n  \u201cI think he may be part of the problem to come, knowing or not.\u201d Topaz the blind said cryptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cThen we will alert the village ourselves, prepare as best we can while Seer raises some help.\u201d<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\u201c And we will offer our assistance here and now,\u201d piped up a small unfamiliar voice.<br>\r\nSeer looked down. Sitting in the crook of an aged alder were two elves.  The speaker jumped up and bows, slinging his bow.  The elder white-haired elf scrunched his eyes and<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElves!\u201d an astonished shout form the twins.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be,\u201d said Rhea, \u201cI never.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d  Deidre spoke.  \u201cthank you for the offer.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe could do no less. We are the protectors of this grove.\u201d<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\u201cWe?\u201d Rhea said.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  \u201cYes, our people.  Oh, we stay out of sight mostly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cBut worse danger than your human foolishness is afoot,\u201d interjected the elder, \u201cDanger for us all.\u201d he looked straight at Seer.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a seer too!\u201d she said,  \u201cThen you\u2019ve seen--?  It\u2019s true!\u201d  Her worried tone almost got the better of her.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\u201cLass, we\u2019d best counsel and then you be off to the great Mountain and I\u2019ll to Lower Cavern.  Fear not, for I will be here in your  absence.  Orin will bespeak me. And Snark, he is still in your service not doubt?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cYes, how did you know?\u201d<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\u201cOh, Snark and I go way back.  A story for another time,\u201d he sounded wistful unlike his earlier tone.  \u201cUhem,\u201d he brought himself back to the present.  \u201cWell come , Seer.  Lad, you stay.  Listen. Help.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  She turned to Orin. \u201cTake care and thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The group turned to discuss procedures as the two seers walked toward the glade.  The elf escorted Seer to a quiet spot by the river Esplan where they sat on Mute Rock.  It was peaceful there and quiet in a strange way as if not a part of the real world.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cSit here,\u201d he motions to a particularly grey yet mottled rock.  She sat on its cool form and in a moment it was warm.  Noticeably so.  Her face showed her expression of puzzlement and he explained, \u201c This is Mute rock.  We have permission to meet here and he can be quite the host when he wants to be.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201c Thank you , Mute rock,\u201d she acknowledged, feeling a little silly. She herself talked to trees, so she was not really surprised.<br>\r\nSerious again, she asked,  \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her and said gravely,  \u201cHe has destroyed Oberla, Mylanda and holds Caprica.  The trolls in Foreland have moved north, hoping not to have to engage him and that not finding them there, he might spare their homes.  I have reports all over elfdom, on the edges of your world, of disastrous effects already on the mists of Forever Unseeing and Time Beyond.  It seems he has a deeper power than Ringman of Old and no one yet knows how to defeat him.  There are old prophecies. I study them now. No avail.  The trolls say nothing.  Gnomes do not have much written lore.  Giants are reluctant to deal with anyone.  It may lie with your people--the answer--you must meet with the others, the magics of the crystal, dragon lore-or even pure human lore.  I have spoken with Tiara Main.  She , like you, has had visions and seeks the Record Books of Tair Cask.  You would be best to travel to Cair Daval and the Mountain Masters, though there are rumours from our flyers that Eban has  left this world--he long held the key to the tomb of Mysteries Long Buried.  Who his successor is I know not.  That is all I can tell you, except that it has befallen you Young One, to discover the ebb and flow to this dread.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cYes, so it seems. What you say burdens my heart. yet more determined I am to stop this.  Surely more than I are to fight.  Already , you have given me strength, and faith.  I will do as you suggest and head to Cair Daval first, as fast as Tak can fly.\u201d she decided as she got up from the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u201cYes, well, I can perhaps help that.  \u201cYour dragon-- a fine ally.  Here,\u201d he held out a small bag of granules.  \u201cRope this around Tak\u2019s neck. It will give him further strength and power in time of need.\u201d<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\u201cThank you for all your help,\u201d she shook his hand and turned to go.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n\u201cAnd Seer,\u201d<br>\r\n      <br>\r\nYes,\u201d<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n\u201cTake Snark with you.  I imagine he is rather a bother at times, as befits his name.  But he knows more than you may think, forgets more than he remembers---but invaluable insight and information he possesses.  He will come through in the end.\u201d<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n  \u201cYes, I am learning that.\u201d she smiled, thinking about the lazy little thing who liked to sleep on her shoulder.  She\u2019d never seen him do that with Teriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          She mounted Tak, whom she found Orin and in her mind she called for Snark.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m here already.\u201d Snark appeared, his mood not having altered.  \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n\u201cTo Cair Daval.\u201d she replied. \u201cKnow the way?\u201d<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n\u201cKnow the way!\u201d he sputtered, totally insulted.  \u201cWhy I\u2019d know the way to that forsaken barren with my eyes closed- just so I\u2019d always avoid it.  Why of all the earth\u2019s shelters would you want to go there?\u201d he ranted. \u201cOk ,Tak, now head west to the Aura Sea but follow the shore south.\u201d he ordered as if born to lead, before getting an answer to his question.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHe sat up on Seer\u2019s shoulder like a little captain, nose pointed into the wind.  She shoved her crystal into her sack and began to explain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to meet other seers to find out how to stop this.  No one knows, according to Elf Eidderin.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cEidderin!\u201d Is he still around? hiding out, no doubt.  They all do, now.  Like some dragons I could mention.  Cowards.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  \u201cOh now, Snark. That\u2019s not it!\u201d<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    \u201cI know. He\u2019d know, old Eidderin.  You are blessed if he let you into his confidence. I guess you told him about me, uh?\u201d<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n  \u201cWell, he brought it up actually.\u201d<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n  \u201cNo! Well, what do you say to that, hiding out and spying as well.  Not a seer for nothing!  So did he say how we, uh, met?\u201d<br>\r\n          <br>\r\n  \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t have time.\u201d<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n    \u201cAh, no matter. Better to be on with the task at hand.

As Deidre and her dragon companions flew toward the sacred mountains, she gasped in awe.  \u201c So this is it!\u201d she whispered.  She\u2019d heard about the majesty of the place and envisioned it only once in her crystal orb. Nothing prepared her for its beauty.  Tak paused mid-flight to take in the scenery and await further direction.  Snark was even silent for moments in the sacredness of the sight.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\u201cWhere do we go in?\u201d  Deidre asked the pair.  \u201cSnark, do you know?\u201d<br>\r\n      <br>\r\nWell, it has been ages. I was very young when I came once before.  But I will try to remember.  Let me think.\u201d  The little dragon closed his eyes, then opened them to gaze around obliquely.  \u201cMove toward that centre peak, Tak, the one that is rounded and smaller than the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n  Tak obliged and brought them in close. Snark continued, \u201dnow circle around slowly and let me get my bearings.  If I remember rightly there should be a..yes, there it is, see that dark shadowy spot on the side of the mount? Head there.  That should tell us further what we want to know.\u201d<br>\r\n      <br>\r\nTak brought them in and Deidre could see a small cave-like entrance. She wouldn\u2019t have been able to find in without dragon sight.  \u201cOf course the whole complex was designed in the time of the dragons...\u201d  Snark began<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Deidre with an excited Snark entered the darkness. \u201cYes,, yes..I remember!\u201d  Snark was like a youngster in his enthusiasm.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Deidre pulled out her light amulet to see more clearly.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  \u201cMove to the wall.\u201d Snark said, flitting toward it himself.  She moved closer and shone the light, which illuminated the perfectly formed rune symbols on the wall.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n\u201cRunes,\u201d she guessed.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n  \u201c Yes, this is the code for entry.  You must interpret then and go to the very top of this mount, chant them three times as you walk in a circle.  Then stand in the centre and wait.\u201dSnark went on.\u201d Funny, I\u2019d forgotten all of this .  Useless, \u2018til now.\u201d<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\u201c You are a wonder, Snark,\u201d Deidre praised.  \u201cThank you. Now what do the runes say?\u201d<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n  \u201cAh, don\u2019t you know? You are a Seer aren\u2019t you? Am I supposed to know everything?\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n    \u201cOf course not,\u201d Deidre said, puzzled.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n  \u201cWell I don\u2019t recall that.  I was a youngster then, and the masters did the magic.\u201d<br>\r\nTak snorted.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n  \u201cWhat? Of course I did Tak.  I went with them to the top and round and round we went.  I remember \u2018cause it was on the day of the brightest sun and the whole place glowed like a giant crystal while the sound echoed, nearly driving me crazy.  Elanis touradis ladicai!<br>\r\nElanis touradis ladicai! over and over even though the master only did it twice, the echoes were thousands to my sensitive hearing.  I just flapped about crazily,\u201d he went on. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n  \u201cElanis touradis ladicai, yes, that\u2019s it  ,Snark.\u201d  Deidre turned to Tak. \u201cThanks Tak.  These runes can be interpreted that way.  I\u2019ll just check now you\u2019ve given me the key--there are a newer set of runes scratched below.  Now if I can recall my lessons in ancient words, we\u2019ll be off.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Snark snorted, and flipped his tail obviously proud of what he did but rather surprised, embarrassed that his knowledge was triggered out of him by that young Tak.

She dismounted, and the three walked to the centre of the hill. The dragons stood at mid-point while she began to step around in a circle and chant. <br>\r\n                      \u201cElanis  touradis ladacai<br>\r\n                        Eras tibides alacara\u201d<br>\r\nHer three chants reverberated and shattered into many echoes and as the last one sounded, the three companions disappeared from view, into the inner recesses of Tar Caval itself.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Stunned, they landed inside a great hall of sorts, decorated with tapestries carved on walls, painted with shiny substances.  eyes from various figures seemed to follow them as they slowly stepped around the room.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    \u201cThis I don\u2019t recall,\u201d Snark said. \u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n  Deidre replied, \u201c So was the chant.

Snark flew to take a closer look.  \u201cYes, come on. through here!\u201d<br>\r\n        <br>\r\nDeidre touched the finely carved wood and pushed on an emerald oval stone in the centre.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven kept running and running, his legs flaying around as if independent from body. He did not even look back once to whether Dragon followed him still. He ekpt on going till he ran out of breath. Still forcing himself to keep moving was no longer a possibility now. His hands rested on his kneesx as he stood stooped, gasping for breath. He wondered whre Laura was. She had went left, after all. Steven considered the possibility of Laura being chased down by the Dragons but something within him told that Laura was too smart for Dragons. He had heard of wraith of the dragons, their fury unleashed on cities and villages at once but what he had never heard was the reason behind their such activities. What made them mad, he thought, but this was no time for such thought. Dragon are supposedly the most genius species which has ever lived on Planet Earth. Some species of Dragons are even known to change their form from Dragons to Turtles to snakes to Crocodile, as and when required. The Chinese mythology has volumes of stories about it and it sure is no folklore. He cared for Laura and was now scared for her. He wondered whether he could go back the path he came to search for Laura. He knew that it was not impossible to do but it would be a major risk for somebody who just ran away with the Dragon\u2019s eggs. The Dragon\u2019s capture everything in their sacred third eye and remember everything they have seen or done over their lifetime. It was decision time, now, and Steven took a long and deep breath. He closed his eyes and saw Laura running for the forest. He opened his eyes with a clear understanding of what he needed to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven knew that if he would go by the path of narrow rocky terrain it would take him at least an hour to reach the forest which lay down the hills. He couldn\u2019t risk it. Possibly, Laura would reach down sooner as the path to the left of the cave had a steeper downward curve and it would take her nearly twentu minutes or so to reach the plain. He cditn want to risk her being alone for this much time, considering the circustances they were in. And that is when it hit him. He would rock climb down to the plains. That would be the only way to reach them faster than Laura. He had never done rock climbing before and in fact, he was scared of heigthts but no such ideas crosses in mind; possibly there was no place for such and idea in his mind and al he could thinkof was Laura and her safety. He knew that even if he got down, searching Laura there would be something he had to think of next becuasse the density of the trees in the forest was so thick that sometimes a apath had to be carved out from between the trees which stood there, as if guarding a forest secret. He moved to the edge of the terrain and looked down. All he could see was green expanses after a climb down of some fifty feet. He had to do it, anyhow. He turned to face the rock, slowly placed his right foot on the rock crevice just beneath the terrain and then took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~*******~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura had been hiding behind a small boulder for more than ten minutes now. She hadn\u2019t heard a voice in this time. She knew that dragons didn\u2019t had it in her to be quiet for so long. Such was their size that something or the other gave away; if not the flapping of the wings then their shrill cries if not their shrill cries then their breathing. She slowly peaked out of from behind the rock and saw nothing. She took a deep long breath, crawled out from the crevice and ran as fast she could. The steep downward road took her in no time and it felt as if she was gliding down the curve.<br>\r\n~~~~~~******~~~~~~<br>\r\nNeither of them knew where the other person was, but as luck would have it both Laura and Steven had reached the forest at approximately the same time. Steven did suffer slight cuts and bruises as he climbed down the hill but that was it. Laura on the other hand was as thirsty as an alive person could be without dying. It felt as if her life was ready to escape through her dry barren throat, such was the thirst she was experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Steven were separated by some seven hundred feet which felt like miles, instead. The thick trees laden with the greenest of leaves were hell bent on not letting through the vision of anybody across. Such was the growth on them that the trees sometimes intermingled into other tree\u2019s branches. Steven stood under the shades of one such tree and looked up at the place from where he had climbed down. He couldn\u2019t believe what he had done but soon realized that what he was to do now would be far tougher in the amount of cranial activity that it would require. He looked at the tree standing there blocking his passage. He had absolutely no idea of which direction of where to go; what the end point of this forest OR where was castle they were earlier headed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere would be some way to do this. Think Steven, think,\u201d he reproached himself. He thought for a while but when he couldn\u2019t get an instant solution to his problem. The irritation and hopelessness building in him reached a new crescendo as a horrible feeling made way to the pit of his stomach. With his head thrown back and eyes skyward, he yelled at nothing in particular to vent out his frustration. The birds which were nestled in the branches of the trees flew out at this sudden disturbance to their realm. Perhaps they were not accustomed to it which was understandable since all they could hear in essence was their own chirp or some other bird\u2019s chirp. Nothing else, pretty much. Steven was also a bit stunned at the suddenness of the flapping sound and as he looked up to see the source of the commotion, his eyes shut close as the sunrays trickling through the leaves blinded him for an instant. That is when something hit him. Using the sunrays he could figure out the directions. He could then head further East to reach the River Saraara which cut through this forest. If probably he could reach there, he could find a plank or a wooden log on which he could drift to the western part of the forest which was essentially the end of the forest. He decided that he would get off that plank after every twenty minutes of rowing and search for Laura on both the shores of the surrounding forest. He knew now there was a way, however improbable to get Laura and the thought energized him. He quickly began to search for a spot from where he could find a direction to the river Sarara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am coming, Laura, I am coming,\u201d he whispered and quickly figured out he East direction from where he was standing. It was tricky to not get lost in the thick foliage which he stood in so he had to something which would enable him to get back to the starting point, if he wanted to. He rushed to a nearby tree and using his dagger cut off a branch of it. Then, he engraved the tree with the following words,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteven\u2013 Laura.\u201d Even writing Laura\u2019s name made him feel the warmth and closeness of his lovely friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1303 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven looked at what he had scribbled and thought of adding one more little word \u2013 a little figure to be exact perhaps \u2013 the figure of a heart, with an arrow striking through it but he resisted for now was not the time. Steven scanned the area surrounding him to scan for wild animals, monkeys, Deer anything but he just saw the brown woods of the trees splashing around the place. He wondered that why he didn\u2019t see an animal in such savannas. This was as perfect an abode for them but still no traces of animal! Probably he would meet them when he would pass through the middle of the forest. Perhaps, his being at the one end of the Forest resulted in this curious barren feel to the forest. He also thought long and hard about the kind of animals he could encounter the leopards, the tigers and the Bear. Bear \u2013 nah Beer would be impossible in these warmer environs, or what would it not be? His mind had already started to stoke with the fear in his mind. He took a deep, long breath and clutched the dagger even harder. He had to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe charted a way to remember some of his path. He would essentially move from one spot of light to another, always in the east direction. Moving ahead using the trees as a reference point was a strict no no considering the number of the trees and hence the other plan looked like a more suitable line of action. He moved to that spot of light some ten steps in front of him and then another. Soon, he had walked for over thirty minutes and he sensed his confidence coming back. Every few minutes or so he would carve his and Laura\u2019s name on the tree and then turn back from where he stood to look at the point from where he had come. If he could remember it and was sure that he hadn\u2019t lost his path then he moved ahead, else he corrected his path. The only problem was that the sun had started to set and thus there were less and less spot of lights from where sun managed to shine through. The whole area was getting increasingly dark \u2013 not as dark as the shade but darker than before. It made him wonder whether he would be able to reach the end as he had planned before the darkness. He thought of it as he dug his dagger deep into the tree to mark his name on it. Just then, he heard a rustle above him. His hands froze where they were as he tried to listen to it, once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be the birds, duh,\u201d he said aloud, wanting to hear it himself more than anything else. Another rustle. His hearts started to beat a notch higher as he felt another rustle and then another as if something was falling through the tree leaves. It increased and Steven looked up to see what it is when he saw a Leopard falling off the tree just near to where he stood. He ran for cover as soon as he realized what he had seen and had run some good five minutes that he realized that the Leopard didn\u2019t follow him at all. Still running, he looked back to the place where he was standing and saw nothing moving. The Leopard was still there, lying flat on its back. Steven eyebrows raised a notch at this curious occurrence. Was this trick of some kind, he wondered! Leopards can\u2019t be such actors and more importantly if the leopard had indeed wanted to catch Steven then it could have done it within the first ten steps. He knew something was fishy and he wanted to discover it. He started to slowly walk towards the spot, tightly gripping the dagger in his hands. He was some five steps away when he heard another rustle emanating from the leaves of the tree where the Leopard laid still. He looked up again to see what the matter was when he realized that this time a Lion was falling through the leaves of the tree. What is happening? With heart pounding against his chest, he walked carefully where the two animals lay side by side. He quickly saw towards the belly of both the animals and realized that there was no breathing taking place. He gained some confidence from it and walked closer and stooped down to where the Leopard and Lion were. Both Leopard and the Lion had a missing right eye and by the looks of it, it seemed as if they had been gouged out.  There was a streak of red which started from the eyes and finished at some place near the neck. It was if a cut was marked their and then sewed back in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor souls,\u201d Steven\u2019s heart went out to them. He caressed the Leopard\u2019s soft skin and wondered who must have done that. Just then, he heard a sound as if a terrible gurgling of hundreds of pieces of metals were clunking against each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled back his hand which lay on top of the Leopard\u2019s stomach. A fear choked his body and almost paralyzed him as he felt unable to move. Soon, the gurgling changed into a tremor and the body of the Leopard shivered. Steven stepped back as he saw the body of the Leopard grow from mere five feet to ten times of what it was. It was still inactive but it looked like that it could come to life at any moment. Steven caught hold of the dagger but soon dropped it when he saw Leopard\u2019s eye grow with bright red light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the Leopard face changed into a blue colored Ogre and he stood up on his feet. In the meantime, the dead Lion lying by his side had morphed into a dwarf, though again with a single eye. It made quite a spectacle to see a fifty foot monster and a three feet dwarf standing side by side. Steven missed a breath and his heart nearly stopped as the Ogre stretched his arms towards him. He looked up at Ogre in horror who seemed to be gnashing his teeth. Steven closed his eyes and took another of those long, deep breaths and remembered Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1064 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Now, he was going to pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Redalf!

The very place where wars of long ago has left the ghosts of silent warriors, with experiences so gruesome that their minds have been tortured\u2026And you pick on me for walking the wrong way. Everyway is the wrong way, Steven. Until you make it the right way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven stopped walking and folded his arms. \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t pick on you, silly! You picked on me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Laura said mockingly. \u201cI picked on you, but only after you complained like a crybaby. You act like Mr. Macho man near the girls, but you fall apart near me, your sister, when we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just walk,\u201d Steven said nonchalantly. \u201cArguing will get me nowhere. Especially with you! You could take us to our deaths.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really!\u201d Laura raised her eyebrows and rolled her eyes. \u201cWe aren\u2019t dead yet, although we are being watched by something or someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven grunted a negative. \u201cYou and your imagination\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at a small clearing between mighty tall trees and wished they hadn\u2019t. \u201cOuch,\u201d said Steven skipping on one foot. \u201cOoh, ouch, this really, really hurts.\u201d He lowered his hands to rub the shin that he had hit against a tree trunk just before they had stepped into the clearing. But losing his balance he fell onto the slippery, slimy, green-leafed ground. As his senses had started spinning, he lay with eyes screwed shut, and once this most uncomfortable sensation passed, he realized Laura was saying something to him repeatedly. \u201cSteven, please, are you all right? Please be all right, Steven!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled himself together enough to sit up. The effort made him whimper, but he poked into his body to make sure it was all in one place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood meat! And he\u2019s down on the ground,\u201d a voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d Laura groaned, alarmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust joking,\u201d A knight in full armor with the insignia of a fox on his chest appeared, making his way through the trees. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you guys, but we\u2019re at war, and two lost people from God knows where are always suspect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re from earth,\u201d Steven said. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re here, how we found ourselves here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how,\u201d Laura said. \u201cIt is the weird contraption you were showing me, and we fell through something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime door,\u201d smirked the knight. \u201cOr maybe a worm hole. Earth you said? I never heard of it. It must be some Godforsaken place, out there.\u201d He made a circle with his hand to indicate a probable place. \u201cOr a blackhole of some kind, I\u2019m not much learned about these things. I only know how to fight wars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven staggered to his feet, but grasped his knees, making a few pathetic sounds. \u201cLet me,\u201d the knight said, and without waiting for consent, he touched Steven\u2019s knees and stroked down his shins all the way to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling much better, Steven looked at the knight, surprised. \u201cHow did you do that? I thought I\u2019d never walk again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d the knight said. \u201cI know a bit of the magic of healing. All my friends who are warring with me can do some magic, but not like His Majesty. He is the tops. He can even read minds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat must be so inconvenient for you,\u201d Laura said. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t want anyone reading my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you ever met his majesty, you wouldn\u2019t say that. He is the most kind, most understanding, most forgiving master of all the masters, but if you approach him from his negative side, beware!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe I keep away from him,\u201d Laura said. \u201cThank you kindly, sir, for helping my stu\u2026 stupi\u2026, my brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven crinkled his nose at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight grinned. \u201cIf my master wants to meet you, he will find you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no escaping him once he puts something in his mind.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least not at the moment, sir knight,\u201d Steven said. \u201cCan you show us a way to get out of the forest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want. But the war is everywhere. Wherever you go you\u2019ll meet beasts, beast masters, dragons, giants and even nice folks if you are lucky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as we get out of this forest,\u201d Laura said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust beware of knights in black and giant women and lizard beasts that can become invisible,\u201d the knight said, pointing toward a direction. There is a town there that is quieter than the others. Once you get there, you can figure out what to do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Sir,\u201d Steven and Laura said in unison. Laura added, \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll make it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight bowed at them in greeting and turned his back to go into the dense part of the woods. As he left, Laura thought she heard him mutter to himself, \u201cIf you can ever make it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat at the clearing on a log for a few minutes, then Laura got up to pick a few berries from the brush. <i>I hope they are not poisonous,</i> she thought, as she tasted one. It was exactly the kind of blackberry her grandmother used to make a jam out of. Recalling her brought tears to her eyes, but at least, they had something to quiet the pangs of hunger they were feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the berries were eaten, Laura stood up and looked around. Miraculously the forest around them had taken the same shape and size all of a sudden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich way did the knight say we should go?\u201d Steven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis way! Oh, it looks the same in all directions. This way\u2026No, this way\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Laura, as usual. That way! Geez, I can\u2019t even tell toward which direction the knight went.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t home and we\u2019re not hitching a ride Steven. Use your head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about your head? Is it of any use?

If the nightmares that lived in this forest came in the dark, they didn't have much time. They would need to find their way out before the last light left the trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood on wobbly legs and took timid steps toward the darkness of the way they came.

Laura almost bumped into him when he stopped suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, what the devil\" she began, but his hand on her mouth silenced her. A figure wandered the trees in front of them swooping back and forth through them as if aimlessly searching, but for what. It's wail was low and disturbing. Laura's heart sped up and she choked down the bile that had risen into her throat. She was not going to lose it. She would be brave.

Were they in even more trouble now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We - we saw the smoke from your fire,\" Steven said as if that explained it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you make a habit of intruding whenever you see smoke?\" The elder gave him a hard look and Steven recoiled into the door. The woman was strange and very intimidating. There was a sinister air about her that made Laura doubt this woman was any safer than the waif. They would have to tread carefully if they hoped to make it out alive. She sent another prayer that Steven wouldn't put his foot into his mouth the way he usually did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We apologize, madam.\" Laura curtsied deep for the woman, bowing her head low, and stayed in that position for an extended time. \"We truly meant no offense. There was a waif outside, and well, we'd heard rumors of the curse on this forest, and we were afraid. Your cottage looked like a safe shelter. We did not intend to intrude. We shall go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's demeanor softened with Laura's words. The sagging skin on her face stretched thin when she raised her lips into a smile which showed the two her black and broken teeth. \"No harm done, child,\" the woman motioned toward the chair at the table next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Odd,' Laura thought. 'I could have sworn that wasn't there before.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit. Have tea.\" The woman implored. And, as if on cue, a tea kettle hanging from a hook in the fire place began to sing alerting them that the water was ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count: 429 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

At least for a while till the waif disappears.\"  Steven held her hand, looking at her, wondering what Laura was thinking and if she was with him on this one. Laura nodded, her face filled with worry and her eyes were wide, her hands trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura?\" Steven jerked Laura's hands slightly which forced Laura to look at him.

The old woman stared at him for a moment longer and then busied herself with the fire. \"Give her the tea or she will surely not survive the night.\" She called over her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven gulped and put the cup to Laura's lips. She had turned a sickening ash gray color and his stomach knotted at the sight of her. Her eyes had begun to turn yellow and an eerie green glow emitted from her skin. \"What's wrong with her?\" he asked, suddenly very afraid to touch her and he pulled the cup away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast you, boy,\" the woman snapped, snatching the cup from his hands and forcing it into Laura's mouth. He watched as she laid the girl onto the bed, covering her with a dingy sheet that looked as if it had seen better years. \"It may be too late for her already. Drink the tea if you do not wish to end up in the same predicament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven nodded and drank, his eyes never leaving Laura. He couldn't believe how quickly the fever had come on her. One minute she was fine and the next she was gray. \"What happened?\" He turned toward the hag as she sat in her rocking chair. She motioned toward the chair next to her and he walked toward it dutifully, sitting himself into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've lived in these woods many, many years.\" The woman began, rocking her chair back and forth. \"Ever since I was a little girl.\" Her eyes took on a wistful, longing expression, but they never left Laura. She watched the other girl as a hawk would watch its prey. Steven felt a shiver travel up his spine. \"My mother and aunts lived here with me. There were five of us in this cottage. The townspeople would come to us for remedies and things for illnesses and love and, well, other things.\" She paused, took a sip of her tea and then let out a ragged breath. Steven thought he saw the glint of something in the corner of her eye. A tear, perhaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day,\" the woman continued, \"a handsome young man showed up at the door. My mother tried to refuse him. I think she knew what he was, but my aunts were under his spell. I was hidden in my room, as was customary when strange men came to visit us, and my mother slipped in and gave me a drink of something. I saw the stranger before the tonic took full effect and for a moment I was under his spell as well. He begged my mother for me. And I wanted to go with him. But she stood firm. And as the tonic took effect, I saw him for what he was. A demon in our midst. He would have feasted on me and then came back for my family. My mother banished him from our house and placed protections around it so that he could never get in. In return, he lured my aunts out one by one and turned them into the creatures you saw outside. I tried once to leave the forest. My mother and I had become prisoners. But within a few hours of being outside of the house, I became ill like your friend. My mother saved me. She gave me the tonic and I was cured. But, we realized we could never leave. We could never be free of this curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven turned his attention to Laura, his mouth hanging wide open. He didn't want that to happen to his friend. He hand known Laura since they were both small. Next month she was set to be married to a man twice her age in hopes of uniting their houses. They had set off on this adventure in hopes of preventing that union. But this was not the way Steven wanted to do that. He loved Laura, was in love with her if he was honest about admitting his feelings on the matter. \"Will she live?\" he whispered, though he wasn't sure who he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hag answered. \"I'm not sure. How long were you both out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For most of the day,\" he responded. \"She wanted to go around, but that would have added three days to our trip. I pushed her to come into the forest. I wanted our journey to be over more quickly. This is all my fault.\" Steven laid his head in his hands and let out a wail that rivaled the sound of the cursed beings in the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>782 words</i> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

He had to be fifty yards away from the house, otherwise, he would start burning.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura's eyes fluttered and she opened them to sunlight streaming in across her face. It took her a moment to cross the void between sleep and wake. Once she did, she sat up and looked around. This room was unfamiliar. How did they get here? When? And where was Steven?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven?\" she called out, turning her head left and right. She smiled when she saw him asleep in a rocking chair near the hearth. It looked like the most uncomfortable position to sleep in. She studied him. He looked so young while he slept, much younger than his five and twenty years. Laura recalled their childhood and the friend of her brother on whom she had an incredible crush. And though she was seven years younger than the boys, they never once complained about her tagging along. After Daniel died, Steven stepped into the big brother role seamlessly, as if he knew his place would forever be as Laura's protector. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura watched Steven's face scrunch and he shifted in the chair, pulling himself into a tight ball. His features looked pained and agonizing. 'I wonder what he's dreaming.' She thought. She considered waking him to ask, and then thought better of it. They were supposed to be travelling to beg the king to call off her wedding to the Earl. She recalled their decision to enter the forest, and then getting lost in the forest, but little else came to mind about the events after they'd decided to turn around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced around the deceptive cottage. At first glance, the room seemed tiny; just enough space for a table, a few chairs and the rocker. But each sweep she made with her eyes provided something else to look at; another door, a hallway, or another piece of furniture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven mumbled \"have to keep Laura safe. I promised.\" And she turned her attention back to him. He was still sound asleep and still curled in the fetal position as best he could in that too small chair. His body looked enormous in the rocker and Laura again studied the lines on his face. She had done so covertly so many times, but this morning she relished in her opportunity to do so freely. Truth be told, it was Steven that she wanted to marry, not some smelly Earl who was twice her age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Steven had no title and her father needed the alliance. Laura was convinced that there had to be another way to make a pact with the earl. She loved her family, but this sacrifice was too great to ask her to make. If the rumors were true, she wouldn't last very long as the wife of the earl. Each of his three wives had died mysteriously within a year of their marriage. Surely that could be reason enough to call off the whole wedding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Laura a moment to realize that she was looking directly into Steven's hazel eyes. She wasn't sure when he had opened them or how long she had been staring into them. What she did know was that a warmth had spread over her entire body. Her mouth opened and her breathing came in quick gasps. Something flickered in Steven's eyes causing her heart to flutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awake!\" He blurted, righting himself in the chair. \"I was so worried when your fever came on as quickly as it did.\" And with that, the moment had passed and the caregiver, older brother figure was back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled and sighed. \"I don't recall what happened at all. Where are we and how did we get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember nothing?\" Steven sounded shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head and nibbled her lip. \"I remember the cliff and then deciding to turn around and that is the last of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" Steven looked worried. He stood and walked over to Laura and placed his hand on her forehead. He sighed in relief when he touched her cool skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Steven, what is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we saw one of them.\" He began, sitting on the bed next to her, and Laura noticed the tremble in his voice. \"The cursed, we saw it and we ran. We found this cottage and came inside. There's a woman who lives here, a witch of the southern sun. She gave us shelter. And then you got so sick, so fast. I wasn't sure if you were going to wake up. She had me give you something to drink and you slept. I stayed up half the night watching...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Steven,\" she threw her arms around him and for the first time in their lives, he put his around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n778 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

But, the feeling passed quickly and she joined him in his search of the house. She had no memory of any woman being here with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hallucinating?\" Laura asked, following Steven through the rooms. \"This house is small, there are only a couple of rooms. If anyone else was here, we would have heard them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Steven stopped suddenly and stared down the long hallway that had seemed to appear right before them. It seemed the more they walked in this house, the more the house opened up to accommodate them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" Laura asked, wrapping her arms around Steven's and pulling herself closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently it is enchanted.\" Steven turned in a circle and noticed that the hall behind him also seemed to go on for miles. \"Maybe one of them leads us out of the forest,\" he said, excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But which one?\" Laura turned her head, peering down each hallway for signs of life, or danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't know until we try one.\" Steven said, sounding very confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if we get lost?\" Laura couldn't hide the tremble in her voice. Steven had used the same tone when he talked her into entering the forest with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much more lost could we be?\" Steven's voice had an edge to it and Laura felt the sting in his tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steeled herself and stood a little straighter, letting go of Steven's arm. \"Okay,\" she said. \"You're right. Which way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven continued to stand there. He looked left and then he looked right as if studying each hallway for potential advantages and dangers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Laura asked, wondering if she would again be the one to make the decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n318 Words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Steven's eyebrows furrowed as he followed her, soon her slow steps turned into running steps as she opened a door, closed it, opened another, closed it, then another one then another one, that was until they entered a room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with you Laura? Try telling me before you drag me the next time.\" He looked at her and she was looking at something in front of her, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head to look in the front and found Linda, lying on a sofa. She wasn't moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God!\" Laura exclaimed as she moved forward, \"Is she alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven followed as he took her wrist in his hand and felt her pulse, it was there but weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's there but weak, we need to get her out of here, get her something,\" He saw as Laura touched her forehead and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has a fever, looks like she hasn't eaten in a while and her skin is pale too, she might be sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get her back to the main room and take care of her.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n400 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

How can this be? There must be a way out? We cannot be in a room without an exit, after all we just came through a door to find her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura searched the room looking for seams on the blank red wallpaper where there might be a hidden door. Her search was in vein, there was no outline, nothing. No way out they were trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" Laura asked \"She is going to die if we don't get her help and soon!\" she said in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven walked over to where Linda lay so very still, her breathing too had become shallow. With a hand on her forehead he was certain her temperature was rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her fever is rising, her breathing is too shallow. I am afraid she isn't going to make it Laura. We are going to be trapped in this damn room forever with a corpse of a witch. If that isn't bad luck I don't know what is!\" he said while running both of his hand through his thick hair. Laura understood how upset and concerned her was, he only ever did that when he was beside himself with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, if she dies the spell will be broken and the doors will return to the room. That must be what is causing everything to appear and disappear. Her magic is failing along with her body! We should leave her be, whatever will happen to her happens. If we stick close to the walls maybe one of the doors will reappear and if we are close enough to open it before it disappears again maybe we can get back into the main hall way.\" said Laura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Linda, really just leave her to die? I thought you of all people were more compassionate than that Laura honestly, sometimes I don't think I know you anymore.\" Snapped Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the lights in the room went out, it was pitch dark and then there was a horrendous screech. Both Steven huddled closely together fearing what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boom a la Moon In a spoon!\" With that said Linda's head spun in circles. She dropped to the floor with a loud thud. Steven and Laura rushed to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She isn't breathing, and I can't find a pulse. She's gone.\" Steven said with tears in his eyes. Why was he crying? He certainly didn't know why, oh ya right they were now stuck in a dark room with a dead witch. Things couldn't get any worse for them could they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wasn't doing anything though though just following her, and trying to think which was hard with the anxiety that was gripping him at this very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly both Laura and Steven jumped, there was another loud bang, both of them heard it this time.

She felt calm and centred for the first time since they have been trapped in this hell hole of a room. With that the lights flickered and were back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God\" Steven muttered quietly under his breath.

It sounded almost as if the trees were being pulled up from the ground by their very roots, tearing the earth to shreds. They began tipping, creating a domino effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to go back, Laura.\" Steven shook his head. \"There's no way we can...\" He turned to look at the forest.

Perpetual darkness surrounded them, a cold ice licked at her skin and then finally, it was almost over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blinding white light filled the ground beneath them getting starker with every inch closer they got. Laura screamed and squeezed her eyes shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey landed with a dull thump, her body falling deep into something so cold she thought her legs might fall off.

She looked harmless enough, but what was happening to Steven? Was the girl really sucking out his soul?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do?\" Laura asked him. \"I don't know what to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... so tired...so weak.

She was a village girl treading up the hill to collect gooseberries and other food items and she had painted her face as blue because she wanted to scare her little kiddie brother who would bug her like anything. Poor choice on her part though to use a color given out by the leaves of aa tree known as the \u201cPurple Beast\u201d in the vbillage. It didn\u2019t have such a name for nothing, It was said to be possessed with a witch which lived on it for nearly seventy years before she got killed by the Wizard of Poz. The witch may have died but her dark soul still clung onto the every leaf of the tree and her blood ran through its every twig. The person in contact of it would not die but would act as a magnet for weakened souls of the universe and Laura\u2019s soul was surely one of them. The girl obviously didn\u2019t know that and she waved at Laura in all her innocence, probably wanting to play with her as the girl hadn\u2019t seen her before but with every second Laura ended up looking at the Blue girl, a tiny particle in her soul was disintegrating and moving towards not the girl but the Tree \u2013 \u201cThe Purple beast\u201d. There was only one way to break this magic and it was if somebody could get to throw something pure on that Blue girl so as to break the connection like say water, as it is the purest of things found on our planet. Nothing else would work on it and in fact, anything impure would make it grow even further \u2013 just like the air in the forest was making it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked at Laura who was still staring at the Blue Girl. He called out Laura\u2019s name but she kept moving ahead towards the Blue Girl. He looked towards the Little Blue Girl who was waving frantically at Laura, as if inviting her to play with something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat could it be?\u201d Steven wondered as he rushed to be on Laura\u2019s side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura,\u201d he said, shaking her by the shoulder but it didn\u2019t do anything. He looked into her eyes to see a purplish haze coming over it, as if a glaze was now trying to romp all over the pupil. He looked at the little innocent girl standing at some twenty hands distance from him. She said,<br>\r\n\u201cCome Madam, play with me. I will take you to my village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want to do that, girl?\u201d Steven yelled right back the girl who was a bit taken aback by somebody else\u2019s jumping into the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not the shy kind but she was a bit reserve when it came to talking to men. After all, in her village she was forbidden o talk to men directly as it was considered a taboo for a grown up girl to be talking adult. In fact, it was taken as being amoral and asking for favors from the men of the village who let up no chances when it came to women. The women of her village used to live in little cottages of their own, locked up in their own world till they would marry someone else. The boys until the age of ten were allowed to stay with their Mommas and sister but only because they couldn\u2019t live without the presence of a motherly figure in the initial stages. Any boy outstaying this period was either banished from the village or sacrificed to the Lord Puzu who was believed to offer them protection. The little girls were the most treasured one amongst the women as they were the only hope of women to get food from afar. The women themselves couldn\u2019t do it so they would use the little girls they would live with to get all the daily commodities from the nearby forest, the river and the small little farm nearby.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just want to play, mister. There is no one I can play with in my village. I will take this madam to my village so that I could be friends with her,\u201d the curious thing about these words from Laura\u2019s mouth was that not even for one second did she take away her gaze from Steven. She was obviously doing it as she wasn\u2019t allowed to stare directly at men in her village but the effect it was having on Laura was something nobody living is prepared for. It is as if the soul in your body writhes in pain as strand by strand, particle by particle it disintegrates into minutest of atoms and escapes via your eyes. It is a painful, suffocating experience for the soul and the body but the sad part is that the tormented could do anything about it at all. All it could do is to wait and suffer the inevitable. <br>\r\nLaura\u2019s eye which were now three-fourth of purple were burning from one such sensation. She could hardly breathe but she still kept walking towards the Blue girl who had now got up and walking towards Laura too. Laura knew she had to stop it but felt completely incapable of doing it. Somehow, the deepest of emotions in her heart were escaping through her mouth and she said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteven, I am going. Stop me or I would be lost forever. That thing in her \u2013 that,\u201d she could say any further and Steven pushed Laura just as she was about to make contact with the Blue Girl. The girl ran away to hide behind the bushes and saw Steven shake up Laura to get her talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(966 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

She was too scared to turn back and didn\u2019t want to but it was as if a force was forcing him to turn and look what lay beyond. With her heart pounding against her bosom she turned to hear a sound which was so mean that it appear to come from a lunatic hell bent on destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-e-e-e-eeeeeeeeee.H-a-h-a-h-a,\u201d was the laughter which echoed through the place where they stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere stood the girl in blue which Steven talked about. With those hollow sockets which should have been the abode of pretty eye balls, she looked towards Laura and flashed a smile which showed her red stained teeth and those worms which lurked from her wide open mouth. Laura as if in a trance kept looking at her, intrigued by what she was seeing. In her heart she knew that she wanted to turn her head away but it was almost as if she was powerless. She was now hearing somebody calling out her name but she couldn\u2019t care less. She started to move towards the little Blue Girl who stood where she was, laughing and jerking her head back with every step Laura took towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven\u2019s tongue was trembling like a leaf in a tornado. He yelled out to Laura twice or thrice but nothing seemed to work as Laura kept on moving towards the Blue Girl. Steven knew he had to do something but had no idea of what to do. He closed his eyes, trying to regather himself and his thoughts and then ran towards Laura, who was herself walking swiftly towards the Blue Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue Girl let out a manic cry as she saw Steven running towards Laura. She couldn\u2019t let it happen. She flew towards Laura. As stunned as Steven was, he managed to run even faster, yelled to the Bleu Girl to be away from Laura and then, dived towards Laura. He knew that if he couldn\u2019t catch hold of Laura now, he may as well bid her goodbye.

She began to cry, emitting a worse sound than before. Something dark... a shadow of sorts... came from behind pulled her away. She was gone. Or at least out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven and Laura landed on a narrow ledge before hitting the bottom of the pit, if in fact, there was a bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Laura asked, grimacing from her bruised body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great question,\" answered Steven while rubbing the back of his neck. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing a hot tub wouldn't fix,\" she said, imagining what it would feel like to be soaking in warm, bubbling water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to make a decision here, Lore,\" he interrupted. \"Up or down?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although both Laura and Steven had agreed to do \u201cit\u201d, neither of them knew what \u201cit\u201d was. They had a decision to make in terms of direction to take but more importantly, they had to decide the path from thereon; what to do next once they reached the top of the hill where they had tumbled down, or what next if they reached to the end of the slide. The fact that the slode downwards had a bit of an unknown to it scared Steven a bit. Laura, despite all what she had seen was in a comparatively much better state of mind than Steven. She for some reason still longed to go to the pit she had seen when they were moving through the forest. It made the decision easier for her. She said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s climb back to the top of the hills, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd would that be because there is the pit you fancy for some reason?\u201d Steven let out a nervous smile, \u201cDo you think a treasure or some jewels of Tuten Khaamen kingdom awaits you there? What is up with the pit, huh?\u201d Steven lips curved into a big smile and it released some of the tension that had been building up in him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled back and said, \u201cNo, hon, its not because of that Pit,\u201d she made sure to cross her fingers as she told this lie, \u201cIt is because at least we know what awaits us there on the top of the hill while if we go rolling towards the bottom- going by the events our eyes have seen today \u2013 I would not be very surprised to see an army of Ghouls dancing as we reach there.\u201d<br>\r\nThe mention of the \u201cghoul\u201d did the trick as Steven didn\u2019t want to run into anything unsavory, anymore. His mind too took comfort in the fact that a known valley is better than an unknown pond. He nodded his head and said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s move quickly, dear. Sun won\u2019t last long,\u201d he looked up to see the position of the orange ball of the sky, \u201csome two hours tops I believe before the darkness is all around us. That couldn\u2019t be pretty, can it be?\u201d he flashed another of those nervous smiles.<br>\r\nLaura moved forward and clasped her hand. She said nothing in words but her eyes gave him all the support he needed. Laura was an indeed a brave woman, much like her mother who was rumored to have fought witchcraft and Ghouls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, hand in hand, they started to trek their journey upwards. Laura had already started to imagine the kind of thrill she would get as she would descend into that hellish pit. She was an adventurer in the truest sense of word and this was one adventure she couldn\u2019t let go. She was going giddy with excitement but the worst part was that she couldn\u2019t share it with Steven for he might have takena backward step. She remembered his pale face when they saw the pit for the first time. It was if someone had ordered Steven to go down the pit all by himself. She giggled a little, thinking about it and Steven caught her smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that for, mam?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah \u2013 nothing,\u201d she couldn\u2019t think of a quick enough lie so thought it safe to just avoid it altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura kept herself shushed as she covered the rest of the journey. Steven was too exhausted and too scared to let out a word too and essentially they kept walking in total silence \u2013 if heavy breathing of them both as they trekked up could be discounted for. From where they were now, Laura could see the edge of the hill which meant they were now some ten minutes away from the top.<br>\r\nAt that moment itself, Laura\u2019s eyes went towards a tree which stood some five feet away from their path. She kept looking at it for some time before moving towards it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey!\u201d exclaimed Steven, \u201cwhat is up with you, now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at him, smiled but didn\u2019t answer him and now ran towards the tree. For some reason, the tree had arm length cloths of different colors tied to it long branches. It was not a peculiar sight in this part of the region and they had met several similar \u201cclothed\u201d trees in their path, before too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Laura? Stop fooling around,\u201d Steven yelled, not out of frustration but out of mere panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura untied one piece of red cloth tied to the low hanging branch of the tree and then another and then another. Within a minute she had nine to ten piece of cloth with her. Steven stood where he was trying to make sense of it all. He thought long and hard but nothing hit him. Just when he was about to ask Laura, Laura herself said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know what these are, Steven?\u201d Laura finally spoke, \u201cThese are little pieces of blessings. The passersby of the forest, tie it to the branches of the tree if their long held wishes are fulfilled. That is their way to acknowledge and thanks the Lord of the Trees which dot the path through the forest. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she had just said was the absolute truth. Many travelers through this Ry-Ry forest have their different reasons and motives to do so but for most of them, the reason is to be blessed by the energy of the Lord of the Trees. Hence, right near the end of their journey they take out a piece of cloth they had carried with themselves, and tie it to the branches as a token of respect and thanks for the protection they got from the Tree Lords.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why exactly are you taking it, Laura?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow came the lie from Laura, \u201cSee we were stupid enough to not bring the clothes with us. We have nothing so I am taking some of these with me so that we can do something which all the travelers do for the Lords of the place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven nodded more readily than a gullible kid could have. He was not dense in the head it was just that he was too scared to think straight, so as to say. But then, out of nowhere it hit him. He said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why are you taking so many of them with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was surely not ready for it and she just kept moving on, without answering him, hoping against hope that somehow Steven could just let it pass. When Steven kept silent for some minutes Laura thought she had succeeded and just when she was getting comfortable with the feeling, Steven said \u2013 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are going to tie them together and jump into that dammit, Pit, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stopped where she was; not purely because Steven\u2019s word hit her but because the pit was now six feet away from them. She turned to look back at Steven who had a look of a defeated man in his eyes. He sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1175 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAre you sure we should do this, Laura,\u201d Steven asked, although he knew the answer to this question anyways. She had been preparing for it all the time ever since she decided to take the uphill path. Steven wasn\u2019t mad at him \u2013 by far no \u2013 because he knew that Laura had streak of an adventurer about him. He had seen too much of it lately to ignore or hate it. Better way to cope with it was to embrace it and embracing is what he did. He walked towards Laura and hugged her, which caught Laura by surprise because she stood there, looking away from Steven hoping for a barrage of angry words; this wasn\u2019t even the last thing on her mind.<br>\r\n\u201cD-Daniel, so you are not mad at me?\u201d she exclaimed, with joy overflowing in his eyes. She hugged him tightly and playfully swung him a little.<br>\r\n\u201cHey careful,\u201d said Steven stepping away from the Pit a bit, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to fall into it hugging each other. The pit aint that wide, Miss,\u201d he smiled, a mischief floating in those black eyes. Laura playfully kicked his shins. <br>\r\nSteven said,<br>\r\n\u201cSo you must have a plan for going in, right?\u201d<br>\r\nLaura gave her the blankest of look and shrugged her shoulders. <br>\r\n\u201cCome on now, Laura. You mean to say that we just jump into this pit, enjoy the environment and come back? Now, there is got to be a motive, man,\u201d Steven sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura kept quiet for a while, as if calculating something in her head. She looked into the nothingness, counted something on her fingers and then said,<br>\r\n\u201cSteven, we have precisely forty five minutes before the sunrays become too weak to illuminate the mouth of the pit. We don\u2019t want to be in that pit with darkness surrounding her. RIght?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven smirked and said, \u201cWell if you ask me, I won\u2019t like to be in that pit on the brightest of days either, hon,\u201d and they both shared a big laugh. Laura looked towards the pit as he talked to Steven,<br>\r\n\u201cI have a feeling \u2013 not a passing one but a real gut feeling \u2013 that in that pit we would find something which would help us to defend ourselves for the rest of the journey. I am attracted to it like \u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike to me?\u201d Steven winked and they beamed a smile.<br>\r\nLaura moved towards Steven in an exaggerated romantic way. She placed her right hand on Steven\u2019s left shoulder and said,<br>\r\n\u201cNothing compares to you, darling,\u201d and flashed a pout at him. They both shared another of those hearty laughs which gave them tears.<br>\r\n\u201cEnough fooling around, let\u2019s do it,\u201d said Steven almost catching Laura by surprise. She didn\u2019t expect to hear it from Steven ever. She gently squeezed his palm and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for doing this for me, dear. It means so much to me,\u201d and Laura smiled at him. Steven too gave her the warmest of smiles and said,<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d and Laura nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly tied together the many clothes she had untied from the sacred tree to form something which could serve the purpose of a rope. One by one as clothes got tied together, the piece of the tied up cloth in their hands must have been some forty feet now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think this should be long enough to reach the bottom of the pit. What do you say?\u201d Laura asked Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I really hope that the pit is not deeper than the near forty feet which this makeshift rope would take us,\u201d said Steven, trying to gauge the length of the rope, \u201cI am concerned about two things though \u2013 the strength of this,\u201d he said shaking the long cloth structure, \u201c and the time we have on our hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat time part we can manage, Steven, we will not climb down for than forty five minutes, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven\u2019s eyebrows went up in mild surprise - \u201cHey, but aren\u2019t the Sunrays supposed to die in another half an hour or so and \u2013 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-and we have to get back to, correct?\u201d Laura finished Steven\u2019s statement and Steven nodded. \u201cMy point is that the fear of unknown is only when we climb into the pit not while climbing back up. We would have seen whatever secrets lay in the pit during that descent into the pit and thus, coming back up would be a total breeze, hon.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSteven wasn\u2019t really sure about it though the conviction in Laura\u2019s voice made him agree to her point. Anyway, he knew Laura would do it so it was better that he agreed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven searched for something he could tie one end of the cloth to and fortunately he found a tree stump some three hands away from the pit. He knew the Palomar knot \u2013 or fisherman\u2019s knot \u2013 from his childhood visits to his fisherman grandfather. He tested the strength of the tree stump by trying to shake it with his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou aint no Superman, Mister,\u201d  Laura giggled and Steven too. He tied the cloth to the tree stump and gave it a jerk so as to do the final rehearsal and checks before descending into the unknown. She gave it to Laura who checked the strength too and then they both held it, with Laura standing  nearer to the cave of mouth than Steven. That way Laura would descend first into the pit and could alert Steven of any danger or abnormal occurrence.  Steven tried to reason with her to be the leading man in the expedition but had to give into the will of Laura, as usual. <br>\r\n\u201cDeep breaths, everyone,\u201d she said jokingly as he saw Steven closing his eyes, as if to pray. Steven opened his eyes and mock punched her. Together, they moved right on rim of the Pit and looked into it. A blank nothingness stared right back at them. Laura checked the tautness of the makeshift rope one last time and then threw it into the mouth of the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome after me,\u201d said Laura as she hunched to his knees and then with a clean jerk slid into the Pit leaving Steven behind, wondering how could he even start to do it. He closed his eyes and his heart pounded against his chest.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful here, Steven, we should live here, I think, \u201d said Laura, playfully, as her voice echoed in the pit and reached Steven\u2019s ear. It made him smile \u2013 the best antidote to stress. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that would be the best. No Rent, no taxes. No mosquitoes,\u201d pat came Steven\u2019s reply as he was now stooping over the pit and climbing down into it. He heard Laura giggle right back. His complete body was now inside the pit and he felt the coldness of the pit hitting him mildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould have got our sweaters, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Steven\u2019s nervousness was going away now and he again heard Laura giggling. But what he also heard was a distinct hissing sound, as if tens of snakes were ready to dig their fangs into their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that, now?\u201d Laura asked and Steven shrugged his shoulders. <br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you speak, Stevie?\u201d that\u2019s when Steven realized that of course Laura couldn\u2019t see his gestures. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Laura. Maybe there are snakes down there in the pit. I just don\u2019t know,\u201d a little nervousness was now dripping into Steven\u2019s voice, \u201cDo you see anything in there,\u201d he asked looking between his legs to see Laura but all he could see was an outline of her head, moving sideways, and wiggling of her body as she slid down the cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep going, shall we?\u201d asked Steven.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d asked Laura, more to herself than Steven, as she kicked a structure which looked like a door to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Steven held on to the wildly swinging rope because of the free kicks delivered by Laura. She didn\u2019t reply but slid further down and so as to inspect the door like structure from up close. Steven too slid down and reached where Laura previously was and saw that curious structure on the walls of the pit, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it a box?\u201d asked he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShall we knock?\u201d asked Laura, as her hands scanned the wooden structure. Steven considered it for a second and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1388 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders. This time Steven knocked the door, a bit harder than before and all they could hear in return was heavy breathing of each other. Laura had started to wonder whether it needed as much attention as it was being given by them. <br>\r\nShe looked at Steven \u2013 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteven, maybe it\u2019s not a door but just a \u2013 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA screeching echoed across the pit as the door opened a wee bit. Steven pushed himself bac from the door, anticipating a wild animal or a beast, anything. Laura laughed at his nervous face when nothing sneaked out from the slight opening of the door. Steven looked a little worried though.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Steven?\u201d Steven said nothing, \u201cCome on now, it might have been that it was once used by someone but nothing lives in there now, at least nothing harmful, else it could have gobbled it us by now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she tried to calm him down but the expression on his face didn\u2019t change. She continued, \u201cWe are this close to the mouth of the door, do you think it is waiting for us to come inside and then attack us? It can\u2019t be this lazy, now,\u201d Laura giggled as she pulled herself upwards, intending to look through that slightly ajar door. She could see nothing as darkness enveloped all around the crevice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot the matchbox?\u201d she enquired but Steven moved his head sideways. He lied because he knew where this was going. But Laura was not of the kind to wait outside some inviting door just because she didn\u2019t have light source. She whispered,<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWe are going in anyways, Steven,\u201d as she said she heard Steven sigh, \u201cso better would be to hand over the matchbox to me. I know you have it,\u201d Steven looked at her with disbelief, nodded and handed her the matchbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hanging in mid-air clasping the rope with her one hand, she pushed the matchbox into the hand which was holding the rope. She carefully took out the matchstick from the match box to light it. With the awkward hanging position she was in, she couldn\u2019t exert all the pressure she wanted while rubbing the matchstick against the matchbox. She had already tried six times but the match wouldn\u2019t light.<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it is the dampness of this place which is not letting it to,\u201d she whispered, still trying strike after strike to light the matchstick. Till now, she hadn\u2019t been able to do it and worse for it, her constant jerky motions were shaking the rope wildly. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Laura?\u201d But she kept on trying it, \u201cI am telling you, you will end losing the match \u2013 \u201c<br>\r\nEven before Steven could finish his sentence he saw the light of the matchstick glowing like a little torch in a coalmine. <br>\r\n\u201cSO you were saying \u2013\u201c she said, playful to Steven who was nodding his head in wonder and a acknowledgement of the stubbornness of Laura.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a little firecracker, aren\u2019t you,\u201d Steven said. <br>\r\n\u201cNo time for romance, Mister,\u201d she flashed those naughty smiles of her, \u201clet us go inside.\u201d<br>\r\nShe pushed the matchbox in her pocket and climbed up the rope. She gave it a jerk so that it swinging again and just when her hand reached the edge of the rocky foundation on which the door stood, she clutched it with her free hand.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Steven, catch hold of something,\u201d she yelled. Steven who was just below Laura, tried the same technique as he had seen Laura do and slid his fingers into a crevice like structure just below the door level. He pushed his fingers harder into the crevice until he had a strong grip. <br>\r\n\u201cYou okay,\u201d Laura asked before one final climb and Steven let out a \u201cyeah\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Laura pulled her weight up to the door and held onto the handle of the door. The door flung open, dragging her with it, bruising her knees in the act. Laura didn\u2019t even flinch because she knew if she said even a word then Steven would lose whatever confidence he had. Once she had reached the level ground, she quickly stretched her arms out for Steven who was struggling a bit with his grip.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Steven,\u201d she egged him on, \u201cpull yourself up just a little bit more.\u201d<br>\r\nSteven was trying his mighty hard but it was only so much he could do with those muscles of his which were not accustomed this level of physical activity. Laura hung her arm even lower but not before tying her leg to a stone which looked strong enough to support her wait. She hung even lower and now, could manage to touch the Steven\u2019s fingers somehow. Steven looked up at Laura,.<br>\r\n\u201cLaura, go back. Push back I say,\u201d he was particularly worried about her since he could see that more than half of her body was hanging down the mouth of the pit. But Laura kept pushing on, until she could clasp Steven\u2019s wrist. <br>\r\n\u201cWhen I say, push yourself up, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Laura you can\u2019t be doing this. You would end hurting yourself, I am \u2013\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Steven, push,\u201d screamed Laura and Steven gave almost jerked himself upwards to catch hold of Laura\u2019s wrists. He used his legs to get even more thrust and gave another upward jerk to his body. Laura was pulling herself back to the top using her legs which she had wrapped around the rope to slide herself up. Slowly but surely, they were rising up towards the mouth of the door. Steven and Laura were getting the hang of it now and the climbing motion had become much smoother as it fell in sync. Some five minutes later they were lying on the floor near the door, panting, gasping for breath but giggling like little kids. <br>\r\n\u201cHow many superheroes are needed to make one Laura?\u201d Steven joked with her, stroking her head and playing with her hair. Laura laughed and replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore than 75 superheroes by my calculation to make one SuperWoman,\u201d she snorted as she said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c75 what, million?\u201d and they again laughed, kicking each other gently playing like those ducks in the pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1058 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Like there is something pressed against your back that you can't see? Like when you just have an irrational feeling that can't be explained? Like when--\"<br>\r\n\"Stop it, will you, Steven?\" Impatience filled Laura's voice. <br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to lighten things up, Laura,\" Steven said. \"You are becoming so tense.\" <br>\r\n\"I need for you to take me seriously, Steven,\" Laura said. \"Stop with the shtick, will you. It's getting dark, and if we don't get out of here soon who knows what will happen.\"<br>\r\nSteven looked at his sister with a softened gaze. \"Okay, sis,\" he said. \"I'm sorry.\" He put his hand on her shoulder. \"Now tell me, what's this strange feeling you have?\" <br>\r\n\"I can't explain it,\" she said as her gaze scanned the darkening woods. \"It's like there are a million unseen eyes watching us. Do you know what I mean?\"<br>\r\n\"A million, really?\"<br>\r\n\"Steven!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sis.\" Steven swiveled his head side to side trying to see into the darkness. \"It sure does get dark fast around here, doesn't it.\" Turning to Laura, Steven said, \"Once it's totally dark we should be able to see if there are any eyes following us. Won't eyes reflect in the darkness?\"<br>\r\n\"I kind of hope they do, and I kind of hope they won't.\" Laura knelt down and rested her back against a tree. \"Let's wait until it completely dark and our eyes are accustomed to the darkness. Then we can move forward. We have to find our way out of here Steven.\" <br>\r\n\"Steven knelt next to his sister but did not rest against a tree trunk. Instead, he scanned the area constantly, his eyes searching the deepening darkness, for what he couldn't say. A moment later, hearing Laura's rythmic breathing, Steve turned and saw that Laura was fast asleep. \"How can you sleep at a time like this?\" he asked. Laura didn't stir. <br>\r\n\"Laura! Laura!\" Steven nearly shouted but got no response from his sister. He grabbed her shoulders and shook her. \"Laura! Are you okay?\" Laura still did not stir. <br>\r\nSteven slowly stood and looked into the darkness. He began to shout. \"Help! Anybody. Can anybody hear--\"<br>\r\n\"Shhhh.\" The breath of the voice stirred the hair above Steven's ear. \"Be quiet or they'll hear you.\" <br>\r\nSteven's skin prickled as if stung by a thousand bees. The hair on the back of his neck rose. He slowly turned to see who it was that has whispered into his ear. But after he had made a complete circle he saw no one. <br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" he croaked, his mouth dry. \"Who is it?\" Still no response. He could feel a presence, like there was someone standing right next to him. He could even feel the heat of someone's body. He looked down and saw that Laura was still asleep. Maybe she's not sleeping, he told himself. Maybe she's in a trance or something. <br>\r\n\"No, she's fine,\" the disembodied voice said. \"She'll wake up once you and I have agreed upon what to do.\" <br>\r\n Who, w wh who are you?\" he stammered. \"And where are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Right here, Steven.\" Slowly a light formed straight out from Steven's face. It was as if someone held a flashlight five feet above the ground and when it was turned on the light fell very slowly to the ground. Inside the shimmering light, Steven could see what looked like a small woman. <br>\r\n\"Who's side are you on?\" he asked as he backed away into the darkness. <br>\r\n\"You would leave your sister here? What if I am evil?\" The light grew brighter. \"Come back, Steven. Come back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 640 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

At this rate, we will get somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed as she looked up at the canopy of the trees that shaded them, hid them away from the outside of the world. Just then, an idea clicked in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Is something wrong? Are you hurt?\" Steven looking, his eyes full of concern, as he searched Laura for any kind of physical injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's sweet of you to be worried but I am fine.

Now might be a really, really, good time to show off, Steven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I will go, climb up the tree. Don't move from here or go anywhere else. I will be above you, just yell my name if you see something or if there is anything at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" Laura smiled, not giving much thought about Steven's warning. He was worried for her, leaving her alone down while he climbed was difficult. He couldn't possibly get down to her if she yelled. What was he going to do? She had a good reason, this could be our only chance to get somewhere safe before dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here we go,\" Steven sighed, preparing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his steps carefully as he climbed up, not looking back. After climbing to the top of the tree, the leaves rustled as he exited the layer of canopy into the open sky. The scene was breathtaking, the sun was right in front of him, he could see the horizon. His eyes landed where the last tree was. He could see smoke coming from near their position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It might be a good place to stay for the night, safe and nice.\"</i> He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Laura?!\" He looked down, trying to see Laura but he couldn't see anything due to the mingled network of leaves and trunks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura!\" He yelled her name again.<br>\r\n</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>439 words</b> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

A vision of icicles piercing his brain sent him shimmying down the trunk of the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, where are you?\"  Steve searched among the bed of twigs and leaves for footsteps, or any other signs of a path. Finding none, he widened his circle of search, calling loudly all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temperature dropped, gradually at first, and then sharply. It began to snow. Everything around him turned white: white trees, white ground, white air. An animal with white fur brushed against him.

He felt the side of the cave which felt like rock. It peirced his skin and made him bleed. Steven pulled his hand off the wall and stuffed it in his pocket. Steven kept walking for like what seemed forever.  He was tired and thirsty. He couldnt walk much longer. He couldnt see anything. He lay on the ground and wept. He was lost in caves and in the dark. He was filled with anger and fear. He was about to turn around and try and find his way out when he heard a scream and saw a small light up ahead. This gave him a surge of hope and joy. He wipped the tears from his eyes and got off his knees. He jumped foward and dashed towards the light. The light seemed to keep ahead of him as fast as he could run. The light seemed like it hadnt came any closer. He ran for a while before he started to gain up on the light.

I fell that I would dishonor him if I just left it lying here on the ground.\"<br>\r\nNo soon had Steven spoken than the fur began to rumble and hump up into the shape of white haired dog. <br>\r\n\"I thought you were a bear,\" Steven cried. <br>\r\n\"I'm a part of the spirit of winter,\" said the dog who very much resembled a husky. \"I can take any shape I want and right now I choose to <br>\r\nbe man's best friend. \"yap, yap, yap,\" he barked in a way that sounded like laughing. <br>\r\n\"What about him?\" Laura asked, pointing at the goblin and remembering he was carrying to his village in a sack. Shouldn't we tie him up or something? \"<br>\r\nSteven walked close to the goblin and looking him straight in the face, shouted, \"Boo!\"<br>\r\nThe goblin staggered back in fright.<br>\r\n\"He's harmless without his friend. I think we should keep him with us or he might go back and tell the Grand Duke where we are,\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"I still think we should pretend to follow him to the edge of the forest.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSo they started out, Steven, Laura, a dog who was really the spirit of winter, and a goblin frightened of \"Boo!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n315 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Remembering that he lied about his broken foot and lied about having all the passwords in the realm,<br>\r\nSteven tured to the right. Laura and Husky dog, Yapo, followed him. <br>\r\n\"Wait, don't leave me alone,\" the goblin called loudly, you need me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven and the goblin faced off head to head. \"Boo!,\"shouted Steven. <br>\r\nThe goblin shivered and shook.  \"You're a disgrace to your race,\" Steven said. \"You lie and you shiver and shake when someone says, \"Boo!\"<br>\r\nHe turned away from the others. \"I know your friend has gone for reinforcements. Get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goblin took off faster that scat and the three friends headed the other direction. This part of the forest was quite thick and little sunlight could filter in. Fallen branches and prickly vines made their going slow. \"Look, juicy red berries, Laura called,\" reaching out to pick some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" barked Yap, \"Not those,they're poisonous. Here, try these blueberries over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven and Laura picked as they walked, slowing them down more. \"Look,\" cried Laura. \"Look at that tree. All of the branches are rocking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a rockabye tree,\" Yapo barked. \"This is a good place for me to take a side trip because I'll see the rockabye tree from a distance. <br>\r\nYou must be tired. You sleep here under the tree. I'll wake you when I return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Yapo, the Husky, took off at a run. \"Yap, yap, yap,\" Laura and Steven could hear him barking in the distance. Then all  went still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYapo came to a halt when he reached the ridge above a narrow valley. Looking down he saw their old pal, the goblin standing amidst a large horde of goblins carrying spears and bows and arrows. Yapo, being a manifestation of the Spirit of Winter, blew frost from his breath, and watched it spreading  out in front of him. \"Fin and Feather, Change the Weather,\" he  yapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow started to fall,everything turned white. Yapo luxuriated in the cold breezes that blew his way as he watched everything in the narrow valley turn to ice. The last to freeze were the shivering goblins. All movement stopped, they were like statues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Yapo barked another incantation. \"Shiver and shake, change my shape. No more be a dog, Now be a horse. Instantly the furry husky <br>\r\nturned into a big white horse with a long mane for holding onto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neigh, neigh,\" he tried out his voice and galloped off to find the rockabye tree with the sleeping children. <br>\r\n\"Neigh, neigh,\" he stomped around on the ground until they woke.\"Get up, climb upon my back and I will carry you through the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a talking horse,\" Steven said. \"He sounds like Yapo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is Yapo,\" said Laura, who had an instinct about animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Relampago,\" said the horse, kneeling down on all four legs. \"Up you go.  If you hurry, we'll reach the castle by nightfall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 495 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

They walked for over two miles until they came to a thatch hut and a fence made of pure bamboo,  When they entered they saw there were several thatch huts and then a metal gate with barbed wire all around it.  they were taken in through the barbed wire gate, the fence must have been ten feet tall or twelve even.  they were told by the dwarfs that if they touched the fence they would be electrocuted.  when inside the gate they were left there.<br>\r\nthe dwarfs left and locked the gate they saw no one to start with, they just stood there with their hands tied behind them.

So please do not disclose this secret to anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Heeshe I will not, I am curiousj why you think I am so special and different?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you are different you are the only female among us all. we have never had a female in our midst before we have just read of you and seen pictures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't you have females, you must how else would you populate your people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo we have no females we are magic we populate by creating the dwarfs by magic  this is how we have done it every since we have been on earth.  It is not that strange actually you humans can create life in a test tube so can we .

I was so worried about you I didn't know what they might have done with you after I left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I too was afraid of what they were doing to you. Are you alright?  are you harmed in any way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve I am alright  they have treated me well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that on your head?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a crown that Heeshe gave me to protect me from the evil that is in the woods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is a crown supposed to protect you and what kind of evil are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeshe says there are lost souls who travel the woods looking for a body to invade so they may possess it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"do you really believer this ?  I think he is just trying to frighten you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Steve the night has fallen we shall see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night the two of them lay down on a mattress that Heeshe provided for them.  They lay awake both of them unable to sleep, At around three o'clock in the morning the noises began, it was like distant screaming<br>\r\nand crying.  and a high pitch whistling could be heard.<br>\r\nThe two of them lay frightened and trembling with fear.<br>\r\nneither one wanted to look out to see what was happening outside.  finally Steven decided he would be brave enough to look out the front door to see what the sounds were and where they were coming from.  <br>\r\nHe eased out of bed and silently walked over to the door he opened it a crack, and when he did he got a huge surprise.   The dwarfs had placed a bucket of ice cold water on top of the door so if it opened the water would fall below and hit upon the person opening the door.   and SPLASH!it hit all over Steve's hair and soaked him from head to toe with ice cold water.  What the hell is this shouted Steve.  Laura jumped up out of bed and ran over to Steven and when she saw he was alright she began laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have seen the look on your face it was priceless I wish I would have had a camera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah real funny, this damn water is cold !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment they both heard a horrible screaming sound it sounded as if someone were being killed.  <br>\r\nThe two of them looked at each other in fear there was no more laughter about the water it was soon replaced with fear.  <br>\r\n\"come with me\" said Laura, \"you need to stay close to me I've got this magic crown on and therefore they will not harm me.But as soon as you  leave they will get you.  Steve went ahead and peeped outside of the door which was left cracked from where he had opened it earlier, he saw a man or shall I say a ghost of a man walking near the gate but yet he did not enter the gate.  It was as if he was afraid to enter behind the fence.  The ghostly creature was fearsome looking with sunk in eyes, gaunt appearance, The creature looked like a dead creature that had resurfaced he growled like a wild animal and groaned as well. soon after another joined him and they stood outside the gate as if they were waiting for something.  Steve quickly jumped back inside the hut and slammed the door. he immediately went over beside of Laura and sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are in big trouble, you will never believe what I just saw outside the gate. \" Steve said with a pale sweaty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a demon of some sort an undead man or perhaps a dead man who was walking around with his flesh hanging from him like a zombie or something.<br>\r\nwe are in big trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at Steve with disbelief in her eyes, but as she sit staring at Steve and saw the way he shook and trembled with fear she knew he had surely seen something.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeshe said we would be Ok if only I would wear this tiara it has some sort of magic powers or something.<br>\r\nHeeshe says their Gods bless these Jewels and they have magical powers.  The demons or undead are afraid of them.  That is why I must wear the tiara as long as we are here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two are left there all night listening to the howls and screams of the night, their first night in this place  was to be a frightening one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n757 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

He was a dwarf but somehow he seemed nine feet tall.  Every one in camp was afraid of him, he was the best with magic more so than anyone else.  Heeshe was not alone a person with a cloth bag over his head was brought in by two dwarfs he was tied and gagged.  The dwarfs pushed him inside of the door and he fell to the ground hard.  Heeshe told them they need not try to escape, He knew all, and saw all, and heard all.  Heeshe and the two dwarfs left and locked the door behind them.

He is loosed on the forest each night as he is a nocturnal creature and can only roam at night.  The reason I have you and your friends is not to harm you but to save you from being enslaved to the Beast Tasha, That is the last thing we need is more undead creatures trying to take our jewels.  We can not get back home until we have all of our jewels back and the slaves of the beast have stolen much of our silver and jewels.\" explained Heeshe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you from Heeshe\". she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would not believe me If I told you,\" said Heeshe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me, I'll believe anything after last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are from Flavo, said Heeshe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flavo,\" said Laura with contempt, \"what on earth is that?   she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not what its where, it is a planet in a distant solar system we traveled here and landed to capture the beast and Bring him to our God.

They all looked at each other with confusion on their faces.  <br>\r\nSteven told Laura that Heeshe was right they needed their rest and they had to sleep during the day so as not to be kept awake by the creatures.

Heeshe brought a roast turkey with sweet potatoes, stuffing, fresh green beans, and pumpkin pie.  It was rolled in on a cart for the three of them to enjoy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow what is this Thanksgiving or something, this is quite a spread.\" said Steven<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah man I could eat a whole turkey myself I'm famished,\" said Rodney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's plenty for everyone don't be a hog boy.\"<br>\r\nsaid Steven.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeeshe brought a pitcher of some sort of liquid for them to have to drink, it was nothing any of them had ever had before it was so delicious they all loved it.  It was a special drink that was blessed by the Gods Heeshe told them , it would help to make them strong enough to fight off the undead if they had to.  <br>\r\nThey all set down to dinner along with Heeshe and a whole host of dwarfs.  They brought in a couple of the roasted birds and a whole ham on which to feast.  Before they began Heeshe asked the Gods to bless the food and when he asked this The sky opened up and rain fell upon the roof.  The lightening and thunder cracked and as quickly as it had began then it stopped.<br>\r\nHeeshe sit down at the head of the table and they all began to eat.  There was apple pie, pumpkin pie, and cherry pie along with blackberry cobbler for desert.<br>\r\nThey feasted on this meal for some time then Heeshe dismissed all of the dwarfs accept the two aids that were always close by.  He Told Laura and Steven along with Rodney That this was the night that they had to get his jewels back from Tasha, so he could take he an the other dwarfs back to Flavo, and they could return Laura, Steven, and Rodney back safely to their homes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we going to fight all of those demons and undead slaves?\" asked Steven<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With magic of course, I have many tricks up my sleeves, The undead can not stand fire it is something they are afraid of, even a small amount such as a torch would scare them off.  That is why we burn torches all over the camp site and night.\" said Heeshe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of magic?\" asked Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I have given you the blessed Tiara to protect you I will give each of the men a gold pocket watch to protect them.  The zombies can not attack that on which the Gods have blessed. \" said Heeshe<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeeshe took out two gold pocket watches and handed to each of the men, their names were inscribed in side of the watch.  The zombies would not be able to harm them as long as they had the pocket watches or the tiara on their person.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your plan?\" asked Steven<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to look for my stolen jewels, they are in a trunk of pure Jade carved and inlaid with Ivory with a gold lock .  It will be filled with diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, and gold and silver.  This is what I need to get me back home to Flavo, it is our fuel they are blessed and send off special magical vibes, this is why The beast wants them, with them he can rule the world<br>\r\nbut he doesn't have all of the pieces he is missing the most important pieces of the collection there are two crowns of platinum with diamonds and rubies all around them and gold tassels that come down on the forehead of the person wearing the crown.  Tasha must capture the crowns and a female human to wear the crowns and if he does this he will rule the world.  And believe me if he takes power Hell will be then on earth.\" when Heeshe ended his tale the whole lot of them looked at each other with fear on their faces.  <br>\r\nThere was much to worry about, They were outnumbered ten to one, and The undead did not care what they did for they felt no pain, emotionally nor physically.  They would eat the brains of their victims and their victims consisted of who or what ever was in their path.  The beast was a powerful entity much more powerful than Heeshe by himself, that is why he needs the help of The three humans wearing their magical watches and tiara.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will we be able to do against such fierce competition?\" asked Rodney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be able to use magic to kill your victims or capture them,  They will not be as physically strong as you will now be with the magic.  You will be as strong as Hercules and together you will not only be able to outsmart them but you will be able to use the fire to kill them and if they gang up on you, you have the power to start large bomb fires even with out matches. You will have magic on your side.\" said Heeshe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeeshe gave the three of them a torch that would ignite by magic.  He also handed each of them a bow and arrow to ward off wild animals in the forest.  although those weapons would be no good against the zombies or the Beast, They could be killed only by fire and the Beast could only be killed using a special dagger made of pure silver, that someone would have to get close enough to the Beast to drive it through his heart.  That is the only way to kill him.  They all got in a circle and Heeshe began to say a prayer to the Gods as they all bowed their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n981 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The box would be easy to spot with the ivory and jade exterior and a solid gold handle and lock.  They found a piece of fabric belonging to one of the night walkers or the undead and they knew that they were on the right track.<br>\r\nThe trail led down between many large oak trees. The oak trees shadowed the road, they made a canopy over the trail. The dirt path led them to the deepest part of the woods.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where they make camp, I believe they are hidden somewhere in this location,\" said Heeshe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I believe we are probably really close to where they make their camp,\"  said Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"look every where you can turn over every rock and look under every tree stump and we will find my treasure,\" said Heeshe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked frantically every where they could possibly think of but the night was beginning to fall and they would never be able to make it back to their camp before the night creatures began to stir.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better build a fire before they come out of hiding.<br>\r\nthat will keep them at bay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group each lit a torch and they started a huge bon fire and they encircled around it.  The all got their bows ready and close at hand as the night quickly blanketed the land.  In the distance a wolf began to howl, and they were all very watchful of what was transpiring around them.  All of a sudden they saw dozens of creatures lurking around in the night.  They were about five hundred feet away from the group.  Laura screamed when she saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're going to kill us and eat our brains!\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be still and stay where you are keep your tiara on your head and your bow in your hand, and they can't hurt you Laura, they are afraid of the flames of the fire,\" said Heeshe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creatures started circling around the group and they were moaning and groaning like they were being tortured.  They were half dressed in ragged out clothes<br>\r\nthat hung from their bodies like they did not fit properly.<br>\r\nThe largest one and the first one to arrive was scary looking the gang thought.  The were decomposing corpses, that walked and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God look at them they are so ugly, I'm afraid<br>\r\nand I just want to go home,\" said Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too, I don't like the looks of those things, they look like they mean business,\"  said Rodney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't go home they will stop us from leaving the forest.  We would never make it out without the magic items that were given to us by Heeshe.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is important that we stick together and not be afraid at this time.  The watches and the tiara are blessed by the Gods therefore they can not attack us personally.  I saw where they came from that may be where they are holding my treasure and jewels,\" said Heeshe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did they come from, I did not see them when they first came out,\" said Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have a nest underground, that must be where my jewels are being held.  They came out from over there,\" Heeshe pointed to a small hillside or mini mountain, that was in the midst.  \"they came from a cavern under the mountain.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean we have to go in their cavern and look for them underground?\" questioned Steven with surprise in his voice. his eyes wide open and his mouth also open wide in shock of the idea of having to go in and under the little mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes we have to go to their nest and if that means we have to go through them and in and under their cave then so be it.  We must do this quickly we will have the element of surprise, we can trick them, they can't really think clearly with their brains rotting away.  <br>\r\nYou can't be fearful or they will sense it and use your fears against you to capture you, and I need not tell you that if you are captured by these things the undead then you to will become undead ,you will die first and within twenty four hours you will be resurrected as one of The Beast's slaves the undead.<br>\r\nI need not tell you what the Beast does to his slaves, he is sadistic and cruel, you would beg for death but you will be unable to die a second time.  You will be tortured day and night the only relief you would get is the night time hunting parties they go on looking for people and dwarfs to capture and kill.  I have lost many of my dwarfs to these creatures they took them while they were praying to the God's they sneaked up on them and surprised them, they killed them and stole the bodies, those dwarfs became part of the undead group,\" explained Heeshe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come the God's did not save them? I thought you said the God's protect us?\" asked Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The God's are not able to save every one they save those who have been blessed and contain a blessed object such as I gave to you.  Those dwarfs did not have such an object with them when they were attacked.  We will be safe as long as we have each other and our magic.  I have much magic to use on them if they try to come by and attack us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is the Beast? \"  asked Rodney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know, lets hope we don't find out because my magic is not as strong as his but our blessed objects are just as strong as his magic because they have been blessed by the God's, and the God's powers are stronger than any one else's in the universe.  That is the reason the Beast wanted my trunk of jewels, my treasure has been blessed by the God's that who has the treasure in their possession will prosper and be protected by the God's,\" said Heeshe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do it, if we stick together, as long as we have the magic items in our midst we will all be alright,\" said Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was a brave man he was not really afraid or if he was he would not let on to the others that he was.<br>\r\nHe had to pretend that he was strong and able to fight what ever came up on him.  He had been to war in Iraq and was wounded in the head and in the shoulder yet he survived the gunshot wounds that his enemy placed within him.  He had seen many of his friends gunned down or blown up in a pipe bomb attack.  by Iraqie soldiers.  He felt as if he could over come any thing if he could over come that.  He had lost his best friend to a sniper's bullet which they were both attacked by the iraqie solders His friend Ben was shot in the chest, right through his heart, while Steven was shot twice, once in his temple, the bullet just grazed him and once in the shoulder.  He would do every thing he could to protect Laura, the two of them were to be married however the got abducted by the dwarfs<br>\r\nwhile in the forest trying to find a good spot for their outdoor wedding.  If they had not been abducted surely the night creatures would have gotten to them and they would be undead now instead of being soldiers for the Flavo people.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not only helping the Flavoian people you are helping your own as humans are forever more being seen in the forest that is why there are so many undead, they are all humans and dwarfs that were caught in the woods or on the outskirts of the woods at night.  They have all been taken by the Beast, Tasha<br>\r\nas his slaves. \" Heeshe said .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group each took two fire torches and left the make shift camp they had created with the bon fire and they set out to find the jewels, their destination being the camp of the undead under the small mountain just ahead about  a quarter of a mile.   The undead looked at the gang and tried to come close to them but as they did the gang took out their bows and arrows and lit the tip of the arrows with their fire torches and shot them at the undead hitting many of them.  The only thing that could destroy the undead was fire therefore they aimed for the hearts or between the eyes of the undead.  several of them burst in to flames as they were hit with the arrows.  They disappeared into thin air.  the group moved cautiously across the the dirt path that led to the mountain's entrance.  The closer they got the louder the moaning and groaning got and the group speeded up to get there before the Beast, Tasha was alarmed to their whereabouts.  The Smell was awful it smelled like rotting carcasses, Laura was sickened by the smell and had to stop to be sick off of the edge of the path.  Steven went over to her and held her hair back for her as she vomited over and over.  as she did the tiara fell off of her head when it did The Beast appeared and grabbed her.  His magic was so strong he could appear out of thin air and disappear the same way.  after grabbing her they disappeared.  <br>\r\nSteven screamed out for Laura but it was no use she was gone.  He ran in the direction where the cavern was as did the others ran after him, he wanted to get to the treasure so that they could out power Tasha the Beast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will she become one of them now?\" asked Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Legend has it that the Beast is looking for a female human to make her his bride so I think she will be safe, he will just hold her until he gets the treasure at such time he will force her to have his child, and it shall be known as the Spawn of the Beast,\"  explained Heeshe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally reached the cavern and when they went inside they noticed pentagrams on the wall painted with what looked like blood.  so far all that had been taken by the beast have been men but now he has his female that he will force to have his spawn. <br>\r\nwords 1,858  <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

They traveled deep into the cave and were underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that awful smell,\" said Rodney<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it is the undead we are getting closer to where the Beast<br>\r\nis, The undead will be guarding him so be prepared for a fight get your torches in order,\" said Heeshe<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment an undead creature came towards them<br>\r\nready to do business and eat them.  Steven was in the front and he took his torch and caught the undead on fire and he disappeared in the flames.  others began coming out of the walls from all directions, they each began fighting the creatures and they burned them up one by one, they then started a bon fire within the cave<br>\r\nand that kept the undead at bay.  Steven knew they were getting closer he just felt it in his bones, so he started screaming and calling out Laura's name.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Laura was placed in a sort of cage created by the Beast.  She was terrified of him.  But the Beast was not to harm her at this time he had plans for her the prophecy stated that he must give her a child and she was to deliver his spawn.  Together the beast and his spawn would rule the world or perhaps the universe.<br>\r\nThe Beast being magic came to Laura in the cage disguised as a man of good looks, he got in the cage with her and lay with her.  His magic put a love spell on her where she felt she was in love with the man \"beast\"  They lay together several times over the night. and the Beast was sure she would be with child.  He left her when he heard the sound of Steven's voice calling out for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Laura, Laura Where are you we are coming for you just hold on.\" cried Steven<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Beast knew they were dangerously close but what he did not know is that they had recovered the stolen treasure.  The Beast and two of his undead slaves<br>\r\nshowed themselves in the tunnel of the cavern where they were at.  Those flames will not harm the beast he is used to fire, and not at all afraid of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not going to have her,\" The beast just laughed at them a sinister laugh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeeshe not being afraid of the beast took from the treasure chest a gold crown and placed it upon his head, and when he did lights started flashing in the cave and sparks flew from the crown and Heeshe began growing he was no longer a dwarf but a man of great stature and as strong as an ox or stronger.    Heshee took from the chest a collapsable sword forged of pure silver with a diamond handle.  he started towards Heeshe with it know full well the a sterling silver sword through his heart is the only way of killing him.  The Beast was aware that Heeshe was about to kill him so he disappeared in thin air.  meanwhile the gang went towards the direction of which the Beast first appeared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the right direction,\" said Steven,\"I know she is in here; Laura, Laura, where are you ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time they heard a faint scream coming from another tunnel in behind a large bolder, which was placed in front of the opening.  The gang led by Steven moved the large bolder with the aid of magic, and they could then hear the cries of Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!  Help!  won't somebody please help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're coming Laura,\" said Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthey turned a corner within the tunnel at which time they could see Laura in a large cage.  The only problem was that she was across a fiver of molten lava<br>\r\nand pure fire was all the way around the cage. She would be difficult for someone to get a hold of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We will have to use magic, I have some diamond dust we can blow into the wind and it should create a down pour of water to douse the fire.  and then We can create a bridge from the sapphires if we pray upon them.  The gang including Laura all bowed their heads and began to pray to the Gods to create a bridge.  The Gods smiled upon Heeshe and his friends on this day as a bridge of pure steel was formed and the gang could safely cross over.  Once over the bridge they rushed over to the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Laura I was so worried about you, did he hurt you? are you OK, what has he done to you? asked Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has He touched you my dear ?\"  asked Heeshe<br>\r\n<br>\r\nnot realizing that the man she had laid with was the beast she said \"no he did nothing to me yet. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you quite sure my dear?\" asked Heeshe a second time, he was terribly worried that they were too late.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I would know if that thing tried to touch me in any way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeeshe took out of his trunk that the two head dwarfs had been carrying all of this time and he had an ice pick made of pure gold.  He took the ice pick and began to pick the lock of the jail cell Laura had been placed in.  it took him a good twenty minutes to pick the lock but sure enough they got in to her and Steven grabbed her and held her in his arms \"are you all right? \" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven kissed Laura on the lips and she was safe in his arms, the group then had to find their way out of the cave without the Beast getting any of them again.<br>\r\nThey began their trip out of the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n985 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

She placed it upon her head and the group started out of the cavern to go back to their camp.  when they arrived at the entrance the Beast stepped out in front of them with fifteen undead souls  ready to fight This would be a blood bath for the group Rodney thought.  There was no way they could fight the beast and all of the undead souls that were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forget that I have the jewels, which of course means I have all of the magic. I will use it against the beast and his legion,\"  said Heeshe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Beast screamed to them, \"You have somethings that belong to me, The girl is mine I claimed her and the Jewels I will have them,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura began to cower and cry she grabbed a hold of Steven's hand and leaned her head upon his shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Please don't let him take me again,\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeeshe took his sterling silver sword and blessed it with a prayer, they all took their torches and made a large bon fire, so the undead souls could not get close to them.  The souls charged them and when they did the flames caught hold of them and they disappeared leaving just the Beast to fight the Battle.  The Beast came forward and tried to take the girl, he grabbed her by the arm, he was not afraid of the fire as the undead were because he knew the flames could not harm him, fire was his dear friend.. he just laughed at them and pulled her towards him. Steven pulled her other arm and they had a sort of tug a war with her.<br>\r\nat which time Heeshe took the Sterling silver sword and plunged it directly into the heart of the Beast.<br>\r\nThe Beast Screamed and released Laura.  he backed up and fell over dead.  Heeshe checked him to make sure he was dead.  He was dead as a door nail. A brief celebration erupted by the group.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over Thank God It's over.\" said Laura<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura did not know she was with child and it was the spawn of the Beast.  They were all relieved thinking everything would be OK, Not realizing in three short months a new beast would be born to Laura herself.  <br>\r\nHeeshe and the other dwarfs could now go home, but for some unknown reason Heeshe did not want to celebrate, He felt something was still wrong.  Heeshe was now a normal sized man and he would cast a spell over the other dwarfs to make them also become a normal size.  They returned to camp and Steven and Laura did not want to leave Heeshe and the other Dwarf men,  Who would now be called flavoians as they were no longer dwarfs so they could no longer be called by that name. That evening back at the camp site the gang celebrated with a huge party in which they all had a great time.  That night Laura and Steven were married by Heeshe who prayed to the Gods and ask for their permission to wed the two lovers.  The Gods were happy to allow the couple to wed on the blessed land where the camp stood.  They blessed the couple in their matrimony.   That night the two lovers lay together as husband and wife, it had been an eventful day and the group was tired so they all went to sleep except for the night guards who watched over the camp.  They still had thousands of undead souls that they had to fear.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning when they awoke Laura slept late very late so much so that Steven went back into the room to check on her.  When he woke her, she said she felt funny , she was very ill, in a way she had never been before.  She was weak and tired very frail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel like getting up today, may I just lay for now.\"  she asked  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can, perhaps you need a doctor?\"<br>\r\nSteven said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be alright I just need to rest, \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven left her to rest while he went to explain how she felt to Heeshe.  Heeshe showed great concern over her illness,  He went to her room and prayed to the Gods for her quick recovery.  Usually with these types of prayers the sick person would have a turn-around <br>\r\nand get better.  But in Laura's case it did not even faze her as she just got worst and worst.  She vomited with out stop for an hour or so, then she fell asleep, in five hours she awoke again and began vomiting again.  she could not stop.  This went on for days and then weeks, finally they took her to a human doctor who, could find nothing so he told her due to the amount of vomiting she was dehydrated and needed to be in the hospital.  In the hospital blood tests confirmed that she in fact was six weeks pregnant.  The doctor told her she would have a difficult pregnancy and that she would need to be bed-ridden until the baby was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Steven were happy they just knew the baby was Steven's because she had never lay with anyone else that she knew of anyway.  She did not know of the spell that had been cast on her to cause her to lay with the beast when he showed himself as a man.  <br>\r\nThe baby surely was the spawn of the Beast. This is the reason she would have such a difficult time with the pregnancy .  The spawn would only take about eight months instead of the normal nine months to come to full term.  it would be a large baby.  In the meantime Steven spoiled Laura as did the others in the camp,  she was the only female and this would be the first child born in the camp ever.  None not even Heeshe would know the true identity of the Baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonths passed and Laura was very ill all of the time, she could barely walk or get out of bed, for that matter.<br>\r\nThe doctors were confused by her symptoms and her blood work it was all so strange to them but they kept that to themselves so as not to alarm Laura.  But her blood work was surely off and strange.  Heeshe and the others did not go home to Flavo, as they wanted to be there for Laura and Steven.  They had become like family to one another, even Rodney stayed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to go out of camp tonight and find myself a girlfriend at the dance hall,\" said Rodney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go with him Steven so when you come home tonight the two of you can fight the undead together <br>\r\nRodney can not do it alone, they would surely capture him\", said Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe shall all go with the exception of Laura and a few of our best guards this way there will be no contest I will use my magic to cast a spell on the woman of your choice so she will come back to camp with us and you can wed her tomorrow night.\"  said Heeshe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that Tasha is dead we have little to worry about,\"<br>\r\nsaid Rodney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still must worry about the undead.\"  said Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well a torch will  take care of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One torch will not be enough for that many .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeeshe looked at Laura and told her not to worry they were going to go out and find another woman for Rodney one who could help birth the child and help you to take care of it when it is born.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small band of Flavoians and humans took off to find a bride for Rodney.  They went to the dance hall which is what Rodney wanted to do, he looked at the dozens of girls who were there he found one he liked and started talking to her after a while of talking he decided this was not the girl of his dreams.  H e decided they would not be able to find her in the dance hall it was not the type of girl he was looking for.<br>\r\nHeeshe, told him they should check out the local hospital for a girl.  They went to the cafeteria of the hospital and they ordered their meal and he looked around trying to find just the right girl.  They were there for over an hour and about to give up their search when a beautiful young woman about twenty-five years old came into the cafeteria and set down with a meal to have dinner.  He spotted her at once and went over to her table and introduced himself.  her name was Carmen, she was a nurse and had worked at the hospital for just a short while.  <br>\r\nRodney set and talked with her for about an hour and then he ask if he could meet her the next day for dinner at the same place.  she agreed and then went back to work.  This went on every night for about three weeks and finally he told her he was in love with her and he wanted her to marry him in the woods at their camp.  He had not disclosed the fact of the undead to her yet.  and when he decided she was the one he wanted to marry Heeshe cast a love spell on her that would make her follow him any where even in the woods where the undead resided.  She accepted his proposal, and then he told her they would live in a camp and have their own hut, she agreed and they went into the woods to wed.  Heeshe presided over the ceremony as he had done for Steven and Laura,  He asked permission from the Gods and they agreed to allow the marriage.  Which took place on the fifteenth of March in the woods at the camp.. they traveled into the woods at day time as to not alarm Carmen of the undead.  This way she would be happily married and living with her new husband before knowing of the existence of the creatures.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey introduced her to Laura and told her that her responsibility would be to care for Laura during her pregnancy and following it with the baby.  Carmen agreed as she was a nurse and the only other female in the camp.  Carmen Liked Laura and the two of them got along famously.  Rodney and Carmen were given a Hut next to Laura's and Steve's Hut  so she can take care of them,  the baby and Laura that is.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1,800 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Steven was also very happy.  Carmen being a nurse was eager to help Laura and the gang got along famously.  Each day Carmen would wake and fix a nutritious breakfast for the entire gang of people in the camp she was very happy there to begin with.  But her first night there, you might say her honeymoon, was filled with night terrors as the undead showed themselves to her for the first time.  She screamed and held tight to Rodney,  <br>\r\n\"What the hell is that?\"  she screamed with tear filled eyes.  Rodney took a hold of her and told her not to worry, that they were just there at the night time.  And as long as they had a fire or torches they would be OK.    \"I didn't sign up for this freaky stuff\".  She scoffed.  \"Don't be afraid, I'm here I'll take care of you, I would never let any thing happen to you, don't you know that?\"  Rodney held her tightly and kissed her softly on her lips.  At that time Heeshe saw that she was terribly upset and he was afraid she may leave the camp come morning.  So he put a bravery spell on her, he prayed to the Gods and explained their plight, and the Gods decided to aid with the bravery spell so that Carmen would not be afraid and leave.  Meanwhile Laura came to Carmen's Hut to speak with her about their location and how important it was that they stay with Heeshe in the camp to help rid the area of the undead.  Carmen reluctantly decided she would go along with every one and she would stay and help with the baby when it came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group set up the next day to have a camp meeting.<br>\r\nHeeshe explained the plans to everyone about trying to rid the area of the undead.  They would have to travel into their cave in the daytime to burn them while they slept.  However they had to make sure to get every last one of the creatures.  Just one creature could wreak havoc on the community,.  killing any person who ventured out at night leaving that person to also become an undead creature.   They decided that the two girls, Carmen and Laura should stay at the camp due to Laura's condition.  The rest of them would venture out looking for the undead's location.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few months pass and each day many undead are killed by the men of the camp lead by Heeshe, Steve, and Rodney.  However they are unable to keep up with the pace of the undead, because they kill nightly many souls lose their lives as the creatures travel the night and take people who are out each night in the near by town.  As Heeshe and the gang kill a hundred or so a few dozen new souls are transformed into creatures of the undead each night.  The main nest has not been found.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Carmen are left in the camp by themselves each day Laura is starting to have trouble with the pregnancy C armen tells her she needs to rest and take it easy in bed.  <br>\r\n\"I am afraid, I don't feel right, I feel different something is wrong I just know it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" You are only four months along you already look as if you are to full term.  perhaps we should travel in to town and find you a real doctor.  I'm afraid something is wrong with you and the baby,\"said Carmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"we have to wait until the men get back and we will talk to them.  perhaps Heeshe can help.\"  said Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nall of a sudden Laura screams out in pain and holds her knees close together and looks down and blood is running down her legs.  Carmen takes a hold of Laura and leads her to the hut and lays her down on the bed and rushes to the cafeteria to get water and rags or sheets.  \"It's coming, I'm losing the baby, it's only four months how can this be happening, she panics and removes her trousers to reveal that it is time for the baby to be born.  Carmen rushes back in to the hut with hot water and sheets and she helps Laura fight through the pain,  Laura screams and screams she is in terrible pain.  Carmen gives her a stick to bite down on.  This goes on for a few hours, meanwhile the men are coming into the camp as it has turned dusk dark.<br>\r\nThey hear the screaming coming from Laura's Hut and they run towards it believing some terrible is wrong and perhaps the creatures have attacked or something.<br>\r\nSteven and Heeshe and Rodney Run into the hut and see what is happening, Rodney and Heeshe immediately leave the hut but Steven stays to try and help.  Heeshe prays to the Gods about the baby but the Gods are silent on the subject and will offer no aid for some unknown reason to Heeshe.  Steven holds Laura by the shoulders from behind her he rubs her face and pushes her hair out of her face.  She is eased a bit and begins to apologize to Steven that she is having a miscarriage, or so they thought.  But a few hours later a baby is miraculously born at full term size although it has been only four short months the baby cries and is swaddled by Carmen and cleaned she cuts the babies chord and wraps it and lays it in Laura's arms.  Steven and Laura are now parents of what they do not know is a spawn of the beast.  The baby is normal looking except it is not premature in size it is full size and healthy.  Carmen takes the baby and Laura is covered and lies to rest for the rest of the night.  Meanwhile out side the camp  the undead gather however this time they gather in silence and just stand out around the camp with out trying to attack for they know their new God is born a new beast to lead them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count:  1,046 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Steven took the child in his arms and held it tight, thinking he was now a proud father of a miraculous young boy baby.  Heeshe took the child and prayed over it and brought it to the Gods for a blessing.<br>\r\nThe Gods however did not want anything to do with the child,  They feared the boy who was born at only four months.  This is an odd thing a bad omen you might say.<br>\r\nSteven was angry and told the Gods that the child was a miracle he should not have lived after being on four months along.  It was a good think not a bad one he declared.  Heeshe was caught in the middle He loved the Gods and wanted to obey their every command or agree with their every rule.  but he also loved Steven and Laura  they had been through so much with one another.  They were family to him.  The Gods would not budge, they would not bless the child and told that they would not aid in any way the raising of the child.<br>\r\nThey felt there was something wrong with a child that was born and lived healthy after only four months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I will allow the child and the family to remain in our camp even unblessed the child would be a welcomed addition to the camp.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmonths passed and the family became the focal point of the camp this was the only child in camp and he was being spoiled rotten.  He was growing faster than anyone could ever imagine, already three months old yet he looked and acted as a child a year or two old.<br>\r\nThings were quiet for the camp since the birth of the child who they named Jona, He was a very unique and special child far advanced than most,  The Gods kept close tabs on the child because they did not trust him they thought he was strange.  Laura loved her son and Jona was delighted with his mother however there was a strange feeling and relationship with Steven and Jona,  Steve could not believe the advancement of his son he grew so quickly and was so intelligent he just did not know what to make of it.  they were not as close as a father and son should be.  Carmen became pregnant with Rodney's child and she was grateful that there would be another child to be in the camp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNine months passed and in that time Jona grew at an alarming rate he was already the size of a three or four year old and he was only a year old.  He could talk and walk, and even recite historical events that had occurred.  Carmen had her child and it was a boy<br>\r\nthey named it Marcus. The child, Marcus was a normal healthy little boy.  he was full term and was about 8 lbs. 5 ounces.  Where as Jona at birth was 13 lbs.  at only four months time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men spent each day out looking and hunting for the undead, which had moved their nest to some other location to escape the witch hunt by Heeshe, Rodney, and Steven and the others in camp.    The woods grew very dense and hard to find the night creatures.  Over the passed year five camp members lost the battle and were taken by the undead and now are undead themselves.   Heeshe had lost a dear friend to the creatures a few weaks pryor to the birth of Marcus.<br>\r\nNow Heeshe, Rodney, and Steven and the two main guards got together to go on a hunt.  leaving the women and children in the camp alone.  They felt it would be alright as long as they had the daylight to protect them from the creatures.  This hunt was personal for Heeshe and he was not going to come back empty handed he was going to get rid of some undead and look for his friend who was now undead because they had killed him,  Heeshe did not want his friend to live like that so he was on a mission to destroy his friend for his own good.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back at the camp Marcus was crying and needed a bottle, Jona did not like the crying child and he sneaked around and placed a pillow over the nose and mouth of the baby for about five seconds to make it stop crying.  but he heard Carmen coming to check on the baby so Jona left the room .  Carmen did not suspect that the children had been together or that Jona tried to smother Marcus.  The evening fell quickly on this day as a storm started and blew in with it the dark.  the men were far away and in the thick brush of the woods, while the women were alone in the camp with the two children.  A familiar sound began and Carmen and Laura looked at each other knowing full well the undead were very near the camp and there they were all alone.  The rain fell profusely and the wind was alarming, They heard the undead coming into the camp and they rushed to start a fire but were unable to because of the rain the undead came closer and about 15 of them got into the camp and they were looking for something,  or someone,  Laura and Carmen took Marcus and Jona to the hut which belonged to Heeshe  for some reason they felt they could call upon the Gods from there and perhaps get help... Laura found a gun and began shooting at the undead to no avail.  They just came closer they spoke in a moaning scream to the child Jona, but Laura and the others could not understand what was being said.<br>\r\nJona however did understand and he told Laura not to be afraid they were not there to hurt them.  Laura was confused she could not understand how Jona could feel this way and not be afraid of the creatures ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nword count 1,016 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The creatures look at the women and groan and scream but then they do as Jona commanded of them.  they left. Laura and Carmen looked at each other and both were in tears.  Laura looked at Jona in a different light, she could not understand how the boy could not be afraid and talk to the creatures and he seemed to understand the creatures as well.  Laura grabbed Jona by the hand and led him out of Heeshe's hut and in to their own.  as did Carmen.  They were fearful that the creatures would come back.<br>\r\n Later in the evening The men came back to camp.<br>\r\nLaura and Carmen informed them all what had transpired that day, and how Jona seemed to communicate with the creatures.    Steven and Heeshe were both alarmed at the fact that Jona communicated with the undead.  This is strange how they did not hurt any of you I just don't understand what is going on with our son.  He is so advanced and so large for his age, he is different very strange said Steven.  Heeshe agreed.  No one has ever communicated with the undead except for the Beast.   Heeshe knew he could not leave this planet and head back home to Flavo until every one of the undead souls were destroyed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid my friend show up with the undead was he with them asked Heeshe.  I must find him and destroy him, he would never want to exist in such a state.   No he was not with them said Laura I did not recognize any of the creatures.  but for some odd reason they did not offer to harm us because they could have killed everyone of us easily.  But for some reason when Jona said leave they left.  That is odd, it is like he has some kind of power over the undead or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nword count 381 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These are the questions that Steven wrestled with daily.  He could not understand why or how all of this was happening, then he got the idea that perhaps Heeshe had placed a spell on the child as he had done to Carmen to get her to fall in love with Rodney so quickly and marry and move to these God forsaken woods of the undead.<br>\r\nwhat was the deal, Steven was going to get to the bottom of this, He would question Heeshe to find out if he put a spell on the child to charm him or something.  Steven left his hut and went to The hut of Heeshe,  He was invited in and Heeshe was glad to see him, the two of them had become very close over the year or so that they had been together.  Steven had no problem to ask him if he had placed a magic charm on the child to let him communicate with the undead, and to live after only a four month development and to thrive and grow as big and strong as he possibly could.<br>\r\nHeeshe swore to Steven he had had nothing to do with the birth of the child nor had he done anything to try to make him stronger or to be able to communicate with the undead.  It was a strange thing Carmen had told them that the undead creatures actually obeyed the child and acted as if they were afraid of him.  Heeshe told Steven he too had wondered about the boy and what was happening with him.   The Gods would not even bless the child for some reason, This is something they could never understand.  But on this day the two men Heeshe and Steven went to pray to the Gods and inquire about the child and why they would not bless the child.  The Gods reluctantly spoke to the pair of men and disclosed that the child was not of whole human origin, it in fact was a product of the Beast when he had taken Laura,  She could not remember this because the beast placed a spell on her.  But the child. Jona, was a child of the beast.<br>\r\nSteven cursed the Gods for saying this and he was upset, but the Gods stood their ground and offered proof to what they were saying, Steven was crushed.<br>\r\nThe child was not his, it was in fact a devil.  and they feared what the child was capable of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was in the hut when steven arrived he came into the room to talk to her about what he had learned.

Glistening eyes stared out of dirty faces from every inch of the walls. <br>\r\n\"Steven...\" Laura's fingers dug into the skin of Steven's arms. \"I don't like this.\" <br>\r\nSteven patted his sister's head. \"Let me do the talking here, Laura. I'll get this figured out.\" He looked down and saw the skepticism in Laura's eyes. \"Don't even say it, Laura,\" he said. \"I'll show you that I'm smarter than you think.\" <br>\r\nSteven stood straight up and squared his shoulders, he jutted his chin out. <br>\r\n\"Listen up, people,\" he said, his voice loud and authoritative. \"We have to get out of this place,\" he let his gaze move around the hut's interior. \"If it's the last thing we ever do.\" <br>\r\n\"Jumping musical lyrics,\" a voice said. \"He must be a member of that rock group, <i>The Animals.</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the hut shook and vibrated, dust and shards of straw fell from the ceiling and drifted down onto Steven and Laura. <br>\r\n\"Who do you think you are?\" the loud voice continued to shake and vibrate the hut. \"You can't come in here and just take over. We already have a  leader.\"<br>\r\nSteven brushed straw off Laura's head, then turned to the obese man who's voice had shook the hut. \"Okay, who is in charge here?\" <br>\r\n\"Holy attempted coup,\" the voice said from the darkness.\" <br>\r\n\"He is!\" The voice said, continued to shake the hut. \"His name is Robin.\" The obese man moved close to Steven and whispered in his ear. \"He thinks he's the Robin from the batman duo.\" He looked back over his shoulder to see where the man who called himself Robin was, then he returned his mouth to Steven's ear. \"He's actually crazy. Nuts! Totally out there.\" He snickered. \"But he has some very good ideas about how to escape.\" <br>\r\nSteven looked at Laura, then turned back to the obese man. \"What kind of escape plans?\" <br>\r\nThe obese man hesitated, his gaze scanned the hut's interior, and then in a voice just above a whisper, he said, \"A tunnel.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm not crawling into no tunnel!\" Laura shouted.<br>\r\n\"Keep you voice down, young lady,\" the obese man said. \"The dwarfs might be height disabled, but they hear just fine.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" Laura said.  <br>\r\n\"Hey Robin,\" Steven said, \"come here, let's talk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven and the man, actually a boy, named Robin stood talking to each other and after a moment, Robin spoke.<br>\r\n\"Jumpin' back aches,\" Robin said. \"There's no reason for us to stand here yakking--\"<br>\r\n\"We have to talk this over, Robin.\" Steven rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Holy jumping to conclusions,\" Robin said. \"I don't mean that we should stop talking. On the contrary, I'm suggested we sit down so we can discuss our escape at length.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Steven said, \"Sorry.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm used to dimwitted people,\" Robin said. Steven shrugged off the insult even when he heard Laura's laugh. \"So, will you agree that we should sit down?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's fine,\" Steven said. <br>\r\n\"Good,\" Robin said and grasped Steven's arm. \"Find us a corner where we can sit and have some privacy.\" <br>\r\nSteven's gaze slowly circled the hut's interior. Thinking he's the real Robin of batman fame is not this clown's only problem,\" Steven told himself. <br>\r\n\"I heard that!\" Robin said.<br>\r\n\"I didn't say anything,\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"I heard your thoughts,\" Robin said. He turned to Laura. \"Can you read people's thoughts?\" His eyes moved over her.<br>\r\n\"No, I can't,\" Laura said.<br>\r\n\"Good.\" His gaze continued to take her in until Steven broke Robin's concentration.<br>\r\n\"Can we stick with the program, Robin?\" Steven said. \"We're in trouble here and we need a plan.\" <br>\r\nRobin threw his hands up and swung his arms in a circle. \"How about that folks!\" he shouted. \"We've been here for months, and now this guy just shows up and tries to take over.\" Robin turned back to Steven. \"Where were you when we were digging that tunnel?\" <br>\r\nSteven's eyes widened. \"Tunnel? There's a tunnel?\" <br>\r\n\"Maybe there is,\" Robin said. \"And maybe there isn't.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm not crawling into a tunnel, Steven,\" Laura said, her voice filled with fear.<br>\r\n\"Even if it means staying here?\" Steven asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Steven,\" Laura replied. \"Even if it means staying here.\" <br>\r\n\"So you like that dwarf who wanted to take you back to his hut,\" Steven said, his eyes focusing on Laura's.\" <br>\r\nLaura let her eyes rest on Steven's for a moment before answering.

Was this the fabrication of their minds and not reality, after what Steven had said? Yet, the moist clinging air and the stifling heat were real. The woods, the ruins, the trough were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Steven asked in a voice unfamiliar even to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA low-status member of a caste\u2026Many rumors are whispered about us.

What precisely do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast shook her head, and a mane as strands red as copper flowed over her shoulders. \"I am the ugliest of all my cousins,\" she growled. \"My scales do not shine, so bright, my nails not cut so deeply. I am a failure amongst my own kind.\" She shook her head and scratched at her forearm, from whence a few glittering scales fell from her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Steven both stared as the scales fell. The beast noticed the couple's interest. She bent to retrieve the scales that had fallen and dropped them into Laura's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gasped in exhilaration. The scales--they were hard as diamond, but brightly colored as the rarest of gemstones. \"You would give us such valuable gems?\" she asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast nodded. \"To have you leave my forest? Yes. Turn back on your foolish quest now, and your village may never know hunger again.\" The beast chuckled, a hideous smell of brimstone and sulfur pouring from its mouth. \"Still, they are worthless compared to those of my brothers, of course,\" she growled. \"If you could find them and slay them, I am sure you could gain riches beyond your wildest dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head. \"And the cure for our son's curse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast bowed its head toward a ravine behind him. \"You must begin by scaling the ravine.

I followed you by climbing down, but it took what seemed like days. When I arrived at the bottom, I only heard your howl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven flinched. \"I...I can't properly remember what happened, Laura. I remember deciding to leap, though I have no idea why. It seems foolish in retrospect. But I had to do it. Then, I just fell. It felt like I might never hit bottom. I don't even remember hitting bottom. I just remember waking in the mud, alone, and worrying dreadfully about you.\" Tears sprung to his eyes. \"But the longer I waited, the hungrier I got. I could not find any food, and eventually I thought, 'Maybe she's left me.' I couldn't -- I didn't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed and wrapped her arms more firmly around Steven's waist.  \"I would never have abandoned you, Steven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that now,\" he mumbled as his head hung in shame. \"But it seemed like the only solution. And the more I thought, the angrier I got. Why would you have done such a thing? Why would you abandon all we've worked for? Why would you just ignore the needs of your village, your son? That's when the change came over me. I felt nothing but rage and hunger, and when I saw you standing in the mud, unharmed, after I'd been searching for food for what seemed like weeks, I snapped. I don't know--\" his breath caught. \"Laura, I would have killed you! And I don't know how I would have lived if I had known what I had done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stroked her fingers through his matted hair. \"It's over, love. You did nothing, except perhaps scare a woman out of her mind. But we have more important things to do.  We need to find the flower.  That's what the beast--\" she stopped mid-sentence, wide-eyed and staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Steven asked after moments passed without a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That beast,\" Laura stumbled, \"he--she said we should seek his cure in the ravine. And she gave me the knife to slay you. But she is gone again.\" She shook her head as she pulled from Steven's arms and stood. \"What could this witchcraft mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven tugged at his beard in thought. \"The men in the village--they have said this forest is cursed. Could the beast be that which stalks it, hunting for our souls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head. \"I think there may be more to it than that. The beast--it never really attacked us did it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven stopped and scratched his head. \"No, I suppose it didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded. \"When we were in the ravine, it actually offered us riches before it sent us on our way. It never really threatened us. Then just now, it offered me--\" she paused and chewed on her bottom lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven narrowed his eyes. \"What did it offer, Laura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"It offered me a knife. It said, 'He has given into his wrath. He has become the beast he is inside. Will you do the same?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if you had chosen to hurt me, or to hurt yourself, or maybe even attempted to attack it--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--I think we would have been doomed.\" Laura shook her head. \"What do you think it wants, Steven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I only know that we have faced it twice. Who knows when we might face it again?\"  Then he took her hands in his and lifted them to his lips. \"Without you, I would have surely faltered and died. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blushed and pushed Steven's hands away. \"It is done. What matters is that we push forward together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven smiled in gratitude and then glanced to the paths cut through by the ravine. The gaping cut in the earth rode a line from north to south.  \"Where do you think the cure is hidden, Laura?

You've gotten us through this far. I see no reason to stop going.\" He took her hand in his and the two began slopping through the mud on their way south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the third day when Steven questioned the decision. They had been traveling in a straight direction, being certain to hug one ravine wall as they headed south. Still, Steven was fairly certain he'd passed a particularly thorny looking vine at least twice. How could they possibly be going in circles? Still, he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had subsisted by eating moss from the few trees that managed to still stand at the edges of the ravine's bottom or by munching on beetles as they passed. Steven had caught a snake on the second day, but Laura had only scolded him from leaving her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, don't be foolish. You could have been killed, wandering away like that. You KNOW time passes strangely here. You might have been lost for weeks, but I would not have noticed your departure until you'd returned five minutes later. Besides, we have no way of COOKING such meat, with the ravine's bottom as wet and muddy as it is. Just like a man who has spent not a day in his life in the kitchen. You leave all the cooking to me. I'm the one who will get us out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven only stared at her. He was absolutely flabbergasted. He knew the past several days had been hard for both of them. He knew she worried for their son, for their village, even for him. But this pride, this hubris, it would keep them from finding their way out. He'd suggested they turn North ages ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura,\" Steven spoke softly, as if afraid of setting her temper ablaze, \"I feel as if we've been traveling in circles. Don't ask me why, I just feel it in my bones. Maybe we should have gone north? We are no closer to finding the cure for our son than we were three days ago. Maybe we have gone the wrong way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura narrowed her eyes at her wayward companion. She had gotten them this far, hadn't she? It was Steven's fault they had come to this accursed forest in the first place. He had ignored her suggestions that they find another way, and when he refused and she had foolishly followed him. He leapt into this cursed ravine in the first place, got himself turned into a direwolf, and almost got them both killed! It was only her patience and quick thinking that had saved them thus far. Who was he to question her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who indeed,\" a growl whispered from behind her. Her eyes widened. Steven's figure was frozen mid-stride, as if he had suddenly turned to stone. Laura shook as she turned to face the beast whom she thought she must know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she was correct. The dinosaur beast with the diamond claws and golden spine lounged behind her, alternatively glancing at her and at the path they would travail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, my lady, should you listen to your companion?\" it cooed as it bathed in a ray of uninterrupted sunlight. \"Turning back now would be nonsense. You have lost so much time already searching for your son, and as he waits he grows weaker. Do you have the time to change your ways now? Does your son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head. \"And I am the one who has kept us safe thus far. I should do what I think is right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" the beast purred. \"But what if--just this once--you were wrong? What if space and time act much the same in this place. What if the cure lies only 100 meters behind you, if you would but turn to the North now? What if your assumptions about what is <b><i>RIGHT</i></b> could be proven <i><b>WRONG</b></i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura squeezed her eyes shut and shook her head. \"Who am I to trust?\" she whispered. \"Steven, who has done nothing but fling us into trouble, or myself, whom I know has the strength to endure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast grinned even as its form faded into nothingness. \"That is the question, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as it had happened, whatever spell hold Steven frozen had snapped, and he continued trudging through the paths. \"What do you say, Laura? We could turn around, go North, maybe even a few hundred yards. It wouldn't take us much time to determine if we have, indeed, moved forward, and if so, we can always turn around again. I can't explain why I feel this way, but I do. You aren't always right, Laura.

No longer were they standing in the middle of a muddy, rocky ravine. Instead, Laura looked ahead and saw Steven, a giant smile on his face, as he stood maybe 30 feet above her, his feet once again on solid ground. The grass under his feet looked green and lush, even as the dirt beneath her own solidified, hardened into dusty clay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven!\" she called, but he was not listening. He instead seemed to be glassy eyed, staring at a row of brightly colored flowers, daffodils, and roses, each open and shining, as if the dew that kissed the petals were diamonds rather than plain water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura frowned and looked at the rocky cliff that stood between her and Steven. She had climbed down the ravine, hadn't she? Certainly she could find a vine, a foothold, SOMETHING that would bring her closer to her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paced the edges of the cliff for most of an hour, periodically calling to her partner, who seemed completely oblivious to her presence.  At one point, she noticed Steven lifting something to his lips, his face glowing in pure bliss, as if he was drinking a heavenly nectar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt her skin growing hot the longer she stood at the bottom and tried to gain his attention. She was thirsty, was she not? She deserved to feel the liquid wonderment of such nectar sliding down her parched throat, did she not? She had gotten the two of them this far, while Steven did NOTHING. Did she not deserve a rest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of light, and Laura knew what came next. That stupid beast, with its stupid diamond claws and its stupid golden scales. She rolled her eyes as it floated next to her. After her multiple encounters with it, she was fairly certain she could read its reptilian face. And right now, it was definitely smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStupid beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura,\" it whispered in her ear as it gently stroked her ear with one diamond claw. \"Laura, what has happened? Why has Steven find himself in such a place? We both know you are the one who has been keeping the journey steady. You are the one who does not give into temptation, who does not fade in the face of harsh choices. Why should you be down here while he enjoys himself above? While your son still lays ill? Why? Indeed, what if that garden is nothing more than a distraction meant to keep you away from the cure you ultimately seek?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd though Laura knew by now the beast and its craftiness, she also could not deny that what it said was undoubtedly true. There was no reason to believe that Steven's current circumstances were anything other than a distraction. And so evil a distraction. Neither of them should possibly have anything so beautiful, not now, not when their son still lay so ill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall you do then, Laura?\" the beast growled as it faded back into nothingness. Laura looked into her hands and saw a hardy rope, tied into a lasso.  Somehow she knew, that if she aimed, she could land that lasso around Steven's limbs, drag him back away from the enchantment she must surely be under. It would be so simple. He should be here, with her, not there, not in such a disgusting mirage that would certainly only lead them to both to heartache in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, the beast rarely encouraged her to take the true direction. What she wanted now, more than to bring Steven now, was to be in Steven's place, enjoying beauty and sustenance and a wide-eyed ignorance of the darkness around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura closed her eyes. With a flick of her wrist, the lasso flew through the air and found its target on the cliff above.  Laura tugged as hard as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>673 words.</b></i> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

But when she arrived, she did not find the gardens she had seen above her, but instead her companion, pacing back and forth at the very edge of the cliff, anxious coloring his voice in a way she hadn't heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you answer me?\" Steven cried the moment she had scaled the wall. \"I have been calling you for hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Laura gasped. \"I have been calling to you for hours!\" She glanced around at the plain fields that somehow now surrounded them both. \"And where is the garden? I saw you enjoying its flowers and sipping its nectar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garden? What garden? I have been standing in this field, watching as you swam in a lake of cool honey below. That damnable beast came back, gave me a lasso, tried to get me to drag you back to me. But I couldn't. I thought that maybe, wherever you were, you felt better. You were happy. You were at peace. I couldn't drag you away from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's eyes had filled with tears.  She threw herself into Steven's arms and gripped at his tunic with her fingers, as if she could not crawl close enough to his steadiness. \"I know, Steven, I know,\" she whispered. I couldn't ask you to join me, so I was going to do whatever I could to join you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them pulled apart, staring into one another's eyes for long moments. The next thing either of them knew, their were pressed together from top to toe, their lips and arms locked in passionate embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura could not imagine grass could be so soft, yet as Steven lay her down on the grass beneath them she might as well have been enveloped in feather down. Her blood was on fire, her skin electric, and it was as if they were teenagers again, before the trials and tribulations of the village, of famine, of parenthood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir lips caressed in such sweet surrender then that hours might have passed, days, and she could do nothing but gasp in his strong embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil that damnable voice purred in satisfaction in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be wonderful to stay here, wouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't see the beast, but she could feel it, its sickeningly sweet breath upon her face, its diamond claws gently tugging her hair even as Steven did the same. She was electrified, but she was annoyed, and she didn't know what it might say next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could stay here in the arms of your lover, Laura. Time in this valley passes much as it did in the ravine. You could be here weeks, months, and not a moment passes in the real world. Surely your son could wait? And when you arrive, you could bring with you news of a new family member, more children to love. You would like that, wouldn't you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd oh, how Laura would. To fill a house with Steven's children, to love them and care for them as each day went by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Andrew. Her son. The child that already had filled their tiny cottage. He would die. The beast might still lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the comfort here, the amazing scent of her lover around her, within her.

She stormed off, leaving her brother speechless and wondering whether he should go after her or not.  <i>She is my sister.</i> he thought.  <i>Going after her would show I care.  But on the other hand, not going after her would show her I respect her choice.</i>  As he debated his decision, a small light lit up in front of him.  <br>\r\n\"I can lead you where you want to go.\" A female voice whispered in his ear.  \"Just say where and follow my light.  You'll be safe with me.  No trolls will dare attack you once they find out Clarissa the Pixie is your leader and fearless ally!\"  <br>\r\nSteven mulled over his choice, wondering if he should take the fairy's offer.  Something niggled at the back of his brain, about forest pixies, though he couldn't remember what.  <i>If only I could remember!</i>  Something about Clarissa just didn't seem right, though for the life of him, he couldn't figure out what.<br>\r\nThen it hit him.  \"Aren't forest pixies supposed to be at war with humankind?\" Steven asked the light.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so?

It's a little stupid if you ask me.\" The light flickered in annoyance.<br>\r\n\"Don't you have history books?\" Steven rolled his eyes.  \"Forest pixies were mad because a human came and chopped down a tree close to the border.  The tree fell across the boundary and the human went to chop it up and bring it back to his home.  As he was leaving, forest pixies surrounded him and demand he surrender the wood because it belonged to you guys instead of him, since it landed on your side.  Though the contract we signed never stated what would happen under such situations, that had never been a problem before!\"<br>\r\n\"So <i>that's</i> why you don't want to come with me?

Come with us or stay on your own in this lonely place that who knows what you will meet here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s face turned beet red with anger while she responds, \u201cWhat would Father think, to know you left me on my own?  Are you going to abandon me for that tart of a pansy being who is our mortal enemy for centuries!  Strange that she picks this time to show her face to us!  She has never shown us any interest before now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura, I can understand your anger.

The time for putting our differences aside, no matter what the cost is about life and death at the moment.  If I leave you two here, the chances of you being dead before the next dawn is pretty much imminent.  We have a chance to help heal this world and the destruction between the most powerful of the races, the Humans and The Gods.  All my life I have been told that if there ever comes a time where destruction comes to this world, if I can, I must do what I can to work with the Humans and The Gds in order to bring the order back into balance,\u201d  Freya looked away for a moment while two tears slid down each of her cheeks, looking into Laura\u2019s eyes, she continues, \u201cThis world was created with the balance of the Humans and The Gods being the key to the love between all the races in this world.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura stood, fear and frustration roiling in her stomach, as the dark woods absorbed Steven and Freya. For a time, Laura could hear Freya and Steven's movements; the rustling of tree branches, the snapping of twigs, the sound of their footsteps growing more faint with each passing second. When Laura could no longer see or hear Steven and Freya, she inhaled deeply and turned in a slow circle, taking in her surroundings. <br>\r\nI hope I did the right thing, she thought. But now that she was all alone in the darkness, every sound that reached her caused a new spike of fear to stab into her. <br>\r\n\"Did I do the right thing?\" she mumbled into the darkness. <br>\r\n\"That depends on what you are trying to accomplish.\" <br>\r\nThe disembodied voice seemed to fill the darkness around Laura. When it grew quiet again, Laura understood that she was imagining things. \"The dark woods can do that to you,\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Do what to you?\" The same voice caused Laura to stumble backwards, nearly falling onto her bottom. She wind milled her arms to keep her balance, and didn't fall. <br>\r\nCautiously, almost hoping she wouldn't see who the voice belonged to, Laura said in a low voice. \"Hello?\" She scanned the darkness. \"Is anyone there? Hello?\"<br>\r\n\"Hello, yourself,\" the voice answered back. <br>\r\nLaura gasped. \"Who's there?\" she said quickly as she back away from where she thought the voice came from. But if she was thinking correctly, she would have admitted that the sound came from everywhere around her. But admitting that would cause Laura to think she was losing her mind. She continued stepping backward until her heel caught a tree root running along the surface of the ground. She yelped and fell backwards and prepared herself for the pain she knew would come when her bottom smacked against the ground. But instead of hitting the ground, Laura felt two arms under her own arms, which kept her from falling. Without thinking, and from force of habit, she said, \"Thank you,\" but immediately realized there was really no one there.<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" the voice said. \"Or would you prefer what young people say today instead? \"No problem?\" <br>\r\n\"What?\" Laura asked, suddenly no longer fearful. \"Are you some kind of English teacher or miss manners or something?\" <br>\r\n\"I can't believe you just referred to me a <i>miss</i> manners. I pride myself on my <i>masculine</i> voice. <br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Laura asked the darkness. \"And could you please take your hands off of me?\" She felt the arms move away from under hers and began falling backwards again. But the hands caught her under her arms. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want me to let you go?\" the voice asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, but this time I'll know to keep my balance.\" When the hands withdrew from under her arms, Laura stood straight. She used her hands to slap the dust out of her jeans. <br>\r\n\"What?\" the voice asked. \"You're not going to say thank you?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" Laura said. \"Thank you.\" <br>\r\n\"No problem,\" the voice said and chuckled.<br>\r\nLaura suddenly felt fear again. She had almost fallen which would certainly have caused her some pain, even if not a little injury. But feeling herself being lifted and prevented from falling and receiving a painful blow to her backside, Laura had forgotten that there was not supposed to be anyone with her. She had watched Steven and Freya leave, she had been alone. So where did the voice come from? And who did it belong to?<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're wondering who I am?\" the voice said. This time it seemed to emanate from behind her. <br>\r\n\"Yes, actually I am wondering who you are.\" Laura sighed. \"You see,\" she continued, \"I am alone here. My friends,\" she turned her eyes in the direction that she had last seen Steven and Freya before they were gobbled up by the darkness, \"my <i>friends</i> have gone, they left me alone. So if I'm supposed to be alone....\" her words trailed off as she scanned the dark woods, \"then who the devil are you?\"<br>\r\n\"It's funny that you would ask that question, actually,\" the voice replied. <br>\r\n\"That's not funny at all,\" Laura said. \"Look at it logically. I'm supposed to be here alone. That means there should be no one for me to carry on a conversation with. There should be no other voices. And before? when I fell? I should have fallen all the way to the ground. But I didn't. And why didn't I, you may ask. Well, I'll tell you even though you <i>didn't/i} ask. I didn't fall because you caught me in mid-fall. You caught me before I lost my balance and travelled all the way to the ground where my butt hitting the ground would have caused a sudden stop in my momentum which would have cause me great pain.\" Laura jutted out her chin. \"So you see? It's not funny at all that I'm asking the question, who the devil are you?\" <br>\r\n\"Wow,\" the voice said. \"In the future I'm going to have to be careful about the questions I ask you.\" <br>\r\n\"Do you plan to ask me more questions?\" Laura asked. \"Because as far as I am concerned, you don't even exist.\" <br>\r\nThere was a loud chuckle that seemed to come from every where. When the laughter died down, the voice said, \"I have many, many, many questions I want to ask you. But if your answers are going to be as long as the answer to my first question, then maybe I'll hold off on the more complicated questions.\" <br>\r\nLaura harrumphed. \"My answer to your first question was not overly long,\" Laura said. \"I don't know what made you say a thing like that.\" <br>\r\n\"I don't even remember what my question was,\" the voice said. \"It seemed so long ago that I asked it.\" <br>\r\nLaura's face reddened with anger. \"If I could see you,\" she said, \"why, I would...I would...I just don't know what I would do.\" She scanned the woods again but saw no one. \"And for your information, your first question was this; It's funny you should ask that question.\" <br>\r\nThe voice grew louder. \"You see?\" the voice said. \"It wasn't even a question. It was more a rhetorical statement, not really a question.\" <br>\r\nLaura stamped her foot on the ground. \"Oh, I see,\" she said. \"So now you're the question police? Now it's you who decides what is a question and what is not?\" She raised her fist into the air and shook it. \"I'll have you to know that I am not abrogating my rights to consider what is or is not a question. Do I make myself clear?\" <br>\r\nWhen the voice grew softer, Laura thought whoever the voice had belonged to must have back away. But when he spoke, it was apparent that the owner of the voice had no, in fact, moved away or backed down.<br>\r\n\"I wasn't questioning your authority to make your own decisions about what is and what is not a question,\" the voice said. \"I was merely pointing out that some questions are, in fact, questions. While other statements that some people might consider a question is really not a question at all, but it is merely a rhetorical question, or a rhetorical statement.\" The voice grew soft again. \"Am I making myself clear?\" <br>\r\nLaura considered what the voice had just said, but she found it confusing. After all, either a question was a question, or it was not a question. She didn't believe for one minute that it was up to the question<b>ee</b> as to whether the words spoken by the question<b>er</b> was a question or not. But Laura knew this was no time to split hairs about such mundane matters. Here she was, lost, the woods as dark as night... wait, it was night. I'm losing my mind, she told herself. But she had to get back to the pressing matter at hand. <br>\r\n\"Look, Mr. Voice, whoever you are,\" Laura said with a voice dripping with sarcasm. \"Let's not quibble over such dumb things as whether a question is a question or not.\"<br>\r\n\"So,\" the voice said. \"You think we're quibbling?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe that was a bad choice of words,\" Laura said. <br>\r\n\"Oh, no,\" the voice said, growing more insistent. \"I am not going to let you off the hook as easily as that.\" <br>\r\n\"Can't we just move on?\" Laura asked. impatience edging her voice.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see,\" the voice countered. \"When the going gets tough, the weak get going? Is that it? Well, let me tell you something, Little Miss.-- .\" <br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Laura interrupted. \"Did you just call me Little Miss?\" <br>\r\n\"Um, well, ahhh, no, I don't think I did.\" The voice stammered. <br>\r\n\"No, I think you did,\" Laura said, her eyes narrowed. \"I distinctly heard you say, Little Miss.\" Laura paused as her gaze scanned the small area where she stood. \"I know that voice,\" Laura said slowly. \"I recognize it as just well as if I had heard it yesterday. In fact, it was yesterday when I heard it.\" <br>\r\n\"You are imagining things,\" the voice said nervously. \"You and I have never spoken.\" <br>\r\n\"You're following me,\" Laura said. \"Is that it? You're following me? Stalking me?\" <br>\r\n\"No you just wait a dad-blamed minute here Little Miss.\" The voice raised in volume. \"I have never stalked anyone, ever.\" <br>\r\n\"But you have followed people before,\" Laura said through squinting eyes. \"Haven't you?\" <br>\r\nA heavy silence fell between Laura and the voice. Laura thought back to yesterday when she had heard this same voice. It had to be him. Who else could it be? Laura smiled with the memory of how he had tried to come on to her. Had flirted with her. And Laura had enjoyed that nearly as much as she enjoyed seeing how jealous it made Steven. <i>Steven!</i> Laura thought. He's probably chasing Freya around in the woods right now. Laura's reverie was interrupted by the voice. <br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the voice said. \"I'll own up to it,\" it's me.\"<br>\r\n\"So you are him,\" Laura said. \"I thought so.\" <br>\r\n\"Can you give me a minute to explain?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count:  1694 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </i></span></div></div>",

And, I've never thought there would ever be a way to bring love back between the races; there's been so much anger, bitterness and hatred these few years of my life and I've only heard about war over and over;  Your heartfelt words bring me tears of admiration; knowing there's even one like you, makes me say yes, I'll go as long as Steven wants to do whatever he can.  I just hope it is something he has the strength to complete; I don't want him to die yet even if it happens, his attempt will be for the greater good of the world and both races.  I am filled with fear and yet have a soft feeling in my heart that only good will happen if we go and try as we can.  Just don't you or you, Steven, leave me behind now and not ever.\"  She wiped tears from her eyes then took her brother by the hand and the two of them followed Freya's light through the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's heart of full of love for his sister's willingness to try to do something to help.  He had studied about the eons of war between the Humans and the Gods and knew millions had died when situations like the falling tree on the boundary, and other events had created an outburst in the war.  He knew there was so much hatred by the Humans and couldn't blame the Gods for the war either.  Some day, some way, there had to be peace.  He muttered to himself yet Laura could hear him, \"I wonder what terrible thing the Challenge is.  Do I even have enough knowledge or personal and physical strength to attempt to meet the challenge?  I don't want to die and leave Laura alone with the Gods since I don't know how they might treat her if I do.  Will they take her life or make her meet another just to live?  I wish I knew.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, I heard what you just said.  We'll both go and we'll both be brave.  I believe in you and all you have learned these years.  I really think you'll have the knowledge and awareness of doing whatever is asked of you.  It may be hard and you may get hurt, and you might even die, but I believe in you.  If you try, I think you'll get the help you need through the faith of our father and all those who have died on both sides in this horrible way;  If it takes one more death or even mine, I'm with you all the way.  Oh that we'll both be strong enough to endure.\"  She shook her fist in the air, \"We're strong, Steven, and for some reason right now I feel stronger and more self-assured this minute than I ever have in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked at her face and saw something almost magical in her expression; Laura was changing right before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, what's happening?  You look different somehow.\"  He caught his breath as a breeze blew over both of them.  \"Do you feel that?  It's like, well, it's like, I'm feeling different.  My skin is cool and my insides are churning.  Weird.\"  He looked around.  \"Weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel it too, Steven.  It's like we are not alone.  I hear a real low hum, do you?  Maybe it's just my imagination but it's a soft hum.  I'm trying to think what it reminds me of.\"  She put both hands over her ears but it did not change the sound of the humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, it's weird too.  I just hope it's not something terrible coming from the Gods.  By following the Pixie, we're close or already in the Gods' land.\"  Steven took notice of the changes he was feeling deep inside.  It was like his muscles were moving around, even getting stronger; and his heart was pumping faster even though he wasn't running.  He wondered, \"Maybe help is coming in some magical way.\"  His faith in himself was increasing.  \"I hope so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was having her own changes happening.  Besides the hum, she felt cool, not cold, all over and her heart was thumping so hard she could hear it with her hands over her ears.  \"This is so strange,\" she said to herself.  \"I know something odd is happening but can't figure out what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a white vapor surrounded the three of them.  It encircled them but did not invade their personal space.  Laura started laughing then yelled at her brother.  \"Steven, This is fantastic.  It's wonderful.  Remember what we learned in \"Space and faith\" class about things before the war began?  It was a time when there was peace and love between the races and nobody even thought about war and they taught us about the Spirits of the Fountain which moved like a mist among the Humans?  They said at the time the Spirits of the Fountain moved the same way among the Gods.  Remember that!  Maybe, I think, I hope, it means that because you had decided to try to meet the Challenge to bring peace and I'm with you about it, that maybe they have returned all these centuries to be with you and me right now.  I think that's what's happening.  If so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could finish, Steven interrupted, \"Yes, Laura.  I remember that now.  Who would have thought you and me would know.  Remember they said the Spirits of the Fountain had never shown themselves again when the war started and that most Humans have come to believe they were never there after all.  I'm feeling stronger in my muscles and my heart is pumping so fast.  It's like we're going to have help when the Challenge is set.  I'm not even afraid anymore.  I feel awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, Steven, me too.  Every second I feel better and happier and stronger.  I'm not afraid any more.  And, the hum is louder and so very sweet and musical.  Whatever this vapor is and whatever the hum is, I may not know, but I know it's really, really special, and magical.\"  She clapped her hands above her head and shouted, \"I am strong enough for anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was feeling excited too.  He danced around clapping his hands then shared clapping with his sister as his energy increased.  \"I'm excited to meet with the Gods and face the challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreya the Pixie stopped moving and turned to Steven and Laura, \"What's all this excitement.  You two don't look as scared and antsy as you did when we started this adventure together.  What's going on, what's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven burst out laughing.  \"Freya, whatever the Challenge, I know it's going to work out.  I can feel it in my head and my heart and my muscles.  Things are going to work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, Freya,\" said Laura with a big smile on her face.  \"Steven and I know what all this white vapor is.  it's help from the Spirits of the Fountain, something that hasn't happened since the war began.  It's the help Steven will need to face the Challenge.  It's wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreya flashed her little light, \"And I thought it was a storm coming that would keep us from getting there.  I hope you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we're right, Freya.  We learned so much about the Spirits of the Fountain but had our doubts like others did back home.  Now, we're going to make it there and only good will happen.  We just have to keep the faith and know we have the help that will be needed to do the Challenge real good and to win the peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" said Laura, \"And then the love will return between Humans and Gods, no more hate and war.  I really believe the best will happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreya flashed her light again.  \"I trust you.  Like I said, you have no idea how important you are at this time.  The changes I see and hear in both of you makes me so very happy.  Instead of tears like I had earlier, I am filled with hope and believe things will go the best way for everyone.  How wonderful our futures can be if we see the Challenge met and love and peace to follow.  You two are wonderful and you're making me happier than I get with 'pixie juice' whenever I get to drink some.  I wish I had some to share with you right now.  Let's keep moving now.\"  She turned and began to lead them on to the place of the Gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven called out, \"Freya, I don't know how to communicate with the Gods since I've never met one.  I can't believe they think about things like we Humans do.  Can you enlighten me about them?  I hope the Challenge doesn't involve killing because I could never kill a living thing except creatures when we Humans see as food.  Will they respect Laura and me?  Will they even listen to us, or to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreya slowed down so she could be heard by both of them as they continued toward their destination.  \"I can tell you, they have had no conscience about the death of Humans.  They know that Humans reproduce easily, every nine months if need be, so they know there'll always be one to replace the deceased Human.  On the other hand, they admire bravery, courage displayed by Humans willing to give their lives for the benefit of other Humans.  The Challenge will probably involve the potential of killing; I just  don't know.  Maybe it will be about using your mind, your brain, to solve something that might bee too difficult for you or any human.  I don't know.\"  She turned to look ahead of them, \"See the lights of the Gods' biggest city, we're almost there.  I just hope you can do what the Challenge demands.  I trust you can because you have already shown me about your faith and your strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the wood was behind them and their walking and running was over smooth reddish sand with a few trees around them, then it changed to a grass-covered land where colorful flowers began to appear.  It was an area unfamiliar to Laura and Steven.  The air was clean, no dust blowing.  As they left the sandy area onto the grass, the white vapor disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked back, \"Steven, did you notice, the vapor is gone.  I hope that doesn't mean the Sprits left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, they won't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flew ahead of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven and Laura ran faster as she led them.  The white vapor continued to surround them and their faith and strength continued to increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, tricky. Horror is not my forte AT ALL. I would think Gods wouldn't have the same conscience as men though - they would see so many men come and go over the years/decades/centuries that human life holds little value. Maybe that's somethign you could bring into play?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC 1840 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, okay,\" Steven said, the bright Pixie light reflecting from his eyes. \"I'll follow you, but I don't like your change in color and demeanor.\" He turned to Laura and whispered. \"I hope we're doing the right thing.\" <br>\r\n\"We?\" Laura said. \"I didn't--\"<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" the Pixie said. \"You cannot be allowed to follow me if you don't trust me.\"<br>\r\n\"How are we supposed to trust you if you can change on us so easily?\" <br>\r\n\"Again with the we, Steven?\"<br>\r\nThe Pixie's color changed again and slowly the light turned from a harsh red glow to the soft shimmering light she had been previously. <br>\r\n\"It is a Pixie law that trust is important,\" the Pixie said. \"No, I haven't explained that in strong enough terms. It is paramount that you trust in me. You see, when the tree fell and we pixie's thought it belonged to us--remember it fell into our wood, after all--we trusted you humans. Of course that turned out to be a big mistake.\" Pixie glared at Laura and then it moved to Steven. For just a moment the soft light switched to a deep, pulsing red, but just as quickly it returned to the peaceful, sedate, soft white glow. \"Sorry,\" the pixie said. \"I can get very excited when I talk about this.\" She took a long inhale and then let it out slowly. \"Shall I continue?\" <br>\r\nLaura grasped her brother by the upper arm, just above the elbow. \"Maybe we should just leave, Steven,\" she said. \"What do you think?\" <br>\r\nSteven wanted to leave, he really did. But he remembered how quickly the pixie changed from this loving, peaceful light into the horrid and scary light. He looked at his sister and saw the worry in her dark eyes. When he turned back to Pixie he noticed her glaring at him, and all around her edges a light moved quickly, like those LED lights that border an object and keep moving alternately from one light to another.<br>\r\n\"Well?\" said Pixie.<br>\r\nSteven turned back to his sister, and said, \"I don't think we have a choice here Laura. I mean, we can lose either way. If we say no, we won't follow you,\" he turned a sideways glance at the Pixie and shot her a nervous smile. \"Or we can try to find our way out of the wood on our own.\" He noticed that his hands were shaking and his palms were sweating. He rubbed his palms along his thighs to wipe away the sweat, but when he looked down he saw that where he had wiped his hands on his thighs there was a greenish glow. His eyes widened. \"What the hell?\" he said, astonished. <br>\r\n\"Hehehehehe,\" the pixie laughed. \"You see?\" she said. \"I have all kinds of magical powers--\"<br>\r\n\"Magical powers?\" Laura said, the nervousness in her voice was unmistakable. \"Steven, are you sure we should have come here at all?\"<br>\r\n\"It's too late now, missy,\" the pixie said, it's voice becoming louder. \"You should have thought about that long before you bothered us by coming here. Don't forget that the wood is filled with trolls, and they aren't nearly as nice as I am.\" <br>\r\n\"Nice?\" Laura said and stamped her foot. \"You call yourself nice when you demand that we follow you?\"<br>\r\n\"I have demanded nothing!\" The pixie's voice had turned thunderous. \"I told you that you have a choice. Follow me to safety or go it alone and find certain death.\" <br>\r\n\"Steven, I'm scared.\" <br>\r\n\"You're scared?\" Steven stammered. \"Don't you think that I'm just a little scared too?\" <br>\r\nSuddenly, the pixie's light grew warmer, fainter, nearly translucent. She shimmered softly. \"I don't mean to scare anyone,\" she said with a voice that was both soothing and low. \"I am not here to do anything like that. I simply want you humans to understand that I am here to help you.\"<br>\r\n\"Can I have a few minutes alone with my sister? Please? I won't say anything bad.\" <br>\r\n\"It will be better if you don't,\" the pixie said. \"Remember my magical powers.\" <br>\r\nSteven stared up at the pixie, and said, \"Right, right,\" he turned to his sister and rolled his eyes. \"Magical powers, let's remember that sis.\" <br>\r\n\"Don't mock me, human,\" the pixie's thunderous voice shook the trees around them. Then it suddenly turned soft again. If you looked closely you could just about see a shape resembling a smile deep inside the light. \"I mean, you shouldn't mock someone who is only trying to help you, sorry.\" <br>\r\n\"Right,\" Steven said slowly. \"So is it alright if I discuss this with my sister now?\" <br>\r\nThe shaped smile widened inside pixie's light. \"Certainly. Go ahead. I was only reminding you that I can hear everything you say.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Steven said and turned to face his sister. \"Let's remember that, sis.\" <br>\r\nLaura shook her head vigorously, but there was no mistaking the fear emanating from her once beautiful eyes. Her lower lip trembled, further announcing her fear.<br>\r\nSteven put a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"It's okay, sis. Let's talk about what we should do.\" He glanced back over his shoulder and saw that the pixie had sat on the ground, her  back against the broad truck of a huge tree. Steven shot pixie a smile, then turned back to his sister again.<br>\r\n\"Okay sis, you go first,\" he said in a voice that was not much more than a whisper. \"I want to hear what you have to say about all of this. He stared across the darkness at Laura, waiting for her to reply. But instead of replying, she just stood there trembling. <br>\r\n\"Laura, Laura?\" Steven grasped both of his sister's shoulder and gently shook her. \"Laura! Come on, snap out of it or we'll never find our way out of here.\"<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity to Steven, Laura's body shivered and she seemed to awaken from whatever had held her captive. <br>\r\n\"Well,\" she said slowly, and looked around as if seeing the  dark wood for the first time. \"We're still here?\" she said with a tremor in her voice. <br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Laura?\" Steven asked, concern rippling his forehead. \"Let me look into your eyes.\" He stepped closer to his sister and stared into her eyes. \"Everything looks okay to me sis,\" he said. \"Just take a minute to gather yourself--\"<br>\r\n\"We have wasted so much time already,\" Pixie said. \"Let's get a move on, giddy up, saddle up, get along little doggy.\" Pixie smiled and then laughed. \"I have always wanted to say that.\" Hehehehe. <br>\r\nI don't think I'm the only one losing his mind around here, Steven thought. He turned back to his sister. <br>\r\n\"Are you okay now?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I am,\" Laura said, but her voice spoke more of disorientation than clarity. <br>\r\n\"So what do you say?\" Steven felt more than saw the pixie's light move. He turned fearful eyes toward the light and watched it move up to the top of a tree, then higher, then higher again, then way up past the top of the tree top. <br>\r\n\"Watch this humans,\" Pixie shouted. <br>\r\nSuddenly Pixie fell down into the tree. Steven and Laura watched pixie fall through the tree. She bounced off the branches ricocheting from one branch to the next like the small metal ball inside a pinball machine. <br>\r\n\"Wheee!\" Pixie shouted as she bounced from tree limb to tree limb. \"Wheee.\" <br>\r\nSteven turned to Laura and his eyebrows rose high into his forehead. <br>\r\nI think that pixie is crazier than either one of us.\" <br>\r\n\"I think you're right,\" Steven. Her eyes moved around in their sockets as her gaze followed the crazy pixie bouncing inside the tree's leaves.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, Laura,\" Steven said bring her back to their conversation. \"What do you think? Do we follow,\" he turned and glared at the pixie, \"her? Or do we go it alone?\"<br>\r\nLaura hesitated before answering, but when she did her voice was filled with uncertainty. \"I think we should. I THINK, I said, remember that!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you're leaving it up to me again?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, I suppose I am,\" Laura said, her eyes still glued to the pixie bouncing around the tree shouting whee, whee. <br>\r\n\"Okay, then don't complain when I make a decision if it turns out wrong.\" <br>\r\n\"Sure, sure, Steven,\" Laura said. But Steven wasn't convinced she had agreed.<br>\r\n1397 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He couldn't recall hearing anything about getting this pixie to calm down and he was in no position to kill it. Unless he had a spell , which he did not.  He felt around in his pockets and then reached for his pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Clarissa the pixie moved closer. \"Don't try anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh just looking for ah.. something.  Oh here..\" it was along shot but he had nothing to lose.  \"Want a mars bar?\" he put forth the candy minus wrapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what? \"Clarissa was now suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candy? Food!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie was so shocked that this human had offered her food, she started to shrink. It had not happened in a long time, so no one really could remember that food especially sugar had a calming effect on pixies. And she actually preferred to be calm than turn into this ugly monstrous thug.  It did a number on her hair doo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven watched her take the candy and return to normal size.  \"mmm. This is good. I needed that ! When my temper gets up ...well, you saw!  It wasn't always that way.  But that wizard..\" .she stomped her little foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any way. listen. you want to find your sister, right. and despite what the books say, not all of us are of that generation or thought. We see the danger of all folk in this battle and well, I do want to help.  It has been along time since a pixie and human joined forces and I want to be the first.  Everyone is my family is..well... I am just different   And if we met any trouble, I can turn into that thing again.\" she shivered.  \"Got any more candy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't give up do you?\" Steven shook his head. \"Maybe I was a bit hasty but..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know all those books! But really I can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I certainly like when you are calm and not biting my head off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I certainly like it when you are nice and not casting me in the same ilk as in the history books.  The prophecy says if we don't work together--the fey and the human and the dragon, well.....\" she dropped her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! What prophecy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the one I am not supposed to know about because it would cause a stir and it might be wrong! Lucky I listen, even If I am not supposed to. So see I could be a perfect ally! And remember I can help with  trolls. You saw..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember.\" Steven said and thought about what had happened. He still didn't know for sure that she could be trusted.  The books can't be all wrong. But at least she was friendly again and he knew how to calm her.  Plus he really didn't know where to go to find his sister.  \"ok, truce! Now which way do we go? I have to find Laura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way!\" Clarissa beamed, happy to have a friend and a purpose. \"She is heading toward the lake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n513 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\nHouse martell</span></div></div>",

She hopped over a boxy shrubs at the end and stomped feeling flustered with the pain in her leg. That was when she heard a cackle under, or was it in between, her feet. \"Come on, come on! Stomp harder so I can get out of this jail of a seed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirecting her gaze down to the slippery ground, she saw a walnut-sized seed that seemed to move. Without thinking, Laura stomped her foot on the seed, cracking it open. Suddenly there was a fog and the form of a giant woman took shape. \"I am Chilan,\" she said. \"From Taiwan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taiwan?\" Laura repeated in fear. \"I don't know we were near Taiwan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because I am from Taiwan doesn't mean Taiwan is near here. It is, in fact, far far away.\"Let me tell you about my name. \"On Taiwan island, fog envelops all year round on a mountain named Chilan. My name comes from that mountain. In that forested island, only three days of the year are clear of fog, and moisture left on the trees alone can reach thirty inches. This fog stabilizes temperature and humidity in this forest, creating a perfect environment to nurture Asia's precious primal cypress forest. To unlock the mysterious force behind this fog, a prominent scientist wizard came to the forest like a genie, reaching through the fog to cypress trees around him, discovering the delicate relationship between fog and the growth of plant lives. How incredible is mother nature, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but I am in a hurry,\" Laura said. \"I lost my brother, and I hate to admit it, but I am afraid of this forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, just lean on me and I'll tell you my story,\" Chilan stretched her arm to Laura. Laura took her arm and leaned on her. Together they began hobbling along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wizard found me as the odalisque of a monster and through trying to save me, he put me in that dreadful seed, but before he could turn me back, the you-know-who's did away with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-know-whos?

They are even jealous of each other, those pixies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevertheless, I must find my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you must come with me, while we hide in my old hut, if it's still there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n505 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was as if she was walking in a dream world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came to lying on her back with sunbeams pouring down into her face and the soft sweet murmur of running water close by. She felt a steady throbbing at the base of her skull and a stubborn ache in her optic nerve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled onto her side, then pushed up into a sitting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tuck your head between your knees before opening your eyes,\" Chilan ordered. \"This is an unstable world you'll need to get used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did as she was told but her breaths felt like steel wedges driven in between her ribs. She groaned and forced her eyes open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw that she was on now a greenest grass with thick but long and soft blades. There were pine trees in clusters along the ledges and the air was filled with the fragrance of pine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChilan helped her to her feet and without saying anything signaled to the point where the grass blades ended. Laura nodded and started walking with wobbly steps even though she still felt pain in her ribs. It was a river, down the bank. The water was clear and swift as it flowed between the boulders whose edges jutted out. Across the river, a cliff rose to about a thousand feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they stood at the edge of an open field. There was not another soul around. But far away at the end of the field sat an amphitheater of stone, enclosed by high cliff walls. Behind it were the mountains in whose nooks pockets of snow lingered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChilan said, \"They are waiting for us at the amphitheater.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With one snap of her middle finger and thumb, Chilan produced a long black cloak, wore it herself, and inside its flap hid  laura, shadowing her face in the depths of the stiff cloth. Despite the warmth of the weather, the cloak was light enough and didn't cling tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, there is nothing about us to attract attention or any notice,\" Chilan said. \"We were fine up to here, but we'll have to pass through town to reach to my place. And anything can happen on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I really in great danger?\" Laura asked, thinking of the lizard massoids. They had to be a kind of the beasts her brother had mentioned. Thinking of her brother brought tears to her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll protect you,\" Chilan said. \"Control your emotions. The worst part will be when we pass through the black tower. Some of the lizard massoids there are invisible. The cloak is covering you well, and if you lean on my leg, I will be able to sense you and also will manage to aid your steps.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will I be able to walk if I don't see where we are going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be able to see through the flap of the cloak in front of your face. The flab is transparent on your side, but not when someone from outside looks at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like an interrogation room window,\" Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what that is, but whatever happens, whatever you see, don't make a sound, and don't talk to me. If you hear me talking, don't answer, but do as I say. Hang on to me and just don't do anything foolish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be very quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, they walked for a while first over a bridge and on a dirt road. At the end of the road they reached to a clearing where a gated tower stood, as black and bright as polished onyx with stairs on the outside. The stairs were steep and Laura mounted them with difficulty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chilan, what's wrong with you?\" A screechy voice shrieked from somewhere. \"Did you hurt your leg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's stomach fluttered, when she saw the large lizard that had taken form by the gate. The beast was colossal in size covered in green scales, and looked as if it were a bloated, mutated mass of indiscernable parts. It opened its powerful jaws sideways to show toothless gums as if it were laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time for joking. Open the gate, Talavic. I had a long day and I'm tired,\" Chilan said in a calm voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your desire my command, pretty Chilan,\" Talavic said, taking an awkward bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the tower, archways surrounded the entry. The stone floors were rough in some places and worn-out in other places. They walked for a while, climbed up a few more stairs, then climbed down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is because of the prison under these stairs we have to walk up and down,\" Chilan said, as if talking to herself. \"No one considers the pedestrians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura opened her mouth to answer but closed it again, remembering Chilan's warning. They were now out of the tower and walking on a stone-paved road. Ahead of them, two huge lizards walked clutching each other's claws. Their scales were bright red and shone under the blazing light from the two suns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Young love</i> Laura thought. This had to be two young lizard massoids in love. Suddenly one lizard jumped on the other and devoured it. In the terror of the moment, an unintended sound escaped from Laura's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChilan coughed to cover up for Laura but the lizard had turned around and was now eyeing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter with you?\" the lizard massoid yowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit under the weather, I am,\" said Chilan. \"Better stay away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yech!\" said the lizard-massoid and scurried to the far side of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Germaphobics, these are!\" Chilan commented as if talking to herself again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore lizard massoids showed up on their way, one minute friendly with each other the next minute devouring, but whoever they devoured reappeared unharmed from their tail. <i>If Steven could only see them,</i> Laura thought. Steven's image in her mind brought tears in her eyes again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No emotions!\" Chilan whispered holding the collar of the cloak to her face. \"Lizards can detect emotion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone swooshed past by Laura's side a trifle briskly, and a melodious voice called Chilan's name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura saw that the someone who had brushed by them was not one but three giant women, as tall as Chilan. Laura noticed images and auras flaring and then disappearing about them like a hologram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, Chilan,\" said the youngest one with shiny black hair falling to her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, Sedhaj, Vorolie, Aejol,\" answered Chilan. \"Excuse me, but I am in a hurry to get ready for the next show. Maybe we can get together, sometimes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked away, Laura heard one of them comment, \"Stuck-up. She's always so stuck up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One thing is sure,</i> Laura thought. <i>Giant or dwarf people never change.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a short distance left,\" Chilan muttered and they continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n852 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Don't go with her!\" A voice so loud Laura didn't know whether it came from a loud speaker or was it her own mind speaking. Panicked she looked around but couldn't see anything but she noticed that Chilan's face had gone pale and her hands were shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" the voice continued in a much lower tone. \"It escaped me that earthlings had sensitive hearing. I'll be whispering, don't worry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this?\" Laura asked, not seeing anyone, except for a sudden reddish cloud in the sky. \"Chilan? What's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Chilan stayed quiet as if she had suddenly gone deaf and mute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask her anything, anymore. I shut down her speech,\" the voice said. \"She was planning to feed you to lizard-monsters, she works for. The plays and the amphitheater bit is a big sham. Don't go with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at Chilan, still without knowing where the voice was coming from. Chilan met her gaze and shook her head in negation. Laura noticed the panic in Chilan's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around, trying to see the owner of the voice, but still there was no one, except what was on the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chilan is helping me,\" she dared to say. \"I don't know you and I can't even see you. Why should I believe you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it is my sight you want to see, I shall materialize then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned to Chilan. \"Does this have anything to do with Antride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChilan shook her head with fear in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, can you see me now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a strange uniform with stars twinkling on its chest area a dwarf appeared in front of Laura. He had the muscular build and facial scars of soldiers, but his legs seemed to be as thin as sticks inside tight purple pants that covered his feet like a baby's leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Laura exclaimed, wondering how someone so small could scare Chilan so. After all, Chilan was a giant from Taiwan. \"Oh, hello!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's Marzendra, and here I am,\" the dwarf said. \"And don't you sneer at shorties. We are concentrated awesome. I have toppled over many a giant in my life. Anyhow, my height's self-imposed. It makes zipping in and out of places much easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't sneer at you,\" Laura said. \"If I gave you that impression, I am sorry, but could you please let Chilan speak? I would like to hear her side, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a moment...in a moment,\" Marzendra said, tossing about his long black hair, and the beams from the two suns played upon it, sending ripples of multicolored lights just like the way any light would act on a black oily surface. \"I believe in fair play and free will. If I didn't, I'd rescue you in a blink without asking. But let me tell you what Chilan is all about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is one of the intergalactic witches  and she works for Lizard monsters, she calls massoids. I bet she told you she was from your planet. She does that to every victim, so they feel closer to her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she did say she was from Taiwan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taiwan, my foot! If Antride is her relative, how can she be from Taiwan? The last time I checked, people over there were about a foot or two taller than me. Did you ever hear of giants in Taiwan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but there were giants on earth once upon a time, it is said. Nephilims they were called.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only a legend. Even if there were, I can assure you, this giant witch is not from Taiwan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she is helping me.\" Laura's voice quivered as sh was skeptical now, having come to doubt everything after she had so believed in Chilan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a show. What did she tell you? Did she tell you, you'd be working in a fancy bakery, baking sweeties for her clients? That's what she told to her latest victim. Unfortunately, I was late in saving the little imp. She'll tell her victims what they like to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She told me I would be acting, but I have never acted in my life, though I do love theater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I guessed.\" The dwarf held his chin. \"Now, I'll open up her speech as my magic is much higher quality than hers, but you ask her your questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping to be fair and also to be able to stay alive, Laura said, \"Before you do that, I have a question for you. If I don't go with Chilan, where will I go? I'd be totally lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. You could come with me to my place. Take my word for it. You'll love the accomodations, and you won't have to act, cook, clean, etc. In short, take it from this shortie that you'll have to do nothing, but enjoy yourself. Or if you wish, I could take you back to the forest where you and your brother became separated. Your pick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura, agonizingly aware of her own limitations, took a sharp breath in, \"I still have to ask Chilan, though,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarf nodded, casting a darkened look at Chilan. \"If she lies, she is going to stutter. So you'll know.\" Saying that, the dwarf yawned and stretched and pointed his forefinger at Chilan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bbbbelieve him, Laura,\" Chilan immediately began. \"Hhhhhhhe wwwill ttttake you tttto hhhhis cccastle tottotto his hhharem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really from Taiwan, Chilan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChilan didn't answer right away. Frowning, she stared down at Marzendra. Finally she said. \"Why is this so important to you? You'll lose either way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will  you please answer my question, Chilan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am not from Taiwan. I am not even from your galaxy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you lie, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChilan shook her shoulders but didn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your relationship to massoids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I work for them, in the amphitheater, but I told you that already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you going to feed me to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnoooo, nnnnnoo. I wwwas sssaving yyyou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Laura turned to Marzendra, then faced Chilan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I have to take my chances,\" she said. \"I decided...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1011 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I thank you for your past support. In some way, maybe for a fleeting second or two, I believe you wanted to help me for whatever reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ingrate!\" Chilan hissed. \"You do as you wish. I for one cannot fight with Marzendra, but I know some beings who could. Be warned, both of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sore loser you are, Chilan,\" Marzendra interrupted her, seemingly bored now, as he went through his pockets, looking for something until he pulled out a metallic star-shaped contraption similar to the ones sparkling on the front of his uniform. \"If we weren't in mixed company here, you wouldn't dare to talk to me this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you wouldn't dare to do anything to me in front of her,\" Chilan said, gesturing toward Laura, fixing her eyes on her and recited some incantation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you!\" Marzendra roared again. \"How dare you put a curse on her in my presence!\" With a deft movement of his foot Marzendra kicked Chilan away, sending her into a fog and having her disappear from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fear, Laura, her curse I will dispel.\" He handed out to her the star-shaped thing he had pulled out of his pocket. \"Stick it on the upper left side of your clothing. This will tie you to me, and will monitor you and others who may come close to you. This way, I will always know when you are in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded in agreement and reached for the star, but her heart was beating so rapidly that it kept echoing in her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, hold my hand, and let's get out of here. We wasted too much time already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" Laura asked, but she couldn't hear Marzendra's answer due to a thundering noise. When she felt his callused fingers grabbing her hand, she jumped as if pinched by a snapping beetle. Her head all the way through her scalp tingled as if electricity were pulsing througn her skin, making her legs twitch and her fingers clutch Marzendra's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That a girl!\" said Marzendra. \"You respond to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt herself spin around together with the dwarf. The entire landscape, the amphitheater and whatever there was to be seen swirled around her as she felt lifted up into the reddish cloud. She felt extremely dizzy, as their velocit forced her head back against something very soft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened her eyes and dared to slide her foot, she found herself falling forward. She sensed being held, with Marzendra's voice in her ears. \"You are not used to speeds, are you? We have to fix that, Dear One.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness surrounded her again. Her breaths became labored and the heat from the left side of her chest radiated all the way to her head. Although she was half-conscious, she thought, <i> The star thing. The heat is coming from the star on my shirt.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to open her eyes but there was too much light, much more than the two suns scorching on the land where the amphitheater had been. Shielding  her eyes with her hands, she tried to take a deep breath, recalling everything she had done and she had seen, be it behind a blinding haze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, her eyes fluttered open, expecting to see something dangerous and scary, but instead she found herself lying on a soft bed in a room very similar to the one her mother once had designed for her.  The uncomfortable feelings inside her head was gone and the heaviness like a freight train had been lifted off her chest. She checked her head, her limbs, her torso with her hands. Feeling just fine, she sighed with thankfulness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So glad, you are doing much better, Laura,\" said  a handsome young man with blond hair perfectly in place, sitting by her side on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Laura timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marzendra. Come on, Laura, you know me,\" the young man said with a playful dimpled grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura squinted at the young man. If this one was Marzendra, where was the dwarf?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One and the same,\" Marzendra said his blue eyes eyes glowing with a sparkle. \"Never judge a guy by his size. I was a dwarf because that is the way Chilan knows me. For you, I am this person, the one you want in your most secret dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's face flushed. \"You can read minds,\" she remarked in a small voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Among my many talents,\" Marzendra said. \"Not that I am gloating...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we here? Where are we?\" Laura looked around the room. It was cheerfully decorated in pastels mostly pink, dusted blue, and pale yellow. Sheer curtains all the way from ceiling to floor, a desk, something that resemled a TV set or was it a two-sided mirror, a dresser two doors one on each wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n838 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If it isn't to your liking, we can change it in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it is just fine. Except at this point, I am not into decorating all that much. You know with the battles going on inside the jungle and God knows where else. My brother's in the jungle. He may even be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Don't think that. He is alive. You can watch the jungle and the battles from here, You can watch anything from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Marzendra doing?

Marzendra pushed the middle button hard, and the screen on what looked like a TV showed a cloudless, cobalt-blue sky with galaxies, stars, comets, and dark shapes leaping on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the remote to the universe,\" Marzendra explained. \"Before you turn it on, sit on your bed and watch it from there. Don't ever get up. It has suctioning power and it can take you inside the place you are watching.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can anything from over there jump in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not, but if you stay on the bed, nothing and no one can hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I turn it off, though, I am fine, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you have to use force to turn it off. Now, since you are so worried about your brother, let's see what he's doing?\" With saying that, he pushed several buttons consecutively and the screen zoomed into a dark fog, giving way to the sight of the tree tops of the jungle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The forest looks so nice from the top,\" Laura remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Infortunately with all the battles inside it, it isn't all that nice. Let's find out where your brother is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, think positive. Survival is what it is all about, and I am quoting the <b>Keeper of the Realm</b>, Laura. Since you and I found each other, the gods must be smiling on you and your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But all that carnage...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the throne is but a joke and the realm is like an ouroboros, which has already eaten its own tail. So sad, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dragons! I see dragons on the screen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are watching the knights and the beasts to see how far they would dare to go. In their good time, they will interfere, as they always do and hand the throne to those who deserve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a knight, Marzendra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a king without a throne. My knights are fighting for me. Our instincts never fail us. Right now they huddled at the city's edges, waiting for me, after the big blast of the weekend. Yes, we have weekends here, but who can care for such things anymore?\" For a happy, outgoing guy he had suddenly turned grim and morose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just who are they? Who are you?\" Laura's voice came out soft and caring despite the questions she was asking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Marzendra, a king with the House of Florent. In our house everyone. every knight, is a king,\" he said, impatiently clicking on the buttons. \"I am looking for your brother, but I am not having much luck, so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must be dead.\" Tears welled in Laura's eyes, and her cheeks were flush. She hadn't been happy with herself for leaving Steven like that, and she certainly wasn't happy about her inability to save him, although she was finally safe to have found refuge with someone who had the capability to protect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to give up,\" he puffed, but then a glint of something among the brush caught their eyes. Even Laura noticed it through the clumps of concrete, shining among the ruins of where an old tower used to be. Marzendra zoomed into it, where they both noticed the form of a young man, digging at the edges of a rock pile, tossing aside rubble and stones, and crying out for someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven!\" Laura screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n730 Words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Those people, those servants of the lizard monsters, will do anything for their masters to grab the throne.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, and I so believed in her. Am I gullible, or what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame yourself, Laura. Everyone acts gullible in unknown, dire situations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said that, Marzendra's face grew more somber and stern. Laura averted her eyes from his face and directed her gaze to the screen, but on the scene, the black tongue of night was already licking the last colors on the two horizons and the lights from the distant stars were igniting the tops of the trees and slithering on to the brush underneath them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ruins looked like phantom ghosts and Steven's image had become lost among them. Dragons with wings and tails of flickering green and purple luster chased across the forest, and shadows leaped here and there, as if they were cadavers rising from their tombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lowest of the social order,\" Marzendra said. \"They rise in the dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext cries of contempt came through the screen. Forms on horseback with jeers and venomous laughter struck the hoisted dead with sharp spears, their blades glimmeringed even with the little light from the stars. While the crumbling cadavers fell in shrill laughter whose tones carried no merriment and grew too bitter to be mistaken for laughter, their rage and hatred seemed to disgust Marzendra, to inflame his own resentment against those on the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are not playing fair,\" he said. \"They are destroying their own dignity. The cadavers are already dead. Killing them serves no purpose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think happened to Steven?\" Laura asked, her voice trembling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about him too much. I put a protective shield around him that will make him iivisible and last through the night of the realm. Tomorrow my knights will try to fetch him to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Marzendra. I think I didn't thank you for saving me and also for trying to help my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for that, Laura. I do what I do to please the gods and the Keeper of the Realm. They are important in this universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of shrieking, howling, screaming in merriment was coming through the screen with the dragons hovering over the chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't the dragons doing anything?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seem to be gathering information for now. But you never know with dragons. They strike suddenly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Marzendra clicked a few more button and the screen went dead.  \"I know you haven't had anything to eat for a while, Laura. Come to dinner with me and we can plan our next action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least, my brother is alive!\" Laura sighed. <br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n599 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, hadn't he shifted his shape? She sighed and thought, \"Bad attitude! Why do I have this question mark? I shouldn't.\" No more bad attitudes. She felt determined to make this work. After all, shape shifter or not, he had taken the vision of her ideal man, a singularly handsome man. There was nowhere to go anyhow. She was at the end of her ropes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she took Marzendra's arm and they walked out one of the doors. Only then, Laura realized that her clothing had suddenly changed. She was now wearing a long elegant pastel pink evening gown, and Marzendra was wearing some uniform still with his stars on its chest, but it looked as if its cloth were a shiny type of silk. He looked stunningly handsome. Laura gulped and averted her eyes toward the tapestries hanging high on the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she realized the different kinds of openings in the walls. On the lower levels were the windowlike spaces large enough for a man to stand in, and on the higher levels the windows were of ordinary size, all set into thick walls with window seats built into them. <br>\r\nTo Laura's right, a stairway led to a higher level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This stairway leads to the towers,\" said Marzendra and while they were passing under a wooden archway, \"Don't worry about what you will see next,\" he whispered with a mischievous grin. \"Most of it is illusion to thwart off my enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corridors they passed through were hauntingly dark, and tall burly guards some of them beast-like stood on both sides of the walkways by the walls and doorways. They seemed go have dazed smiles on their faces and loving every minute of this. As Marzendra and Laura passed these beings first turned translucent, then transparent. After they passed a corridor, behing them, the floor erupted and the inticately decorated and glazed tiles flew up in a dark cloud. Yet, what happened with the guards was more disconserting than what happened to the floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura bit the her lower lip not to make a sound. This might as well have been a dream world or did it have the possibility of turning into a nightmare?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably reading her mind again, Marzendra said, \"Shadow people, but they are very real and extremely effective and capable. I believe you have similar ones in your world called Ninjas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never met a Ninja,\" Laura said, \"however, I've heard of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you could meet them, they wouldn't be called Ninjas, would they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard they suddenly sprang up here and there, with the more unexpected motions and at the more unexpected times.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra nodded in agreement but didn't answer with words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dining room was straight out of a fairytale, mysterious and incredibly beautiful. The floors were made of wood and a blue Crest on the floor welcomed them into the home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Crest?\" Laura pointed to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is my family's. The star I gave you has the same crest built inside it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe didning had a unique ceiling design with star-shaped lights against a navy blue background. A mahogany table with several chairs around it  could possibly fit a huge dinner party, but Marzendra led Laura to a nook off the dining room to a much smaller table magnificently decorated for two people, but there were three chairs around the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nook was warm, and the curtains behind them were drawn. A small exquisite chandelier hung over the table that had fancy china and several glasses with different colored liquids in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a vegetarian,\" Marzendra said, but if you wish to have something like the chicken in your world, my cooks can bring it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you,\" Laura said. \"I'll have what you have.\" She certainly wasn't going to bite into some unknown meat of an unknown animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner was delicious and the drinks in her glasses were just to her liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was sipping the red liquid Laura couldn't help but glance  at the third chair. Why did a that extra chair stood there? Was there an invisible being in the room? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra chuckled. Laura felt her face go red. Had he read her mind again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expected your brother for dinner, too,\" he said. \"But it will have to wait, under the circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a gigantic fly with metallic blue shine, flew in whirring its wings and lowered itself on the plate in front of Marzendra. Laura attempted to ignore it but she almost choked on her last sip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfazed, Marzendra touched lightly on the fly's torso. The fly rose and landed on the top of his left ear. Marzendra frowned and stayed frozen for a second or two, then with a hand signal, he shooed the fly away. The fly buzzed away obediently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just received word that your brother isn't on the spot we saw on the screen,\" he said solemnly. \"My knights tell me someone else has him locked in a cave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears sprung to Laura's eyes. \"But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must have traced him to you, and therefore, to me. Unfortunately, he became a bargaining chip, a commodity now, but don't worry, Laura. Now that he's important to them, they will keep him safe and sound, and we'll find him as soon as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n932 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

He was killed in the last battle, by the lizard monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Massoids? That's what Chilan called them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they are the tricky ones. They must have tricked Harcolt first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura reached up to pull a lock of hair from the front of her face. \"Your friend's name was Harcole?\" She felt more friendly toward Marzendra now, although she still didn't trust him completely. She never like hostility and agression, but in the realm that she was thrown in those two things were the currency for existence. She shivered thinking that she eventually would need to readjust her paradigm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Laura, and don't worry. You don't need to change. I don't want you to change. You are my fresh air in this God-forsaken swamp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt blood rushing to her face at the compliment. <i>It is just a compliment; only a compliment,</i> she told herself, and raised her eyes to Marzendra's face, which was now supporting an adorable, crooked grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said with a polite smile. \"I guess I needed someone telling me something nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra locked his eyes on her. \"Except I wasn't being nice,\" he said. After a moment's silence, he added, \"I promise I'll find your brother for you, Laura.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, when she was just about to fall asleep, Laura thought she heard someone whimper. She sat up in bed and listened. It was coming from one of the doors on the wall to the side of her. She got out of bed and tiptoed to the door. After a moment's hesitation, she opened it ajar to another bedroom next to hers. There on an armchair, next to his bed, sat the dwarf, his face in his hands, sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, the handsome man was gone and in his place  the dwarf had returned. Now which one was the real Marzendra?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra took his hands off his face and stared at her, his mouth agape. Obviously, in his emotional condition, he hadn't sensed her opening the door and catching him unawares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra scrunched his head in shock. \"Go back to bed, Laura,\" he said. \"Please do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura asked softly. \"Is there anything I can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Forget you saw me now and go to sleep. Please.\" It was obvious he was annoyed with himself for being dumb enough to show his vulnerability, his danger zone, and maybe with her, too, for catching it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded without uttering another word and went back to bed, but sleep came hours later, without her noticing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> She is wearing a corset, and someone from behind keepse pulling its cords tighter and tighter, squeezing her, reducing her ability to breathe. The mirror in front of her keeps changing colors. Then the person behind her steps out and Laura sees his reflection next to hers. Her heart drops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conte Briswald?\" she asks. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't I be here?\" The baritone voice is extremely impatient. \"It's my castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am dressing...Please, can you leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignores her and pulls the strings so tight that her bones grind against one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gasps with pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll never let you breathe.\" He puts his hands on her shoulders and kisses her hair. \"I want you, Alexandra. Come to my room after the ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Steven walks in the room in an seventeenth century gentleman's attire. After him is Marzendra in his handsome-guy persona. He too is in a similar attire. Marzendra draws a sword and when he's about to cut Briswald to pieces, Laura blinks and opens her eyes. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was awake now. It was really no surprise that she dreamt of Marzendra and Steven, but who was Conte Briswald and why did he call her Alexandra? And why were they all wearing those old-fashioned clothing? Laura had never worn a corset like that in her life. Still feeling the tightness of it, she took a deep breath. She knew she had to get up, but she couldn't decide if she could shake off the images in her dream or cling to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose out of bed and dressed for the day to come.

He wasn't the handsome guy today, but the dwarf now standing rather wearily in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said, \"I hope you slept well, Laura. Let's go for breakfast. I will be leaving soon, to find your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come with you. Please, let me come with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be dangerous.

I'll give you a bodyguard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, as long as I am with you.\" Marzendra's eyes gleamed. Laura added,\"To find my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra's eyes turned misty, as he turned his face away from Laura. \"There is one other thing I mean to tell you.\" His voice changed a bit, stilted perhaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Laura said, feeling her skin start to prickle. Was it bad news?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to tell you the truth...the truth about me...and not because you saw me last night. Because I can't stand myself when I lie to you. I could never lie to you. In all the lives we led together, I never lied to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked down at him, asking questions with just the rise of her eyebrows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who you saw late last night and right now is the real me. Who you saw last night at dinner as the handsome blond man of your dreams was me, also, but that was once upon a time. I changed the now me to the once upon a time me with the hope that you might recognize...or rather something in you might remember..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling her dream, Laura opened her mouth, then closed it again, recognizing this is not the time to interrupt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, you and I we have been together in many lives. Both of us took many shapes and forms, but we always found each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How's that possible?</i> Laura thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible because gods move behind the scenes, creating, crafting and presenting and re-presenting us and the world of the Realm to the world at large. Because love, unlike life, is infinite. The realm is infinite. You and I are infinite because my love for you is infinite.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you and I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura started to look away, but Marzendra reached for her hand held it looking into her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it too difficult for you, if I am this?\" He made a sweeping motion with his chin; hard to figure out if he were talking about his shape and size or what or who belonged to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was facing him directly. Yes, she knew this man, this man who was holding her hand in whatever shape or form. Didn't she know him in the dream? But he was also a stranger. Should she walk away? Should she let his rough, unsightly exterior sweep her away? <i>Why not? Why not indeed? Just when looks did matter to me?</i> <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSlowly Laura moved closer to him and clasped her fingers around his, and when he wanted to pull away in what she thought was confused excitement, she didn't let go. She loved the feel of his hand. Clawlike, yes, but strong and textured. Hands that were exposed to hardships. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Laura!\" His voice was raspy and flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handsome one and this lovable dwarf; it was this contradiction that was so enticing so seductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra slowly lifted her hand to his lips and kissed it while still gazing into her eyes. The sensation was so strong, Laura thought she would never be able to breathe again, ever. When she started to breathe once more, her each breath was shallow. She struggled to still herself. <i>He has flair!</i><br>\r\n <br>\r\nAt that moment, the door to the hallway opened. Laura let go of Marzendra's hand as a tall knight in gleaming black armor talked, standing at the threshhold. \"Do you still want me, Sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, Ausout,\" Marzendra said. \"You will guard and protect Laura while I turn the Realm upside down for her brother.\" Turning to Laura he added, \"Ausout is a diviner; he's also a philosopher. He'll keep you entertained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be coming with me and others, but Ausout will take care of your needs and will be the one explaining things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAusout bowed in respect. \"Your Majesty, what is Miss Laura's magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's pure,\" Marzendra said. \"No magic. Except she can stay inside a person for eternity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, Sir,\" Ausout said, a smile flashing across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go and get things ready.

You must be very careful with what you put in your mouth, Laura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what it was that we ate,\u201d said Laura. \u201cExcept it was a most delicious breakfast.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra raised his eyebrows and looked away, but she didn\u2019t miss the smirk that played across his lips, as he directed those shapes he called vehicles, waving his arms like a traffic cop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she kept watching him, Laura only noticed Ausout\u2019s form minutes after he had taken shape next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Majesty, is Miss Laura ready to come with me?\u201d Ausout asked, his luminous black form acting like a star under the gloomy morning sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra turned to Laura. \u201cGo with him,\u201d he said. Then noticing her hesitation, he rubbed her arm gently. \u201cIt is going to be all right Laura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the moments when Ausaut led Laura into his chariot, or at least the tacky, outsized globe-like thing that he called a chariot, Laura inspected him carefully. His was a strong, captivating face with sharp-angled bones, a scarred left brow, a square jaw and a cleft chin. His eyes were startling, a deep-ocean blue, the eyes of a teller of tales. His lips quirked in a half-smile when he noticed her staring at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the hatch opened, and he thrust out his hand to help her up the three steps into the enclosed part of the ugly dark green cab. Laura took it and his big, warm hand engulfed hers like a mitten filled with the softest cotton balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember the feel of my hand, Miss Laura,\u201d Ausout said. \u201cWho knows, we may be cast in the dark, and if someone else holds your hand, without you seeing him or her, you\u2019ll know it isn\u2019t me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if it\u2019s Marzendra?\u201d She\u2019d rather be holding Marzendra\u2019s hand, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou already know Marzendra\u2019s, but if it\u2019s him, he has many other ways of making himself known.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know him very well,\u201d Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, Miss Laura\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, just call me Laura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, if you so wish. I was just saying that Marzendra insists you two knew each other for a very long time, centuries in earth-time. Now, if you permit me, I must take my helmet off to adjust to the inside of this chariot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Laura sat down, a belt that looked like a serpent bucked her down on its own volition. She squirmed and looked at Ausout who was unlatching the helmet from the armor. His hair was short and shiny black at the top, closely curled, but at the back much longer hair in several braided portions fell out of the helmet. Immediately a hand that came out of the side of the vehicle reached to the helmet and held it as if it were a hook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad, my chariot, don\u2019t you think? I got the outer shell from an antique place packed with old-fashioned robots and two dimensional screen sets. I designed the insides myself. Most of it is underwater equipment, but after a few adjustments, it fits my needs in all dimensions. I value old things. When I look in the ways of the ancients, I find hope for the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTruth be told,\u201d Laura said. \u201cEverything is new to me, here. I vaguely recall how we ended up in the forest, my brother and I, I mean. One minute my brother was showing me his new invention. The next, we ended up in the forest where all kinds of weird things were happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026I think your brother must have unknowingly touched into an area of knowledge alien to both of you. The Realm is infinite in its own way, but I\u2019m afraid, your planet is forever unreachable.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d Laura rubbed her hands together in distress. Not returning to earth ever? The idea stabbed her right in her middle, but she only let out a tiny sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo difficult to explain. Although we have a little time at the moment, it might not be enough. When we return, I\u2019ll ask his Majesty Marzendra to talk to you about it. He had more earthly lives than any one of us. He says he asked for that asylum because of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach word that came out of Ausout\u2019s mouth, generated at least ten questions in Laura\u2019s mind, but she decided to shut her trap and let Ausout tell her things in his own way, but where was Marzendra?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am here,\u201d came Marzendra\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019m in the vehicle behind you, but I\u2019ll always be with you, Laura. Just think of me, and you\u2019ll hear from me.\u201d Laura looked about her, bewildered, but also felt a certain kind of happiness reach to her face; she turned her head away from Ausout to hide her vestige of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Majesty, Miss Laura is very happy to hear from you,\u201d Ausout said. \u201cYou should see her now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt her face redden. Was there a way to hide her thoughts and feelings from these people? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, there is,\u201d came Marzendra\u2019s chuckling voice. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to work at it. Now I have to attend business, Laura. Talk to Ausout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems I\u2019ll have to work at a lot of things,\u201d Laura said to Ausout. \u201cHow do you think I can adjust to, or if not, get out of this place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura, please I implore you, don\u2019t talk of getting out of here. You\u2019ll hurt his Majesty and make him delirious with rage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mean I should be afraid of him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no. He won\u2019t show it to you, but he\u2019ll take it on the rest of us, and what ends up happening won\u2019t be pretty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be a harsh one. Is he cruel to you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAusout shook his head. \u201cHe won\u2019t hurt the tiniest insect. But especially us, the diviners of his castle, we\u2019ll feel his hurt and it is a most painful thing to feel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you like him so much that his pain becomes yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore than that. His pain multiplies in us.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Laura said, although what she thought she understood overwhelmed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why truly religious people on earth are afraid of doing something bad, even if through their thinking. Because they don\u2019t want to upset God. One doesn\u2019t want to upset the one he or she truly loves.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t call his majesty a god, but for us he is the most fair-minded and accomplished leader. Yes, I guess you could call what we feel for him a kind of love.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow wonderful you all are, and I am so happy I got to know you, Ausout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can only reflect his majesty\u2019s goodness, Laura. I am not all that good on my own.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen, you are a genuine, decent being, to know if and where you lack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAusout\u2019s eyes glistened though his voice was controlled. \u201cYou are quite a philosopher, and his majesty calls me one. Go figure.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt she should change the subject for she didn\u2019t want her mind to go in all directions, while saving Steven was the most important thing for her, especially after the way she had stomped away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t we moving?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs Marzendra waiting for someone or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but we have been, Laura, we\u2019re almost there. My chariot has a smooth ride, because of the buoyancy factor in it. That\u2019s why you didn\u2019t feel us moving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the vast stretch of land where it was hotter and more desert-like than the Tropics that Chilan had taken Laura to, the forest glimmered in its dark green suit under a cool light. Ausout was walking behind Laura, but she couldn\u2019t see Marzendra or any other knights? What had she gotten herself into? Was this all a dream? Or was it a nightmare? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot seeing me doesn\u2019t mean I am not with you, Laura.\" Marzendra\u2019s voice said. Was he in her head again? She opened her mouth to say something, but before she could talk, the dwarf\u2019s voice warned her again. \u201cDon\u2019t talk out loud and be very quiet, both of you. Now, Laura, walk where your instincts will take you and Ausout will be with you. So will I, though in a form you aren\u2019t used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why am I the one leading everybody?</i> Laura thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause your instincts and your wish to find your brother is a compass stronger than ours. Now, I have to attend to the scanning. If I see something, I\u2019ll lead your thoughts to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the music started first as a humming then as an orchestra drilling into her head. Laura recognized it immediately. The Savages\u2019 Dance of Peace\u201d from Rameau. She could dance to it; she felt like dancing to it, but Ausout held her arm tightly, and the music was gone. Laura turned and threw a questioning look at him. Ausout shook his head seriously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAusout can\u2019t reflect his voice into your head,\u201d Marzendra\u2019s voice said again. \u201cThose were the forest pixies trying to get your attention by the music you\u2019re familiar with. They must be working for someone or someone is making them. Don\u2019t get caught up in their magic, Laura. It\u2019ll prolong our search.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All right. And thank you, Marzendra.</i> After all, she was learning to communicate with him in thought. That was something. Better than nothing, until she could learn to block her thoughts from these beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1614 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> She had known Marzendra for a very short time, but she felt so close to him. Was this feeling his magic or did it come from her insides, she couldn\u2019t tell. Yet, both he and Ausout were insisting that she had known him for centuries. Could that be possible? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny, Marzendra wasn\u2019t responding to her thoughts anymore. <i>He must be busy with whatever he\u2019s doing,</i> Laura thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, she realized they were climbing up a hill, now. Yes, a steep hill in the forest. So steep, it had to be a mountain. Kind of like the earth where once upon a time most mountains were covered with tall trees until their cap areas where snow and ice began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut higher up here, through the trees, where the forest started becoming less dense, she saw something iridescent in the distance, and after walking for a little while more, she noticed that it was a lake. A high desolate lake on top of a mountain. The shores of it were covered with tall grass and were not visible to the eye, but when Laura looked toward the horizon she saw that the water was shimmering. A mist blanketed the lake. and she noticed mountainous islands peeking at her through it. Could Steven be somewhere around here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around to Ausout, but Ausout wasn\u2019t behind her. <i> Marzendra</i> she screamed inside her head, but all she heard as any answer was static like an old-fashioned radio's static. She retraced her steps back where she found Ausout lying in between a clumps of trees and brush with an arrow at his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAusout!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knelt by him and tried to undo his helmet, but she could only open it a quarter of the way, enough to see his face. He wasn\u2019t dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShshssshh,\u201d Ausout whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can heal myself, but it will take time. Go back down. The wild ones must be around here. They might be wanting to take you, not me. They\u2019ve never hurt me before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh! Only whisper. Never mind who. I sent an alert to his Majesty, but he probably didn\u2019t get it. Something's in the air.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t answering me, either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t dally! Close my helmet back and go! Go back down.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn\u2019t want to leave Ausout, but she didn\u2019t know how to help him either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour being here puts me in danger more, Laura. Go back down. Quick!\u201d he whispered, as his face contorted in pain. Laura reached for the helmet\u2019s open facial area and closed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShall I take the arrow out, at least?\u201d she asked hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t touch it. Don\u2019t touch much else, not even the trees and plants. Just hurry. When he finds you, His Majesty will explain these things. Now go, Laura! You\u2019re putting both of us in danger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Ausout, be well again!\u201d And saying so, Laura hurried back down the mountain, half running half sliding on the moist ground covers and fallen leaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she was in the deep forest again, but everywhere she looked, she couldn\u2019t see Marzendra and no matter how often and how long she called him, she didn\u2019t get an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed something, something different, something she hadn\u2019t seen in the forest before. The color of the leaves on the trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leaves were all purple and crimson. The forest she had come from, the forest where, on the screen, she and Marzendra had seen Steven, where the ruins were, had dark green leaves. Had she climbed down the wrong side of the mountain? Now she was really lost, and she longed for home, for her brother, and now for Marzendra, too.  But she was lost, hopelessly, desperately lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she was all alone and had to find Steven, and Marzendra, too. She had warmed up to him. She recalled how Marzendra had changed his shape just to please her, and as if something in her broke, she felt pain in the middle of her chest area. His shape of the dwarf had never bothered Laura, but why would Marzendra feel that way, when he was the one so knowledgeable and so powerful in so many ways? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow tears were running down her face wetting her shirt. She covered her mouth to stifle the sound of her sobs. What if she never saw Marzendra again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n729 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she lowered her hand from her mouth, Laura accidentally touched the star that was stuck on her chest under her light jacket. She felt a zapping sensation at the tips of her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> The star thing! The star Marzendra gave me\u2026how could I forget? Maybe I can use it in some way. But how?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried rubbing the star again. Yes, it was zapping all right but the zapping was much lighter than the time when she had felt herself spin around together with Marzendra when she and he were lifted into the reddish cloud. That had been more than a zapping sensation. She had felt extremely dizzy then, as their velocity had forced her down, and feeling sick, she had fallen into her bed in Marzendra\u2019s castle, with Marzendra's sweet voice in her ears. \"You are not used to speeds, are you? We have to fix that, Dear One.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there had been no time to fix anything. Except the fact that she had found a friend in Marzendra. Well, maybe more than a friend, but who could tell so early in a relationship! At least she had been given the information that she and Marzendra had had a past together, a past the universe had erased from her mind, a fact that she had believed only half-heartedly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura rubbed the star again, then looked up at the multicolored leaves on the trees. She had stopped treading about a few minutes ago, as her tears had been clouding the places where she was walking on. She certainly didn\u2019t want to step on a serpent\u2019s tail in this alien forest with no Ausout or Marzendra protecting her. She wiped her nose and tears on her sleeve and looked once more around her to see where her feet her taken her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it was as if the forest rose up around her, with a bright sunbeam turning every branch to purple and crimson and setting everything into a blaze of holographic prisms display while glass leaves and reeds moved and jingled against one another like sleigh bells. A little blue bird darted toward Laura and perched on a glassy branch nearby, its beady eyes staring at her. It lifted its tiny head and trilled \u201cOdd lost girl in the fairyland, odd lost girl in the fairyland! Pull the star\u2019s tail. pull its tail. Odd lost girl! Odd lost girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas the bird giving her a message? Should she listen? Maybe she should be polite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Laura said, and the next moment she felt astounded at her own voice zipping through the air as a stroke of bright red paint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird reached out to her and touched her head with a rainbow-like claw. Just then, Laura noticed something peculiar. Her voice that had been a stroke of bright red paint had come back at her, and was swirling and creating a bird cage around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she screamed in terror. She certainly didn\u2019t want to be captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the trees a tall woman all in a flowing white gown, with white hair and huge hazel eyes appeared; in her hand was a wand. \u201cAre you here to hunt our birds?\u201d she asked. Her words turned into light blue streaks, which the woman captured with her wand. The wand seemed to absorb all the streaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m just lost,\u201d Laura said, but as she talked her voice, still in bright red swirled on the cage making it even stronger. Laura grasped the bars of the cage and shook it to make it break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, girl,\u201d the woman said. \u201cLet this be a lesson to you. Don\u2019t let your own words capture you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird on the tree chirped again. \u201cPull the star\u2019s tail.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush, hush, hush!\u201d The woman stretched her wand to the bird and the bird fell on the ground in pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura took a step back in horror and let go of the bars of the cage. She realized she should be quiet, as this multicolored forest was a fairyland. Hadn\u2019t the bird said so? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf so, then this woman had to be a fairy or possibly a witch in fairy form. Another thing the poor little bird had said was for Laura to pull the star\u2019s tail, but the star had no tails. Laura put her right hand inside her jacket and pulled the points on the star one by one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have an ailment of the heart?\u201d The woman, fairy or witch, asked. \u201cYou are holding your heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Because Marzendra is inside my heart!</i> The thought hit her so hard that her knees buckled and she sat on the ground inside the cage. At that instant, she realized that she was holding the star and grabbing it with her whole hand instead of gently touching it or pulling on its points. As she did that she thought of everyone she ever loved, but especially Marzendra. If she ever found him again, she would ask him about the other lives they had been together, and would apologize for not remembering them, if there would ever be a waking from this nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarzendra,\u201d she moaned as she shook the star that had so attached itself to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next instant, the forest with the multicolored leaves, the fairy woman, the glass pieces of the tiny bird started swirling around her and a darkness engulfed her, choking her, as if furiously alive. She struggled to breathe while a thunderous noise shook the earth on which she had been sitting, but the bars of the cage shattered and flew about her like pieces of broken glass and Laura felt herself being lifted up into a fluffy white cloud that moved so swiftly that its motion multiplied her dizziness in million folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came to, she found herself in the middle of the forest, the very forest where she and Steven had first gotten lost in, the very forest where she had gone with Marzendra to find her brother. The very forest inside where she had been frightened and terrified before felt like her motherland, her home now, in comparison with that other forest of the multicolored leaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose to her feet, her legs shaking and everything blurring about her. Her dizziness took a while to subside. When it was somewhat gone, she started walking, then stopped and put her hand inside her jacket to rub the star again. <i>Marzendra, find me, please! Marzendra! </i> Each sound of his name became a polished diamond, shining with no equal to its brilliance, inside her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a few more steps first to her right, then to her left, but stopped, not knowing which direction to go. That was when she heard high-pitched bells chiming steadily, and she felt the breeze warm and moist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked toward the sound of the bells, but froze in place when a short form appeared through the trees with three knights behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding both her hands in his, he sighed. \u201cAt last, you made it.\u201d His was a deep, heavy sigh, as if he had more to say, and he had used the sigh to keep him from saying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bird. Did you send the bird? She killed him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn illusion,\u201d said Marzendra, gazing into her face with his huge eyes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a live bird. I can only send illusions into the fairyland. I was very concerned about you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the image of him, his wide curving mouth, was such a relief. Trying to pull herself together, \u201cAusout needs help. He\u2019s hurt,\u201d Laura said. \u201cUp on a mountain where there\u2019s a lake on top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra talked swiftly, as his eyes drifted to his entourage. \u201cI know and don\u2019t worry about him. I sent several knights after him.\u201d He squeezed her hands in his as a comforting gesture. \u201cYour brother we\u2019ll find still, but you need rest, Laura. This speed sickness of yours, we have to take care of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarzendra,\u201d said Laura abruptly, not quite being able to hold back her words anymore, \u201cI think, with you\u2026I\u2019m falling in\u2026I\u2019m falling in\u2026big trouble.\u201d This loss of control was something different, something unrehearsed. She felt the heat rising to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra grinned smugly, his cheeks shaking like jell-o. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1385 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

Laura couldn\u2019t believe her ears. After she had blurted out what was in her heart, he had looked surprised, but his face had taken on a happy expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen before he could respond to her, several knights had rushed to their side and had talked to him in whispers and in a language Laura wasn\u2019t familiar with, and Marzendra\u2019s face had lost its pleasant look, and his brow was scrunched with worry. Maybe it wasn\u2019t worry, but at least, he had gone suddenly quiet and serious. After their discussion, he had produced, out of thin air, a huge shawl and had told her to cover her entire body from head to toe with it, and if they were to be approached by someone she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with, to cover her face, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Laura had asked why, he had said that their travel plans had changed and he was taking her to his grandmother\u2019s cottage, far away, at the outskirts of the realm. \u201cAren\u2019t we going to the castle?\u201d Laura had asked timidly, still unable to look at him, to look at his face, for she was too embarrassed of her own revelation, thanks to her big blurting mouth a while ago.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThere was some trouble at my castle,\u201d was Marzendra\u2019s unwilling answer. His face had grown darker and he wouldn\u2019t elaborate on it, and Laura was feeling too tired and still too embarrassed to say anything further, let alone to push him for information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, while she waited for him guarded by two knights on each side, he had taken off to rain orders on the knights and other personnel. She had watched him from the distance zipping here and zipping there like a comet, his form a tiny dot among tall knights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left Marzendra\u2019s camp at night because he had told his driver the cloak of darkness would hide them better. Following Marzendra\u2019s vehicle, other vehicles had gathered and piled so tight together that their forms stacking up and sideways had taken the form of a huge fox that had just come out of the undergrowth where it was hidden, ready for action like a gathering body of a small army preparing for war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as he neared her, someone had rushed again to tell him, \u201cIt\u2019s there! I saw it behind the trees.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra had grabbed him by the arm and scolded him in a low whisper. \u201cKeep quiet, Osapir. The whole forest doesn\u2019t need to hear your voice.\u201d Then he had pinched his eyelids together peering into the trees.  Hearing them, Laura had covered her face with the shawl, sensing all this hush and rush could be about something involving her or something hiding in the forest behind those trees and she\u2019d better be cautious than sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it had begun. First quietly, then louder and louder, from the depths of the forest a shrill, piercing sound reminiscent of singing, a sound heard in one\u2019s soul if not in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe forest sprites and gremlins,\u201d Marzendra rushed to reassure her. They come at night when three moons are about to come together.\u201d Then he had ordered his driver to take Laura inside his vehicle.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you can let her in there?\u201d Jarchial had asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo as I say, and quick!\u201d Marzendra had grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Laura sat in the carriage, she found out she could see through all sides of it. It was as if Marzendra\u2019s vehicle was a bubble, but couldn\u2019t bubbles burst and couldn\u2019t one see through them?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe inside of this vehicle isn\u2019t visible to the outside.\u201d Jarchial had told her as she sat down on the leather chair which swaddled her as if she were a baby. \u201cMarzendra makes it so that the entire vehicle is invisible, at times. By the way, Miss Laura, your brother is fine. We are certain about that, and we are certain to reach him in a few days or so. Ausout is found, too. His majesty told me to give you the news, so you wouldn\u2019t worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Marzendra had come in and sat next to her. Then slowly he had reached for her hand, which he still kept holding.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they were floating in the air in what seemed like a still night with three bright silver moons shining down on them and on the large stretch of water below them. The brilliance of the moon penetrated the vehicle, and shone on Marzendra\u2019s face. <i>What if he\u2019s a dwarf?</i> thought Laura. <i> He has the most handsome and noble face, and I love it when he looks at me with those huge, magnificent eyes of his.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, thank you, Laura,\u201d Marzendra said with the softest, most loving expression on his face, and he pulled her hand to his lips. \u201cYou just made it so that this is the holiest night of my existence...so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt as if her heart would beat out of her chest. She should learn how to block her thoughts from him and others like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work on that, too,\u201d Marzendra said. \u201cMy grandmother will teach you. She is eager to meet you..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" said Laura and her embarrassment receding a bit, she asked, \u201cWhy did you give me this shawl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will make you unseen from most eyes, though maybe not all,\u201d said Marzendra, his face taking on a mischievous grin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? I never needed such protection before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you did, and I didn\u2019t know it.\u201d Marzendra hit his forehead with his other hand. \u201cThat you are pure, magic-free, makes you desirable for anyone in the realm.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt only makes me ignorant,\u201d said Laura. \u201cWho would want to have anything to do with an ignoramus?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra shook his head. \u201cAnyone who knows any magic. And you are no ignoramus. You had good sense to cover up when danger was reported just a while ago. A pure one like you is immeasurably valuable because any kind of magic magnifies when met with purity. Your purity is your beauty inside out, Laura. And you are so beautiful that my lips would be unable to describe you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, he had a high opinion of her, and this pleased Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut your head back and try to rest,\u201d said Marzendra softly. \u201cWe have a long way to go. My grandma\u2019s cottage is at the other end of the Realm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura put her head back but didn\u2019t immediately close her eyes. It was more fun watching Marzendra\u2019s form under the silvery light of the three moons that stood side by side on the dark night sky.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1147 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Heavy thumping sound of footsteps came through the corridor so dark, her eyes couldn\u2019t see anything inside. Then an immense shadow cast its silhouette against the entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing to worry,\u201d Marzendra said. \u201cGrandma has her own style of having doors opened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA servant half black-bear half-man opened door and turned his head toward the inside. \u201cYour grandson, Ma\u2019am!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarzie!\u201d  a shriek shook the foundation under Laura\u2019s feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Marzie?</i> Why did grandmas in all creation embarrassed their grandkids by calling them with their baby names! Laura giggled. Marzendra blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Marzendra called a cottage was a huge castle, even larger than his. His grandmother, to Laura\u2019s surprise, was not a dwarf, but a giant of a woman, her height almost close to what Laura recalled as Chilan\u2019s. She had striking red hair and wasn\u2019t old at all. She looked the same age as Laura except she was massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you found her,\u201d Marzendra\u2019s grandmother said. \u201cGood for you. I didn\u2019t think you had it in you, Marzie.\u201d Then she turned to Laura. \u201cSo good to see you again, Alexandra, ummm\u2026sorry, Laura. All these name changes. They always get me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura certainly didn\u2019t remember her. Were these people playing with her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d Grandma said. \u201cI confused the child!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGran, Laura doesn\u2019t recall the past, only this life she\u2019s in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, why didn\u2019t you show her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot enough time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot enough time because you were cavorting with the young lady as usual.\u201d Marzendra rolled his large beautiful eyes, making Laura put her hand on her mouth to suppress another giggle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranma continued. \u201cOh my, well, reintroduction is called for then. Laura dear, I am Cormeroline, Marzie's grandmother from his father\u2019s side, as surely you know. You call me Corie; all my friends do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGran, can you keep Laura safe, while I attend some business with this Thrones problem? Also I need to take care of finding a lost person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What lost person? Are you in the detective business now? Did you blow your mind while changing shapes or what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteven,\u201d Laura said. \u201cMy brother. He\u2019s looking for my brother for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well. That shouldn\u2019t be too difficult for Marzie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it is,\u201d Marzendra said. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize it at first, but Laura is a pure one. Too many clans are after her, and she was roaming the Realm alone, looking for her brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh---ohhhh!\u201d Corie said, frowning. \u201cI must put up the shield around this place then. Were you followed, at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think so,\u201d Marzendra said. \u201cI turned the vehicle invisible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that wouldn\u2019t stop some and by some you know who I mean,\u201d Corie said. \u201cAnd I am not sure you didn\u2019t forget something. You always forget something, Marzie. And with Laura here, you probably looked at her and forgot yourself, too.\u201d She put her head back and let out a laugh, then turned to Laura. \u201cHe was always like this, dear, but of course you wouldn\u2019t recall, but I\u2019ll let you in on him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a whirlwind she turned around to her servant. \u201cTamblero, put all the shields up. All of them, and let my knights stand guard as well.\u201d And she took off after Tamblero in a rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All this for me?</i> Laura was surprised. Why would she be this important?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you are,\u201d Marzendra said. \u201cYou are the most precious for me. Besides, beings like you are extremely rare. I told you why. Everyone\u2019s after you without wanting to harm you. They want you as you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why does Marzendra want me, then?  Is he like the others?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think that! Don\u2019t ever!\u201d Marzendra roared in a rage. Laura covered her ears from Marzendra\u2019s rumble. Marzendra softened his voice, but with a sad expression on his face. \u201cWhy I want you is not so despicable as them. I wanted you in all my lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked stricken, as if Laura had slapped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n670 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shame on you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, she thought\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a right to her thoughts. Sometimes I can\u2019t recognize you, Marzie.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt her eyes misting. \u201cIt isn\u2019t his fault, Corie,\u201d she said. \u201cI just have this doubting nature.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd as you well should have. It is your only protection in this Realm. Marzie, did you give her the ring?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has the star.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe star is not much good, alone. Why do you always get things half done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be pushing, Gran.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> A ring? </i> Was the lack of it why she couldn\u2019t reach him in the fairies forest?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust look at her. Look at the way she looks at you,\u201d Corie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is the one to make that decision. Not me,\u201d said Marzendra. \u201cI\u2019ve already made mine, romantic and giddy as it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAargh!\u201d Corie said, looking at Laura. \u201cHe\u2019ll never learn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura doesn\u2019t remember, Gran. Anyhow, this is a different situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this about the ring, Marzendra?\u201d Laura asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt means\u2026\u201d Marzendra swallowed his next breath. \u201cIt means the ring will make you attached to me for eternity. It means you have to give up your earth life. It means you\u2019ll always be my mate, forever. It means you\u2019ll also gain eternity. Eternity is a long, long time. It has been long and lonely for me, but I had been waiting for you; Laura. Still, it is not in me to\u2026I can\u2019t force you to\u2026to\u2026\u201d He looked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glad he was talking frankly, and letting her to consider her options. Though she felt such warmth toward him, her decision had to be based on a reasonable analysis of consequences rather than her romantic feelings. But if she opted otherwise, could she live from then on without Marzendra? Could she let him live without her after he had waited for her for so long, as he and his grandmother claimed? Even if she could, could she find her way back to earth? She had no one else left on earth, anymore She had only her brother, who also was somewhere in this realm. But even if Steven chose going back to earth, if they could go back, could she, Laura live another life on earth with Marzendra in her mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed both Marzendra and Corie watching her as she deliberated her choices. \u201cI need to tell you this, both of you,\u201d Laura said, crossing her arms over her chest and trying to hold a cool mask over what was high excitement. \u201cI do want that ring, and not because I am depending on you, Marzendra, for my welfare. Because I want you for reasons not fully clear even to myself. Because things what never interested me before have become fascinating since I know they are important to you. I love and like you as you are, for who you are, and not as a replacement for someone I imagined or dreamt about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you so,\u201d said Corie to Marzendra. \u201cNow, that is true purity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra was still staring at her, his great amazement showing in his face. \u201cYou want me even though I am a dwarf?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are the most handsome dwarf in the universe,\u201d murmured Laura. \u201cWhat does it matter whether you are a dwarf or a fancy male model? You are who you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, to go with your star\u2026\u201d Out of the thin air, Marzendra pulled a ring with shining stars built all around it and held it in front of Laura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura staggered, the stars dazzling her eyes. Marzendra held her arm and placed the ring on her finger. \u201cNow, kiss me,\u201d he said, gazing into her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Corie was watching them, Laura shed her timidity and bent down to kiss Marzendra. When their lips met, she felt herself being raised into the air. When she opened her eyes, in front of her she saw the handsome man she had dinner with a few nights ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe frog just turned into a prince,\u201d Corie clapped her hands. \u201cExcept he was never a frog. He was always the prince. That old tale! Some imagination my grandson has. He tests people all the time. Even me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Laura looked into the eyes of her handsome mate. \u201cDoes this mean I\u2019ll now have a life of being tested all the time?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just a life, Laura. Eternity,\u201d Marzendra said. \u201cYou are now eternal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t remember the old lives we had together,\u201d Laura said, searching into her own mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you with that,\u201d Corie said. \u201cYou need unlocking. And Marzie being Marzie, he\u2019ll do that halfway, too. So I\u2019ll do it for both of you, as a gift for your union.

The Realm was one of the latter. In the Realm, something was always happening. Most everyone stalked others in their reach to the throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching all this on Corie\u2019s screen, Laura felt more mystified than enlightened. \u201cBut why is everyone trying for the throne?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe throne is the ultimate goal,\u201d said Corie. \u201cThose who can get to the throne can never be stalked or be in danger?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs Marzendra in danger?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe does want the throne.

Surely, with life eternal in you, no one can kill you per se, but is any existence as a slave worth that existence?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not,\u201d said Laura. \u201cThere are ways of being bound and not free. My past lives are still not coming back fully. Despite all the help you and Marz is giving me, my mind is making me a slave, I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they were together, she was calling him Marz with his name, rolling it in her mouth like candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame your mind, Laura,\u201d said Corie. \u201cIt is trying to adjust just like you are. You went through enormous and sudden changes. Adapting to change will be part of your quest for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes, I recall bits and pieces of other lives, at other times nothing happens, even with the chant you taught me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true; she did suddenly see scenes from other lives where she and Marz were together, sometimes dancing, sometimes fighting, but never agreeing to stay together, but she never recalled those scenes in their full sequences. Or else, she thought she was catching on to an idea or a scene as if hearing a rustle, hurried footsteps, things not quite comprehensible, or things always screened by shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could try something else, a potion,\u201d Corie said, hesitatingly. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring it up before because Marzie asked me not to. He said you\u2019d feel bad, and he doesn\u2019t want you to feel bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind. I wish to get this over with, so we can go ahead with our life together without a hitch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat shall I say to him, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell him I asked for it, which I am now doing, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right then, but you may not feel all that well for a little bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d said Laura. \u201cMay I have that potion, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just hope Marzie doesn\u2019t come back too soon,\u201d Corie sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe potion tasted just like chocolate milk, which was perfectly fine with Laura. Yet, later, as the pressure waves washed through her, a strange light shone in front of her eyes through the translucent walls of the castle. For some reason, Laura found herself resisting and the light began to fade gradually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything abruptly became clear to her. It was during the Victorian times when her then-father was a Lord and he was ordering her to marry someone, Duke Conte Briswald,  for the convenience of some business or alliance he had in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura, however, was in love with another nobleman, Lord Whestall, his brother\u2019s best friend, who was Marzendra now but only a baron then. For his lower rank, Marzendra hesitated to declare his intentions, and Laura, Alexandra then, wasn\u2019t sure that Lord Whestall returned her feelings. Although Laura made a few vague attempts toward Lord Whestall, the Lord didn\u2019t catch on or didn\u2019t follow through, and Alexandra had married Briswald, only to be abused by him. On his last day of life, Lord Whestall had stabbed Briswald to save Laura but was killed by him. Just like in Laura\u2019s dream. Briswald had also died a few months later, from his wounds not healing well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled and with frayed nerves and her thoughts filling with self-reproach,  Laura looked at Corie. \u201cI caused his death. He was the most selfless man I had ever known, always helping the poor, always kind to everyone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorie\u2019s eyes misted. \u201cHe still is. That life made this one possible for him. The powers-that-be granted him this eternal life, and your love for him made you two find each other for eternity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am so\u2026so sorry,\u201d Laura sobbed. \u201cNot only for the last one but other lives, too. We wasted lifetimes through misunderstandings, usually all my fault. I was so selfish, so proud. I must have been plumb crazy.\u201d As her tears ran down her cheeks, she felt a grey cloud being lifted from over her, but the cloud now had erupted and spattered in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all your fault, Laura. It belonged to the family you had, especially in the last one. They had raised you like themselves. Class and control ruled them. They were slaves to the rules of class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we all had exaggerated opinions of ourselves in those times,\u201d Laura gasped, attacking her tears with her hands. \u201cAnd I felt betrayed by him, too, when Whestall began devoting his attentions to my cousin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs did Marzie, Whesthall then. He was timid, unable to follow through. He approached your cousin because he thought he could get closer to you through her. He also felt betrayed by you. I should have known better, too. I should have interfered since I was his mother in that lifetime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember you, Corie. You were the kindest, warmest lady, so unlike the people around me\u2026then.\u201d<br>\r\nShe blinked, her tears nearly blinding her, but she added, \u201cFunny, I recall another thing. A poet who recited to me a few lines. I still remember that. <br>\r\n~Yet each man kills the thing he loves<br>\r\nBy each let this be heard<br>\r\nSome do it with a bitter look<br>\r\nSome with a flattering word<br>\r\nThe coward does it with a kiss<br>\r\nThe brave man with a sword~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOscar Wilde,\u201d Corrie said. \u201cHe was prophetic, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I think he sensed it; he sensed Whesthall\u2019s story and mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began sobbing again, and finally she blacked out unable to handle this much emotional tsunami. When, she couldn\u2019t tel,l but she felt the strong touch of Marz\u2019s hand. When she opened her eyes, she saw the care and panic in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGran, you gave her the potion, didn\u2019t you!\u201d He swiped up Laura and drew him to her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Laura. That stuff is dead and gone. We are alive and together now, forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you,\u201d Laura sobbed, as a fierce pleasure filled her with just being held by him. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t Corie\u2019s fault. I asked her for the potion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1121 words <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

The good thing is neither of us will return to earth, as much as we appreciate its teachings. Now is our chance together to make this realm as beautiful and as spiritual as we can. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded. Marzendra continued. \u201cI have some good news for you. Your brother is found. My knights rescued him from Chilan\u2019s people. They were holding him hostage and were planning to exchange him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExchange him? For what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou. They wanted you. They could do so much with your purity. Why, with what they could pump into you, Chilan alone could become the heiress to the throne after her supervisor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSupervisor? She had a supervisor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, the great lizard-knight. He was a friend of mine at one point, but then he followed his lizard brain and he turned ugly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy brother, where is he? I must go, rescue him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHappy to say that, my love, Steven is on his way to here. When I was away from you for a while, I was casting a spell on the place where he was being held, so my knights could penetrate through and find him. It was quite difficult as his quarters were underground and impenetrable, but we managed it, somehow, without hurting him or anyone, even his most powerful guards. Something I did put them all to sleep, and sleep they will for a very long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if when they wake up and find Steven gone and they come after us? Oh, Marz, I don\u2019t want you or Corie hurt or anyone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat won\u2019t happen easily as I left a dummy who looks just like Steven in his place, a moving, talking dummy. The only way they could find out if Chilan were to go see him, and that too, is highly unlikely, because Chilan hates underground anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said, you left a dummy. You went in there, for Steven?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but it\u2019s fine. Everyone was snoring and as the invisible dwarf I turned myself into again, even the ones among them who dabble in magic could not see me. If they did, they might have thought they dreamt it.\u201d He threw his head back and laughed heartily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he stopped, Laura gave him a speck on the cheek with appreciation. Then she looked at him, looked through him, beyond him, her face intense with joy as if she were under his spell for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, now this is something I like, Laura,\u201d Marzendra cooed.  \u201cYour love will lead us into new worlds, irresistible and intoxicating, all the way to the throne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura leaned against his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll go anywhere you take me, Marz,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to see my brother, first. By the way, isn\u2019t he a pure one, too? He doesn\u2019t know any magic that I know of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but he does. How do you think you and him suddenly found yourselves off of the earth and in this realm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was an accident!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was no accident, Laura. Although he didn't know about it either, he had been thought in another lifetime, not on earth, but in a nearby galaxy, Alpha Centauri to be exact. I had to find his records in order to help him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe had a lifetime in another place other than the earth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t the only one. We all did. But he and I were taught magic. You refused it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t stupid. One can always learn magic, but reaching success without magic shows a higher calling, Laura. When one learns to do things without the hocus pocus magic, that person has purity. Then magic is divinely given to that person, as I believe will be given to you. When that happens you\u2019ll be stronger than me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you are very strong. How did that happen, Marz?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra remained silent for a moment. Then he replied. \u201cI\u2019ve never used my magic for negative things and never just to hurt another being. This made what I knew more powerful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd because you also believe that everyone should be encouraged to find happiness. I noticed it in your interactions with your knights. Even the way you treat your enemies is gentle, Marz. No, I could never be as strong as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what our existence brings,\u201d replied Marzendra with a patient smile. \u201cThe thing is, we are together and for eternity. This is the greatest gift of the universe to me, Laura, and the end to all my sorrows.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched Marzendra\u2019s face, Laura began to understand the complexity of this man, of everything he did with passion. There was a dramatic flair in his words, actions, and conquests. Each had a perfect sense of rhythm and timing. Thus, she was reassured that what seemed to be separate interests were, in fact, one and the same.  <i> This must have been the miracle of eternal life </i> she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was thinking, she didn\u2019t notice the sudden appearance of a knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour majesty, your awaited party has arrived!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet them in, Lieros, what are you waiting for!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Laura turned toward the entrance and sighted Ausout and Steven together, she let out a surprised scream and staggered back. Marzendra held her and walked with her toward the two men. Ausout was still in armor, but Steven had stars and ribbons on the chest of the jacket he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome home, my two most favorite people,\u201d Marzendra said with a satisfied look on his face. \u201cI\u2019m glad you made it through the realm safely.\u201d Then, he turned to Laura. \u201cI have another news, my love. Your brother has agreed to become one of my knights. We\u2019ll all be together, now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura ran to Steven and hugged him, then stretched her hand to Ausout and said, \u201cThank you, knight Ausout for guarding me and putting yourself in such danger. I\u2019m forever in your debt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAusout bent in deference. \u201cYour desire is my command, my princess,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess? Just when did you turn princess?\u201d asked Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled and held her hand to him to show the ring on her finger.

The stars which changed colors as you passed them along with the silvery moon kept her fascinated. The stars in particular seemed to have a pattern to heir glow \u2013 not all of them changed colors as they swooshed by them but only some did and Laura\u2019s mind was now preoccupied in the \u201cwhy\u201d of the thing. Another of those stars turned to green as they flew across it and she slowly moved her head sideways, as if her calculation had gone wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, It doesn\u2019t work that way, Laura,\u201d Marzendra said, almost surprising Laura but as he parted his lips to reveal the secret Laura raised her fingers to her lips. She said \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to learn about it on my own, Marzendra,\u201d and dived again into her messy mind which was yet busy calculating it.<br>\r\nMarzendra  looked at her and smiled. How pure those eyes were, he wondered. As her lips moved to mumble her calculation, it was if Marzendra felt the softness of those pink lips. He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch yourself, Marz,\u201d she said without looking at him in a teasing tone, \u201dyou may just lose yourself to me,\u201d and she giggled. Marzendra looked at her and smiled. Not embarrassed in the least, he said \u2013 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCatching up fast with that mind reading thing, huh,\u201d and winked at Laura who nodded wholeheartedly, flashing another of those mischievous smiles. <br>\r\nA sudden commotion of sorts, in the clouds some thirty feet away caught their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that, dear?\u201d she asked Marzendra who seemed to be taken aback by it too. He shrugged his little shoulders and a little nervousness touched him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight be the Cows,\u201d he said, smiling trying to lighten the environment but the vigorousness with which the clouds were being parted made him wonder if they were about to be attacked by the perpetrators of the Dark Realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for the shawl, Laura,\u201d said Marzendra and his voice had a sense of urgency in it. Laura quickly wrapped it all around her and poof \u2013 she went invisible to all non-wizard eyes. She could see clearly though what was happening in front of her. Amidst the nearest cloud which floated beside them,  a curios shape was taking form. It was of a carriage driven by a bunch of creatures who can be at best described as Horse sized Doves was appearing before them, slowly. Marzendra kept looking at it with great intent and searched for the magical dagger in the inside pockets of his robe. He took it out and hid it sneakily between the stubby fingers of his right palm.  Now he was ready for the strike if the need appeared. The carriage was now completely visible and there seemed two people sitting in them, wearing a shawl like Laura which made them invisible but not to Marzendra\u2019s eyes which were sharp as a Hawk\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsout, Steven! \u201d Marzendra exclaimed in joy, \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage screeched to a halt and waved back at the Dwarf which stood in front of them. Although, they were not sure as to whether they had met him before but the pure joy in his voice told them that he was happy from the bottom of his heart and thus he could be believed. Another thing which made them trust Marzendra was the fact that the turban which he was wearing had the same imprint on it as the one on their vehicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarzendra turned to Laura and exclaimed in utter joy  - \u201cLaura, look who is here!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mentioning of Laura\u2019s named perked up Steven\u2019s and Asout\u2019s ears.<br>\r\n(620 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It felt definitely odd to hear anything other than the quacks of the ducks which swam on the lake which sat right in between the grand Hills of Naini. He tried to hear again for a voice, any voice but didn\u2019t hear anything \u2013 not even the quacking ducks. A nervous and a weak smile escaped his lips as he breathed in the aloofness in the air around him. It was a real probability that Asout was the only human for miles, now. He looked at the magnificent Naini hill which stood before him like a proud guardian to the serene Aqualy lake. The snow capped hill had a grandeur to them unlike he had seen before in his life. The Ice caps were not threatening, not boasting but rather inviting. He wondered about who lived there on the Ice filled region of the hill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe Yetis,\u201d he sniggered, and then considered the thought that Yeti had probably called out his name.  Asout wondered he had stated to hallucinate; it was a possibility after all since he had eaten food some six hours before ann the weakness and the fatigue was probably catching up with him now. He kept moving towards the edge of the lake, walking all around the lake to reach that point of the lake which seemingly met the foot of the Naini Hill. He was somehow too sure about the presence of something whch could help him there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, he heard it again, his name being called out by not one but a bunch of humans, probably. He turned back to look into the direction of the voice but saw nothing again. He was too sure of having heard it to dismiss its occurrence this time. He yelled back,<br>\r\n\u201cHellooo-oo-o-o-. Somebody in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply came his way for some time apart from the echo of his own voice. He yelled out again twice or thrice but to no avail. His stomach had started to churn now, forcing him to do things which he normally wouldn\u2019t. The accumulating hunger and the feeling of being lost were starting to get better of his senses. He ran towards the direction from where voice had supposedly originated, yelling all the time seeking for help. The ducks in the lake, not used to commotion, quacked even louder and flew away from the direction he was running. Despite running for some ten minutes, he had not heard the voice even once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I losing it?\u201d he questioned himself but kept running, flaying those legs around which felt like made of jelly. He felt as if he could lose balance anytime now and soon he did too, tripping over a little piece of rounded rock which lay in its bath. He fell face first and his head thudded into a nearby rock. Streams of blood ran down his nose and his eyes turned bleary.  He knew he couldn\u2019t keep them open any longer. He fought against the closing shutters despite no apparent hope of being saved. His breath was now giving away and his eyes grew even heavier. Just then, he heard it once more,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-a-a-a-A-s-s--sout-t-t-t-t. We are searching for you. Stay still, we are reaching there.\u201d<br>\r\nThe help was probably nearer than before and it gave him another reason to fight on. He kept fighting for every second with his eyes till he saw what his ears had made him believe \u2013 five soldiers, sword in their hands stood some ten feets away, calling out his name. He smiled as he closed his eyes, consciousness leaving by his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(606 words) <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

I am a daughter, sister, friend, but I would not call myself anything other than that, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And thus, it is with me. I, too, am a daughter, the daughter of the earth, born from its very breast in a moment of turmoil.\" Chilan tapped her fingers on the nearby tree. \"I, too, am a sister - to all those who reached their heights with me beside them. And I wish to be a friend, your friend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura put her small hand on Chilan's massive one. The hand, hard and cold as stone, stilled. \"You shall be my friend, Chilan. Now, let us clean this growth from your hut. \"Tell me of your journeys, about yourself. It will make the work seem less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, you have a good heart. Thank you.

I will call you friend, You have only be kind and helpful. Why would I consider you anything but?\" Even as she said this, Laura wondered what happened to the fear and anxiety that had plagued her since becoming lost. Here she was in an overgrown jungle clearing with a woman three times her size in height alone, and yet she felt nothing but companionship, even, if possible, the beginnings of a warm joy. Was this some kind of witchcraft? Was she under a spell? She shook off her doubts. Night was falling and they needed the shelter of the hut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, friend. We shall clear my hut so we can sleep. The demons will be out with the moon. We will be safe in my hut.\" Chilan strode through the clearing. Laura ran to keep up with Chilan's long stride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the hut, Chilan pointed to the door. \"If you can clear that first, then I will work on fixing the roof where it has caved in.

For that matter, you don't act like one either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you before. Looks are deceiving. I have been many things\" With her massive hands, Chilan lifted the beam that used to hold the roof and inserted it into a hole. She beat it down with her bare hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gasped. \"That is um - incredible. I see what you mean about looks. Your hands must be made of iron. Didn't that hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not iron, my dear, rock. My hands, my self, I am rock\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so? I touched your arm. It contained flesh, just like my own. I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My spirit can take many forms and humans see and perceive me through their own eyes, It is a projection of themselves. You are a kind and lovely young woman, so you see me as a kind woman. Others have souls that are crooked and evil and they see me as crooked and evil. The desperate see me as such and the monsters perceive me as a monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am rock. I was weaned at the breast of mother earth, raised in the upheaval of earthquakes. I am as old as time has been measured. I am the spirit of the mountain, Chilan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura dropped the broken limb she was moving from the front of the door. \"A mountain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a mountain - the spirit of the mountain. My outer core still exists in the mountain range between my sisters, but my spirit has come to help solve the turmoils of war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how -  I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Throughout history, there have been upheavals. Some physical which gave birth to the mountains, the rivers, the valleys. These, while sometimes destructive were also constructive. Since the creatures of the land became sentient - man, trolls, goblins, elves - there have been other upheavals. Social upheavals, political upheavals, intellectual upheavals. All of these, up until now, have also contained the seeds of destruction and construction. Great things have been created in the shadows of these upheavals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said 'until now'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, I am glad you caught that. I knew you were astute. No wonder you are the chosen one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chosen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More about that later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forces are coming together to create an alliance. They will cause the ultimate upheaval. It is they who call me monster, for as I have told you, they see what they are. When pure evil forces an upheaval, no good can come off it, unless, of course, good triumphs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But surely good will triumph. Is there not leaders, troops to meet this foe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is our dilemma, and why I have come to aid you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the second time you have referred to me as if I am some great hope, but I am nothing, a nobody. Why would I have a role?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChilan laughed. \"Oh child, you are far from a nobody. You are the one that the oracles have foretold for centuries. Songs and poems have been written in your honor. Stories have been crafted about the bravery you will someday show. You, yourself, and all your friends and family have sung of the promises you bring.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You jest. Wouldn't I know? Wouldn't my family know?\" Laura brushed the hair from her eyes and grasped the huge limb to drag it from the front of the door. \"Oh, I see. You promised me a story. Well, that was one strange tale, but fiction is fiction, and we have work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we do, but this is not fiction, and I will tell you more when we rest this evening.\" Chilan continued to reweave the hut's roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I care not for this type of story. I think when we are done, I would like to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, little one, great revelations take time to sink in. Soon, you will need and want to ask me more. But if there is one thing a mountain spirit learns to do, it is to bide our time and mind our tongue until the moment is right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two women continued their tasks in silence. Just as the moon was rising, Chilan proclaimed her work finished and helped Laura remove the last of the debris from the front of the door. After entering the hut, Chilan dusted off the top of a trunk in the middle of the room, opened it and pulled out  stuffed mattresses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that fit in there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember not all is as it seems, Laura.\" Chilan brought out two pillows, blankets, and when she set these up on the ground, she returned to the trunk and brought out two bowls filled with steaming liquid, and two tankards frosty and filled with ale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be dreaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, child. Eat well. You have many things to learn about this world and what is possible. This is a mere trifling. Then sleep.

Uuugh!\" Laura yelled.  \"Let. Me. Go!\" She tried tugging herself free but every move made Chilan's grip tighter.<br>\r\n\"Not until you stop struggling.\" Chilan replied.<br>\r\nLaura's eyes shot daggers at Chilan.<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to keep you safe.  How can you rescue your brother if you, too, are in danger?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not in danger!\" Laura kept tugging, and Chilan's grip kept tightening.<br>\r\nFlinging Laura towards a nearby window, Chilan simply said \"Look for yourself.  Look me in the eye and tell me that is not dangerous.\"<br>\r\nLooking out the window, Laura saw the trolls converging towards the hut.  \"It's not dangerous.\" Laura forced herself to look Chilan in the eye while saying that.  She was desperate to get out and desperate to find her brother.  She did not trust Chilan.  Grabbing a sword on her way out, Laura began randomly slicing and swinging it about, as if to ward off the trolls.  <br>\r\n\"Ahh, Miss Laura.  We've been waiting for you!\" One of the trolls exclaimed.  <br>\r\nCaught off guard, Laura lowered the sword.  \"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n\"We've been waiting for you.\" another one said simply.<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"To lead you back to Steven.  We're here to help!\"<br>\r\nLaura frowned.  This sounded a little dangerous.  Trolls usually did not help humans- contrarily they frequently misled people and took them in circles- much like pixies or sprites of the forest would to a lost traveler.  Heaving up her borrowed sword again, she narrowed her eyes.  \"Why should I believe you?\"<br>\r\n\"Because we know Steven is in great danger right now.\"<br>\r\n\"That still sounds weird.\"<br>\r\n\"No no no, we promise you this is not a trick.  We are faithfully yours.  We shall lead or follow you as you desire.\" the trolls bowed down to Laura.<br>\r\nCompletely confused, Laura decided to give them a try.  \"Fine.  Lead me to Steven.  And some of you stay back so Chilan doesn't get to me again.\"<br>\r\nThe trolls hurried and scurried about to follow orders.

She turned to the four trolls who had been assigned to stay back with her to keep an eye on her. <br>\r\n\"How long will we have to stay here,\" she asked the troll who seemed to be in charge.<br>\r\nMateus wore a bright red shirt over a loose fitting pair of pants made out of sail cloth. The soles of his sandals had been cut from an old tire and the tire treads could still be seen under the sole. The sandals were kept on his feet by strips of leather wound over his ankles and calves. His blond hair was combed back and curled over the collar of his shirt.   <br>\r\n\"Until we're told to do something else,\" Mateus said. Mateus had been silent up until this point, but his voice was filled with authority. \"We have our orders and we intend to obey them.\" The three other trolls who stood next to him nodded their agreement. <br>\r\n\"What if I told you that you are making a mistake?\" Chilan said as she looked from one troll to another, stopping her gaze on Mateus. \"What if I convinced you that Laura is in more danger without me than she is with me?\" Chilan paused and stared into the dark confines of the forest. \"Will you at least listen to what I have to say?\" <br>\r\nThe four trolls bumped their heads against each other, as they leaned in to discuss the matter. As they whispered, Mateus looked up over his shoulder to make sure Chilan didn't try to get away. After several minutes of whispered murmurs, Mateus stood and, staring at each of his comrades, said, \"Okay, let's take a vote.\" He paused and held up his hand with his fingers outstretched, ready to take a count. \"Who says yes?\" <br>\r\nTwo of the trolls held their hands up high. \"Me, me,\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Mateus said. \"Who votes no?\" He waited.<br>\r\nOne small, white gloved hand slowly rose into the air above the head of a troll wearing a green shirt with a torn sleeve, a pair of red pants, and a haggard looking pair or Nike sneakers that were once white. The troll looked around, and when he noticed his was the only hand raised, he began to cry and whine.<br>\r\n\"Oh, man,\" he whined. \"I never win at this game of voting. If I had known that you guys were going to vote no, I would have voted no as well.\" He wiped at his eyes as the other two troll gathered around him. They patted his back and offered him kind words about not being disappointed.<br>\r\nA troll wearing a bright yellow shirt and green pants jumped up and down and grunted. \"I want to change my vote, I want to change my vote,\" he kept calling out.\" <br>\r\nMateus looked at him and frowned. \"Why on earth would you want to change your vote?\" <br>\r\n\"Because I don't want my friend, Angus, to lose, that's why,\" the troll with the yellow shirt said. \"He's my friend, and if I change my vote from yes to no, then he won't feel so bad.\" <br>\r\n\"That is so nice of you,\" Angus said to the yellow shirted troll. \"But I want you to vote the way you think you should, not the way you think will make me feel better.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" said the troll with the red shirt. \"I want to change my vote too.\" He gazed at Angus with a soft stare. \"See, Angus, you're not a loser. You have friends that care about you.\" <br>\r\nAngus wiped at the tears flowing over his round cheeks. \"Thanks, guys. You're all true friends. I think--\"<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Mateus shouted and held his hand out to quiet the trio of talking trolls. \"You're all losers if you ask me,\" he said. Troll grumbles filled the air around Mateus as he scanned the area around him. <br>\r\n\"That's a terrible thing to say,\" the troll in red trousers said. <br>\r\n\"You should be ashamed,\" another troll said as he wiped his sweaty palms on his green pants. <br>\r\n\"Would you all please stop,\" Mateus shouted. \"I have something important to say here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices of the other three trolls faded away, and three pairs of eyes fell on Mateus. <br>\r\n\"Okay, Mateus,\" the trolls said in unison. \"It's your turn to talk.\" <br>\r\nBefore Mateus could say anything, the troll in the yellow shirt said, \"Where's Chilan?\" <br>\r\n\"Where's Chilan, indeed?\" said the troll in the green shirt. <br>\r\n\"Hey, she's missing,\" said the troll wearing the red shirt. <br>\r\n\"I have finally gotten your attention,\" Mateus said to the trio of trolls taking their time looking around. \"I've been trying to tell you that Chilan has hidden herself from us.\" <br>\r\n\"But why would she do that?\" Angus said. \"Didn't she know we meant her no harm?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, didn't she know that?\" red shirt said. <br>\r\n\"Didn't she?\" Yellow shirt said.<br>\r\nMateus sighed long and loudly as he looked at each troll in sequence. His gaze stopped on Angus. <br>\r\n\"I don't know what she thought,\" Mateus said. \"But if she escapes that could put Laura, and maybe even Steven in danger.\" He took a deep breath, and continued. \"It could be dangerous for the trolls that took Laura to look for her brother, too.\" <br>\r\n\"What should we do?\" asked Angus.<br>\r\n\"Should we do something?\" yellow shirt asked.<br>\r\n\"We can't do nothing,\" red shirt said. <br>\r\nMateus, impatience filling his voice when she spoke, said, \"Let's not quibble about the details. We all agree that we have to find Chilan, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Angus said. <br>\r\n\"Correct,\" red shirt replied.<br>\r\n\"Can we take another vote?\" yellow shirt asked.<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Mateus shouted. Then more quietly, he added, \"No, no more voting. We have to break up into groups.\"<br>\r\n\"But there are only three of us...well, four if you count yourself.\" <br>\r\n\"Of course I count myself,\" Mateus said. \"Why wouldn't I?\" <br>\r\n\"Well, you're the boss, the man in charge, the big honcho, the man of the hour, the person what is in charge, the big--\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I get it, Angus.\" Mateus's voice was getting testy. It was becoming apparent that he had been left with three of the lousiest, laziest, loneliest, lamentable trolls in the group. But he refused to allow that to keep them from their appointed rounds. <br>\r\n\"Here's what we'll do.\" He put his forefinger to his lips as he spoke. \"We'll break up into four groups and search for the ghost, Chilan.\" <br>\r\nAngus held his hand up tentatively.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Angus,\" Mateus said.<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, you see, boss,\" Angus smiled shyly. \"A group is made up of more than one person.\" Angus forced himself not to laugh. \"And if we break up into four groups, than each group will consist of only one person.\" <br>\r\n\"So?\" Mateus asked as he eyed each troll for a second. <br>\r\n\"Well, it's simple really,\" Angus said. \"If a group has only one person, then it's not a group.\" <br>\r\nThe other two trolls nodded their heads vigorously as they agreed with Angus's statement. <br>\r\nMateus shook his head back and forth slowly. What am I getting myself into, he asked himself. <br>\r\nMateus's shoulders sagged as he let out a long exhale and forced a smile onto his circular face. <br>\r\n\"Okay, you guys win.\" He looked around the small clearing where they stood. \"We will all go separately...\" he waited to see if anyone had something to say about his plan so far. A moment later, when no one seemed to object, he continued. \"That means we can go east, west, south, and north, each one of us taking a different direction, and look for Chilan.\" <br>\r\n\"I want to go east,\" red shirt shouted and jumped up and down.<br>\r\n\"No, I want east,\" yellow shirt said and pushed red shirt.<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch your hands,\" red shirt said and pushed his red clad chest against yellow shirt. <br>\r\n\"STOP!\" and exasperated Mateus shouted. \"I will assign a direction for each of you to follow.\" He glared at the trolls as they began to grumble amongst themselves. Slowly, ever so slowly, the grumbling stopped when Mateus said. \"If anything happens to our friends because we couldn't put a search together, we will be drummed from the troll village. Everyone fell silent, giving Mateus the idea that he could finally organize a search for Chilan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" Mateus pointed to Angus, \"You will go east.\" He turned to red shirt. \"And you will go west.\" Red shirt began to complain, but Mateus's glared shut him up. When quiet resumed, Mateus looked at yellow shirt and said, \"You go south, and I will go north.\" His gaze locked onto each troll for a moment in turn. \"Okay, then, let's get going.\" <br>\r\nAs the trolls worked their way in the direction they had been assigned, Chilan looked down from high up in the locust pine where she hid among the prickly branches. <br>\r\n<i>Fools,</i> she thought. <i>They couldn't find their heads if I placed a paper bag over them.</i> <br>\r\nAs the clearing below her emptied of trolls, Chilan slowly drifted down to the ground. As her feet felt the ground under her toes, Chilan looked around. Why wouldn't they believe her, she asked herself. She meant no harm to Laura, and especially not to Steven. She felt butterflies take flight in her stomach when she thought his name. <i>Steven</i>. There they were again, the butterflies fluttering inside of her. <br>\r\nChilan had kept her feelings for Steven secret, but she knew that at some point she would be unable to control her emotions. Steven, with his grey eyes flecked with gold, his high brow suggesting superior intelligence, and the narrow chin she thought of often. But it was his wide mouth that had caught her attention. \"And those pearly white teeth that showed when he smiled,\" she mumbled. <br>\r\nShe realized that hiding her feelings meant the trolls had no idea how she felt about Steven, so why wouldn't they think she meant him harm? If only they knew, she told herself. <br>\r\nChilan could hear the trolls thrashing around in the forest. \"They're not a quiet bunch,\" she mumbled to herself. \"If they were really looking for someone they'd never find them because they so easily give their position away.\" <br>\r\nChilan took a deep breath and it looked like someone had shook out a bed sheet and let it billow into the air. She didn't like being a ghost, but she also knew that there was hope for her yet. She had heard that if she were to save the life of a troll she might be considered to be allowed to live on earth again. As a living, breathing person. She knew that would be the only way she and Steven could ever be together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1811 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Something that might even kill him?\" A conversation raged in her head. \"I wouldn't really let him be killed, or even hurt. But it would have to look realistic.

Below her, the mosaic of forest hid everything except for the noise the trolls were making. Off in the distance, Chilan saw what looked like a cliff, but as she drew nearer she realized it was a high waterfall. She hovered over it and watched as a wide silver ribbon of water moved slowly toward a headland of rocks, where it tumbled over the edge and became a misty, cloudy mass of steam. She flew lower into the falls and could see the massive boulders hidden in the mist, the terrible sharp edges that could cut a man to ribbons. A troll would be no match for something like this.<br>\r\n\"It's perfect,\" Chilan said through a smile. <br>\r\nA loud noise coming from the forest below her grabbed Chilan from her reverie and tossed her into a turbulent wind. Her gauzy body was tossed about and she became disoriented. As she regained her senses, she realized a strong storm was brewing and she had flown right into its turbulent edges. She would have to be careful or she would be the end of herself. <br>\r\nChilan continued to search for a troll she could lead to the falls, and after several minutes of searching, she saw the bright yellow material moving slowly along the edge of the ribbon. <br>\r\n\"Yes,\" that's Angus,\" she said. \"He's not the brightest bulb in the box. Poor fellow, he'll be perfect.\" <br>\r\nChilan allowed herself to hover in a tree top as she watched Angus thrashing about in the woods below her. A moment later, Angus stopped and sat on a fat rock. Pulling a red polka dot handkerchief from his pants pocket, he wiped away the sweat that had formed on his thick forehead. Chilan descended. <br>\r\n\"Hi, Angus,\" Chilan said softly as she alighted next to him. <br>\r\nAngus, seeing Chilan, slowly crawled away, sliding along on his back side. <br>\r\n\"I've been looking for you,\" he said meekly. \"We are all looking for you.\" <br>\r\n\"All of you?\" Chilan said. She had to try something to lure him, so she adapted a sensual tone to her voice.<br>\r\n\"You know, Angus,\" she cooed. \"You are the best looking of all the trolls.\" <br>\r\n\"Y-y-you don't re-rea-really mean that,\" he smiled. \"Do you?\" <br>\r\n\"Sure I do.\" She siddled closer to him. \"You must have noticed me watching you.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, no, not exactly.\" He lowered his eyes shyly. \"I mean, were you really...um, watching me?\"<br>\r\n\"I sure was.\" She smiled seductively. \"I was hoping you had noticed.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, I don't like to brag,\" Angus said. \"But a lot of women can't keep their eyes off of me.\"<br>\r\nChilan poked her forefinger into his upper arm playfully. \"You must have a lot of girlfriends.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, not too many, really,\" he said. His gaze rose to her eyes. \"You sure are pretty.\" <br>\r\n\"Why thank you, Angus.\" Chilan could feel her heart beating faster. Her plan would work, it would, she told herself as she watched a red line move up Angus's face. He was blushing and she knew she had him.<br>\r\n\"I knew it would be you who found Laura.\"<br>\r\n\"You did?\" He squared his shoulders, and said, \"I mean, I knew it would be me too.\" <br>\r\n\"But taking a short break before confronting her was a good idea.\" <br>\r\n\"It was?\" Angus said, and then frowned. \"I mean, yes, it was all part of my plan.\" <br>\r\n\"You're very smart,\" Chilan said, touching Angus's cheek. \"So your plan was to cross the waterfall and cut off Laura and the other trolls to stop them from making a mistake?\" <br>\r\nAngus stared at Chilan for a minute, then said, \"Yes, that is my plan exactly.\" <br>\r\n\"So, do you think you've rested enough?\" Chilan looked in the direction of the waterfall. \"Do you think it's time to go save Laura?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I believe it is.\" Angus slid off the fat rock and let his feet hit the ground. He grunted with the pain.  <br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Angus?\" Chilan asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I'm fine. I'm much tougher than I look.\" <br>\r\n\"I can see that,\" Chilan said. She looked in the direction of the falls. \"How did you know they were in that direction?\" she pointed.<br>\r\n\"I've spent a lot of time in these forests around here. I can find my way anywhere.\" <br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Chilan said. \"You are tougher than even I thought. But don't you think you should get going?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, I do.\" Angus turned away from Chilan and began walking in the direction of the falls. \"You better stay back here where you'll be safe,\" he said over his shoulders. \"I wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, you're right, of course, Angus.\" <br>\r\nChilan watched Angus walk quickly in the direction of the falls. A wide smile stretched across her lips.<br>\r\nIn the distance, Chilan watched a dark cloud form above the place where she knew the falls to be. Slowly, the cloud grew bigger until it nearly blocked out the sun. Everything around her began to darken, but Chilan was sure it was simply a storm brewing that had nothing to do with what was happening with the trolls. <br>\r\nShe could almost feel herself coming alive again. \"Steven,\" she mumbled and felt the butterfly wings brushing against her insides. \"Soon, Steven, we'll be together, for always.\" <br>\r\nToward the falls, rain began to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1184    <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She loved the feel of the air currents under her body as she soared through the clear sky. The wind in her face pushed her long black hair back against her head and caressed her face.<br>\r\nWhy have I not done this more often? she asked herself as she glided over the tree top shimmering in the sun. She banked left and felt herself go weightless in the breeze. A moment later, she banked right and flew out of the forest and watched the ground beneath her change from the leafy green of the forest to the white sand beaches, their jagged lines ending where the blue water began. <br>\r\nChelan loved the freedom of being up here. Up here in the clouds and the wind and the air currents she was alone, a solitary figure that was invisible to anyone who might look up. Oh, she knew she was making the normal swishing sounds, how could she not? After all, the law of physics still worked for ghosts, didn't it? She was sure of it. <br>\r\nChilan was enjoying herself so much that she nearly forgot why she was up here. But slowly her reverie was replaced by the reminder that she needed to find a troll. It was the only way to save herself and Steven. As her thoughts returned to Steven, Chilan felt the butterflies in her stomach take flight. <br>\r\n\"Love,\" Chilan mumbled. \"Where would the world be without it.\" <br>\r\nShe shook the image of Steven out of her head and concentrated on finding a troll. She reminded herself of her plan. <br>\r\nShe had to find a troll, lure him into a dangerous situation, and then swoop in and save him. Easy, peesy, extra cheesy, she told herself and giggled. \"Yes,\" she mumbled into the warm air. \"Love can make us behave in a silly way.\" <br>\r\nShe turned away from the ocean, reluctantly, and swooped back toward the forest, it's soft, power puffs of green slid by below her before long. She banked left and flew for a while, her eyes searching below for any movement. Not seeing any, Chilan banked right and soared just above the tree tops. She was beginning to think she wouldn't find a troll, but just then she saw one. <br>\r\nIt was his red checkered shirt that gave him away. Chilan watched him scurrying across the ground, his short legs churning as fast as they would go. As she watched him, Chilan had a thought. I wonder what he's running from? Is he being chased, or is he just doing wind sprints? <br>\r\nChilan decided to make a three hundred and sixty degree turn and come up behind the little fellow. Just as she completed her maneuver and was coming out of her turn, she saw it. She nearly missed it, its brown color blended in with the surrounding trees. He wasn't as fast as the troll was, but his pace was fast, more direct, and relentless. It took a moment before Chilan could identify what it was, but eventually she determined what it was that was following the little troll. <br>\r\n\"I haven't seen one of those in years,\" Chilan said through a gasp. \"Why, it's a double-breasted, brown-legged, horny-toad, roadrunner. Not the traditional road runner, oh no, this was a special species, one that was bred to be a killer. These roadrunners were called, dangerousity non-ambiguosity, headstronganous, roadrunners. They were smart, they were crafty, and they could track a man, or a troll, without any trouble. As Chilan watched the actions taking place below her, an idea blossomed in her mind. <br>\r\nThe danger she saved the troll from didn't have to be made up, fictitious, or fake. The danger could be real. As a matter of fact, it would probably be better if the danger were real. Certainly the troll would react more naturally to a real threat. <br>\r\n\"This might just work out better than I thought,\" Chilan mumbled. She took a deep breath that seemed to immediately leach out of her body, and then she banked left and made for the upper branches of a tall horse chestnut tree.<br>\r\nChilan's speed dropped quickly as she alighted on a strong upper branch where she could see both the troll and the roadrunner, it's stout beak pressing into the wind ahead of it. She tracked forward of the roadrunner and found the troll. Little red shirt was rally making tracks, his little feet were just barely touching the earth as he scurried along. Chilan knew she only had a few minutes to come up with a plan that would save the troll. But she didn't want to hurt the roadrunner. This genus were nearly extinct, and she didn't want to add to the problem of a dwindling herd of roadrunners. Especially this breed. <br>\r\nIt was the sound of the water falls that gave her the plan she would use. <br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Chilan pumped her fist into the air. \"It will work, I know it will.\" She gave one final pump of her nearly transparent fist and flew into the sunlight, disappearing in its rays. <br>\r\nDown below, running along the forest floor, the red shirted troll continued to scamper. He ran along fallen logs, hoping to hide his scene by not touching the ground. Jumping down from the logs, he ran through sage brush, wild roses, and onion plants that had been growing untouched for years. But he was beginning to tire. He could feel the energy in his legs beginning to give out. His breaths were beginning to come in gasps. His forehead was slick with sweat.  He wanted to stop and rest, just for a minute, just to catch his breath, but the sounds coming from behind him gave his the energy to keep going. <br>\r\nRed-shirt was a hunter troll, and he knew all about the species of roadrunner pursuing him. He knew, for instance, that the dangerousity, ambiguousity, roadrunner could run for days. He also knew that if that genus of roadrunner were to catch him, it would mean his end. These roadrunners, while nearly extinct, would run until they dropped once they had gotten the scent of a troll. Red shirt felt fearful by the knowledge of what would transpire if he were caught. But that knowledge was also the impetus for his pushing himself to the limit. <br>\r\n\"If'n I coulda just a minute take for a breaff,\" red shirt said. \"that's a mean i'm a good fur to run mooa.\" A dead log lay on the ground ahead of old red shirt, and it would suspend him above the ground for forty feet. Red shirt made a dash for the log jumped up on one end, and then scampered along the rotting bark,  his feet and legs a blur as he sped along. When red shirt jumped down from the other end of the rotting log, he dared a glance back over his shoulder, and he could see the roadrunner's head bobbing up and down as he tore after him. <br>\r\nChilan knew she had to hurry if her plan was to work. She formed herself into a narrow line, like an arrow, so that she became more aerodynamic. With less wind resistance she was able to pick up speed and zoomed along quickly. She couldn't remember the last time she had gone so fast. <br>\r\nZoooommmmmm, she went, flying soundlessly through the air. She had to make a slight course correction but once she did she found herself right behind old red shirt. \"One final adjustment, Chilan,\" she mumbled. \"And then you've got him.\" <br>\r\nAs Chilan flew over the ground at break neck speed, she opened her mouth and waited until the last possible moment, and then she struck. Grasping red shirt by his suspenders, Chilan closed her mouth around the little guy. She heard his scream as she soared up into the sky. She wanted to tell him that he was safe, at least for the time being, but if she opened her mouth the troll would fall to earth. Chilan didn't even want to think about what old red shirt would look like when he splattered against the ground. She had no choice but to allow him to believe that he was in mortal danger. And in away, Chilan told herself, he is in mortal danger. <br>\r\nChilan swooped high into the sky with a screaming red shirt dangling from her closed and locked jaw. She thought that if she tracked back over the dangerous roadrunner, old red shirt would be able to see that Chilan was only trying to help. She banked hard left and drifted into a one hundred and eighty degree turn, and was soon gliding past the roadrunner. The roadrunner had stopped his pursuit and was staring up at Chilan.<br>\r\n\"I'll bet you're hoping I drop him,\" Chilan mumbled, careful not to open her mouth and drop old red shirt. From his position directly in front of Chilan's eyes, old red shirt stared at Chilan. He blinked, and his Adams Apple bobbed in his throat when he swallowed. He blinked again and a smile slowly stretched across his lips. Chilan was sure he understood that she was only trying to help him. But old red shirt put that thought to rest when he reached back behind his head and then drove his finger into Chilan's eyes. <br>\r\nChilan couldn't believe what was happening. Her screech must have been heard all over the forest. <br>\r\nDang, that hurt, she told herself needlessly, after all, she had felt it so she knew it hurt without her having to tell herself that it did. <br>\r\nChilan, now looking through only one eye, soared high to the top of the horse chestnut tree where she had sat earlier. She gently released old red shirt and waited while he found his balance. <br>\r\nRed shirt looked down at the ground so far away. \"You,me a gotta me outa here,\" he said, his voice soft and earnest. \"I cnat live so uppity her. too uppity forme to stay.\" <br>\r\nChilan shook her head, and said, \"Do you have a better plan?\" <br>\r\nOld red shirt nodded his head vigorously, and said, \"youza betcha.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1707  <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chilan soared high above the tree tops looking for a troll she could lead to danger, so that she could save him and return to a living, breathing, flesh and blood human again. It was the only way she could be with Steven again, and she was willing to try anything. <br>\r\nAs his name passed through her thoughts, Chilan felt the butterflies in her stomach take flight. Her skin warmed and it felt like a thousand bees were stinging her. \"If this is what love feels like,\" she mumbled into the cool air around her, \"maybe I should just leave it alone.\" <br>\r\nBut Chilan knew she wouldn't leave it alone. She wanted to experience love again, the feelings of having someone care about you, knowing that you mattered, knowing that you were important to someone. <br>\r\nAs she let herself drift with the air currents, Chilan thought back to when she was in love; with him. Oh, how wonderful it was to feel that most sacred of emotions. <br>\r\nSure, you had to put the other person first, always their wants and desires put before yours. It was a feeling she craved more than anything.<br>\r\nShe thought about how, when you were in love, you thought of the other person first. Some people called it sacrifice, but she never felt like it was a sacrifice when she made sure he was happy. She didn't think of it as a chore when he came home from work and his back and neck hurt and she'd spend an hour massaging his sore muscles. No, letting her hands slide across his warm skin was never a chore. <br>\r\nAs she drifted along with the clouds, Chilan rummaged back through her memories. The lane surrounding the lake of her memories was gauzy, as if a fine mist of rain, or maybe fog, had obscured her older memories. But she finally broke through and there they were, clear as a bell or a summer afternoon sky. <br>\r\nShe remembered the night they met, and how they nearly didn't. <br>\r\nIt had been a long day, and all she could think about as she made her way home was how much she wanted to crawl into a tub of hot sudsy water and sip a cool glass of the red wine her Italian neighbor made in his basement. Sure, it was strong, and it didn't take much for her to get a buzz from drinking it. But tonight a buzz was exactly what she thought she needed. <br>\r\nAn hour later, Chilan lay in a tub full of hot, sudsy water. The tub was long, but shallow and her knees poked up out of the water like two small volcanic islands. Two scented candles filled the bathroom with their sweet smell. She had one arm draped over the curved edge of the tub, the other held the  stem of a wine glass that was half full. As she lay there she felt the days troubles evaporate.<br>\r\nShe nearly shot straight out of the tub when the phone rang/ <br>\r\n\"Chilan,\" Tilly's excited voice filled the phone's receiver. \"You have to help me, you just have to.\" <br>\r\nChilan took a long, deep breath and said, \"Tilly, how are you?\" Her attempt at calming her friend down were wasted. Something important was going on in Tilly's world, and it had all of her attention. Chilan knew it would be best to just go along and let her friend follow the script she had probably been practicing all day. <br>\r\n\"What's so important that I have to help you with?\" Chilan said.<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God.\" Tilly said each word distinctly. \"He is so beautiful. I can't wait for you to meet him.\" <br>\r\n\"But why do you need me for that?\" Chilan asked. \"I mean, if he wants to go out with you he'll ask. If he doesn't ask you, then you ask him. It's the 2000's, my girl friend, it's okay for a girl to ask a guy out.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, I know, Chilan,\" Tilly said, disappointment filling her words. \"It's just that he won't go out with anyone because his cousin is in town and he doesn't want to leave him on his own. He doesn't know anyone around here.\" <br>\r\n\"So what exactly do you want me to do?\" Chilan asked. She knew the answer to her question. She had only asked it so that she'd have time to think of an excuse.<br>\r\n\"Well, it 's simple, actually, Chilan.\" Tilly's voice had suddenly slowed down. Intrepid was the word that came to Chilan's thoughts. \"I can get my guy to ask me out, but you would have to be with his cousin.\" <br>\r\nChilan could picture Tilly's fingers tightly wrapped around her phone, her knuckles white. <br>\r\n\"Not a blind date?\" Chilan said. \"You know I hate blind dates.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, but my guy is so beautiful. And I just know you'll like his cousin.\" <br>\r\nChilan had let out a long, loud exhale, hoping Tilly would get the subtle hint that Chilan wasn't interested. But Tilly missed the cue. <br>\r\n\"Do these guys have names?\" Chilan asked. <br>\r\n\"Of course they have names, silly,\" Tilly said. \"Everybody has a name. Why would you think I would date someone who doesn't have a name?\" <br>\r\nChilan wanted to interrupt Tilly to tell her that yes, she knew the guys had names. But interrupting Tilly meant that when Tilly resumed the story she would have to begin all over again at the beginning. So Chilan just went with it. <br>\r\n\"Okay, Tilly, I'm glad they have names.\" Chilan rested her head against the curved edge of the tub. \"Can you tell me what their names are?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course I can,\" Tilly said and paused. When Chilan said nothing, Tilly finally said. \"Oh, you want to know their names, right?\"<br>\r\n\"That would be nice, Tilly,\" Chilan said. \"It might be easier to talk to my date if I know his name.\" <br>\r\n\"So you'll do it?\" Tilly's voice squealed so loud Chilan had to hold the phone away from her ear. \"Oh, goodie, goodie, gum drops.\"<br>\r\n\"The names, Tilly,\" Chilan said, \"What are their names.?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, that,\" Tilly said in her sing song voice. \"Your guy's name is Freddie. My guy's name if Steven.\" <br>\r\nChilan hated the name Freddie. As she felt the warm water swirl around her, she took another sip of the velvety wine. The last thing she wanted to do was get out of the tub and go meet some guy who said his name was Freddie. But Tilly was a good friend and it has been a long time since her break up with Greg. Greg was an abuser, a loser, and a hoser. The guy had broken Tilly's heart and it had taken he a long time before she was willing to go out with anyone. Was it really too much to ask from a friend? Go out with a guy named Freddie so Tilly could go out with a guy named Steven. <br>\r\nChilan pressed the phone to her ear. \"Okay, what time and where will we meet?\" <br>\r\n\"You are the bestest of friends, Chilan,\" Tilly squealed into the phone. \"We can meet at your place at eight. Is that okay?\" <br>\r\nChilan looked one more time at her glass of wine, dipped her fingers into the warm water, and sighed. \"Sure, Tilly, eight o'clock at my place. I'll be with Freddie. But you owe me, big time.\" <br>\r\n\"I can't wait,\" Tilly shouted into the phone. \"I love you. I love you. I love you.\" <br>\r\nChilan put down the phone and let her body ease back into water that was quickly becoming cold. \"Yes, you certainly do owe me,\" she mumbled. <br>\r\nOf course, Chilan had no way of knowing that Tilly would repay her favor, and soon. And she had no way of knowing right then that the favor Tilly returned would cost her and Chilan their friendship. <br>\r\nChilan sighed loudly and stood in the tub and lines of water ran down her warm skin and into the tub. Stepping out, she wrapped a towel around herself and left the bathroom.<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" she mumbled as she pulled the towel tighter around herself. \"Tilly gets the guy name Steven, and I get the Freddie. Sometimes life just isn't fair.\" <br>\r\nAn hour later there was a knock at Chilan's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1384 <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/checkg.png\" alt=\"*Checkg*\" title=\"Checkg\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
