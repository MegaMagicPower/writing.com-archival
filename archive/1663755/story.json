It boggled the now 10 year old reploid's mind. Although X didn't recall ever being a child, he seemed to him that this was case. With each second, his armor felt looser and looser. Some of it fell of and hit the ground! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor boy was frightened, as he now reached seven years of \"age.\" This wasn't age as robots saw it, however, but rather age has human's <br>\r\nway of looking at \"age.\" As far as he knew, he was still the same age he was before but simply modeled after a human at a certain age. Though the sudden feeling that he had flesh made him wonder how much of him was mechanical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis regression finally stopped at eight months old. X was lying on his back in his oversized helmet naked and crying, the rest of his now oversized armor surrounding him. He was confused as to what just happened, yet he knew it wasn't necessarily a good thing. The world around him seemed much bigger and scarier, which caused him to cry more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he saw_______ walking towards him. </span></div></div>",

This couldn't be right, since the only beings on this base were reploids, and there was no such thing as a baby reploid, right? Nonetheless, the red chrome plated reploid followed the source of the sound and couldn't believe his eyes. Lying on the ground was a naked baby boy with short, brown, messy hair and crying his eyes. The infant was lying in what appeared to be X's helmet and was surrounded by his armor. Zero could only conclude the worst possible outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"X!?\" Zero exclaimed as he picked the boy up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero then proceeded to try and calm X down by rocking him in his arms and shushing him. Thankfully that worked. Suddenly, X began to.......pee on Zero!? Zero never knew reploids could urinate like normal humans, or could they? Whatever the case, he was still disgusted by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross!\" Zero held X far in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX then looked at what he was doing and was surprised at what he was doing, He then looked at Zero's reaction and giggled. Finally, X stopped peeing. Zero sighed and looked at X. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do with you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nX simply smiled and sucked his thumb. Zero smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are kinda cute,\" Zero poked X's little nose, causing the baby to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then pondered what to do with X. As far as he knew, there were no diapers or baby care supplies on the base. Also, what would his comrades think? X, their most valued maverick hunter, was now a baby. This sure wasn't going to go over lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then decided to...</span></div></div>",

Dada.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that X looked up to him a lot, but he always thought of it as a mentor-student and/or brother like relationship, not a father and son one. Did X really see it like this, or is it just X's infantile state that was causing this? He decided to let it go for now and focus on getting to the command room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he arrived, he was greeted by odd glances from Alia and Signas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zero, why do you have a baby in your arms?\" Signas inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, this baby is X,\" Zero replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia and Signas were stunned. Was it even possible for reploids to be babies? This was all rather puzzling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's.....X!?\" Alia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero nodded and handed X to Alia. She looked at the smiling infant in her arms and fully realized that the baby was indeed X. Though the prospect of their best maverick hunter being reduced to an infant was nearly terrifying, she couldn't help but smile at the adorable child in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least he's a cutie,\" Alia poked X's little nose, causing the baby boy to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX then hugged Alia in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama,\" X babbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia was shocked by what the infant called her, but she couldn't help but smile at X.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, he thinks I'm his mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero blushed at that statement, but then quickly regained his composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First.things first, we need to get some supplies to care for X until he's back to normal,\" Zero stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSignas replied by saying......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
