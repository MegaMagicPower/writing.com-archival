Seemed like someone forgot it's clothes on the couch.<br>\r\nTomomi, or Timo (for Tiny Tomo) as her friends loved to call her, just came back from a grueling world tour with her band Scandal and all this traveling, running, playing and singing in front of a different country for six months took its toll on her body.<br>\r\nHer usually skinny body got even smaller and leaner, she was always tired and felt like sleeping when she was in a band meeting.<br>\r\nBut the tiredness was worth it, as they just celebrated the 10th anniversary of the band, and had the most heart warming welcome in their home country.<br>\r\nShe stood there for an hour, not moving, looking at the wall in front of her, lost inside her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--    --    --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long time, she finally decided to reach her phone to order some food.<br>\r\nShe was famished, she ordered her usual meal and added some extras.<br>\r\nTimo was so tired that she ordered on the first restaurant that came, and passed out, waiting for the delivery man to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----        ----        -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door bell rang. <br>\r\nTomo jumped from her sleep, and emerged from her clothes.<br>\r\nShe stumbled her way to the door and opened it.<br>\r\n\"Ogawa-san? Asked the delivery guy.<br>\r\n- Hai!<br>\r\n- Here's your food miss.<br>\r\nThe guy hands her three huge black bags with a light red logo that showed a sumo enjoying a Ramen, it said Fat Sumo. <br>\r\n- Wait, did I really order all that?<br>\r\nThe guy check his note :\" A huge Tonkotsu Ramen, with extras noodles, a can of beer and extra fried donuts.<br>\r\n- Fried Donuts?<br>\r\n- That's a bonus from the restaurant for the new customers. FFD *Free Fried Donuts*<br>\r\n- Okay! Arrigato anyway.<br>\r\n- Arrigato, and bon appetit.\"<br>\r\nAs she closed the door with her foot, he arms full of bags, the smell of the FFD crossed her nose. Her eyes opened wide, she never smell something like that before.<br>\r\nShe put the bag on a table, and got a bite of that wonderful donuts, and what a donuts. </span></div></div>",
