They were wearing their lucky charm, a stone with light blue markings later revealed to be the Yeti's Heart (You'll find out what that is later) In order to exit the Triangle the character will have to travel through each realm (In the order from above) and collect each realm's relic before being able to return home safely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story is only optional and doesn't have to be followed, there will be routes in each realm that doesn't involve the story at all (Meaning the Yeti's Heart will in fact be in Bermuda not on earth)<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSo, with all the confusing explanations out of the way which realm would you dare enter?
