As one or both of them were usually present most nights, this offered the 17 year old teenager a rare opportunity of freedom. She wasted no time in calling her three closest friends over for an impromptu slumber party. The four of them had been planning on getting together like this for a while, but until now they hadn't had the chance. The group hadn't had a chance to get wild in a long time, so this had been a long time coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At school that day, the four had decided that the night's activity would be strip poker. Despite being close friends, most of them had never seen the others in so much as underwear before. Kaylee certainly hadn't. So it seemed like a bit of naughty fun. What would come of it? None of them knew, and that's the way they liked it. The night was young and everything was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kaylee Jacobson:</b> a rather pretty high school junior. Her hair is a shoulder length rich, dark brown, and her chest an ample c-cup. She's sociable and sometimes a bit bratty, but not overly bitchy about it. She's pretty and she knows it, but she is the most loyal of friends, and nice to those that know her.<br>\r\n<b>Clothing:</b> white tennis shoes, socks, a white outer blouse, a light pink under-blouse, a pair of stylish slim cut jeans, black lace bra, black lace panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Zoe Adams:</b> A fun-loving, busty redhead. Zoe is a bit on the ditzy and flirty side, but she's nevertheless friendly. She is likely the most comfortable with her body of all the girls. She is an easy d-cup, and she wears her hair in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<b>Clothing:</b> high heeled shoes, black stockings, silk button-up shirt, a knee-length black skirt, hot pink bra, hot pink thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tanya Jackson:</b> An athletic, intelligent black teen. Tanya is a scholar athlete and ivy league hopeful. Despite running track, she still has a very feminine frame with c-cup breasts and a very shapely ass. She's likely the most uptight of the group when it comes to matters like this. Despite her shyness, though, she is dedicated and can get fiercely competitive.<br>\r\n<b>Clothing:</b> fur-lined boots, athletic socks, white jacket, sleeveless purple shirt, form fitting jeans, purple bra, purple panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Carmen Valdez:</b> A petite Latina, Carmen is the thrill seeker of the group. She likes driving fast cars, bungee jumping and whatever else to get her adrenalin fix. Her body is on the smaller side, with b-cup boobs. And while she has a nice ass, it isn't as shapely as Tanya's.<br>\r\n<b>Clothing:</b> tennis shoes, socks, red sweater, white cotton tanktop, jeans, red bra, red panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However, these four girls are not entirely alone in the house. There is one other occupant. This person was not invited to the slumber party, but they are about to become involved in ways they never would have imagined. This person's name is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Michael Jacobson:</b> Kaylee's younger brother. Michael is 16 and a sophomore in high school. He and Kaylee get along but don't spend much time together. Michael is much more focused on his future than having fun. Michael is well-read, but not a total shut-in. He can be distracted, it's just not as easy as with some guys.<br>\r\n<b>Clothing:</b> tennis shoes, socks, open button up shirt, t-shirt, jeans, boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tyler Jacobson:</b> Kaylee's much younger brother. At nine years old, Tyler has just started middle school. He's only just starting to notice girls, and even still he's very confused about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<b>Clothing:</b> baseball cap, tennis shoes, socks, t-shirt, jeans, briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Alyssa Jacobson:</b> Kaylee's younger sister. Alyssa is 15 and a freshman in high school. While her sister went the popular sociable route, Alyssa became something more of a nerd. Alyssa is a gamer and geeky trivia buff. She's sarcastic and laid back, but can be rattled by embarrassing situations.<br>\r\n<b>Clothing:</b> zip-up hoodie, tennis shoes, socks, t-shirt, jeans, sky blue bra, sky blue panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amanda Jacobson:</b> Kaylee's much younger sister. At eight years old, Amanda is still in third grade. She's entirely innocent to the erotic undertones of the game. She idolizes her older sister and wants to be just like her when she grows up.<br>\r\n<b>Clothing:</b> baby Nikes, socks, choker, overalls, t-shirt, panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Noriko Yamada:</b> A Japanese exchange student living at Kaylee's house, Noriko is extremely shy, but also extremely nice and friendly. Being highly introverted, she doesn't make friends easily, but she can be determined when she sets her mind to something.<br>\r\n<b>Clothing:</b> black shoes, white socks, blue cardigan, white blouse, plaid skirt, white cotton bra, white cotton panties.</span></div></div>",

Things have been going well so far, and he sees no reason that he won't do well when the time comes. He knows his sister is having people over, her usual friends most likely. He plans to stay out of her way, and just let them do their thing. Sure, they might be cute, but whatever they're doing it probably isn't even worth bothering about. He has other things to do, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Michael is not a bad looking guy. His family has good genes. Of course, his social star has always been eclipsed by his sister's. Not that he's ever cared, the limelight was never something Michael shot for. He and his sister simply had different priorities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, the sound of breaking glass comes from downstairs, and Michael is shaken from his studying stupor. Thinking he should probably see what happened and if everyone is okay, Michael leaves his room and heads down the staircase to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His father's card table sits at the center of the room, and his sister's three friends; Zoe, Tanya and Carmen sit around it. Kaylee is nearby, sweeping the shards of a broken glass into a dustpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What happened?\" He asks, vaguely concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...hey, Mike. It's nothing. Just dropped this stupid glass. It's already taken care of, no need to go bitching about making a mess while the folks are away,\" Kaylee replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey I wasn't going to bitch. Just checking in,\" He finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Heeey, Mikey,\" Zoe says, with a flirty grin his way. He begins to wonder what's up with the cards and the card table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So...what are you guys up to tonight, anyway?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...well...we-\" Kaylee stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We're playing strip poker!\" Zoe says excitedly, before breaking into giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He feels his eyebrows shoot up in spite of himself. That certainly wasn't the answer Michael expected. Unbidden, images of his sister and her friends and various states of undress fly through his mind. He inwardly curses. How is he supposed to focus on his studies when he knows that a floor below women are slowly getting undressed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You knooow...\" Zoe says wistfully. \"You could join us if you want, Mikey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What!?\" Kaylee says. \"You want to play strip poker with my <i>brother</i>!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, he may be <i>your</i> brother, Kay, but to me he is just a boy, and frankly this game could use a little extra flavor. I mean, sure seeing you girls naked sounds like all kinds of fun, but I think I'd be even more interested with the prospect of throwing a dick into the mix,\" Zoe says, grinning. Michael feels himself blush a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I think I'm going to second Zoe's motion here. We need a guy in here!\" Carmen adds. Kaylee looks at Tanya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, don't look at me. This wasn't my idea, and if we're going to do this whole stereotypical strip poker thing, I don't see why we shouldn't invite a guy,\" Tanya says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...it looks like I've been outvoted. Mike, the chair is there if you want it. Just try not to stare too much,\" Kaylee says somewhat reluctantly, pointing out an empty seat as she sits down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Michael isn't entirely sure what to think. There's no way he could go back to studying now. Not with this on the brain. Feeling a bit nervous, Michael sits down at the chair to the cheers of Zoe and Carmen. The cards are handed out and Michael looks at his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hand:</b> 10 (clubs), 6 (spades), Jack (spades), 10 (diamonds), 8 (clubs)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Clothing Remaining:</b> tennis shoes, socks, open button up shirt, t-shirt, jeans, boxers.</span></div></div>",

So what if Kaylee's friends so my baloney pony.</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much.  Does the loser get to pick what they discard?\" Michael asks in a defeatist tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee looks over the cards with a grimace.  \"Yes.  But you're not the loser.  Or at least you don't have the lowest hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIchael checks everyone's hand and sees she is right.  Kaylee has a busted inside straight and flush draw and everyone else has at least a pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIchael lightly grins.  \"Okay.

Kaylee decides to make taking it off as interesting as possible by having Zoe take off her shoes as Mike came back with his English notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd object to your studying during the game, but as long as its when I\"m not stripping, I'm okay with it,\" Zoe said to the returning Jacobson sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee sits back down.  \"And don't slow the game,\" she added as the cards are dealt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" he answered and dog-ears a page to check his hand and his eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hand</b>: King (hearts), 2 (hearts), King (spades), 8 (hearts), King (diamonds)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Clothing Remaining</b>: tennis shoes, socks, open button up shirt, t-shirt, jeans, boxers</span></div></div>",

It's risky, but it's not much riskier than the heart flush.  Unfortunately, what he draws doesn't get him either way, as he pulls a spade (4), a heart (6), and then a king (diamonds).  Well, at least now he knows it wouldn't've matter no matter what he'd gone for, and now he has a king high instead of a jack high.  That would just have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it does seem to pull through as the others reveal their cards.  Carmen had managed to pull an ace high club flush, but it was wasted this round as the entire rest of the group had nothing.  But, with only a mere 8 high, Kaylee had the nothingest of nothings and removed her other shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" said Kaylee.  \"Now that things are heating up, how about this?

Her breasts weren't exactly her best feature, but her bubble butt was something to talk about. Not quite as big as Tanya's but perfectly formed with just the right amount of padding. Angling herself so he had a good view of her backside, she unsnapped her jeans and wriggled them to the ground as sexily as possible. Based on Michael's expression, it seemed to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer red panties were high cut, coming around in the back to perfectly accentuate the curves of her rear end. She winked playfully at Michael, making sure to stick her butt out as far as possible when she bent over to pick up her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Carmen, I never would have invited a boy to this shindig if I knew he would hog all the attention.

Claire and I are helping Melissa get her grades up in English.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it made sense to Kaylee. Claire Ondario had been Michael's close friend since she moved to town in seventh grade. Well, almost since then. At first Michael was frustrated to suddenly have competition for honors he was used to beating everyone else for. Especially since, having skipped second grade, Claire was a year younger than him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa Silverberg was probably who the group was really for. It's not that she was stupid, she was actually a science whiz, but she struggled in English and now her grades might keep her from getting into the city's prestigious math and science magnet program. Kaylee suspected her brother had a little bit of a crush on Melissa, and that the study group was a ploy to spend more time with her, but in the process he risked her ending up at a different school halfway across town. She knew what she had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, they were supposed to come over after Claire got off work. I kind of forgot because um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the thought of seeing so many fine specimens of young womanhood in their undergarments and maybe less tends to have that affect on an adolescent boy?\" Zoe finished for him, thrusting her bra-encased chest out as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah... um... that,\" Michael stammered, remembering to focus on her face. Um, I'll just tell them something came up and I can't study tonight. I'm sure Claire can help Melissa out over at her place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" Kaylee insisted. \"Zoe, we can fit two more in here can't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it would start to get crowded with seven, I think-\" Zoe started, before she caught her friend's look. \"Actually, no that's fine, we'll just play with two decks. The more the merrier! And the hornier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's- weird. Especially with Claire. I'll just go out there and take care of this then I'll be back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Do whatever, little brother. But I've seen Claire and Melissa and I don't think this is an opportunity you should pass up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he headed for the front door, Michael heard Kaylee call Zoe and Carmen towards her and whispered something.

She was short, and her thick brown hair was woven into a single braid down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, sorry we're late. It took longer than I expected to close up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate, um, I hadn't notice,\" Michael replied, truthfully. \"Look, here's the thing I can't study tonight, because um-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then he heard Carmen's voice booming from across the room, \"MIIIIIICHAAEELLL, I wanted to ask you where-\" as she rounded the corner she let out a staged EEEEEEEKKKK and her hands shot to cover the front of her panties. It fooled Claire and Melissa, who were of course caught off guard, but Michael knew this was somehow Kaylee's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, wow, Michael is that your sister's friend Carmen?\" Claire nervously stammered. \"I just- wow, way to go I mean I totally understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

I mean you have your test on Friday and there's still so much to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, it's fine. I'm doing great, you guys have been a huge help. Look, my mom gave me this huge speech just yesterday about how I spend so much time working on my projects she's worried I'll forget to be a teenager. And I'm gonna guess you're not much different. We can study tomorrow, tonight, let's have fun, and maybe even see some cute boys-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Carmen interrupted, \"just the one boy, sorry. He's really cute though and I can't wait to see his wiener!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael turned crimson. Of all the people to say that around, why did it have to be Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, it still sounds fun! Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire tugged on her friends arm. \"Melissa, can I talk to you, um in private, before we do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.

Although this was the moment she had been building to, it felt weird to finally be going through with it. In motion she whipped her bra from her body and twirled it around her head, whooping like a crazy person. Throwing it aside she sprung up, calling out, \"who wants to get a feel of these all-natural babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee and Carmen immediately agreed. Tanya hesitated, but followed her friends. While she touched briefly, the other two gave long appreciative feels, Kaylee ending hers by lightly tweaking Zoe's nipple. Her friend gasped, then stuck out her tongue. Next, Zoe turned to Mark. \"C'mon, mister, after all fair is fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm not sure what you mean by that this-\" he went silent, and wasn't the only person to gasp, as Zoe reached out and cupped his boxer-clad crotch. \"Well, I guess fair is fair then.\" He couldn't believe what was happening as his outstretched hand made contact with his sister's good friend's world-class chest, then settled for an explorative feel. When he pulled away, Zoe leaned in and her lips briefly brushed his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GROOOOSSSS!\" his sister groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she felt obliged to offer a chance to Claire and Melissa. The former declined, but the latter not only copped a feel, she took the chance to snake a hand up the back of Zoe's skirt and caress her but. \"So you really are naked under there,\" Melissa grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" Zoe snorted. I like this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire won with a straight. \"Payback,\" was all she said to Melissa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the situation was worse for the shorter girl. Her shirt came down only slightly past the waist of her pants, meaning whatever she chose, she would be showing her underwear. Deciding that a t-shirt and panties would look better than a bra and baggie jeans, she chose to keep her top half covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact her jeans were falling off her the second she undid the snap, she tried her best to sexily wiggle out of them. Underneath she had on a pair of boy shorts covered in rainbow stripes, with a bit of pink lace around the leg holes. She got a little knock-kneed and seemed unsure whether or not to try to cover herself, but worked up the courage to do a little twirl for the group before sitting down.

His sister lost with a pair of fours, meaning she would finally have to reveal some underwear. Despite what a good sport she'd been, this seemed to set something off in her, and she started to protest. But one look from Zoe shut her mouth, and she meekly pulled her camisole over her head. Her black bra had patterns of roses worked into the lace, with white scalloping to set off the edges of the cups. She pouted, and covered her chest with her arms for a minute before returning to her usual cheerful self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya won the hand with a flush. \"Zoe! Strip!\" she blurted out, then instantly regretted. Had she just drawn a target on her back? She was still fully clothed and intended to stay that way. \"No, wait, can I-\" she tried to correct herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, too late,\" was her friend's response. Before Tanya could say anything else, Zoe was on her feet. She reached down for the top of her left stocking, but an idea struck her. She put her left foot on her chair, and pulled her skirt back to begin lowering her stocking. Of course this meant the whole room had a clear view right up her skirt, something Zoe was pretending not to notice. Her pussy was on full display, and her fiery red bush shaved into... was that a heart?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe repeated the procedure with her right stocking. As she pulled it off, she looked up at her shocked audience, clapped her hands down so her skirt covered her, and playfully screeched, \"ooooomiiiigoooood, I'm almost naked! Alright, new rule because I'm the judge and I say so! The winner of a hand can't strip someone of their last article of clothing. You have to lose on your own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen and Michael weren't eager for the game to end, and immediately agreed. Claire seemed ready to object, but her friend placed her hand over hers and her mouth closed. That left Tanya and Kaylee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, Zoe. I said I was gonna stay clothed and that's what I'm gonna do. If I get a chance to take you out, I'm gonna do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, c'mon, Jackson. You've been such a good sport so far. Work with me here.\" And Tanya was pleased with herself for going so far into this game, even if she had been lucky up to this point. It was probably good for her to let it get a little further. She agreed to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee was a tougher sell. The frustration of having to expose her bra earlier in the round came back, and she snapped at Kaylee, \"you kept trying to speed things up and now that you're the one whose naked butt is on the line you want to slow things down. Not happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, jeez, Kaylee. You really think after the show I just gave you guys I'm worried about my modesty! This is about keeping a good time going! Don't be such a baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'd prefer to have Tanya join me in showing a little more skin, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the moment Tanya had been dreading. Screwing up her courage, she slowly reached for the hem of her pullover. Eyes scrunched up, she couldn't see the faces trained on her as she raised the garment, gradually revealing her purple bra embroider with tiny pink flowers and pink ruffles lining the cups, bought special for tonight. It was the first 'sexy' underwear she had ever owned, and only at the last minute had she gotten up the courage to wear it. She kept her eyes squeezed shut for a full minute after the shirt was over her head. Only then did it dawn on her to cover herself. Shrieking, she pulled her arms across her chest, but not before catching an appreciative look from Michael. It emboldened her, and for a second she tried lowering her arms, but decided that was definitely to much and left them wrapped tightly around her upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's cards: 3 (hearts) 4 (clubs) 5 (hearts) 6 (clubs) 7 (spades) 9 (clubs) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">white tennis shoes, socks, a white outer blouse, a light pink under-blouse</span>, a pair of stylish slim cut jeans, black lace bra, black lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">high heeled shoes, black stockings, silk button-up shirt</span>, a knee-length black skirt, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">hot pink bra, hot pink thong</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya's clothes remaining:<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"> fur-lined boots, athletic socks, white jacket, sleeveless purple shirt</span>, form fitting jeans, purple bra, purple panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes, socks, red sweater, white cotton tanktop, jeans</span>, red bra, red panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes, socks,open button up shirt</span>, t-shirt, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">jeans</span>, boxers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">black heels</span>, opaque white tights, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">black jacket, black pencil skirt</span>, white blouse, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">white half-slip</span>, bra, panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's clothing remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">flip-flops, red zip-up sweatshirt, baggy jeans</span>, science t-shirt, bra, rainbow-striped panties</span></div></div>",

She turned white. \"Seriously, I can't believe you talked me into this,\" she hissed at Melissa. Shaky hands pulled open the buttons of her blouse one by one, with Claire trying her best to keep front completely closed. Finally, she was done. For a second she pulled the open sides tight around her, then in one jerky, nervous motion she threw her top off and let it smack against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when it became clear why she had been so nervous to play. Only lightly developed, her bra was one she had clearly owned since she first need one. The lightweight material was a sunny blue and adorned with smiley faces. \"It's not that I'm flat,\" she stammered. \"I don't care. Boobs would just slow me down as a runner, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true,\" said Tanya. \"She's one of our best sprinters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" She was trying her hardest not to look at Michael, who was in turn trying his hardest not to stare at her chest. \"It's just... look I have better bras... less... girly ones, but it was laundry day, and well, nobody really told me I'd be playing strip poker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Zoe interrupted, looking the girl up and down. \"I can't really say I care that much about your underwear when your body looks like that.\" Although her tights remained completely opaque, without her shirt blocking them they now had a full on view of her long, slender legs leading up to a tiny, but thoroughly tight butt and the perfectly flat stomach above it. Michael had been swimming with Claire before, but he'd never realized what a beauty she was. \"But why'd you take off your top? You could have kept better covered if you had ditched the tights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... um...\" she giggled, to her surprise enjoying all the attention her body was getting. \"The um... panties... are.. probably worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...\" was all Zoe could respond with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe turned out to be the winner of the hand with a straight flush. As expected, she set her sights on Tanya. Removing her jeans seemed to go easier for the shy girl. Her panties turned out to be the same shade of purple as her bra but simpler, with lust a little bit of pink trim around the waistband and down the sides. Once she'd got her pants off though, she reverted, scurrying back into her seat and pulling her legs up against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's cards: 2 (diamonds) 3 (diamonds) 4 (clubs)  9 (clubs) A (diamonds) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">white tennis shoes, socks, a white outer blouse, a light pink under-blouse</span>, a pair of stylish slim cut jeans, black lace bra, black lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">high heeled shoes, black stockings, silk button-up shirt</span>, a knee-length black skirt, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">hot pink bra, hot pink thong</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya's clothes remaining:<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"> fur-lined boots, athletic socks, white jacket, sleeveless purple shirt, form fitting jeans</span>, purple bra, purple panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes, socks, red sweater, white cotton tanktop, jeans</span>, red bra, red panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes, socks,open button up shirt</span>, t-shirt, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">jeans</span>, boxers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">black heels</span>, opaque white tights, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">black jacket, black pencil skirt, white blouse, white half-slip</span>, girly bra, panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's clothing remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">flip-flops, red zip-up sweatshirt, baggy jeans</span>, science t-shirt, bra, rainbow-striped panties</span></div></div>",

Carmen lost the hand with a pair of fives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, I guess this is the moment you've all been waiting for.\" She stood up, and to everyone's surprise began toying with the waistband of her hi-cut panties. Slowly she eased them down in the back until the full expanse of her bubble butt was on display. Then she yanked them back up. \"Ha ha, just kidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No faiiiiir!\" Zoe moaned. Instead, Carmen reached behind her back and undid the clasp of her bra. She let the straps fall and held the garment again briefly against her chest before tossing it aside. \"Ta da!\" She giggle. Sticking her chest out she asked, \"anybody want a feel? They may not be as magnificent as Zoe's but I don't think they're too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly, Zoe reached across the table and grabbed a handful of her friends boob. Everyone took a turn feeling her chest, with Michael the last. As her cupped her breast, she reached down and brushed her hand across his crotch. \"Whoa! Someone's enjoying themselves. But then again, what teenage boy wouldn't want a room full of half-naked girls to himself.\" Michael blushed and pulled his hand away. Like Zoe before her, Carmen then leaned in and pecked him gingerly on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys, seeerriously,\" Kaylee pouted, at this point more in jest than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was the winner of the hand. She looked around the room before settling on Claire. The younger girl flinched. \"Sorry kid. What you said made me wanna know. How much worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omigod I knew I should have said anything! Um... if I just like, pull my tights down and show you, can I maybe keep them for just a little while longer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! Them's the rules. Now strip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, nervously, Claire began peeling her last real covering down her legs. It turned out she wasn't exaggerating. Her panties were pale pink, frilly around the waistband, with cartoon puppy dogs frolicking across them them. Like her bra, she had clearly had them a few years. But unlike her breasts, her butt seemed to have filled out a little in that time meaning her underpants were stretched tight, with just a little of her butt cheeks sticking out the back. It was goofy, but also kind of sexy. She seemed unsure what to do with herself, first trying to shield her boobs and the front of her panties before settling on wrapping her arms around her slender torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... yeah... I still where kiddie panties. I mean, they still fit my body, so why bother spending a ton of money on new underwear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you work in a department store,\" Zoe asked. \"Don't you get a discount on lingerie? I've seen the way you dress, you're not exactly frugal with the rest of your wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but... It's...\" she looked over at Michael, her face turning beet red. \"It's not like I spend a lot of time taking my clothes off in front of boys. Especially not Michael.\" Now it was her friend's turn to blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you look great!\" he blurted out, immediately regretting it, but Claire giggled and grinned at him. \"Um... you, too, Melissa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" his study partner chirped. \"I don't spend much time taking my clothes for boys either, but I do have some cute undies. What do you think of these!\" Impulsively, she bounced out of her seat, lifting her shirt a little and spinning so everyone could get a good look at her rainbow boy shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very cute,\" Kaylee agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it won't be too long before you guys see the rest,\" Melissa quipped, retaking her place at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think maybe not,\" Kaylee agreed, glancing quickly at her little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's cards: 3 (spades) 8 (hearts) 10 (diamonds) K (diamonds) A (diamonds) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">white tennis shoes, socks, a white outer blouse, a light pink under-blouse</span>, a pair of stylish slim cut jeans, black lace bra, black lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">high heeled shoes, black stockings, silk button-up shirt</span>, a knee-length black skirt, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">hot pink bra, hot pink thong</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">fur-lined boots, athletic socks, white jacket, sleeveless purple shirt, form fitting jeans</span>, purple bra, purple panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes, socks, red sweater, white cotton tanktop, jeans, red bra</span>, red panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes, socks,open button up shirt</span>, t-shirt, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">jeans</span>, boxers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">black heels, opaque white tights, black jacket, black pencil skirt, white blouse, white half-slip</span>, girly bra, cartoon panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's clothing remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">flip-flops, red zip-up sweatshirt, baggy jeans</span>, science t-shirt, bra, rainbow-striped boy shorts<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That put him in last for the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, and quickly pulled his t-shirt of his head, reveal an upper body that was tone but not muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn around!\" Zoe yelled. \"Let's see that butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did, to a chorus of wolf-whistles from the group. Carmen gave his rear end the same playful slap he had given hers. As he sat down he saw Claire eying him intently. She looked embarrassed, but he returned an appreciative up and down of her body. She blew him a kiss. He wasn't sure what was going on. Were they flirting? She had been his first kiss, actually, back in eighth grade, and he hers, and at the time they'd talked about dating before deciding they weren't really interested in each other. But now? And there was Melissa, also staring at him. Kaylee had won the round and.. would she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would. \"Time to keep you promise, Melissa.\" The younger girl didn't hesitate, springing up and throwing off her t-shirt. Underneath she had on a simple white bra with just a little bit of lace. She spun in a circle before turning to face the group. Again, she got a little knock-kneed, although she made no real move to cover herself. Instead, she toyed with the straps of her bra, then waistband of her panties, then back again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she generally wore loose, baggy clothes, this was the first real look Michael had gotten at her body. It didn't disappoint. Her breasts were indeed b-cups, just verging on c's, going down to a pale torso with just a little bit of a belly and then wide hips and a butt that stuck out alluringly. He couldn't have been happier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Melissa whispered something to Claire. She made a face, but after a little more whispering, she nodded her head. The two got up, coming over to stand on either side of Michael. Leaning in, they pressed their breasts against his arm while giving him simultaneous kisses on each cheek. Michael was glad he was wearing tight boxer, or else his erection would definitely be popping out now. As it stood, it was hard to hide, and both girls took a long look at their handiwork before returning to their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's cards: 3 (clubs) 4 (hearts) 5 (diamonds) 8 (clubs) A (hearts) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">white tennis shoes, socks, a white outer blouse, a light pink under-blouse, a pair of stylish slim cut jeans</span>, black lace bra, black lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">high heeled shoes, black stockings, silk button-up shirt</span>, a knee-length black skirt, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">hot pink bra, hot pink thong</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">fur-lined boots, athletic socks, white jacket, sleeveless purple shirt, form fitting jeans</span>, purple bra, purple panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes, socks, red sweater, white cotton tanktop, jeans, red bra</span>, red panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes, socks,open button up shirt, t-shirt, jeans</span>, boxers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">black heels, opaque white tights, black jacket, black pencil skirt, white blouse, white half-slip</span>, girly bra, cartoon panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's clothing remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">flip-flops, red zip-up sweatshirt, baggy jeans, science t-shirt</span>, white bra, rainbow-striped boy shorts<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kaylee finally lost another round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I hate strip poker!\" She whined. \"I can't believe you guys are gonna see me in just my underwear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, get off it,\" Carmen snapped, annoyed her friend's bratty streak was surfacing. You did it to Tanya and Melissa yourself. Now it's time for you to bite the bullet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINE, WHATEVER!\" She stood up and tried to get her jeans down as quick as possible, but the tightness made this difficult. In the end it was an awkward dance that probably would have gone faster if she had just wiggled out of them. Her bikini panties had the same rose-patterned lace as her bra, and the same white scalloping around the top, as well as white accents down the sides. They were stretched taut across her body, to the point where they almost looked painted on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly she clapped her hands over her chest and crotch, and dropped to a semi-crouch. \"Aaaaaaaah, I can't believe I'm in my bra and panties in front of my broooooother!\" She scrambled back into her seat, squirming and trying to figure out who to best keep herself covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, get over yourself,\" Zoe yawned. \"Michael, who do you want to strip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hit Michael then that the girls were all down to their underwear. Whoever he chose was really going to have to show some skin. He looked over at Melissa. Did he dare? Kaylee was out for the round, not that he'd choose her anyway. He couldn't force it on sweet, innocent Tanya. That left Claire and Melissa and between the two. \"Melissa. Your turn.\" She didn't seem surprised at all. She'd probably made the same calculation he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired girl turned out to be a natural tease. Getting to her feet, she arched her chest as she reached behind for her bra clasp, then slowly and seductively lowered each strap. She faked them out once, twice, three times before letting her support garment fall to the ground. Michael's eyes bugged out. Her breasts had looked great before, but exposed they were incredible, perfectly formed and perky with small pink areolas. Her nipples gave away how much she had been enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she hesitated. Had Zoe an Carmen set a pattern she was expected to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe sensed the dilemma. \"It's cool. I let everyone feel my tits because I wanted to. You don't have to if you don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa smiled and shook her head. \"No, it's cool. I'm proud of my breasts and I don't mind showing them off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went around the table, stopping last at Michael's place. That was where she broke with custom. As he put his hand to her chest, she leaned in for a long, slow kiss. Her hand came down to his crotch, lightly feeling his erect member, and his free hand circled to her back, where he ran it over the colorful, cotton-covered expanse of backside. Finally, she broke away, smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot!\" Zoe shouted. \"Things just got steamy in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you believe that was my first kiss?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no, no, you were great,\" Michael assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I know it wasn't yours.\" She looked over at Claire. \"What? Girls talk. Especially when they spend so much time around a boy this cute.\" She gave him a quick peck before retaking her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go, Mikey!\" Zoe hooted. \"Who would have guessed Kaylee's nerd brother was such a chick magnet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Kaylee quipped, still wound up but starting to relax a little. \"Maybe the girl who dragged him into an all-girl strip poker game.\" Zoe stuck out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's cards: 4 (spades) Q (hearts) Q (diamonds) K (spades) A (spades)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">white tennis shoes, socks, a white outer blouse, a light pink under-blouse, a pair of stylish slim cut jeans</span>, black lace bra, black lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">high heeled shoes, black stockings, silk button-up shirt</span>, a knee-length black skirt, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">hot pink bra, hot pink thong</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">fur-lined boots, athletic socks, white jacket, sleeveless purple shirt, form fitting jeans</span>, purple bra, purple panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes, socks, red sweater, white cotton tanktop, jeans, red bra</span>, red panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes, socks,open button up shirt, t-shirt, jeans</span>, boxers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">black heels, opaque white tights, black jacket, black pencil skirt, white blouse, white half-slip</span>, girly bra, cartoon panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's clothing remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">flip-flops, red zip-up sweatshirt, baggy jeans, science t-shirt, white bra</span>, rainbow-striped boy shorts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tanya, on the other hand, was left stranded with just a jack high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh no,\" she moaned. \"I should have quit while I had the chance. Bu a deals a deal.\" Quickly she reached behind her and undid her bra, slipping it down her body in way that kept her chest constantly covered. She looked indecisive for a minute but then steeled herself. \"Okay, okay, you can all cop a feel.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite the site. The usual confident track star scurrying from place to place in just her purple and pink panties, letting her arms down briefly so everyone could examine her shapely c-cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you run with those things,\" Zoe teased her. \"Your sports bras must be made of titanium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to Michael, she again seemed unsure what to do. Then, she dropped her arms and bent in for a kiss. Unlike the other girls, she didn't try to take touch his penis, and he kept his free hand on her hip, the frilly material of her panty waistband tickling his fingers. When she pulled away she blushed, momentarily forgetting to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... that was, um, my first kiss, too,\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought another wolf whistle from Zoe. \"Way to go, Jackson! I knew this would be good for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Michael had to decide who to strip, and his options were Kaylee and Claire. He looked apologetically at his best friend. \"No, I get it, it can't be your sister,\" she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's flimsy bra was a front clasp. She fumbled for a minute, clearly flustered. Having finally gotten it open, she held the cups to her chest. She tried pulling them apart once, giving everyone just the briefest glimpse of her breasts before she panicked and pulled them together. After a few deep breaths, she let the cups fall, standing there exposed for a second while she screwed up the courage to slip out of it completely. Her breasts were still little more than buds, with tiny, bright pink nipples. She blushed, but refused to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's okay with all of you, I'd prefer not to share with the group. Maybe I am a little self-conscious after all.\" Everyone nodded. \"But I feel like I have to do something.\" Hesitantly, she walked over to Michael, putting one arm over his shoulder and bringing herself down into his lap, her firm butt press up against his dick. Her lips touched his, and he was shocked to feel her tongue enter his mouth. His hand brushed delicately over her nipples and she shudder. Then he moved to her back, his hand slowly moving down until it hit the waistband of her panties, then moved inside, feeling directly the toned muscles of her butt. She tensed for a second, but didn't stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they broke away. The room was silent. \"I can't believe we just did that in front of a room full of people,\" she whispered to him. \"In just our underpants.\" Michael had no idea where this had come from, either, but he wasn't exactly unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire retook her seat, which was when the next surprise happened. Melissa leaned over and kissed her friend square on the lips. They held for a second, then broke away, giggling. Zoe found this hilarious, and responded by leaning over to plant one Carmen's lips. They pulled closer, bare breast rubbing against each other, then broke away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, now Michael had a problem. The feel of Claire's body against his already full erection had put him under quite a bit of strain, and the girls kissing hadn't helped. Fortunately someone took notice of his problem.</span></div></div>",

He's dying over there.\" Zoe bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire glanced over, finally noticing Michael's throbbing dick. Her eyes widened realizing she had been the cause of that. She, too, had thought they were just friends, but since Melissa talked her into this something had come over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I'll take care of it,\" Zoe continued. Before anyone could say anything, she grabbed Michael by the wrist and dragged him to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, shorts down, mister.\" Michael didn't know how to respond as Zoe tugged his boxers down to his ankles. \"Don't worry, stud, this isn't my first rodeo.\" Gripping the shaft of his penis, she used her lips and tongue to apply what slight pressure was still needed to bring Michael to release. He was stunned, but relieved to finally have the intense urge taken away. Zoe grabbed a few tissues from the counter and cleaned him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was your first, wasn't it? Glad I could be of service. But I have to say, I'm getting jealous of those other girls. We'll have to do something else to even that out.\" She drew him in, opening her mouth as their lips touched. The sensation of her enormous breasts on his chest, as well as his uncovered dick so close to her barely covered pussy was overwhelming. Sticking a hand under her skirt, he found her lower lips and inserted two fingers. She shuddered, but pushed him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later,\" she giggled. \"Definitely later. Right now, we have a game to finish.\" She pulled his boxers back up, giving his crotch one last appreciative pat, then led him back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they rejoined the group, Carmen called out, \"No fair!

I did it special for tonight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just to0 weird,\" Kaylee replied. \"Anyway, it looks like I'm the winner this round, so... I guess nobody else takes anything off, right?\" Everyone agreed. \"Well, then I do believe you said something about forfeits. But what can me possibly to to embarrass you that you wouldn't do to yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could make her take Michael in the bathroom and- oh wait,\" joked Carmen. \"Wait no, I've got it. You do seem awfully proud of that bush of yours. Hey, Kaylee, do you have any razors handy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do. Upstairs bathroom. Are you thinking what I'm thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh noooooo,\" Zoe moaned. \"I knew I shouldn't have thrown that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it! No take backs now! Girls, will you lead the prisoner upstairs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya and Carmen each grabbed one of Zoe's arms, and Kaylee led the other three to the bathroom. Which left Michael alone with his study partners, he is his boxers and they in just their panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Claire. \"Some study session this turned out to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we... certainly learned a lot about... each other...\" Michael joked lamely. He was trying not to stare at their exposed chests, only to realize his eyes were locked on Melissa's panty-clad crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Zoe really...\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, um... with her mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would haven taken care of it if she hadn't offered,\" Melissa chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's eyes widened. \"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's enough of this,\" Claire butted in. \"Michael, you like Melissa, Melissa you like Michael. You two aren't nearly as subtle as you think you are, you're both just too infatuated to know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room went dead silent. Then, Melissa leaned over and kissed Michael again. Her tongue entered his mouth and they made out for a few seconds before remembering Claire was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, but what about you and that... thing?\" Michael wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know either. Look, it's like we talked about that one time. You're my best friend, and you're definitely hot, but we're clearly not into each other that way. I just... I got caught up in the moment and wanted to do something to feel sexier. Why did I have to wear these stupid puppy dog panties today? Sorry, Melissa, I knew you two liked each other and I probably shouldn't have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Melissa replied. \"Look, if I get into the science magnet, we won't be a study group anymore, so I guess we'll have to find something else as a group. And anyway, I think your panties are really cute.\" She playfully pinched her friend on the butt, then leaned in for a kiss. Michael glanced at Melissa, who nodded, and he moved over to kiss Claire as well. It was short and fairly chaste, which was just as well, because at that moment Zoe and her captors returned, the redhead's hands now cupped protectively over her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe we got you to show modesty, Zoe,\" Carmen snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe guys, I mean... it's just so weird, I feel like double naked now. I mean look.\" She pulled her hands away, revealing a smooth crotch that left her pussy completely on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" Carmen added, \"when we were getting her ready we found a bit of moisture... and Zoe spilled the beans about your little adventure in the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's heart sank. Now he wished there was anything he could do to take back what had happened. But Melissa's just took his hand in hers and kissed him on the cheek. \"Why Michael, I had no idea you were such a lady's man. I would have locked you down sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" Zoe demanded. \"Whatever, I guess I'm out now, so let's start the next round so someone else has to get naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's cards: 2 (clubs) 3 (clubs) 5 (diamonds) 10 (clubs) J (clubs) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">white tennis shoes, socks, a white outer blouse, a light pink under-blouse, a pair of stylish slim cut jeans</span>, black lace bra, black lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's clothes remaining: NAKED<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">fur-lined boots, athletic socks, white jacket, sleeveless purple shirt, form fitting jeans, purple bra</span>, purple panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes, socks, red sweater, white cotton tanktop, jeans, red bra</span>, red panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes, socks,open button up shirt, t-shirt, jeans</span>, boxers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">black heels, opaque white tights, black jacket, black pencil skirt, white blouse, white half-slip, girly bra</span>, cartoon panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's clothing remaining:<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"> flip-flops, red zip-up sweatshirt, baggy jeans, science t-shirt, white bra</span>, rainbow-striped boy shorts</span></div></div>",

While she was gone, everyone set about getting plates and napkins.

It'll be sexier that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael wasn't sure what to do as Melissa straddled him and began grinding. Clearly she had never done this before, but the act itself was inherently sexy. Slowly she turned so her back was to him, and his hands came to rest on her breasts. Grinding against him, she began to tug on her panties and suddenly Melissa's bare butt was against his chest. She slithered up and down for another minute, making sure her bottom made contact with his penis more than once, before finally slowing to a stop, but making no move to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to take your seat, Melissa?\" Tanya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.

You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A seven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA!\" Zoe snorted. \"Looks like loverboy is taking a dive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and these four twos. I think that means I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire glared at him. But now that the final moment was upon her she hesitated. She was the one who dragged Melissa into this, but now, she wasn't sure she could actually get naked instead of her two best friends. But a deal was a deal, so she stood up and with great ceremony pushed her panties down to the floor. Scooping them up, she waved the puppy-dog covered undergarment over her head and announced, \"I declare Michael the winner of this evening of strip poker.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body wa a sight to behold. Michael knew she was in good shape, the but the rail thin runner had not an inch of fat on her. While her tiny breast buds might seem silly on another girl, on her they made perfect sense, and only added to the feeling of pure athletic power. Zoe let out a low whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think it's only fitting for Michael to pick your forfeit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael thought for a minute. This is one was tough. Melissa seemed comfortable with everything that happened, but he was still worried about how she would react. Then it hit him. \"Well... Tanya said you were the best on the track squad, so how about a lap around the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire blanched. \"You mean... outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I did more than that,\" Carmen pointed out. \"You only have to go around the house, that's way better than what I got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay.\" As Claire shuffled towards the door, the gang took places at various windows to make sure she made it all the way around. Each one cheered in turn as her pale body flashed past, arms and legs pumping mechanically. For her part, Claire tried not to think about her nudity. \"It's just like any other run,\" she told herself. \"Except normally when I run I can't feel the grass, and the wind isn't quite so... obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lap around the spacious suburban house took her two minutes. She burst through the front door, gasping and bright red from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... we could get dressed...\" Carmen started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" Everyone was shocked as Tanya spoke up. \"After Michael just smoked all of us in this game, I think we owe him a little more. We'll get dressed for tomorrow, but for the night, we're his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment there was dead silence. Instinctively, everyone looked at Melissa. \"Good idea!\" she chirped. \"Well, Michael did you really think you'd ever have six naked girls, six extremely cute naked girls at your beck and call for an evening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five.\" When nobody was looking Kaylee had squirmed back into her bra and panties. \"You guys do what you want, but I'm not going to be my brother's naked servant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be,\" Zoe shot back. \"We could get the big baby a diaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, let her go,\" Michael said. \"She's been enough of a sport, considering.\" Kaylee scurried off to bed, leaving Michael alone with five beauties and not a stitch between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say, I feel a little over dressed. Should I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Claire, \"keep them on for now. You've earned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although...\" Melissa said, patting his boxer-covered crotch, \"maybe later...\"</span></div></div>",

But his strategy was rewarded with a solid 10 (hearts). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister was shifting uncomfortably. Her glances went quickly from one face to the next scanning for a poor result that might save her. But her K (clubs) high was simply not enough. With her socks already removed she carefully peeled herself out of her white outer blouse. The thin pink material she wore below hardly covered her full C-Cup breasts. When she rose to hang it onto a vacant chair Zoe gave Michael a quick smile and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like your sister?\" Michael looked back in confusion. \"S-Sure\" he responded to Zoe, who slapped her hand on her covered thigh laughing.

Although she was nervous about playing strip poker with Kaylee and her friends she was hardly a poker virgin.  Being a gamer and on the nerdy side poker appealed to her when she was first introduced to it by a friend of hers.  Her and some friends would often play at someone's house for quarters and dimes, but they never played for stakes as high as clothing.  Playing amongst her friends she found that she had a natural knack for the game, and even though she was too young to gamble online she refined her skills by playing in free game.  Of course the possibility of losing her clothes made her nervous, but she had a feeling that Kaylee and her friends really didn't play poker often and she figured she could use that to her advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying 5-handed she figured that the odds would be extremely slim that any pair would be the worst hand let alone a decent pair like 9's.  A less experienced player probably look for the home run and chase the straight or the flush, but Alyssa knew better than that.  <i>No point in breaking up an already made hand</i>, she thought to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Kaylee mucked her own cards she looked at the girls around the table, \"Alright ladies, let's see what you've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling confident Alyssa quickly put down her pair of 9's and then looked around the table as the other girls revealed their cards: Zoe had a pair of Kings, Carmen had a Queen high, Tanya had two pairs: 4's and 5's, and then she saw her sister's card and a sly grin formed on her mouth.  Kaylee turned over a 9 high and had obviously busted on a straight draw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa looked over at her sister and could see the fear in her eyes, \"Not the hand you were hoping for, huh sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up, it's only one hand,\" Kaylee replied.  The pretty brunette then bent down and untied her white tennis shoes.  She then took them off and held them up for everyone to see before putting them behind her chair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe, who had been shuffling the deck then asked, \"Everyone ready for the next hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all nodded in unison and Zoe dealt out the cards.

Carmen showed a pair of 3's, Zoe showed a King high, Tanya showed a Queen high busted straight draw, and Kaylee showed another weak hand this time showing a 7 high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa couldn't resist the urge to dig into her sister and remarked, \"If I didn't know any better I'd say you were trying to get naked for us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee's friends laughed at her sister's remark which annoyed her even more.  \"Shut up, it's only two hands.  My luck will change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down in her seat for the 2nd consecutive hand Kaylee took off her socks and held them up for everyone to see before throwing them behind her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya, who was now shuffling the deck looked at her friend and giggled, \"Looks like we've got a little sibling rivalry going on tonight, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well it won't be much of a rivalry when she's the one taking off her clothes,\" Kaylee replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa sat there grinning as the next hand was dealt.  <i>She thinks this game is all luck. This is almost gonna be too easy</i>, she thought to herself.  Her and Kaylee got along very well and she considered her a good big sister, but after watching her lose the first two hands she couldn't help but think how much fun it would be to embarrass her by having her be the first one naked.  After that she didn't care who else lost as long as it was one of Kaylee's friends and not her.  After receiving her final card she looked down at her hand and saw the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>8 (clubs), 7 (<span class=\"clred\">diamonds</span>), 6 (<span class=\"clred\">diamonds</span>), 5 (spades), 2 (<span class=\"clred\">diamonds</span>)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">white tennis shoes</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">socks</span>, a white outer blouse, a light pink under-blouse, a pair of stylish slim cut jeans, black lace bra, black lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's clothes remaining: high heeled shoes, black stockings, silk button-up shirt, a knee-length black skirt, hot pink bra, hot pink thong<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya's clothes remaining: fur-lined boots, athletic socks, white jacket, sleeveless purple shirt, form fitting jeans, purple bra, purple panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen's clothes remaining: tennis shoes, socks, red sweater, white cotton tanktop, jeans, red bra, red panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa's clothes remaining: zip-up hoodie, tennis shoes, socks, t-shirt, jeans, sky blue bra, sky blue panties<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She figured her best option was to go with a straight draw because any 9 or 4 would complete that, and even if she missed maybe she'd get lucky and pair one of her cards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid a single card over to Tanya and when she took another in return she was glad to see that it was a 5, giving her a pair.  <i>I may have missed my straight draw, but at least I paired up.  That should be good enough not to lose</i>, she thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya was the first to lay her cards down and she proudly displayed a flush, \"Looks like I won't be taking anything off this round, let's see what you losers got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee was next and showed a pair of Jacks, \"There's no way that can be the worst hand, no way!\" She exclaimed, sounding like she was trying to convince herself after losing the first two hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa showed her pair of 5's which brought a smile to Kaylee's face, but then Zoe showed only a King high which was followed by Carmen's 10 high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya shuffled the deck and then passed it over to Carmen, \"Looks like you're the loser this hand so what's it gonna be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carmen contemplated what to take off she felt the sudden rush of adrenaline that she usually got when doing one of her extreme activities.  She never expected this to happen, but there was no doubt that playing poker with these stakes was exciting and a jolt to her system.  Suddenly feeling hot, she surprises the other girls by taking off her red sweater instead of her tennis shoes and reveals her tight tank top underneath.  Although her breasts weren't as big as any of her friends, the tank top is low cut and shows off a nice amount of cleavage from her perky B-cups.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen then put her sweater over the back of her chair and saw that her friends all had a look of surprise on their faces, \"What?  It was getting hot in here, okay?  You all act like you've never seen a girl in a tank top before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis elicited some laughter from the rest of the girls and Carmen then began to deal the next hand.  Looking down at her cards, Alyssa saw her next hand and had to try hard to keep from smiling:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>King (<span class=\"clred\">hearts</span>), King (spades), King (clubs), 6 (clubs), 3 (<span class=\"clred\">diamonds</span>)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">white tennis shoes</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">socks</span>, a white outer blouse, a light pink under-blouse, a pair of stylish slim cut jeans, black lace bra, black lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's clothes remaining: high heeled shoes, black stockings, silk button-up shirt, a knee-length black skirt, hot pink bra, hot pink thong<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya's clothes remaining: fur-lined boots, athletic socks, white jacket, sleeveless purple shirt, form fitting jeans, purple bra, purple panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen's clothes remaining: tennis shoes, socks, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">red sweater</span>, white cotton tank top, jeans, red bra, red panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa's clothes remaining: zip-up hoodie, tennis shoes, socks, t-shirt, jeans, sky blue bra, sky blue panties</span></div></div>",

Keeping the three Kings was a no-brainer so she quickly discarded the 6 and 3.  The two cards she got in return did nothing to improve her hand significantly but she didn't really care.  She was starting to feel a little hot though so she unzipped her hoodie about half way down to reveal the top of the t-shirt she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee saw her do this and decided to tease her sister, \"Getting ready to finally lose a hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa just smiled back at her, \"No, I just thought that Carmen was right and it was feeling a little hot in here, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the rest of the girls got done drawing Alyssa showed her three Kings much to the chagrin of her sister who turned over a pair of Aces.  Carmen turned over Jacks and 6's, Tanya turned over Ace high, and Zoe showed a busted straight draw with a 10 high.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's my turn,\" the bubbly redhead announced.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was easily the most well-dressed amongst the group of girls, but this was nothing out of the ordinary.  She was very proud of her body and while she certainly wouldn't say that she flaunts it she always makes sure to dress well and accentuate her assets.  Playing poker with the girls was no exception.  While the other four were dressed very casually for a night of hanging out Zoe looked like she was ready to hit the club in her silk button up shirt, black skirt with black stocking and high heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs confident as she was in her body Zoe wasn't about to reveal any skin yet so she simply slipped her foot out of her 4-inch heels then held them up to show everyone that they were off and placed them under her chair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deck was then passed to Alyssa who shuffled and began dealing.

If she lost she'd only have to give up her hoodie so she figured she was in a bad position regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the rest of the girls each mucked cards or held onto their hand Alyssa gave up her 8 and took another card.

The two cards she received in return didn't improve her hand much, but she was fine going into the showdown with a pair of 2's <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving played poker with her friends and online Alyssa was by far the most experienced player at the table.  For the other four girls this was simply a night to have some fun while Kalyee and Alyssa's parents were away.  Between her sister and her three friends Alyssa was finding that her sister seemed to be the worst player amongst them.  She was the only one who had lost three hands so far and they usually seemed to be the result of going for risky draws that got busted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa liked her sister, and the other girls too for that matter, but she couldn't help but think about how much fun it would be to see Kaylee be the first one naked amongst them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee, not on purpose of course, seemed to be giving her sister exactly what she wanted.

She felt more than a bit embarrassed to be the first one to show any significant amount of skin so far, and with only two articles of clothing left was nervous that she'd soon be naked.  Poker was turning out to be a more difficult game than she imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe laughed and then dealt out of the next hand.

Up until then she had been the only player that had yet to lose, and she had planned on making sure it stayed that way.  Being an athlete she had a competitive streak that was a mile longer than any of the other girls at the table.  If there was one thing she hated it was losing, and that was mostly because she was unaccustomed to it.  Ever since joining the track team as a freshman she was the best runner on the team, and she rarely lost any race that she was in.  On top of hating to lose Tanya was also the most conservative of the girls.  She was the only one that had voted against strip poker, but she got outvoted and didn't wait to bail out on the slumber party.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, it's my first loss,\" Tanya said as she bent down to slip off her fur-lined boots, \"it's not like I've lost four hands already,\" and she shot a glare at Kaylee who rolled her eyes at her friend.  After getting her boots off Tanya held them in the air for everyone to see and then placed them under her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her turn to deal so she shuffled the cards quickly and dealt.

If only she could have improved Kaylee would have been down to her bra &amp; panties!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you lost Alyssa so you've gotta take something off,\" Tanya told her as she passed the deck over to Carmen to shuffle and deal the next hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know,\" she replied as she reached under the table and untied her sneakers.  As with all the other girls that had taken off their footwear so far she lifted them up for everyone else to see and then put them under her chair.  For the first time Alyssa felt a little nervous because she had only one more hand she could afford to lose before she had to show some serious skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen had finished shuffling the deck and began dealing the next hand.

She turned the 9 and 6 face down and pushed them towards Carmen who gave her two cards back.  When she turned them over she was ecstatic to see that she had gotten another Ace back giving her three of a kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen was the last player to draw since she was the dealer and she took only 1 card and then announced, \"Okay, turn them over everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee was the first player to show which was unusual because she was generally worried about having the worst hand and was usually one of the last to show.  This time she showed a paid of Queens which she obviously felt confident in.  Alyssa then showed her three Aces which was followed by Carmen who had a busted straight draw with only an 8 high.  Tanya had a busted flush draw with a King high, and Zoe followed up with a pair of 4's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoker had been providing Carmen a surprising adrenaline rush that she usually got only when doing one of her extreme activities.  She never expected that playing a game at a table could provide that same kind of rush, and the rush always came to it's highest moment when the showdown occurred.  The rush of adrenaline always raised her body temperature which is why when she lost her first hand she decided to take off her sweater rather than her sneakers like all the other girls were doing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeking even more of an adrenaline rush she decided to spice things up a little.  She knew that everyone would be expecting her to take off her sneakers, but she surprised them all by reaching behind her back and unclasping her bra.  She then tucked her arms in tight so that she could slip the straps down her arms, then reached inside her tank top and pulled the red undergarment out with a giggle, holding it high in the air before leaning back slightly and dropping it behind her chair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I wasn't expecting that,\" Zoe commented.  \"I guess you adrenaline junkies always need to find news ways to get your hearts jumping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen giggled again then added, \"Yeah, well it was getting a little boring with everyone just taking off shoes and socks, well other than you Kaylee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee, the only player that had lost four hands so far and was down to just a blouse, a bra and panties, raised her middle finger towards Carmen in jest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen shuffled up the deck and handed it over to Alyssa who began dealing everyone in.  Once she gave herself her final card she looked down at her hand:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>King (spades), Jack (<span class=\"clred\">hearts</span>), 10 (<span class=\"clred\">hearts</span>), 9 (clubs), 8 (spades)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">white tennis shoes</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">socks</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">a white outer blouse</span>, a light pink under-blouse, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">a pair of stylish slim cut jeans</span>, black lace bra, black lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">high heeled shoes</span>, black stockings, silk button-up shirt, a knee-length black skirt, hot pink bra, hot pink thong<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">fur-lined boots</span>, athletic socks, white jacket, sleeveless purple shirt, form fitting jeans, purple bra, purple panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen's clothes remaining: tennis shoes, socks, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">red sweater</span>, white cotton tank top, jeans, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">red bra</span>, red panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">zip-up hoodie</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes</span>, socks, t-shirt, jeans, sky blue bra, sky blue panties</span></div></div>",

If she missed her straight she was still hoping to pair up, and if that didn't happen she figured that a Jack high could be just the 2nd worst hand.  After dealing out the other players all their draws she discarded her King and took a single card.  As luck would have it she got a 7 and made her straight!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her cards over proudly then asked, \"What's everyone else got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya turned her cards over next and showed a full house, 3's full of 4's.  \"Full house, baby!\" she shouted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen was next with a pair of 9's, then Kaylee with an Ace high and Zoe with just a 10 high.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like I'm the big loser this hand,\" Zoe stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you getting rid of?\" Kaylee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe, who is the bustiest of all the girls replied, \"Well, I was feeling inspired by Carmen so I think I'll spice things up a little too.\"  Standing up she started with the top button on her silk shirt and worked her way down.  Standing with the shirt open her hot pink bra was visible underneath as were her large D-cups.  She wiggled her shoulders back so that the shirt would slide off her shoulders and down her arms.  Moving her shoulders in such a way caused her ample breasts to bounce slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the shirt was down her arms she slipped one of them out and then raised it over her head and gave it a little twirl around her finger, \"Ta-da!\" she announced bubbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show off!\" Carmen yelled as she teased her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you've got it, flaunt it\" Zoe replied then she shook her shoulders again which made her breasts jiggle from side to side.  Her hot pink bra looked as if it was ready to burst under the weight of her large breasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the girls giggled at her display while Kaylee shuffled the deck and then dealt out the cards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa checked out her starting hand:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>King (clubs), Queen (clubs), 8 (clubs), 3 (clubs), 2 (clubs)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">white tennis shoes</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">socks</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">a white outer blouse</span>, a light pink under-blouse, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">a pair of stylish slim cut jeans</span>, black lace bra, black lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">high heeled shoes</span>, black stockings, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">silk button-up shirt</span>, a knee-length black skirt, hot pink bra, hot pink thong<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">fur-lined boots</span>, athletic socks, white jacket, sleeveless purple shirt, form fitting jeans, purple bra, purple panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen's clothes remaining: tennis shoes, socks, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">red sweater</span>, white cotton tank top, jeans, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">red bra</span>, red panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">zip-up hoodie</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes</span>, socks, t-shirt, jeans, sky blue bra, sky blue panties</span></div></div>",

As she stood up she turned her back to them and started swaying her hips seductively as she reached behind her back and unzipped the back of her skirt.  She let it stay open as she continued to move her hips, and her hot pink thong could be seen by all.  Very slowly she started to push the skirt down her hips, revealing more of her thong as well as the globes of her tight, round ass.  As she continued to dance and push her skirt down past her thighs the girls were able to see that Zoe was wearing a very sexy pair of stockings with lace at the top.  Once the skirt got about halfway down her thighs she let it go and allowed gravity do the rest of the work.  She stepped out of the skirt, kicking it under her chair, and then sat back down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, you're such a slut!\" Carmen said giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe stuck her tongue out at her friend, knowing that she was only joking with her.  Zoe was having fun being the most revealing one so far.  Granted she didn't necessarily want to get naked, but she was having fun showing off her body thus far.  She didn't think getting naked would be the worst thing if it happened to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the deck off the table and began shuffling, \"My turn to deal,\" she announced and then gave everyone their cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looked at her hand and saw:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>10 (<span class=\"clred\">diamonds</span>), 10 (<span class=\"clred\">hearts</span>), 7 (<span class=\"clred\">diamonds</span>), 7 (clubs), 2 (clubs)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">white tennis shoes</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">socks</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">a white outer blouse</span>, a light pink under-blouse, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">a pair of stylish slim cut jeans</span>, black lace bra, black lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">high heeled shoes</span>, black stockings, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">silk button-up shirt</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">a knee-length black skirt</span>, hot pink bra, hot pink thong<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">fur-lined boots</span>, athletic socks, white jacket, sleeveless purple shirt, form fitting jeans, purple bra, purple panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen's clothes remaining: tennis shoes, socks, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">red sweater</span>, white cotton tank top, jeans, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">red bra</span>, red panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">zip-up hoodie</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes</span>, socks, t-shirt, jeans, sky blue bra, sky blue panties</span></div></div>",

She figured if she was able to improve to a full house that would be great, but she knew she odds of that happening weren't very good so it's not as if she was disappointed when it didn't happen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe finished the round by taking three cards, and then put her hand down showing a pair of Kings.  \"There's no way that can be the worst hand,\" she said. \"What's everyone else got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa showed her two pair, followed by Kaylee who had only Queen high.

It was the first time that she had lost in a while and she was hoping it would stay that way because she didn't want to get naked, and especially not be the first one.  She thought for sure that Zoe was going to beat her to that based on how the hands had gone recently.  Kaylee knew that she was pretty, but she wasn't nearly as confident about showing off her body as Zoe was.  Despite all of them being close friends this was the first time that any of them had seen her in a bra &amp; panties.  Sure, they had all gone to the beach together and her bikini essentially was no different than her underwear, but there was something about bra &amp; panties that was more private and intimate to her.  She knew that she had to be careful going forward because if she loses again she'll either be topless or bottomless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the bra &amp; panties club,\" Zoe exclaimed and raised a hand towards Kaylee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay, so excited,\" Kaylee replied sarcastically and she gave her friend a less than enthusiastic high five.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya already had been shuffling the deck and dealt out the next hand.

If she hit she knew that she wouldn't lose, but if she missed she knew there was a pretty good chance that she'd have the worst hand.  Of course if she happened to pair up that would be fine too because the worst hands so far had always been high cards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was her turn, she slid one card over to Tanya and then took a look at the one she received in return.  <i>Crap! Just a 6 and not a club.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited for the players after her to go, and when it was time to showdown Alyssa meekly laid down her Jack high busted flush draw.  Not surprisingly it was the worst hand of the bunch which meant that she had to take something off.  Thankfully she still had her socks, but they were the last item of what she considered to be her expendable clothing.  Any losing hand after this would require her to start showing some skin, and that was not something that she wanted to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that the stakes had now become higher for her and that this was the 3rd hand that she lost, Alyssa was becoming a bit rattled.  She knew that she had played more poker than any of these girls and there wasn't any doubt that she was the best player here, yet Tanya and Carmen hadn't lost as many hands as she had.  <i>Is it possible that they're setting me up to lose?</i>  She dismissed that idea because her sister was down to just her bra &amp; panties, and if she was being set up she was sure that her sister would still be fully clothed.  <i>Maybe I underestimated the amount of luck in this game?</i>  That's certainly possible.  She always played the odds but some hands are just crap and there isn't much that can be done with them.  This last one being a perfect example.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa was brought back to reality from her thoughts when she heard her sister Kaylee, \"Hello?  Earth to Alyssa!  You lost so that means you have to take something off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, s-sorry,\" she replied and then rested one foot on her opposite knee, removed her sock, and then did the same thing with the other foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Alyssa?\" Carmen asked as she shuffled and got ready to deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, thanks.

So she elected not to take any cards when it was her turn.  If she was playing to win instead of playing not to lose she would have went for the full house, but under the circumstances she saw no reason to go for it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen took a card for herself and then turned over two pairs, Kings and Queens.  \"What's everyone else got?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa showed her three 6's and Tanya was next showing a pair of 5's.  Kaylee and Zoe each figured they lost so they were more apprehensive about showing their respective hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on already,\" Tanya said impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was the first to show with a 9 high busted flush draw.  Kaylee let out a sigh of relief with a 10 high busted straight draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, I really thought I'd be half naked after this hand,\" Kaylee stated.  \"Thanks for bailing me out Zoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can hold your thanks, it's not like a did it on purpose,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's true that Zoe didn't lose on purpose, but she didn't mind that she lost either.  While all the other girls were nervous about potentially being naked Zoe was okay with it.  She was very proud of her body and amongst friends she didn't care about being seen naked.  Although most people would think that Zoe was proudest of her D-cup breasts (which she was) she was in fact proudest of her legs which is why she had kept her stockings on thus far.  She always felt that her legs looked great in a pair of thigh highs, and she felt incredibly sexy wearing them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering that she had only three articles of clothing remaining any other girl at the table in Zoe's position would have elected to take off the thigh highs, but Zoe surprised everyone when she reached behind her back and unhooked her hot pink bra.  She then brushed the straps off her shoulders and grabbed the cups that were covering her breasts.  Zoe whisked the bra off her body and leaned back slightly to drop it behind her chair.  The effect of leaning back slightly arched her back and made her breasts seem even more pronounced then they already were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked at Zoe and giggled, \"I always knew you were a show off,\" Carmen told her playfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not showing off, this is showing off,\" Zoe replied and then jiggled her chest making her large breasts bounce up and down.  The girls all laughed at the display and the busty redhead laughed at herself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa had been shuffling the deck while Zoe was removing her bra and putting on her little show and was now ready to deal.

She flipped over her cards, and the girls had a small laugh at her expense. \"Sh-shut up,\" the poker expert exclaimed lightheartedly. Her chest had the same heated feeling as her blushing face, so she instinctively pulled up her top in an awkward but generally quick motion. Her arms crossed her chest and avoided eye contact with the group. The rather giddy Zoe responded with a wolf whistle which didn't help the youngest girl. \"C'mon, lets just play,\" Alyssa almost pleaded to Zoe, who was the next to deal.

The cards that she received did nothing to improve her hand, but she felt confident that her pair of Jacks would risk her any further embarrassment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was the first to show her hand after taking a card for herself, \"Read 'em and weep,\" she said as she laid down a flush.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a pair so I think I should be good this round,\" Alyssa announced as she showed her Jacks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya laid down a pair of 6's leaving Kaylee and Carmen as the only two yet to show.  The two friends stared each other down for a moment before Carmen relented and showed an Ace high busted flush draw.  Kaylee then laid down a busted Ace high flush draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carmen has Ace, King high but you've got only Ace, Queen high so you lose.  Sorry, Kaylee,\" Zoe told her.  \"At least I'll have some company in the topless club though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayle had a feeling that she was going to lose which is why she had the stare down with Carmen to prolong showing her hand.  To lose by just a single card was pretty hard for her to take though especially since she was already down to only her underwear.  She shot Zoe a glare after she made the \"topless club\" comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well get this over with quickly,\" she said as she stood up and reached behind her back to unhook her black lace bra.  Once it was unhooked she hugged it to her chest for a moment before sliding out of it and exposing her ample C cups.  Alyssa couldn't help but take a look at her sister's bare breasts and feel a twinge of jealousy.  She had never seen them bare before and getting a look at them made her feel even more self conscious about her own. <i>They're pretty much perfect</i>, she thought to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having a great pair of breasts, Kaylee didn't have the confidence in her body that Zoe has so once her bra was off she quickly sat down and kept her arms folded in front of her on the table to hide her breasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're getting down to showing some serious skin,\" Tanya commented as she shuffled and began her deal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa took a look at her hand after she received her last card and saw:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Queen (<span class=\"clred\">diamonds</span>), Queen (<span class=\"clred\">hearts</span>), 10 (clubs), 10 (<span class=\"clred\">hearts</span>), 3 (clubs)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">white tennis shoes</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">socks</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">a white outer blouse</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">a light pink under-blouse</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">a pair of stylish slim cut jeans</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">black lace bra</span>, black lace panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">high heeled shoes</span>, black stockings, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">silk button-up shirt</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">a knee-length black skirt</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">hot pink bra</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">hot pink thong</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">fur-lined boots</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">athletic socks</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">white jacket</span>, sleeveless purple shirt, form fitting jeans, purple bra, purple panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">socks</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">red sweater</span>, white cotton tank top, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">jeans</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">red bra</span>, red panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa's clothes remaining: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">zip-up hoodie</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">tennis shoes</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">socks</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">t-shirt</span>, jeans, sky blue bra, sky blue panties</span></div></div>",

She pleaded with Kaylee and all the other girls to give her something else but they were having none of it. \"If you don't do it we'll have to do it for you,\" Zoe told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa was admittedly quite horny but there was no way she was going to masturbate in front of her sister and her friends. She tried to refuse but the girls were having none of it. When she tried to leave they grabbed her and sat her forcefully down on the couch. Tanya and Zoe held her down and Carmen forced her legs apart as Kaylee approached her helpless sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to take your forfeit sis,\" Kaylee said. She grinned with joy as she pushed three fingers into Alyssa's pussy. She began to slowly work them in and out, twisting and turning, hitting all the right spots. Clearly she masturbated a lot as she knew just how to give a girl maximum pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa's eyes rolled back in her head and she moaned as she felt her orgasm building rapidly. \"Kaylee!\" She gasped out her body bucking, but the girls held her down. \"Please sister. Don't!\" she begged as she writhed and moaned against the pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee shook her head. \"You chose this when you backed out sis. Just give in to your pleasure. You know you want to.\" All the girls laughed at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite not wanting to be humiliated in front of the other girls, Alyssa couldn't resist. Her sister was just too good, hitting exactly the right places to push her over the edge. Alyssa threw her head back and screamed her sister's name \"Kaylee!!\" as she came hard. The girls watched in awe as Kaylee's shy younger sister came apart at the hands of her own sister.  </span></div></div>",

Let alone after I came!\" \"Maybe it will be a pizza girl, instead?\" suggested a giggling Tanya. Alyssa blushes as Kaylee and Tanya continue to bicker about the dare. \"Kaylee, you lost. There was no limits, it's as simple as that! Heck, I will help you with the cumming if you want.\" intervened Zoe. Kaylee glared at Zoe \"You are such a flirt bordering on a damn, nympho Zoey! I am straight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not. So either getting those fingers dancing or spread em, babe!\" \"Come on, Kaylee! We both did dares!\" observed Carmen. \"Yeah, my ass still hurts!\" \"And anyone could have seen me, run! So hurry up, already!\" Kaylee looked more abashed, but shook her head. \"I won't masturbate like some sicko in front of everyone, let alone let some stranger see my body smelling of juices! It's too much! Come on, Tanya. Give me another dare!\" Tanya shook her head. \"Either you rub yourself or someone else does it!\" Noting her two friends by her side, Kaylee decides mentally that Zoe and Carmen are bluffing. \"Fine, Carmen and Zoe, better get started!\" To Kaylee's surprise, Zoe goes straight for her spread snatch while Carmen begins playing with her breasts. Kaylee quickly realises that since she is leaking already; it won't take long before she climaxes and orgasms hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa knew that this was wrong. Hell it was virtually incest. But her sister's eyes were closed as she kept moaning and moaning. \"Watch Zoe's tongue flick and on off against your sister's clit! Wait till I win and do things to you! Also I have already called the pizza place. Can't wait to see who arrives.\" Alyssa couldn't keep back a tremble. If she could make Kaylee's friends lick her breasts and vagina, what could see do to Alyssa. Alyssa reminded herself not to act weird, to stay calm. But the heat between her legs was starting to build. Kaylee was now openly moaning like a porn star, unable to keep her sounds now. Alyssa could see that somehow Zoe was pleasing her with a tongue and a finger, while Carmen was practically breast feeding on her right breast, while massaging her left. It was clear that Kaylee was going to surrender as a loud shriek almost spit their ears. \"Reverse time!\" called out Zoe, liquid almost dripping down her throat. Alyssa couldn't believe what she was seeing as Carmen now brought her sister to a second and third orgasm, while Zoe somehow managed to her fingers inside Kaylee's bum. A door knock silenced everyone. \"That's your cue, Kayley!\" Barely able to walk, Kaylee stumbled towards the door, liquid juices leaking down her thighs. The other girls hid, watching as Kayley opened the door; a few bills in her hands all that she had. </span></div></div>",

Almost as much as I will enjoy seeing you and Noriko!\" Alyssa was relly getting annoyed by Tanya. This trash talking was unnecessary, it's not like they were playing for billions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, maybe I am a lesbian!

Three more Kings was just what the doctor ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what I got!\" declared Tanya. It seemed that Tanya rich vein of form continued. The Queen of Clubs led the straight flush leading Alyssa to wonder how was Tanya doing so well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko removed her blouse as she showed yet another hand without so much as a pair. Noriko didn't like even going to the beach in a full swimsuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still remembered an incident where somehow she ended up losing hers in the Ocean. Luckily her girl loving cousin Yuki always carried a spare or else she would have been publicly humiliated, instead of simply being privately mortified. She could still feel the waves against her bare bottom and exposed genitalia even though she put it on in record time underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as her bra was the third one here, she realised what it meant. She was in danger of going nude. She had lost every single hand, since she started playing this game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tanya continued her mocking, her ultra competitive nature on full display, Alyssa and Noriko tried to avoid staring at each other's brassieres. Alyssa was certain now that she really was gay or at least bisexual. She wanted Noriko to be her girlfriend, though she had no idea if Noriko felt that way or was just being nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko knew that if she was brave, this beautiful girl could be a potential partner. Would her parents accept her dating a western girl? She somehow doubted it; but why shouldn't she? It's not like Alyssa was experienced or promiscuous in any way.

But.....\" Alyssa almost screamed when she saw the 10 High Straight Flush. How on Earth was Tanya so lucky, especially since she'd barely picked up today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriki wailed as she showed her hand. The highest card was a Queen. To make matters worse, she had a seven instead of a 6 which would have made Zoe forfeit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa saw Tanya's grinning face. There was only one option. \"Tanya, if you spare Noriko; I'll strip and do the forfeit for her!\" \"Alyssa Chan, you must not!\" responded Noriko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, kiddo!

This was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko stood nude before her. It took all of Alyssa's strength not to look between her legs, but to look her in the eye. Tentatively, Noriko moved her hands to Alyssa's sky blue panties and kneeled down. She looked up at Alyssa for permission. Alyssa nodded, swallowing hard. Had she always dreamed of being with someone like Noriko? She had thought about Asian girls before, but never made the connection. Look at the beauty now, the idea that Alyssa was heterosexual was laughable. Bit by bit, Noriko lowered the wet panties, the stain so heavy that liquid was still going down her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya smirked to herself. She had won. Granted all this lesbian stuff was a lot to take it, Tanya liked being in charge. It was always so embarrassing the way her friends were so free. That would change now. And outing Alyssa was just the icing on the cake. She never believed that silly gamer thing was legitimate. She was just faking it, to seem cool. After this night, Tanya would be the head of their clique which would expand to include the little freshman and her Japanese romantic companion. The slight moan as Alyssa's panties touched her ankles was all the evidence Tanya needed that she was on the right path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was thrilled for Alyssa. She definitely got the gay vibe from the little hottie. It was nice to see a girl coming clean about who she is. And now that Zoe finally had Carmen, maybe she too could be happy. Carmen felt a rush. The rush like she hadn't had before. Not even during that nude streak outside. It wasn't the same as the feelings that she had kept suppressed for Zoe until tonight. Noriko's face was buried deep inside Alyssa who was really breaking the sound barrier. It had only been a few seconds and already it looked like Alyssa was going to explode all over Noriko's eyes, nose and lips. It was so hot, she couldn't help moving a hand between Zoe's legs. Zoe quickly reciprocated as hormones ran as wild as a professional webcam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko was still amazed that Alyssa was trusting her this fast. They barely knew each other and now they were heading for a relationship. She was so tight, Noriko was in no doubt as to her experience. Noriko was going to date this girl. Noriko was going to marry this girl one day. Tonight was the beginning of what she was certain would be a lifelong partnership. And Izanami be praised, she tasted so magnificent. The soft bare skin devoid of any covering, combined with the salty taste of a fine young woman was increasing Noriko's own libido. She felt the heat generated in her loins increase. Her juices were started to flow without touch. And the buckling of the girl, now spread open and breathing heavily was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be long. She simply had no resistance. Alyssa knew she would orgasm in public in front of 2 other nude women, who she couldn't be sure, might be masturbating themselves. Each touch made her quiver and turned her legs to rubber. She tried to keep from trapping the sexy woman's head with her thighs. She tried to extend the pleasure. She knew that if she surrendered, a wave would begin that might never end. She tried to keep from screaming out Noriko's name and a number of sexual expletives. But all she could to was cry out in ecstasy before the inevitable reaching of the apex brought forth a cascade of fluids and a deluge of climaxes, one after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya was so glad that she filmed this. All four of the girls had came. She somehow was able to get each one's spams on her phone, which she quickly hid. All four were panting before Carmen and Zoe holding hands ran up to Kaylee's rooms. Kaylee's loud snores were still audible, but all Noriko and Alyssa were doing were kissing and canoodling next to each other, breaking only to pant, before restarting. \"Uh love birds?\" That got the two to separate. \"Shall we continue or are you both giving up?\"</span></div></div>",

She also elected to keep the King since it was a high card, and she dumped the 5 and 4 since they didn't do anything for her hand.  She got back another 10 giving her a three of a kind which she knew would be one of the top hands in the room.  As she looked up from her cards she glanced around the table to read the expressions on each of the girls' faces to try and gauge what they thought about their hand.  When she looked at her sister she saw a clear look of worry on her face, and she knew that Kaylee managed to get another bad hand.  Hopefully bad enough to be the worst.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Carmen stated, \"showtime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa was quick to show her three 10's.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Alyssa, Kaylee never told us that her sister moonlighted as a poker pro,\" Zoe joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa smiled proudly, but didn't want to give away that she been playing amongst friends and online for a while, \"Beginner's luck, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe showed a pair of Aces, Carmen had two pair: Jacks and 3's, and Tanya had a pair of 2's.  Once again that left Kaylee as the last person to show and she flung her Queen high busted straight draw on the table, \"I hate poker!\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's four in a row for you Kaylee,\" Tanya stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know,\"  Kaylee replied, \"I don't need a reminder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the embarrassment of losing as well as undressing in front of her friends, Kaylee's bratty side started to show up.  Acting like a child in the middle of a tantrum she took off her light pink under-blouse revealing the lacy black bra underneath.  She then threw the shirt onto the ground and sat there pouting with her arms crossed over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stayed like that until Alyssa got done dealing her hand and she had to take a look at her cards.

She knew that poker was as much a game of skill as it was of luck, and there was no doubt that she was getting unbelievably lucky so far.  Unfortunately the same could not be said for her sister Kaylee who had lost all four of the previous hands so far, and was sitting across the table from Alyssa in just her black lace bra, jeans and (not known to Alyssa) matching black lace panties.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa didn't even bother mucking her 10 when it was her turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what's everyone got?' she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen turned over a flush, Zoe had a pair of 5's and Tanya had a pair of 8's.  The four girls then turned to Kaylee and she put down a busted straight draw: 5, 6, 8, 9 and a King.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa knew it was mean, but when she saw Kaylee's hand she couldn't help but start laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your problem?\" Kayle asked.  \" You think it's funny that I'm losing every hand?  Let's see what you've got and maybe it won't be so funny when you have to start taking off clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Kaylee,\" Alyssa replied as she tried to regain her composure. \"I didn't mean to laugh, it's just that....\" then she slowly revealed her hand turning over the 7 of spades, then the 7 of diamonds, then the 7 of clubs and last the 7 of hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Kaylee's face as she revealed her hand and saw the shock in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe whistled then said, \"Wow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee couldn't believe that her sister had all the cards that she needed to make her straight.  Giving Alyssa a look that could kill she stood up and quickly unbutton and unzipped her skinny jeans.  She wasted no time in pushing them down off her hips and showing off her matching black lace panties to the group.  She shimmied them down her legs, stepped out of them, and then remained standing for a few moments with her hands at her sides and gave a sarcastic twirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!  Everybody happy now!  Did you all get a good look!?!  You've got me down to my underwear, yay!\" Kaylee said in a bratty tone that Alyssa and the other girls were all too familiar with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Alyssa wouldn't admit it out loud part of her was happy about it.  Her and Kaylee got along but like any siblings they had their occasional disagreements, fights, and arguments.  It was never really anything serious, but they still happened nonetheless.  Seeing Kaylee get embarrassed in front of her friends and taken down a notch was amusing to her, but even she felt a little bad that Kaylee was the only one that had lost so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Kaylee's turn to deal and since she was in one of her bratty moods she was practically flinging cards at the other girls.  There was an uncomfortable silence for a little while as the other girls exchanged glances with each other.

She was having a great run with the cards that she was getting and she didn't want to didn't want to do anything that would throw off her mojo.  She figured if she was going to have to take off any clothing, even if it's just her sneakers, that she'd rather lose fair and square rather than give away a hand.  <i>Giving up a hand now could be the difference between exposure or modesty later in the game.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Kaylee asked if Alyssa wanted any cards, she simply nodded her head no and stood pat.  Much to her surprise each of Kaylee's friends took four cards.  <i>That's pretty odd, usually they take three at most and that only seems to happen when they've already made a pair.</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Kaylee sighed, sounding as if she was resigned to losing another hand, \"what's everyone got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got nothing,\" Zoe announced and she showed a Queen high.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too\" Tanya said and showed a 10 high with a 6 kicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I make three, absolutely nothing,\" Carmen replied and showed a 10 high with an 8 kicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa could tell what was going on.  All of Kaylee's friends ruined their hands to avoid her having to take off her bra or panties.  Now she felt kind of bad about about having stuck to her straight and she laid her cards out rather sheepishly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee then turned her cards over and showed just a Jack high.  At first what her friends did for her didn't register until she realized that she was off the hook for the loss.  She smiled at them, \"You girls are the best, you didn't have to do that,\" she told them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends played dumb.  \"I didn't do anything other than have a bad hand,\" Tanya replied.  \"It was bound to happen sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee grinned and blushed a little because she knew that her friends had messed up their hands so that she wasn't either topless or bottomless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya then took off her white jacket and set it on the back of her chair, \"Now your losing streak is over so you can relax and have fun again,\" she said to Kaylee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe got all the cards back together, shuffled the deck and dealt out the next hand.

This hadn't really amounted to much apart from a quick dinner of macaroni and cheese and the being rushed off to her room upstairs before Kaylee's friends got here. Amanda wished she could hang out with them, but Kaylee got weirdly territorial around them and tended to act like Amanda got in the way. This doesn't stop Amanda from thinking they were totally awesome however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amanda's homework is done, and remains next to her backpack. She has taken to absentmindedly filling in a coloring book when the sound of breaking glass emanates from downstairs. Deciding that this warrants investigating, Amanda heads down the staircase to the living room, ignoring her sister's warnings to stay upstairs for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Amanda reaches the living room, she finds their father's card table set up at the center. Zoe, Tanya and Carmen are already sitting around it. Kaylee is at the entrance to the kitchen, sweeping the remains of a glass into a dustpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What happened?\" Amanda says, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...hey, Mandy. It's nothing, okay? I just dropped a glass. You can go back upstairs.\" Kaylee says. She seems somewhat insistent about the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, Mandy! What's up?\" Zoe asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Erm...not much. What are you guys doing down here?\" Amanda asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We're...uh...going to play a game so...\" Kaylee begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh! What game?\" Amanda pipes up, excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Strip poker!\" Zoe says with a bit of a giggle. Kaylee shoots Zoe an alarmed look. Amanda frowns slightly. She's heard of poker. She learned to play when her dad taught her and her sister. But she doesn't know what the 'strip' part means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's 'strip' poker?\" Amanda asks innocently. Kaylee looks even more exasperated and Zoe giggles in full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...do you know what poker is?\" Zoe asks. Amanda nods cutely. \"Well, strip poker is like regular poker, except whoever has the worst hand has to take off something they're wearing.\" Amanda feels her face go hot. A taking off clothes game sounded a little weird, but it also felt like something she shouldn't be doing, which of course made her immediately want to do it. One time, Amanda spied on her sister taking off her clothes in front of her computer. She wondered if this was something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I want to play!\" Amanda blurts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-what!? No!\" Kaylee says. \"I'm not playing strip poker with my eight year old sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aww, why not?\" Zoe butts in. \"I think it's kind of cute! I mean...we're just girls having a little fun anyway. It's mostly innocent. Mandy is awesome, I think she should totally get to play!\" Amanda beams at Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It <i>is</i> pretty cute, Kay. And besides, it's just us girls here. I mean, sure if we had some guys from school over it would be <i>really</i> weird, but with us I think it's fine. It'll be fun, even!\" Carmen adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If I'm being honest, I don't see playing strip poker with your little sister as that much weirder than playing strip poker with you. If they want her here, I'm cool with it.\" Tanya offerers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine,\" Kaylee says, defeated. \"I guess my friends want to play strip poker with a 3rd grader. Weirdos.\" Kaylee sighs heavily. \"Sit down, Mandy. They'll deal you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yay!\" Amanda says as she skips over to the table and falls excitedly into her seat. Kaylee eventually joins the table too and the cards are passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know how to play, Mandy?\" Zoe asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh huh!

I'm really good!\" Amanda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We'll see,\" Zoe says mischievously as Amanda picks up her cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hand:</b> 3 (diamonds), 5 (clubs), Jack (diamonds), 7 (diamonds), 3 (spades)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Clothing Remaining:</b> baby Nikes, socks, choker, overalls, t-shirt, panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She showed Zoe the other two and the older girl picked one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen and Tanya were still talking and had noticed nothing. Then Kaylee returned with a bunch of full bottles and dropped them next to her spot. \"Here we go then.\" She had a pair of kings and thought that it might work. And it did. Amanda turned her cards and proudly showed her two pairs swinging her arms from left to right and back. Zoe yawned and casually put her cards down with three cards showing the number five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya did not show her cards. \"Nothin\" she murmured and took off her white jacket and placed it carefully behind her. \"I will deal now.\" She grabbed the cards and distributed them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda picked up four spades and a diamond. No pair, diamond King high.

Sit with us and play.\" Her sister was not pleased with this further outbreak of childishness of her much younger sister. She felt embarrassed by her behaviour and already regretted that she had allowed her to join the game. Slumber party strip poker required different participants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong sweetie?\" Zoe purred and reached over to Amanda. She wanted to give her arm a playful tweak. But Amanda rolled and the hand of the teenage girl got the hipbone instead. It was too late to call the order to the muscles back. Accordingly the tiny hipbone was squeezed. \"Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah\" the preteen girl screamed and bucked like a donkey, but on her back. \"Sorry, didn't mean to get you there.\" But the girl had already rolled into a ball like a hedgehog. \"I can't play like this.\" Kaylee protested and put her cards down. She looked for the others to support her view that they should play without the kid but did not find support there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get some new cards. Maybe they are better then.\" Carmen said weakly. \"Now hear her say. Still wearing all clothes and wishing other luck.\" Kaylee was fuming. Carmen did not step into this trap. Instead she said calmly \"It is nice that you, Amanda, play with us. Please come back and sit down.\" This kind request solved the tension and the game was resumed. Zoe and Carmen exchanged looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need four cards. I just have a King.\" Kaylee opened her mouth to protest against this new break of rules but Carmen put her hand on her arm. \"It is good to keep the highest card and hope for the best.\" And she was right, but on her own expense. With her measly pair of Jacks she could not beat two pairs and King high held by Amanda nor what the others held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Carmen took off her tennis shoes Kaylee smiled briefly. New cards were dealt.

Again, her sister Kaylee still found a hair in the soup. \"You don't have to brag if your cards are already good.\" The little girl's eyes turned from brightness into sadness. Why was her sister so mean to her? But Carmen retorted instead. \"Possibly she has really bad cards and just bluffs. You might go for a riskier strategy and lose in the end. And I hope you do indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mood chilled again. Kaylee said nothing but gave Carmen and her sister a fierce look. Amanda tried to stare back and frowned as much as she could. It was such a comical sight that Tanya burst into a laugh and rolled on her back, her socks rising towards the ceiling before she rolled on her side. Amanda could not hold it and followed. Quickly the whole group was laughing and commenting each other's faces. It was a girls slumber party poker. Moods could swing quickly any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee wanted to let Carmen know that she would not lose this round with her pair Kings high, but she refrained from any comment and settled down. She even did not smile more when her previous verbal opponent Carmen lost again. \"A pair of Aces, and that is now enough. That is not fair and against the odds.\" Nevertheless she played along and removed her socks. It was the clear choice for her, because she wanted to hide her really tiny breasts for the whole evening if possible. Loss of clothes would have to happen south of the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we have two pairs.\" Zoe commented, surprising everyone. \"Who has two pairs? I had two pairs of, what was it again?\" Tanya had answered, simply because she had no idea what Zoe was talking about. \"Bare feet.\" Amanda suddenly beamed, wiggled her bare feet towards the other girls and said \"Nothing beats two pairs of bare feet.\" Carmen weakly showed her bare feet, just to please Amanda. Everyone else had a lot of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew cards were dealt. Amanda found 7, 8, 9, 10 in different colors and a King again.

Now she wanted something better by having the best hand of the whole slumber party sleepover. And she had just learned to play cool or pretend to have good or bad cards, but at eight years of age she had no idea how and why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile others were shedding more cards she held her nose high into the air and said \"One card only\". \"Now look at her, now she is into the game.\" Zoe said apprehensively. \"Yeah, you who still wears the full set of clothes encourages her. Aren't you hot? Wanna shed your skirt maybe?\" Carmen was still grumbling over her double defeat and getting concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe card Amanda picked up made her jump with joy first. But that quickly changed when she looked closer. It was a 5, not a 6 she required and initially interpreted it to be. When everybody else had put his hand down she still was sitting with her cards in her hand, a single teardrop slipping over her right cheek. Zoe felt sorry for the little girl and carried the teardrop away with a touch of a single finger. \"Was it not the right card?\" she asked. It was now quiet in the room. Amanda shook her head and put her cards on the floor, not showing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer short dream to be praised as the girl in the round with the best hand had turned sour. Now she was having trouble to open her own overalls. Had any of the girls tried to help she would have cried in frustration. But now she was fully occupied with the task of opening buttons and zipper of the overalls. This girl needed no help with undressing. Another teardrop followed while she stood up and wiggled herself out of the overalls. Now she was the first girl showing her bare legs. She slumped on her belly and held her feet up in the air, moving them forward and back synchronized. When Zoe and Carmen exchanged looks indicating to the tiny bare feet she did not notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further comment Kaylee took the cards to deal them again. Once her sister was out of the game they could play as they wanted without her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda hardly looked at the three Queens she held on her hand.

She was still new to poker and there was such a wide variety of combinations that the other girls might have to help her along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Mandy.\" Zoe apologetically replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well that's okay! I just wasn't lucky enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls breathed a silent sigh of relief. A lot of kids could turn into sore losers pretty quickly but Amanda seemed happy to be playing a game with older girls to not care about losing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have to take off my clothes now?\" Amanda asked, already kicking off her sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down there sissy!\" Kaylee exclaimed, waiving her hand at Amanda as she undid a buckle on her overalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" Her face filled with innocence, Amanda was worried she had screwed up the game somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only take off one thing when you lose.\" Carmen explained. \"Otherwise the game would be over real quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Amanda replied. \"Yeah, I knew that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda sat in thought while the other girls stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya looked around. \"Okay,well... Kaylee, you want to deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Amanda squealed. \"My turn isn't over yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquinting, \"Wha-?\" was all Tanya could offer in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst!\" Amanda whispered to Zoe, beckoning her closer while chewing on a finger nail. \"I need to ask you something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe smirked and leaned forward. \"What's up?\" she whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda glanced at the other girls at the table before cupping her hands over Zoe's ear. \"What am I supposed to take off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey giggled. Amanda had already taken off her shoes but Zoey didn't have the heart to correct her a second time so soon. \"Anything you like sweetie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cupped Zoe's ear again. \"Yeah, but what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe shrugged. \"Start with your pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain cupping Zoe's ear, \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda bounced down from her chair. \"Okay, I've decided to take off my overalls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you-\" Carmen started, stopping herself when Zoe stuck out her hand and shook her head. Kaylee rolled her eyes dramatically but the rest of the girls just chuckled. Amanda really was adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overalls were already half off due to her exuberance. Amanda struggled with the other clasp but soon worked it free to expose the peach My Little Pony t-shirt that had been mostly covered until now. Amanda wiggled the rest of the way out of the undersized denim that she was quickly growing out of to reveal the pastel green panties that sat above her lengthening skinny pale legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's face reddened standing in front of the other girls but she was more flustered by her clumsy and unsophisticated display than she was embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished the \"strip\" portion of the round Amanda threw her arms out to the side in a sort of 'ta-da' moment before quickly taking her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet. Moooving along then...\" Tanya smacked the now shuffled deck down in front of Kaylee. \"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more hands were dealt with each time Amanda worried that she would lose again, but thankfully Carmen and her sister had worse luck and each lost their pants in turn. But Amanda felt that something wasn't right. Sitting at the table everything felt strangely normal. This was just plain old poker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda poked her head under the table. She could see her sisters bare legs and bits of her pink thong in the dim lighting under the table, her bad luck on display, but righting herself in her chair Amanda was again met with familiar, boring poker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we're playing this right.\" Amanda said, voicing her concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee began to deal the next hand. \"Yes we are sis. Just... shush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're not. We need to play on the carpet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee stopped dealing with a sigh. \"And why's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're just picking clothes we can't see. We can't look at you. You could even be cheating.\" Amanda offered suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she has a point Kaylee. It's a lot easier to cover up at the table but that kinda goes against the concept of the game.\" Zoe said, again supporting Amanda who smiled back at her with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says the girl still wearing pants!\" Kaylee snapped back. \"Fine! Whatever. Let's move to the carpet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda ran out into the middle of the living room and plopped her green butt onto the carpet while the others girls moved with less enthusiasm. Amanda pushed herself up again and ran back to grab Zoey's hand, pulling her forward and ensuring they sit next to each other on the floor. Meanwhile the other girls stole pillows and cushions from the couch to make their new playing area more comfortable. Landing on the carpet again Amanda kicked both of her legs out straight in front of her, opening and closing them repeatedly in V shape, an easy task for someone in her fourth year of gymnastics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sissy,\" Amanda ordered, the other girls still settling in, \"Deal 'em!\"</span></div></div>",

You just have to practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about this? Can you do this?\" Amanda pulled her legs up one by one, over her shoulders and behind her head. She rolled onto the small of her back before locking her ankles together. Her arms were stuck out in front of her, resting on the underside of her thighs. The green fabric between her legs stretched as her crotch and butt pointed up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I definitely can't do that!\" Zoe answered, more impressed than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda, are you playing with us or not?\" Kaylee asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay, lighten up. She's just a little hyper.\" Zoe defended her young friend. Amanda again smiled at her before rocking herself back and forth to pickup the cards on the floor next to her. She was proud of her gymnast skills and wanted to keep showing them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is getting stupid.\" The big sister was starting to sound as whiny as the younger one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chillax Kaylee.\" Tanya echoed. \"Let's just make the game more interesting. From now on the winner of each round gets to strip something off the loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo. I like it!\" Carmen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that should make it more interesting. More incentive to win at least!\" Zoe winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee sighed. \"Okay. That sounds good to me too.\" She didn't even want to ask her. \"Manda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Sounds good!\" She gave a weird salute still wrapped up in her leg ball, cards in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand progresses as normal. Amanda thinks she has a pretty good hand with three of a kind. When everyone shows their cards she laughs at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha! I beat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee was momentarily worried then smiled. \"Heh. No, you definitely did not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea-huh I did too! Look! I matched three eights!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you didn't! You matched two threes!\" Kaylee shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked over her cards again. She had mistaken her threes for eights. She suddenly went from having a decent hand to having virtually nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... That's not fair!\" Amanda moped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, all I know is that my two Jacks beat your two threes. You lost sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda threw her cards down, hugging her arms and rocking side to side on her back. This was more in line with what some of the girls were worried about. But Amanda was at least consoled by the fact that Zoe was the actual winner and not her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tanya...\" Zoe said, standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya stood with a groan and flopped her arms to her sides but Zoe moved in closer, whispering with her in private. After a few moments the two of them knelt down on either side of Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Mandy.\" Zoe started. \"How you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I gue- HEY! Hehehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe and Tanya grabbed each of Mandy's arms and pulled her body into the air, legs still wrapped behind her head. Amanda giggled as she found herself suspended in front of everyone, as helpless as a turtle on its back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swing me! Swing me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe and Tanya rocked Amanda back and forth through the air gaining more and more momentum as she swung. Amanda giggled happily to this new game, watching as the other two girls on the carpet dipped in and out of sight past the crotch of her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe and Tanya nodded to each other and each removed one of their hands from Amanda's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready? One...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls grabbed Amanda's ankles and let go of her arms causing her to fall back through her own legs as her ankles were separated. Her body flopped upside down, her legs now suspended in the air. With her body rotating so forcefully, not to mention gravity doing its thing, her t-shirt quickly slid up her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attack!\" yelled Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls tickled Amanda with their free hands, taking advantage of every patch of bare skin they could find, not to mention her ticklish armpits and the soles of her feet. Amanda squealed and laughed as the hands roamed her body, poorly defending her most exposed areas while she writhed in delight from so much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks fun!\" Carmen shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda couldn't see Carmen or Kaylee get up since she was facing the wrong way, but was very aware when four more hands joined the onslaught of tickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BAAHahahahahaHAhaha!!!\" The young girl laughed uncontrollably, twisting desperately and flailing wildly. One of her arms accidentally popped out of the sleeve of her t-shirt causing her most protective garment to collect under her chin, useless to her now. This only gave the hands assaulting her more sensitive skin to attack. Her thighs, her calves, the backs of her knees, her neck, her sides, her chest; most of her skin was fully exposed to the world and tickled without mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister started blowing raspberries on her belly button, the change in sensation helping to re-sensitize her for more tickling across her tummy. Carmen pinched and poked her butt and dove her fingers under the edges of her panties trying to provoke more and more of a struggle from the girl as she attacked up and down each thigh; a sort of drive-by tickling across her green underpants. Tanya's hand ran the length of Amanda's body, darting from place to place with no real pattern, trying to find the least exploited patches of skin. While all of this was happening, Zoe gradually slipped off each of Amanda's socks, a task interrupted by the girl's explosions of resistance as well as Zoe's own contributions to the tickle-fest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpside down, the blood had rushed to Amanda's head. Her face was red. Her stomach hurt from wiggling and laughing. Her arms were tired and defeated and hung limply to the floor mimicking her ravaged hair. She was exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleas-haHA! Please stop. AH! Uncle! Mercy! BWAHAH!!! Anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pitiful cries were finally answered. Zoe and Tanya lowered the spent girl to the floor setting her down on her back. They released her legs which fell lifelessly to floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl may as well have been dead. Her arms lay above her head. Her hair sprawled in every direction, partially covering her face. Her shirt was mostly off, covering more of her neck than her chest. Her small pink nipples poked up into the air. Her stomach rose and fell with heavy breaths. Her panties were twisted and wedgied in both front and back, exposing bits of butt check and crotch as her legs lay splayed and spread beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had completely forgotten about losing. Not only that, but Zoe's idea had stimulated the young girl into such a fervour that she had expended the ball of energy that had been building within her. The half naked girl now struggled to move, let alone do much of anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that was kinda fun!\" Kaylee admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I think she needs a rest now.\" suggested Carmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll deal,\" Tanya said. \"She can sit out this round.\"</span></div></div>",

Well the shirt is fine, but I don't like you wearing it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya scooted over on her knees to unbutton her friend's silk shirt. They glanced at each other as Tanya tugged it up and out of Zoe's skirt before sliding it off her arms and setting it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very, very pink.\" Tanya commented, staring at the redhead's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do you like them?\" she replied, shaking her larger tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya looked away. \"I meant the bra... but yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we take bets on who will be topless first?\" Carmen asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it won't be you,\" Kaylee replied. \"Look at the sweater you're still wearing. I don't know why you took your pants off before that huge bundle of fabric.\" Carmen blushed slightly. She was self-conscious surrounded by so many well endowed girls and would rather show off her vag before her bra. In her own head she had more in common with Amanda's chest, the young girl still exposed as she lay on the ground recovering from their tickle attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Kaylee,\" Tanya said, dealing the next hand. \"I'll take care of her yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the next round underway the girls eyed each other up, trying to figure out how big of a risk they need to take to win the round. Not losing clothing was good, but taking off someone else's was even better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother smile crept onto Tanya's face. \"I'm just going to throw this out there because I'm pretty sure the rest of you are screwed... flush of diamonds!\" She made a show of laying her cards down in front of her. The girls looked around to see who lost but Carmen already knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have anything?\" Zoe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I broke a pair trying for a straight. Just didn't work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Kaylee? I told you I could take care of this!\" Zoe shuffled toward her new victim. \"Arms up hun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya tore the red sweater up and off her head revealing in a flash the thin white tank top it had been hiding. Carmen immediately moved to straighten her ill-fitting top and even readjusted her bra trying to improve upon her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya leaned back and eyed up her work. \"I bet Carmen isn't the only one here with matching underwear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we all knew where this night was going. I'd be surprised if someone wasn't matching!\" Kaylee noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe leaned over and poked Amanda's belly button but didn't get much of a response. She crawled closer and tried to pull Amanda's shirt down, but didn't get it very far with only one arm in it. \"Hey Mandy,\" Zoe said brushing the girl's hair away from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda lifted her head and stared wondrously at what was in front of her. \"...boobies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! These are boobies!\" Zoe laughed. \"You still playing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda sat up and looked around. She poked her free arm through her shirt sleeve and pulled it down just far enough to regain some modesty but immediately regretting her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hot,\" she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... sorry? But there's not much more you should take off!\" Zoe teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee sighed. \"Well you can go leave us alone or you can lose a hand and lose your shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe frowned. \"Aw, don't be so mean Kaylee,\" she said, tucking some of Amanda's hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still playing.\" Her big sister wasn't about to get rid of her that easily. Amanda straightened her My Little Pony shirt defiantly and stuck her chin into the air. But her twisted and wedgied panties remained in their unkempt state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll do the honors then,\" Kaylee stated, grabbing the deck from Tanya. \"Because you girls are going down!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amanda repositioned herself on the floor, her crotch feeling funny, and looked across at the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to think of what the rest of you should do once I get all of you naked!\" Kaylee teased, dealing for the new round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was just as confident though. \"Oh hunny, I know exactly what I'll do; I'll be looking down on you as your tongue gets tired, and it won't be from all that talking you've been doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls laughed nervously at Zoe's burn, even Amanda although she didn't know why it was so clever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, someone's pretty cocky for not having one!\" came Kaylee's weak retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chatter died down as everyone examined their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda brushed more stray hair away from her face and blinked her eyes repeatedly. She was still feeling worn, hot and used after being the other girl's tickle victim and wasn't sure why she had that good funny feeling. But determined to show up her sister, she tried to figure out what to do with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a 5-6-7 of hearts plus two more 7s; a club and spade. But Amanda wasn't paying enough attention to her three of a kind. She knew that full sets were better and discarded the two black sevens to try to complete a flush, straight, or even a straight flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the risky, reckless, and amateurish strategy left her without a prayer. She ended up with another 6 and a 10 of clubs. Complete and utter garbage. She set her cards down in front of her before the other girls were even done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee no longer had a look of confidence on her face as she glanced around. \"Umm... okay. I have a pair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, all talk. I have three fours.\" Zoe sat up, baring her pink bra and ample chest proudly as if to say 'this is all you'll get from me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya and Carmen in turn come up with two pairs each causing the girls to glance between the two sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looked down at Amanda's hand, face up on the floor. \"What do you have Mandy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" she said defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, it's okay! You can't win everything. But that does mean I have to take something from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda stood up awkwardly. \"I know! I didn't forget!\" She walked the few steps it took to stand in front of Zoe, still sitting on a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe eyed her up considerately. \"Did you want me to take off your shirt, hun? Since you're hot..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. I guess.\" Amanda didn't sound happy but she wasn't moping either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe began to lift the bottom of Amanda's shirt when she noticed her panties were still well mangled from earlier. The pastel green underpants sat oddly on her hips and were severely twisted. One of the bottoms hems of the crotch had slid over and wedged itself up into the girl's slit, partly exposing one of her lips and no doubt rubbing itself oddly into her sex. Meanwhile there was a wedgie in the back and most of one of her butt cheeks was hanging free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um... let me sort you out first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe stuck her fingers into the front leg of the panties, brushing against the girl's pussy as she released the fabric from her lips. She turned her to the side and reached around to also pick out the wedgie before running her fingers along the waistband of the green garment, straightening everything out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that should feel a lot better, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda turned back to face Zoe and thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she replied. Her funny feeling was now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Okay, well... I tried!\" Zoe chuckled, lifting the My Little Pony shirt for the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Amanda exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda hesitated. \"Can you take off my panties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe glanced over at the other girls, specifically Kaylee who just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can! If that's what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl nodded. \"Yeah. I don't want to lose my pony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe hooked her fingers into the sides of the pastel underwear and easily slipped them down the girl's legs, exposing the smooth bare mound the fabric had been wedged into since the tickling assault. The small V that ran up her frame from either side of her pussy was partially obscured by the t-shirt, not nearly long enough to offer any coverage below her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we have our first bottomless player ladies!\" announced Zoe. \"It seems at this rate she'll probably be our first loser too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda sat back down on the carpet pulling her knees up to her chest. Her bottom lip was stuck out. \"I don't want to be a loser...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe leaned over. \"I'm sorry hunny, I wasn't trying to be mean! There are always winners and losers in games. But the losers can have fun too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda didn't look impressed. But Zoe knew how to turn her around. She stuck out her hand and gave a quick tickle along the side of Amanda's shirt. She flinched but only hugged her legs tighter. The next tickle landing in her armpit and got a bigger response. \"Quit it,\" Amanda said with a smile, quickly wiping it off her face. But she couldn't hold out forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe needed a more vulnerable target so she reached for skin, specifically Amanda's tiny feet. She grabbed hold of an ankle and stuck her other hand under the small foot, tickling up a storm. Amanda immediately kicked out her other leg and started giggling. Falling back onto the carpet she tried to pull herself away but Zoe wasn't having it. She leaned back and dragged the girl towards her, the carpet forcing Amanda's 'pony' to once again ride up her chest. Amanda's butt was pulled up onto Zoe's lap, her legs sticking straight into the air on either side of her head. Zoe was now positioned to make quick work of all that pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no clothing to protect the young girl from below her chest to the tips of her toes, a full frontal finger assault rained down upon her sensitive skin, causing more and more laughter to fill the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without warning - or a formal invitation - Carmen also joined the fray, eager to force further screams of laughter from their tickle toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are ridiculous!\" laughed Kaylee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teens roamed Amanda's body with their hands. The girl's defenses were for naught. Every effort made to evade their fingers only opened a new opportunity. Clamping her hands in her armpits forced the tickling digits to her toes. She kicked her legs in the air to protect her feet so they moved to her stomach and sides. She planted her heels behind Zoe's shoulders and lifted most of her body, thrusting her pelvis in the air and forcing Zoe to look down onto her crotch. Carmen took that as an invitation to attack her smooth hanging bum, Amanda swatting at Carmen's hands with little effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to immobilize the scrambling girl further, Zoe tried to repeat her success. She pressed both of Amanda's legs into her chest and stood, hoisting the inverted young girl into the air once more. The pony on her chest again failed to fight the force of gravity with all of Amanda's squirming and advanced past her chest. Carmen, still kneeling in front, ran her fingernails up and down the sides Amanda's exposed torso bringing squeal after delightful squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get her feet!\" yelled Zoe. Carmen stood to carry out her orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHahaha... AHHHAHAhahahaha!!!\" Amanda laughed between breaths, soon doing more of the former than she could of the latter. She was almost naked and had to stop her attackers somehow. She grabbed hold of Carmen's legs and pulled herself closer. She tickled the knees in front of her but got no reaction. She contemplated biting before she looked up to see the only thing she was able to past her bunched up t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This girl won't be able to walk after we're done wi- AAHHH!!! HA! HO! MMMahah! No, STAHP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda had yanked Carmen's red panties down her legs and attacked her vagina. Her small fingers flicked over and between Carmen's soft lips and tickled the length of her slit. An overwhelming combination of pleasure and ticklishness coursed through Carmen's body as lightning bolts of activity fired from her clit and labia. She quickly backed away, tripping over the panties around her ankles and collapsing to the floor in shock from the few seconds of intense stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carmen fell the entire room broke into laughter having realizing what happened. Zoe crossed her arms and leaned back, laughing heartily. Amanda's spread legs remained pinned on either side of Zoe's ample chest further enhancing Zoe's cleavage. She felt victorious even though she was still captive, suspended and completely naked from her neck down, er, up. But she smiled looking over at Carmen who was tugging her panties back up her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels good, right?\" Amanda asked as the laughter died down. Carmen met her inverted gaze quizzically. \"Like a sorta funny good. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen secured her precious panties back over her crotch. \"Yeah, I guess you could say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda nodded. \"Well I think so,\" she said, grabbing her own crotch with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee wiped tears from her eyes. \"Sis that was hilarious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was definitely effective!\" chuckled Tanya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe finally lowered Amanda to the floor again. \"That's usually my kinda thinking!\" she added with her signature wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was not only proud of herself but she felt warm and invigorated by her win in their tickle war. She hopped up to her feet and pulled her shirt down as far as it would go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who deals next?\"</span></div></div>",

In some ways Carmen was as much to blame for that as anyone but Amanda was fun to abuse. She took their harrassment with a smile and a giggle. But Carmen's pussy now ached, having been awoken by the young girl's small digits to the internal arousal that had been building within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she doing? She just split her pair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen cursed herself for losing all concentration. She still managed to pickup another pair, but it was hard to do worse than a pair of threes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya once again proudly displayed her hand, having not lost much of anything. \"Another straight for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I picked two pairs!\" came Amanda's excited voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe, Kaylee and Carmen all showed their cards simultaneously, none of them confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so everyone has a pair?\" Zoe was surprised. \"Although I think my Jacks will keep me safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I won with a pair of fours?!\" Kaylee shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't win Kaylee,\" Zoe corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I didn't lose! So that's a win to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again Carmen,\" Tanya said, slinking her way across the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...\" Carmen said, a nervous smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya pulled herself in front of Carmen and began straightening the white tank top she eyed longingly. \"I told you I would take care of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen was blushing now. She was barely a B-cup and her insecurities about that ran deep. But it was a little late to turn back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya pulled the flimsy top off of Carmen's body, leaving her sitting on a pilling with nothing but her underwear to shield her from the other girls. Carmen nervously adjusted her bra straps, trying to make her already perky breasts look fuller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good look for you...\" Zoe teased. \"Half naked and embarrassed! You should wear that outfit more often!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen began shuffling the deck again. She couldn't afford another loss.</span></div></div>",

A card for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cards for everyone!\" Amanda pushed herself to her knees and threw her hands into the air. Her pussy was briefly on display again, her t-shirt rising enough to flash her belly button, before she sat back down placing her hands in her lap. She seemed to enjoy showing herself off to her sister's friends, especially since everyone was slowly losing their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the new round dealt Carmen finally felt more secure with her hand. A pair of nines followed by a 10-J-Q gave her some options. But she didn't want to split another pair. Dumping the 10 and Jack she managed to draw another Queen into her hand. Now she was confident. But who would lose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have two pair here,\" she said laying down her cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm flushing!!!\" came Amanda's excited yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez sis, are you sidelining as a card shark after school?\" Kaylee tossed her three of a kind into the center of their circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a shark! Sharks have fins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Card-shark... nevermind. Ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe showed off her single pair. \"I don't suppose you've fallen off your winning streak yet, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" Tanya grinned, displaying her two pairs. \"Not yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe sighed. \"Alright Mandy, get over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda scurried to her feet and hopped in front of Zoe, holding her hands in front of her slit after an awkward exchange of glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Zoe prodded. \"My skirt then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay down!\" Amanda giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be hard for you to take off my skirt if I'm laying down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want your panties!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe had been starting to stand but stopped herself. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took mine away so I want to take yours!\" Amanda seemed excited by the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense.\" Zoe leaned back on the carpet. Her skirt at least covered more of her than her panties did. All the same, she glanced over at Tanya. \"Thanks for this by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya chuckled. \"Hey, I think it's a good rule!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe flattened her body and Amanda fell down onto her older friend. She slid herself up the long legs and under Zoe's skirt. The whole scene looked like some reverse-birth art piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda came to a rest, her head, arms, and half her back concealed under Zoe's black skirt. The weight of Amanda on her legs forced Zoe to part them slightly, the young girls back half slumping to the floor, her round little ass still pointing up to the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls watched the lump under Zoe's skirt distort and shift. She was definitely taking her time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you fall asleep under there?\" razzed Zoe before a sudden burst of laughter left her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAha... Hey, that tickles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffled giggles came from under her skirt, followed by more laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... HehehehAH! Stop that!\" Zoe laughed. She pulled herself up enough to give a quick spank to Amanda's bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Zoe swatted the girl's supple bottom her expression changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA... ho... that doesn't... tickle. Oh-mmmMMmy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe convulsed sharply. She squeezed Amanda's ass while trying to push herself up off the floor but her body stiffened before she collapsed backward again stretching an arm over her head. Amanda's butt shifted again. Zoe's back arched. A hand slapped at her breasts, squeezing hungrily, still contained by her bright pink bra. Her other hand shot down and pressed the lump farther into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnnnugh! Ha! ...fuck!\" Zoe's spasms and sudden cries of pleasure took the other girls by surprise and was admittedly turning them on.  All the while Amanda's small legs and bum happily wiggled to and fro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the girls on the floor time seemed to stop but that didn't last for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya looked at Kaylee. The big sister gestured at Carmen. She sighed and advanced forward slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen spanked Amanda's bare cheeks a few times. \"Hey!\" No response. She grabbed each of Amanda's ankles and pulled her away from the busty redhead. Zoe quickly stopped her moaning and thrashing. Being dragged by Carmen, Amanda appeared from under the skirt and was pulling Zoe's panties down along with her. Seeing this, Carmen continued to drag her until Amanda had slipped the panties off each of Zoe's ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl twisted around on the floor and adjusted her shirt, panties in hand. \"What took you so long?\" Amanda asked. \"I can't tickle forever you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe sat up and brought her breathing under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting hot in here.\" Tanya commented, taking off her stylish white jacket. \"But really...\" she continued, looking at Zoe. \"She couldn't be that good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe raised her eyebrows and smiled. \"You should try her! I don't know what she was doing but... fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That's my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying Kaylee, she's good! As in really good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Zoe!\" Amanda said proudly. \"I like you too!\" She was once again oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen sat down and grabbed the deck. \"Shall we ladies?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the table put away, the girls got back to business. The cards were dealt and idle conversation continued while they all worked out their strategies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda ended up with a 4-5-6-7-J off the deal. She was sad that she didn't get a Queen; she especially liked the prettier face cards. But she remembered from playing with her dad that getting cards all in a row was a good thing so, disappointed, she traded in her Jack for a new card and ended up with a 3. They were all lower numbers but she hoped it would still be good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Zoe started, \"Whaddya have ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda put up her hand. \"I have a row.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... do you mean a straight?\" Zoe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Sorry, a straight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya responded by triumphantly slapping her cards on the table. \"Full house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls simultaneously groaned and congratulated Tanya. Amanda laid her cards down and poked Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost, didn't I?\" she asked sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe glanced over but had to do a double take. \"Um, actually no. You totally won! Hey guys, Mandy got a straight <i>flush</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Tanya exclaimed incredulously, both surprised and impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Good job Amanda!\" Carmen said, rubbing one of Amanda's outstretched feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but winning doesn't actually matter,\" interrupted Tanya. \"Who lost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have three of a kind,\" showed Carmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee slumped in frustration. \"I have a pair of Queens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looked confused. \"Wait, I have a pair of Queens too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you both lose!? Then get to the stripping you two!\" Carmen teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe shrugged. \"Seems fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock yourself out, I'm not taking off shit.\" Kaylee said in a huff. \"There aren't ties in poker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... I think there are actually,\" countered Tanya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dad said there are tiebreakers. It's the next highest card.\" Kaylee explained, scratching her head. \"They're like shoes... kickers! They're called kickers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well what's your kicker then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an Ace!\" Kaylee snootily declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well so do I.\" responded Zoe flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee's mouth dropped. \"What? Gimme your cards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Zoe said, outstretching her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick comparison the girls were dumbstruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two have the exact same hand!\" Carmen shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee again felt frustrated. \"That's not even possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but it just happened!\" apologized Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chillax Kaylee.\" Tanya echoed. \"Let's just say the winner of the round decides who loses a tie. That's more fun. No more 'kicker' nonsense. Actually...\" she pondered for a moment. \"Let's make the game even more interesting. How about from now on the winner of each round gets to strip something off the loser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo! I like it!\" Carmen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that does sound like more fun. Certainly more incentive to win!\" Zoe winked at Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee sighed. \"Okay. Fine. It's a good rule.\" She paused. She didn't even want to ask. \"Mandy?\" she said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda beamed. \"Yes sissy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who's the lo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ARE! YOU ARE!\" The young girl pointed and shouted before her sister could finish her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee huffed again. \"Fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Kay. Your sister likes me too much!\" Zoe booped Amanda on the nose with her finger and received a cute giggle in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee reached down to remove her socks before remembering the new rule. She beckoned toward her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Get it over with already.\" she growled, pointing her feet outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda rose from the floor and skipped forward, passing the elevated socks before straddling her sister's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? Take off my socks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down, kicking her legs out behind her sister on either side. \"But that's no fun! I want to take off your shirt!\" Amanda replied, already reaching for the buttons of her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee pleaded to the other girls. \"Don't I still get a say here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" Tanya replied. \"Makes sense that the winner would pick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee didn't respond. She realized she was turning into a poor sport. She leaned back, resting her hands on her sister's ankles and stuck her chest out to expedite Amanda's victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clean lines of Kaylee's white blouse were slowly broken as its buttons were undone one by one by her sister's dainty hands. Amanda slowly revealed the sexy pink camisole worn underneath. The low-neck-lined undershirt wasn't entirely sheer but it wasn't opaque either. Her dark undergarments were easily seen through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can see your braaa-aaw!\" sang Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee shook her head. \"Yes. I guess you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH!! Can I?!\" Having released the last button of her sister's blouse she reached out and grabbed at her cleavage, yanking on the top of the loose pink cami. It quickly stretched downward allowing everyone an unfettered glimpse of Kaylee's lacy black bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That's still mine!\" smirked Kaylee in mock protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda pulled it back up and over her sister's ample chest but not before playfully giving everyone a second look with another quick tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" laughed Kaylee. \"Get off me already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee lifted Amanda's ankles into the air pushing her away and off her lap in a reverse somersault. Giggling and falling to one side through the awkward roll, Amanda scrambled to her feet and flung her green pantied behind back onto her sister's lap. Kaylee again shook her head but couldn't wipe the smile from her face. The hyper young girl grabbed each lapel of the white blouse and unceremoniously stripped it from her sister's body. After pushing it down each of her arms she wadded and threw the garment away from them in no particular direction. Her task was finally done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking her legs around her big sister's waist, Amanda looked up at her with an affectionate smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satisfied?\" Kaylee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then take a seat Mandy,\" remarked Tanya, mid shuffle. \"I'm about to deal the next hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am sitting,\" came Amanda's reply, fingering the camisole and bra straps that draped off her sister's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once it was Kaylee that stood up for her. \"It's fine. Just deal.\"</span></div></div>",

Kaylee had promised and fun and wild night to the other girls and didn't want to be the one to ruin the festivities. But as she received her next hand from Tanya she couldn't help feeling distracted from the game. Amanda was sitting in her lap; not just facing her but hovering inches away from her body, her bare legs wrapping around her waist and raising the camisole up her back. As Kaylee crossed her legs to try to get more comfortable Amanda's small butt slid downward between her inner thighs brushing her crotch. It was awkward, sure, but strangely intimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have anything, huh?\" Amanda said, peeking at her older sister's cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee tilted her cards out of view. \"None of your business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Amanda was right. She had a horrible hand. Hoping for better luck she discarded all of her cards only to be met by much of the same after drawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have an awesome hand!\" Zoe teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee didn't respond. She really didn't want to lose at her own game but she was quickly heading in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, I'll start,\" said Carmen. \"Another three of a kind for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two pair here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee tossed her cards down. \"I got nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay sissy,\" replied Amanda. \"Me neither.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Kaylee was surprised. Amanda had been doing okay. Did she lose on purpose? \"Well one of us has a higher card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kicker thing?\" Tanya interrupted. \"No, we're not doing that, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We lose together!\" Amanda said excitedly. She placed her hands on her knees and rocked her butt in her sister's lap, unknowingly grinding into her sister's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya shook her head. \"No, winner picks. It's up to Carmen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Who loses, Carmen?\" Asked Kaylee. She briefly tickled Amanda, trying and failing to prevent her from grinding against her pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has to be you, Kay. I don't think your sister has too much more to lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee just nodded, looking down at My Little Pony and the green panties that were resting against her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen leaned over to pull at one of Kaylee's socks. \"Mandy? You want to grab her other sock? Since you're there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Amanda happily twisted her torso to better reach her sister's foot covering. \"Got it!\" She playfully dangled the small article in front of Kaylee, a huge smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Kaylee sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't lose forever Kay.\" Tanya said, dealing out the next hand. Her words were of no comfort to Kaylee.</span></div></div>",

Maybe her luck could change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst. Sissy.\" Amanda whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee looked past her cards into her sister's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time let's both do straights, k?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sealed it. Kaylee couldn't help but smile. It was simultaneously annoying and cute that she was trying to match their hands. She patted her younger sister's bare thigh and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not how the game works. Just tr-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two strategizing over there?\" asked Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda leaned back all the way to look at Zoe upside-down, rising up Kaylee's pelvis slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to win everything!\" she proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe grinned. \"Well you can't both win sweetie. One of you has to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" She remained horizontally suspended for a moment, her expression holding a hint of disappointment. Then came a cheerful \"Okay!\" before she righted her torso. Slipping back down Kaylee's pelvis with a wiggle, the underside of Amanda's own crotch quickly began brushing against and increasing its contact with her sister's panties. Amanda had been starting to feel pleasantly weird sitting here and now unconsciously continued to squirm, exploring the sensation by purposefully pressing their sexes together between the thin undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee wiggled right back in frustration but couldn't maneuver her sister away from her pussy. Not wanting to alert the others to this and realizing she had bigger problems to deal with she tried to pull her attention back to the game. Something had to happen with this hand. She couldn't keep losing. But this was not Kaylee's game to win. She failed to make her straight and for the second hand in a row came up with nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. This sucks.\" Kaylee moaned, tossing her hand aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. Sounds like Kaylee lost. So who won?\" Asked Tanya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did a straight!\" Amanda proudly declared, bouncing lightly against her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya shook her head. This kid was doing stupidly well. \"Can anyone beat that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a pair here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Well missy, have at her.\" Tanya said, gesturing at Kaylee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda grabbed her sister's camisole and bra straps and shook the both of them back and forth, rubbing their panties together even more vigorously. \"I'm taking all your clothes!!! You'll never get to wear anything ever again! AAauuAAaaAAaaAAaaugh!!!\" Amanda gyrated her body fiercely, as hyper as ever and thoroughly enjoying her winning streak. The girls laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kaylee's pussy couldn't take the grinding any longer. She struggled to stand at first but managed to push herself to her feet with her sister still attached. Amanda finally unlocked her ankles from behind her sister's back and dropped her feet to the floor, much to Kaylee's relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Kaylee said with a sigh. She lifted both of her arms above her head, exposing a small bit of midriff. \"I guess it's cami time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's eyes looked up and down her sister's body attentively before darting back up, now accompanied by a devilish grin. She stuck her fingers under each of the leg holes of her sister's panties and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee flinched in shock then sighed, pursing her lips while lowering her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Amanda didn't wait for her response. She slid both sets of fingers inward along the bottom edge of the panties then, meeting at the crotch, yanked down with her entire body. She crumbled to the floor, still holding the crotch of the lacy undergarment, giggling excitedly. The other girls laughed right along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed to be the only one bottomless, Kaylee quickly stepped out of her panties and covered her crotch with one hand before kneeling down on the carpet. But her fingers found something unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew.\" Amanda said, wiping her fingers over the pony on her shirt. \"Sis, your panties are wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee had only just realized it herself. Her sister's grinding and vibrating had caused her body to respond just as one would expect. She couldn't believe she hadn't noticed before now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe threw a hand to her mouth trying to cover her shit-eating grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen looked at Kaylee naughtily. \"Well someone is excited...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked around and sniffed her fingers. She was worried it was pee. The last time she peed her pants she was too excited. But this smelled sweeter somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Kaylee was beginning to blush. \"Mandy, go wash your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda stood and quietly walked out of the room with her sister's panties, embarrassed on her behalf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her sister out of earshot, Kaylee turned to Tanya. \"She has to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygod this is hilariously cute! So awesome!\" Zoe replaced her hand over her mouth again, still unable to contain her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What??</i>\" Kaylee squinted at Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's good to know you're ready for later,\" quipped Carmen seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a big deal Kaylee,\" added Zoe. \"My older sister's slumber party got <i>waaay</i> out of hand when I was about Mandy's age. It was amazing! And that was way worse than strip poker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we just rig her cards or something?\" Kaylee asked, glancing at Tanya. \"She can't keep winning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not always easy to give someone a bad hand,\" explained Tanya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then... give me better ones!\" Kaylee stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen rolled her eyes. \"Kay, relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe nodded. \"Yeah. So what? She's good at it. Leave her be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be embarrassed sissy!\" Amanda re-entered the living room, oblivious to their conversation. \"I can help!\"</span></div></div>",

Thanks sis.\" Kaylee said, outstretching her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonono. It think it's my fault you wet yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls glanced at each other. How little she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so I want to fix it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine Mandy. I can do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really! You've helped me before. I'll be quick!\" Amanda pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Kaylee, she just wants to help.\" Zoe cut in, her shit-eating grin consuming her face. \"Go on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen was holding back her own smile now. \"It is weirdly cute. You don't want to disappoint your sister, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee shook her head. Were they trying to torment her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just lay down. I'll fix everything!\" Amanda gave her best reassuring look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, Kaylee laid down in the middle of the carpet, hand still over crotch. Amanda straddled her sister's lap yet again, now facing away from her. She leaned down and gingerly removed Kaylee's hand before sitting on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sissy,\" she loudly whispered. \"You need to open your legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee paused. She took a deep breath, her face red, before parting her legs for her sister. She directed a few angry glances at her 'friends' before warmth made contact with her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda made a few repetitive passes with the washcloth at the top of Kaylee's slit. Kaylee bit her lip. Her body was still aroused and the warm cloth massaging her lips and clit felt disturbingly good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the cloth away Amanda pressed her palm into Kaylee's sex with an attempt to rub her clean. Of course rubbing down there rarely makes anything dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow inspecting her hand, Amanda saw her fingers glisten with fresh wetness. She stuck her hand out to show the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going!\" came Zoe's evil suggestion. Carmen giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda nodded and reapplied the washcloth, this time focusing lower and making longer strokes. She ran the full length of Kaylee's slit, slower and with increased pressure. Her small fingers pressed down beneath the soft folds eliciting a whimper from Kaylee. Amanda wasn't sure when to stop but she wanted to do a good job. Nearly a minute had elapsed, Kaylee now biting a finger, her breathing heavier, before Zoe stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's good Amanda! She looks like she's almost, umm... done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I should finish right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore sniggering came from the girls. Kaylee said nothing; silent compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think she's okay. For now!\" Zoe added with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda pulled the washcloth away. She landed a few pats from her fingers, trying to dry Kaylee's pussy some other way, only to be met by short repeated moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kayleeee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-hmm?\" Came her frustrated and muffled acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you better now?!\" She stared down at her sister's pink slit, unsure of what would indicate that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes.\" Kaylee was reluctant to respond but she couldn't deny how good it had felt, regardless of the source of her pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Amanda spun around to look at Kaylee, re-straddling her stomach. \"Hey, do you feel funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee opened her eyes and took her hand away from her mouth. Her face still very red, she looked up at her sister. \"Uh... I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda nodded. She felt naughty but didn't know how to express it. \"Me too. But...\" She wiggled her butt with a smile, rubbing her own crotch against her sister's skin. \"...I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo.... Are we ready for the next round?\" interrupted Tanya. \"Or are we not playing poker anymore?\" she asked with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda shouted in response, \"Oh yeah! Let me put this away!\" running out of the room with her sex cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee dropped her head back onto the carpet. \"I hate you guys.\" She couldn't even say it with a straight face. The other girls laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your pussy says otherwise!\" teased Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee slid backwards on the carpet and up onto her butt. She was still collecting herself when Amanda ran back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't start without me!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never!\" Zoe shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanya,\" Kaylee started, clearing her throat. \"Are you <i>ready</i> to deal my sister?\"</span></div></div>",

Go ahead then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya dealt the new hand but with a minor change that Amanda, the complete opposite of a card shark, would never notice. She was dealing only Amanda's cards from the bottom of the deck. She set it up so her cards were dealt in order but spaced apart from each other in twos then followed by the remaining gaps of cards. There was no way she could make any pair and no way she could get a straight. A flush might still be possible if Tanya hadn't been paying enough attention to the suits but it was pretty much a guarantee that Amanda would have a horrible hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with a deal of 2-3-6-7-10, Amanda excitedly dumped the lowest two cards only to receive a Jack and Ace. She hadn't had such bad luck in quite a while, if ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls finished their decision making promptly. But Amanda was the only one who didn't already know this outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Amanda?\" Kaylee asked smugly. \"What did you get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showed her hand to all. \"I got horrible cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee smiled at Tanya. \"Really? How about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's okay. I'll do better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya won the round with a flush of clubs but told Amanda to remove her own socks, not wanting to get up and needing a few moments of distraction to rig the deck again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the winner is supposed to take our clothes off. You said it earlier. I remember!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know I did, but as the winner I want... Kaylee to take them off for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sissy!\" Amanda replied happily, laying on her back. \"I'm ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you come over here?\" Kaylee didn't want to get up considering there was nothing covering her from the waist down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! If you want me come get me!\" she teased, slowly kicking her legs in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee was about to argue before she just gave up. With Tanya's help this would all be over soon anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood cautiously, one hand buried in her crotch, and waddled forward to her sister laying on the floor. She tried to grab her feet but Amanda wouldn't stop kicking. After several feeble one-handed attempts she threw modesty to the wind and used both hands to stop the flailing feet one by one and remove each sock in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaylee, your naughty bits are showing!\" Amanda said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks.\" Kaylee's voice was dripping with contempt as she turned to waddle back to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're really nice naughty bits,\" Carmen offered. Kaylee just gave her a funny look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ready for the next round yet Tanya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed we are.\"</span></div></div>",

She pouts and flicks at her cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I getting such bad cards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Kaylee is a sore loser,\" Zoe explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee shot a deathly look at Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda appeared confused. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing hun, just do your best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course when the deck is stacked against you there isn't much that you can do. Amanda discarded useless cards and picked up new equally worthless cards. She groaned and dramatically splayed her body out on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, who won?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe laid down her cards. \"I have a Queen-high straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" replied Kaylee. \"I only have three of a kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two pair,\" stated Tanya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen glanced at Amanda. \"Just the one pair for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you don't have anything sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda shook her head from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Zoe, at your leisure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled over and laid down next to Amanda who smiled upon seeing a carpet companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" greeted Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Zoe,\" Kaylee interrupted. Her tone was condescending if not just immature. \"Maybe you should take off her panties? I think that's a great idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry your sister is so mean, Manda-bear,\" comforted Zoe, trying to ignore Kaylee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay! I'm still having fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good! But I still have to take something from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda moved to her back and flattened out on the floor, legs straight and arms above her head, ready for anything. Zoe couldn't help but adore Kaylee's little sister, yet here Kaylee was trying to get rid of her. Ridiculousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe began to pull Amanda's shirt up her body, the back of the garment occasionally catching on the carpet underneath her. Zoe worked it up her stomach but stopped to wiggle her finger in the girl's belly button, with many a cute giggle in response. She then drew it up higher, up over her shoulders, where the shirt turned itself inside out, the neck still under Amanda's chin but the rest of the shirt stretching up her arms and covering her face. Since they were such easy targets with Amanda arms in a cloth restraint she couldn't help herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe poked at one of Amanda's cute rosy nipples. She giggled and squirmed as Zoe followed up with the other one, Amanda struggling for a moment to pull her arms and head free from the shirt. Zoe took every second she was given to lovingly antagonize the playful girl. As soon as the shirt came off Amanda threw it at Zoe with a smile and slapped her hands against her tingling nipples. By all accounts she now only had her panties left to keep her in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee rolled her eyes. \"Geez you're slow. We only have one more round here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curiously, I think you would only have two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. That's why we're doing this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Zoe stood, hands on her hips. \"I don't think you're being very nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Zoe, she just gets like that sometimes.\" Kaylee's sister sat in her green panties on the floor with her arms crossed over her bare chest, a hand on either shoulder, oblivious to what they were really talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanya,\" Kaylee pleaded, \"It's just one more round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looked at their dealer. \"Yeah Tanya, how are you going to deal with this?\"</span></div></div>",

Calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm calm.\" Zoe said quietly. \"But what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I think Kaylee is being a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee felt betrayed and confused. Her gaze moved away from Tanya to Carmen who offered her no sympathy. Then to Zoe, a look of scorn. And finally to her sister, who tried to smile a weak toothy smile uncertain why everyone was getting upset. Kaylee slouched down a bit, shoving her hands down farther between her bare legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...\" she started, not sure what to say. They waited for her to finish but she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I think,\" Zoe offered, sitting down. \"I think it would make sense for Kaylee to match her sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya nodded. \"Well let's see what happens.\" She fiddled with the deck for a minute before passing out the next round of cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee didn't want to pick up her cards. She feared the worst. And once she turned them over she audibly sighed. Tanya had dealt her the exact same hand she dealt to Amanda last round. Kaylee didn't bother drawing for new cards. That would obviously be a waste of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up she saw her sister bouncing and dancing on her butt. She knew what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya started. \"Well I have three of a kind. What do you have Amanda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have four stars!!!!\" she giddily proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are aces hunny. But good job!\" Zoe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you Kaylee?\" Tanya asked. \"What did you end up with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head defeated. \"Nothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Amanda!\" Zoe smiled. \"Go take off your sister's shirt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda bounced to her feet and ran directly at her sister. She leaped into the air and crashed down on top of Kaylee who just barely caught her, the two of them collapsing to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HI SISSY!!!\" Amanda yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi... you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be sad!\" Amanda said, pulling up each of Kaylee's cheeks. \"This is fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee swatted her sister off of her and sat up on her pillow. Maybe she was being too harsh. But she still didn't want to be the first one to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small hands that suddenly tickled her butt cause her to throw her body forward and off her pillow. Kaylee landed on her knees and hands but wasn't able to go very far before her sister jumped on her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm bigger than you!\" Amanda yelled. The young half naked girl squirmed against her sister's bare backside and pushed the camisole up Kaylee's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not!\" Kaylee yelled back. But her words weren't mean. They were just playing together as siblings. Mostly naked in the middle of a gaming of strip poker, but they were genuinely playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda slipped down off of Kaylee's butt and ran passed her sister, camisole in hand, pulling it up her chest. Before she could pass, Kaylee grabbed one of her legs and twisted, flipping to her back and pulling Amanda down on top of her. Her camisole was now up and over her black bra, but Amanda was mostly concealing her now. The girl squealed and laughed as Kaylee threw random tickles, hugs and kisses at her sister. Amanda pushed away, squeezed her sister's tits, and tickled her back in response but Kaylee wouldn't let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll save you Mandy!\" Carmen yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds a hand pulled one of Kaylee's arms up and over her head, followed by the other one. Carmen and Zoe had stretched Kaylee out on the carpet immobilizing her. Amanda scrambled around and straddled her sister's chest, sitting with a hard plop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof! Careful!\" Kaylee exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on Amanda! Take your prize off of the evil mermaid!\" joked Carmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda shuffled her butt higher up her sister's torso, pushing the cami as she went. She slowly inched her butt onto her collarbone before crawling over her sister's head. She sat down with an evil giggle and smushed her green bum into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butt face! Butt face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, no, thapsmmer haph fer mam berr!\" Kaylee's mouth was buried in her sister's panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Amanda stopped, lifting her butt. \"Do that again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what?! I domp perferde mar! MMMMMMMPH!!!\" She yelled in desperation, suffocating by means of her sister's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was blushing. \"Hehe! Your face feels funny! I like it!\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee realized then that she was yelling into her sister's pussy through her panties. If not her moving lips then the vibration of her voice was giving Amanda some pleasant sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee was thankful her sister moved off her face, if only so she could breath normally. Her camisole gone and Carmen and Zoe releasing her arms, she quickly moved to cover her crotch after having just unabashedly displayed her shaven mound to the room for the past minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sissy, we need to play like this more often!\" Amanda said, sitting down hard onto the carpet, her face flush, panties again twisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look how nice your sister is!\" Zoe said. \"And what were you going to do again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry guys. Really. I just didn't want to lose to her! Especially since it's my sleepover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph.\" Zoe huffed, but she appeared to accept Kaylee's apology. \"What do you think Tanya?\"</span></div></div>",

Once she finds it, she reaches for it and almost drops the ipod she had been wearing.  Her quick reflexes are equal to the task, so she is surprised when she hears a crashing sound.  In a moment she realizes the sound was from the next room.  She puts a bookmark in her <i>Chobits</i> manga and goes to check the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sees her host Kaylee and her friends around a table; she thinks their names are Zoe, Tanya, and Carmen.  They already seem annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sono... hello Kaylee.  Is everything okay?\" Noriko asked uncertainly.

No free shows,\" Zoe added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko blushes slightly and considers before nodding.  \"Okay.  Is it Texas Hold Em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we didn't decide,\" Kaylee said and scratches her head.  \"Which poker games does everyone now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them,\" Tanya said confidently and resumes shuffling impatiently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, but I prefer draw games: high, low, or both,\" Carmen said and walked over to grab some snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've played most games, except I don't care for stud,\" Zoe added and joined Carmen in snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, I having knowledge of most games, but I don't care for the low ones.  Noriko?\" Kaylee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm good with anything,\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee nods.  \"Right.  So how about we vote for High 5 Card Draw, Hold Em, or Omaha?

Instead of hearts, diamonds, spades and clubs; you have 13 birthstones each representing 12 month and another one. Garnet, Amethyst, Bloodstone, Sapphire, Emerald, Pearl, Turquoise, Carnelian, Chrysolite, Opal, Topaz, Ruby and Agate. Each stone represents a number- Garnet is the highest; Agate is the lowest. You go for numbers rather than hands. The highest number is 715. You only get one exchange, no bluffing, no second chances. The person with the highest hand chooses a piece of clothing from the person with the lowest hand! What do you think?\" proposed a grinning Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Recap<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko handed over all her cards in the exchange. Kaylee was surprised as she handed over 2 cards. Carmen, Zoe and Tanya kept their cards. Noriko looked at her cards. Each one was Agate. The King, Queen, Jack, Ten and Nine of Agate! If it was poker, she would have a King High Straight. Instead she had only improved her total by 9 points. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully Kaylee had a lower total or whoever one would be kind. She would be embarrassed to strip, but it would be shameful to quit. Her father taught her, never to quit anything unless it was dangerous. And sadly, being naked in front of other teenage girls was humiliating, not dangerous. Besides, she just arrived in the US and she didn't want to appear weak in front of her new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe shown her hand first. To Noriko's shock, it was 715! King to Nine in Garnet! Kaylee had 660, Carmen had 546 and Tanya had 495! She was the only one stuck with a small score of 55. \"Sorry Noriko! The highest number is 715, not 835! And I have it! So I believe you will hand over that plaid skirt to me, now!\" declared a giggling Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Sorry?\" stammered Noriko. Zoe beamed evilly. \"I won the hand. I was wrong, 715 is the highest number. It's on the chart, see?\" explained Zoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tK\tQ\tJ\t10\t9\t8\t7\t6\t5\t4\t3\t2\tA<br>\r\nGa\t169\t156\t143\t130\t117\t104\t91\t78\t65\t52\t39\t26\t13<br>\r\nAm\t156\t144\t132\t120\t108\t96\t84\t72\t60\t48\t36\t24\t12<br>\r\nBl\t143\t132\t121\t110\t99\t88\t77\t66\t55\t44\t33\t22\t11<br>\r\nSa\t130\t120\t110\t100\t90\t80\t70\t60\t50\t40\t30\t20\t10<br>\r\nEm\t117\t108\t99\t90\t81\t72\t63\t54\t45\t36\t27\t18\t9<br>\r\nPe\t104\t96\t88\t80\t72\t64\t56\t48\t40\t32\t24\t16\t8<br>\r\nTu\t91\t84\t77\t70\t63\t56\t49\t42\t35\t28\t21\t14\t7<br>\r\nCa\t78\t72\t66\t60\t54\t48\t42\t36\t30\t24\t18\t12\t6<br>\r\nCh\t65\t60\t55\t50\t45\t40\t35\t30\t25\t20\t15\t10\t5<br>\r\nOp\t52\t48\t44\t40\t36\t32\t28\t24\t20\t16\t12\t8\t4<br>\r\nTo\t39\t36\t33\t30\t27\t24\t21\t18\t15\t12\t9\t6\t3<br>\r\nRu\t26\t24\t22\t20\t18\t16\t14\t12\t10\t8\t6\t4\t2<br>\r\nAg\t13\t12\t11\t10\t9\t8\t7\t6\t5\t4\t3\t2\t1<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I got the highest hand, so I choose what you lose. So I choose your plaid skirt.

Remember your little private game with Alyssa?\" teased Carmen. \"Shut it!\" responded Zoe, her face a darker shade than her hair. \"What happened between you and Alyssa?\" demanded Kaylee. Noriko felt relief that the focus was off her skirt...until Zoe burst into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe! It's just a joke! Don't cry!\" pleaded Carmen. \"Why doesn't she want me?\" blubbered Zoe. Noriko felt shame that she didn't just hand over her skirt. While she certainly didn't want to expose herself, she didn't want to see poor Zoe in such a state. Kaylee wrapped her arms around Zoe, who just bawled, clutching at her friend. \"Zoe has always had a crush on Kaylee's sister Alyssa!\" whispered Tanya to Noriko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what happened please, Zoe!\" requested Kaylee. \"It...it was two weeks ago. I invited Alyssa over when my parents were away. Alyssa got her friend Greta to cover for her. Greta's sister Inge told your parents that Alyssa was with them. We played about 3 games of strip poker. I ended up naked each time. My forfeits were 10 gentle swats, a quick rub and photos. The last time as Alyssa took photos of me....I rose and kissed her. She kissed back. She deleted the phones and offered herself to me. She was my first. I think...no I know that I was hers. It was just like in the stories or rumours. She told me as I cuddled up to her...that tonight was about us. But it was likely that when she left for home tomorrow, that would be it. I was shattered, but recovered quickly. I....I have been crushing on her for 2 years, I wasn't about to let go so easily! I spent the day, trying to win her back. A few times, I thought I had. But then I lost her. And since then, I've been trying to deal! I...I know you want more details. I...I'm just not ready to give the full story! Guys, I'm not a lesbian! I really do like guys...I just like Alyssa way more! I...I...\" Zoe stammered again, before Noriko declared \"Here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe turned, tears blinking to her. \"W-What?\" \"It's my skirt. You won, I lost. Please take it!\" offered Noriko, face heating up. Zoe's eyes watered as she gave Noriko a hug. \"Thank you, Noriko! Sorry about the flirting, I just thought....maybe I...\" \"You thought maybe it would help you forget Alyssa.\" concluded Noriko, feeling a little exposed by the fact her cotton underthings were visible. \"Sorry for being a bitch, Zoe!\" apologised Carmen. \"Me too! Sorry Kaylee, but Alyssa is a cow for experimenting like that with Zoe!\" exclaimed Tanya. \"I still want her!\" stuttered a weepy Zoe. \"I love my sister, Zoe. But she was wrong to do this. I hope we are cool.\" stated Kaylee. \"Thank you guys! It means a lot! And thanks for still playing Noriko!\" \"Shinpai nai! Do not worry! We are friends and I will play, even if I risk my underwear!\" declared Noriko. Zoe beamed, a little more confidently. \"You will lose your panties, when I win the next round, Nori!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko looked at her cards after Carmen dealt them. She had a healthy blend of Garnet, Bloodstone but also a Carnelian. Should she risk getting a weaker card?</span></div></div>",

She chose no further card, noting that both Carmen and Tanya took 4 cards. Kaylee took one. She was certain that either she or Zoe would take the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proudly showed her hand. \"Great hand, Nori! But 633 is trumped by 660!\" she declared, showing her hand of Amethyst, all in straight formation from the King down. Noriko took out the calculator from the box, but knew she was sunk. Kaylee and Tanya had hands worth 509 and 338 respectively. But Carmen couldn't reach 200, showing a paltry hand of Opals and Topaz for 186 with the Ace of Bloodstone, the sole upper suit card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Zoe, what do you want from me?\" asked Carmen, excitedly. \"I'll take shoes!\" replied Zoe, smirking. \"Is that all?

Where did you get the cotton?\" asked Carmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNori turned red and stammered something up of Macy's. Nori watched as Tanya played with the cards, making them dance before handing them out. Nori's cards were poor by her expectations. All cards were Chrysolite, for a sad total of 275. She pondered what to do as Tanya, Kaylee and Carmen took 3 cards each. </span></div></div>",

She got the Jack of Bloodstone and the 9 and 6 of Agate. It pushed her up to 211. She felt a tremor through her body. She feared that she was in great danger of exposing her most private parts to the group. \"No!\" she told herself. \"Someone will have a lower hand! Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her breath as Zoe showed off her hand. Ten to 6 in Garnet, a total score of 520; yet another massive score and she didn't deal them out! Tanya threw her cards down in anger. \"Only 495! How the hell are you doing this, Zoe?\" she demanded. \"Alyssa taught me.\" she replied, going red again. No-one else commented. Kaylee put down her hand, a good hand of Kings dragged down by a 5 of Rubies and an 8 of Agate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko and Carmen looked at each other. Neither of them had any desire to show their hand. \"Come on girls, I want to know who I'm stripping!\" grinned Zoe. \"Oh whatever!\" declared Carmen, showing her hand. Noriko breathed a sigh of relief as she showed her own. Carmen's was a paltry 80 comprised of the 4 lowest cards and the 7 of Sapphires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess Nori and I aren't very good at Stones! Okay, so what should I lose?\" asked Carmen. \"Well I could say panties...\" Zoe paused mid sentence to watch the smile fade from Carmen \"But I think I'll take your jeans to go with your shoes and Nori's skirt! So fork them over!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen rolled her eyes, exposing her lacy red panties. A few wolf-whistles followed. \"Of course, you're whistling! I can turn any girl!\" she remarked, putting on a fake air of faux arrogance. The other girls couldn't help but laugh at her play acting, even Nori let loose a few giggles. \"Well girls, you'll just have to lift your game!\" commented Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting game, going on here! Hi Zoe!\" came a voice, entering the living room. Zoe went bright red again as Noriko recognised Alyssa. She was tall, very tall for a 15 year old. She was well endowed in the chest area, far more than any of them even Zoe. \"Little sis, we are playing! You should leave!\" declared Alyssa. Alyssa looked everyone over and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, then!\" she stated. \"I...I'm sorry, Alyssa! I shouldn't have...\" Alyssa cut Zoe off with a kiss. \"ALYSSA!\" cried Kaylee. \"Oh, what? If you know and are cool with it; why should I even pretend? Girls, I'm coming out of the closet! I'm gay!\" declared Alyssa. Noriko was stunned and it was clear she wasn't alone. Zoe on the other hand was practically glowing with happiness. \"So it's Stones? I'm in!\" she declared, removing her jeans and hoodie. \"ALY!\" squealed Kaylee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's eyes never left Alyssa's as the younger girl took her hand. \"So can I deal?\" she asked, cockily. \"This better not end badly, Aly! I am not losing a friend, because of you!\" retorted Kaylee. \"You won't, Kaylee! Only reason it didn't happen before, is because I worried you'd end your friendship with Zoe. Since that didn't happen, I'm her girl! So here's the deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko felt like she was in some weird TV show. 10 minutes ago, Zoe was crying over being dumped. Now, Alyssa was her girlfriend again. Her attention, however, quickly turned from the Jacobson drama to her cards. It was a weak hand indeed. The 8 of Garnet was the only high card amongst a King to Ten of Rubies. A piddling score of 196. Tanya was the only one who picked up, all 5 cards.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>RECAP:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee Jacobson: a rather pretty high school junior. Her hair is a shoulder length rich, dark brown, and her chest an ample c-cup. She's sociable and sometimes a bit bratty, but not overly bitchy about it. She's pretty and she knows it, but she is the most loyal of friends, and nice to those that know her.<br>\r\nClothing: white tennis shoes, socks, a white outer blouse, a light pink under-blouse, a pair of stylish slim cut jeans, black lace bra, black lace panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe Adams: A fun-loving, busty redhead. Zoe is a bit on the ditzy and flirty side, but she's nevertheless friendly. She is likely the most comfortable with her body of all the girls. She is an easy d-cup, and she wears her hair in a ponytail.<br>\r\nClothing: high heeled shoes, black stockings, silk button-up shirt, a knee-length black skirt, hot pink bra, hot pink thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya Jackson: An athletic, intelligent black teen. Tanya is a scholar athlete and ivy league hopeful. Despite running track, she still has a very feminine frame with c-cup breasts and a very shapely ass. She's likely the most uptight of the group when it comes to matters like this. Despite her shyness, though, she is dedicated and can get fiercely competitive.<br>\r\nClothing: fur-lined boots, athletic socks, white jacket, sleeveless purple shirt, form fitting jeans, purple bra, purple panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen Valdez: A petite Latina, Carmen is the thrill seeker of the group. She likes driving fast cars, bungee jumping and whatever else to get her adrenalin fix. Her body is on the smaller side, with b-cup boobs. And while she has a nice ass, it isn't as shapely as Tanya's.<br>\r\nClothing: tennis shoes, socks, red sweater, white cotton tanktop, jeans, red bra, red panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa Jacobson: Kaylee's younger sister. Alyssa is 15 and a freshman in high school. While her sister went the popular sociable route, Alyssa became something more of a nerd. Alyssa is a gamer and geeky trivia buff. She's sarcastic and laid back, but can be rattled by embarrassing situations.<br>\r\nClothing: zip-up hoodie, tennis shoes, socks, t-shirt, jeans, sky blue bra, sky blue panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko Yamada: A Japanese exchange student living at Kaylee's house, Noriko is extremely shy, but also extremely nice and friendly. Being highly introverted, she doesn't make friends easily, but she can be determined when she sets her mind to something.<br>\r\nClothing: black shoes, white socks, blue cardigan, white blouse, plaid skirt, white cotton bra, white cotton panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Stones?\" asked Noriko and Kaylee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A game that involves a lot of thinking. Instead of hearts, diamonds, spades and clubs; you have 13 birthstones each representing 12 month and another one. Garnet, Amethyst, Bloodstone, Sapphire, Emerald, Pearl, Turquoise, Carnelian, Chrysolite, Opal, Topaz, Ruby and Agate. Each stone represents a number- Garnet is the highest; Agate is the lowest. You go for numbers rather than hands. The highest number is 715. You only get one exchange, no bluffing, no second chances. The person with the highest hand chooses a piece of clothing from the person with the lowest hand! What do you think?\" proposed a grinning Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChart:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t         K\tQ\tJ\t10\t9\t8\t7\t6\t5\t4\t3\t2\tA<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet\t169\t156\t143\t130\t117\t104\t91\t78\t65\t52\t39\t26\t13<br>\r\nAmethyst\t156\t144\t132\t120\t108\t96\t84\t72\t60\t48\t36\t24\t12<br>\r\nBloodstone 143\t132\t121\t110\t99\t88\t77\t66\t55\t44\t33\t22\t11\t<br>\r\nSapphire\t130\t120\t110\t100\t90\t80\t70\t60\t50\t40\t30\t20\t10<br>\r\nEmerald\t117\t108\t99\t90\t81\t72\t63\t54\t45\t36\t27\t18\t9<br>\r\nPearl\t        104   96\t88\t80\t72\t64\t56\t48\t40\t32\t24\t16\t8<br>\r\nTurquoise\t91\t84\t77\t70\t63\t56\t49\t42\t35\t28\t21\t14\t7<br>\r\nCarnelian\t78\t72\t66\t60\t54\t48\t42\t36\t30\t24\t18\t12\t6<br>\r\nChrysolite\t65\t60\t55\t50\t45\t40\t35\t30\t25\t20\t15\t10\t5<br>\r\nOpal\t        52\t48\t44\t40\t36\t32\t28\t24\t20\t16\t12\t8\t4<br>\r\nTopaz\t39\t36\t33\t30\t27\t24\t21\t18\t15\t12\t9\t6\t3<br>\r\nRuby\t        26\t24\t22\t20\t18\t16\t14\t12\t10\t8\t6\t4\t2<br>\r\nAgate\t13\t12\t11\t10\t9\t8\t7\t6\t5\t4\t3\t2\t1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Recap<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko felt her heart sink. She dropped down to 152. \"I don't believe this!\" expressed Tanya, angrily. She hurled her hand to the ground. A score of 225.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa showed off her 715 with pride. Zoe got a King High straight Amethyst, smirking with her 660. \"You two are cheating, somehow!\" exclaiming Kaylee, shaking her head with a smile as she showed off her King High Straight Emerald. \"I guess I'll settle for 3rd!\" declared Carmen, a 4th King High Straight with a Bloodstone High. \"So Nori, who is losing? You or Tanya?\" asked Alyssa, a cruel smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNori showed her hand, fearfully. Alyssa smiled an even meaner smirk. \"Well hon, I guess I'm a cotton girl! Panties, please!\" Noriko forced herself to be brave. Her father had taught her never to back down and to be determined. But this was not, she suspected, what he meant. \"Whoa! Come on, Alyssa! That's too much!\" responded Kaylee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's too early!\" agreed Tanya. \"My girl is within her rights!\" answered an indignant Zoe, cuddling about to Alyssa. \"Sorry sugar, it's time to hand them over!\" added Carmen. All eyes were on, Noriko. \"Nori, you can leave if you want! It's all about fun!\" declared Kaylee. \"If she quits, it'll be worse! I mean we all have kitties, what's the big deal? I mean if she forfeits, I'll be asking for spanks only!\" pointed out Alyssa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko felt her feet on quicksand. She truly didn't want to do this. But she wasn't a quitter. She rose unsteadily, closing her eyes. Her hands rested on her panties. She reminded herself that she couldn't back down. \"Go girl! You're the second coolest girl here after Zoe!\" expressed Alyssa, before Noriko heard the sound of two girls kissing. With one last gasp of courage, her panties fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely stepped out of them before Alyssa snatched them up. Noriko immediately sat down, keeping one hand firmly planted on her entrance. \"Do you want Zoe to deal, Nori?\" offered Alyssa. Noriko nodded as Zoe dealt the cards. Noriko's face was on fire as she surveyed her cards. It was a powerful hand of 732! Noriko was stunned, she thought 715 was the highest hand. But she had the King of Garnet and Amethyst, the Queen of Garnet, the Jack of Garnet and the Queen of Emeralds. Surely she would win this hand? </span></div></div>",

Noriko?\" Kaylee asked the exchange student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko again put a hand behind her head.  \"Sono... 5 Card Draw, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee stroked her chin as she looked at Zoe, whom had proposed an alternative game in the first place.  \"Well, swing vote.  What are we all going to get bare-assed to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe chuckled.  \"I think, since this is your idea and Noriko is our special guest, I'm going to vote against my inclination and go for 5 Card Draw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya grumbled a little while Carmen shrugged.

After she dealt the others their cards she saw she had gained a 3 and a 9, making her frown momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked up, she saw her table mates were already revealing their hands.  Kaylee looked to have the strongest with a set of Jacks.  After her was Tanya with a pair of 9s.  Third so far went to Carmen with a pair of 4s.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko looked timidly at Zoe, who had yet to show her hand.  \"Noriko, I see your one article of clothing, and I raise you two,\" Zoe said coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko looked away and was about to fold when the host intervened.  \"Zoe, knock it off.  There's no betting or bluffing here.  Lowest hand strips,\" Kaylee said and turned over Zoe's hand.  She had a 2, 5, 6, 7, T. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe shrugged.  \"M'kay.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is an interactive fiction story about a game of strip poker taking place during a girl's slumber party. Readers will take on the role of one of five different characters and then find themselves playing with the other girls. The goal of the game is to get everybody but the \"player character\" naked, as the last person with clothes left wins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould the \"player\" lose their clothes and be rendered naked, it's treated like a \"game over\" in a video game. The player's character will then be humiliated in any number of ways, such as being made to streak, pose for photos, made to masturbate or even be sexually dominated. And those are just ideas off the top of my head. Keep in mind those are supposed to be bad ends, though, not threads, so make sure that if the player does lose, it's a one chapter ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Rules for Additions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No torture or death. This is a fun sexy story, please keep it that way. A little light bondage is fine, and obviously should the player character lose, having their punishment be forced on them is a totally viable option, so long as it doesn't get too extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Nothing scatological. Please no urine, excrement, farting, diapers or anything of the sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Nothing fantastical. This story is grounded in reality, so please no growth/shrinking, futa, gender-swapping, mind control, vore or anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Show the whole game. So please no time skips over events, or ending the game early. The strip poker game is what the story is supposed to be about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. One article at a time please. The lowest hand takes something off, and no one else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks :)</td>",
