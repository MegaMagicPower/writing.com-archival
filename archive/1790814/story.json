The last thing you remember is settling down for the night, when you were blinded by a flash of white light, which somehow knocked you unconscious. By the look of the blurry blue sky above you, you've been unconscious all night at the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pick yourself up from the floor, you begin to realise that something isn't right. For starters, you've been moved, as you were certainly not on a patch of crumbling brown rocks last night. However, the scenery seems wrong, somehow. The trees appear to stretch into the air for hundreds of metres, and massive plants with long green leaves wave in the breeze. The crumbling rocks appear to go on for miles in all directions. You are still very confused, when suddenly a huge clue literally falls out of the sky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA leaf several times your size. In comparison to you, it's as big as a bus. You look upwards to see where it came from, and suddenly something clicks in your mind. You look around wildly, as everything begins to make horrible sense. The trees seem to go upwards so far... Because you're so small that they seem to be enormous. The massive plants are actually... Tufts of grass. The rocks beneath you are actually specks of dirt on a dirt path. If you had to guess, you'd say that you're only 1cm tall! You look down at yourself, and are relieved to see that, apart from your sudden size change, you're still a perfectly ordinary...</span></div></div>",

It's a picnic basket,\" she takes it down. It's a rather small thing but packed to the brim with supplies. She begins to unfold a checkered red-and-white blanket that's on the very top and spreads it on the ground, carefully flattening out the bumps. \"Climb on, don't be shy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blanket is very soft under your paws and has a sweet smell to it. \"Well, I am kind of hungry now that you mention it. But I was hoping to sort this size thing out first, though I see now you won't be able to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I can help you! Well actually, <b><i>I</i></b> can't, but I do know someone who can! There's this scientist back in my village. He's a Snivy and he knows everything there is to know about potions and herbs and I'm sure he'll know what to do!\" She pulls out a small metal flask and a teacup and sets them down on the blanket. \"But, since I've already got everything ready, why don't we eat first? Since you're so cute and tiny even just a little bit of food will fill you up, won't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the teacup fixedly. She was pouring ice cold tea into it and you were panting, not used to being on dry land for so long. \"I...I could use a nice drink...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" she gasps and lowers the cup just as she's about to take a sip,\"I feel so silly, you must feel like a fish out of water! Here, just climb in.\" She moves the cup towards you. A drop of the liquid splashes on your face and you lap it up. It tastes sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it's OK? You really won't mind?\" You grip the ear of the cup and pull yourself up to the brim, looking at Leafeon for affirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind at all! Jump right in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't hold back at all. The dark brown liquid feels icy on your skin and the relief is instant.

The liquid's stillness is interrupted and you feel waves on your skin. You open your eyes and Leafeon's face takes up most of your view, larger than ever. Her fur is a bright sunny yellow, except for the tips of her ears which turn into green leaves. Her eyes are deep brown jewels, shiny and curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're not going to um...drink me are you?\" you ask jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know,\" her mouth widens into a playful smile as she brings the cup near her mouth, \"maybe I will? Maybe I won't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I would rather you don't!\" you reply loudly. She knew I was joking, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to tilt the cup and you grab hold of the porcelain brim anxiously. Leafeon's tongue comes out from between her lips and she playfully laps at the sweet liquid. The smooth red tongue manages to just touch the very tip of your blue tail, and you pull it away, hiding it between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tilts the cup further and the level of the tea gradually lowers as she drinks it in. Your paws sweat in fear and you begin to lose grip on the rim. The tea no longer covers your body at all and you start to slip. First one paw, then the other, and you splash down into what little liquid remains in the bottom of the cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaahhhh!\" you yell as you slip down the smooth white wall and towards the Leafeon's open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cold hind paws touch her warm outstretched tongue and you stop momentarily. Your heart is beating wildly and you still hope to escape. But to no avail. Light becomes darkness and your body slips with ease between Leafeon's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's dark and warm and the air is a bit stale, but not smelly at all. The slick saliva-coated tongue below you undulates and presses you against the rippled roof of her mouth. She's playing with her food, you realize. Is that what you've become, her food?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smack your large tail against her tongue as best as you can to get her attention. \"Please don't swallow me!!\" you yell, \"I don't want to be digested!!\"</span></div></div>",

I asked you whether you were going to drink me and you clearly said 'Maybe I will, maybe I won't!', then you went ahead and did it! Now you're saying you're a vegetarian?\" You felt brave, having caught her in a lie. Tiny, but brave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh-heh-heh-heh...\" She gave a nervous laugh, \"Oh look! - I made us a sandwich!\" She tossed the crumpled salad leaf she was restlessly wringing onto the two veggie-topped bread slices laying on a paper plate then joined them together. She dug around in the basket a short while and procured a small knife. \"Aha!\" She exclaimed, \"one for meeee...\" the knife sliced crisply through the bread, \"and one for you!\". You looked at the sandwich. Your appetite was still there, strangely enough and it did look quite good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My half's smaller...\" It was a silly observation to make, you knew, as it was still three times your own height. You wouldn't be able to eat it in a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's because you're smaller! Now dig in!\" Leafeon reached over to you and grabbed you by the tail, lifting you in the air! It didn't really hurt but it was rude, you thought. One does not just lift Vaporeons up by their tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell and plopped onto the soft white bread.

A picnic all laid out, yet no picnickers? What a queer matter this is!\" He lifts the empty teacup and tilts it upside down. A single drop drips out, \"Alas, no tea. A tragedy. But what a grand sandwich that is. No one should miss it if I were to eat it, surely, lest it go to waste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No...no...NO!</i> You had hidden yourself in between the pieces of bread while he had been inspecting the tea but now regretted it immensely. \"Please don't eat me, just go away...\", you repeat furiously under your breath. Without warning the giant leaves of lettuce bear down on you and the gravity shifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy lifts the sandwich to his open mouth and takes a hefty bite. The vegetables crunch loudly as he chews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say, this is quite fine!\" His eyes move upwards and to the left as he chews and considers the taste with a connoisseur's tongue, \"The hint of...fish...complements the texture of the cucumbers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your tail out in the open. The warmth of Snivy's breath is right on it. <i>If he bites down one more time it'll be the end of me! Leafeon please hurry back! Please hurry back! Please hurry back!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leaves squeeze down tightly again and in front of you, a great crunch. The pressure around your body loosens, only to increase again with much greater force. <i>Am...am I inside his mouth</i>? The smell of spittle and gnashing of teeth all around you confirms it. <i>I am</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wriggle out of the bolus of food and try the same trick that worked on Leafeon. You latch onto Snivy's tongue doing your best not to get your big clumsy tail in between the clamping teeth. It's not as easy as it sounds for Snivy's mouth is smaller than Leafeon's and much wetter. You can't see what you're doing either as he chews with his mouth closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grip starts to slip. Your tail becomes trapped in a lump of food. You yell but it's not loud enough to be heard. Suddenly the Snivy opens his mouth to take another bite. And for a moment you see Leafeon. Salvation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy's mouth closes; giant serpent swallows. You lose your grip and slide down the snake's tongue like the food that you are and enter a tighter passage that violently pulls you downwards and away from any hope of freedom. \"NOOOOOOO! I was so close!\" you yell in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tight tunnel works you over and stops pulling you down for but a second. Your tail feels it first and then your hind paws. A blockage; or at least it was before it opens and you slip into the more capacious stomach. The stink of acid and bile hits you and your sensitive skin tingles as you splash down into the thick fluid. Quickly, you reach through the gunk and try to grab onto something. But there is nothing. <i>I'm...I'm going to be digested aren't I</i>?</span></div></div>",

No doubt you already know how to help him, being the great doctor that you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy swallows the bite he's chewing. \"Ahem, do forgive my rudeness, I did not anticipate this picnic's participants to return, so I helped myself to this delicious sandwich.\" He looks guiltily backwards and around \"Vaporeon you say? Am I to have had the pleasure to make his acquaintance that you speak so eagerly of him? I assure you, the only Pokemon that I see here is you, lady Leafeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon blushes at his kind words. He has a funny way of speaking; aristocratic in manner, she tries to imitate it whenever she's around him, just for fun. She sits down next to Snivy on the picnic blanket and puts her paws in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite. He is a small blighter, a most unfortunate victim of some shrinking charm or what have you. He was seated on the very sandwich you now hold, last I saw of him. Surely you have seen him? Or is it that you've eaten him accidentally!\" She laughs playfully and points at Snivy's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be the latter, I'm afraid.\" replies Snivy earnestly; Leafeon's smile fades and all is silent for a moment, \"Tell me, this sandwich, was there any fish put into it? For I distinctly taste fish, and I know that you are not one to eat meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon turns serious very quickly. \"My, you did eat him then! The taste you mention is the same I felt when I almost drank him, accidentally mind you, with my tea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems our fishy friend is done for then, I'm afraid.\" He rubbed his round yellow belly, \"there's no medicine I'm aware of that can save him now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but surely you can bring him back up!\" Leafeon pleads, \"Regurigitate him if you must, you're a snake after all aren't you? Snakes are known to regurgitate their prey if the need comes of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy sighs. He stands up and places the unfinished portion of his sandwich back onto the plate. \"What you say is true but it's not gentlemanly. However if you insist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...then I will. I prefer not to be watched if you wouldn't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\uff5e<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou beat your paws on the stomach walls. It's pitch black and you can feel the stinging on your skin growing stronger. Between the loud beats of Snivy's heart you could hear that Leafeon was talking to Snivy and he was replying back, his voice much louder and coming from above. You just hope that Leafeon managed to talk him into barfing you back out. You hope and hope that that's what they were saying, because you have no more energy left to stand. Your head begins to slowly slip below the acid...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the walls surrounding you come together with a lurch and you submerse completely under the liquid. Food and flesh violently brush against your skin and it hurts even more now that it's so raw. Then you see light. You see the blue of sky and the green of grass rushing towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\uff5e<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope my humble apology will be accepted,\" green fingers dig underneath you and lift you from the wet grass up to a large orange eye; the big serpent Pokemon inspects you with in professional sincerity, \"had I known you were playing at hide-and-seek inside a sandwich I assure you I would not have eaten you! Though I digress; the blame lies solely upon me, Doctor Snivy, healer of ailments and crasher of picnics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you ate me!\" You could just muster up enough strength to pull yourself up and shout angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor! Oh good doctor!\" Leafeon rushes to his side and looks at you \"Tell me, can he be cured? Do you know of some medicine to bring him back to his original size?\"</span></div></div>",

I've tested it only once, to disastrous effects mind you, on an Arcanine. My calculations must have been off or maybe my subject drank too much of it because it grew to the size of a house. While in my laboratory! Needless to say, countless bottles were smashed and years of research was lost, but I never forgot the recipe for the potion.

The Arcanine that is?\" Leafeon finished folding up the blanket and pushed it inside the basket. The fit was tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A potion of reversal has eluded even my wits.

Drying leaves and fruits hang by the windows; chemicals of every color flow briskly through pipes and test tubes. Snivy brings a very large and dusty tome off a shelf in his library and lays it on a workbench. He brushes the cover clean; it's inscribed in strange symbols that you don't recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes,\" Snivy said as he browses the pages of the book. \"This is the one. See the footprint?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that from Arcanine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peer over Leafeon's shoulder. A huge black ink smudge covers two spread pages. In fact, it would have covered more than two pages as it was only part of the footprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The recipe for the growth potion is underneath the ink. Completely illegible, yes, but I have it stored in my mind just the same. I should have all the ingredients I need laying around. Finding them, however, shall take me a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy walks brusquely back and forth through the room, looking into shelves, cupboards, boxes and chests. Sometimes pulling out a dried leaf and putting it back only to pull out an identical leaf from a chest elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon reaches a paw over to you and gestures; you climb on. She brings you to her face and smiles kindly. \"You're going to be big again, I just know it! Snivy's a really good doctor and he's never had a patient die on him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's always a first time!\" Snivy answers while reaching behind a bookshelf to retrieve a paper that had fallen there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...\" Leafeon was nonplused. \"Tell me,\" she says changing the topic of discussion, \"you still want to be friends when everything's back to normal? Can you forgive me for trying to eat you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe honest answer is <i>no</i>, but you don't want to hurt her feelings. \"Yes, of course I forgive you, Leafeon! Friends forgive each other don't they?\" Leafeon smiles widely and pets you on the head. It still stings a bit but you smile back, glad to have sealed a friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, we'll be hosting a Vaporeon before the hour is up; I'll be needing several buckets of fresh water and a pool to put them in! With haste!\" You look towards where Snivy was speaking and see him directing his orders to a shy young Absol you had not noticed before. He was carrying a flask of blue liquid but had set it down upon receiving the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry where are my manners. Leafeon, Vaporeon, this is Absol my apprentice. A studious youth and knowledgeable on all fronts of medicine and herbalism. One day he might just succeed me in accomplishments but today, <i>he will fetch water</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon Absol's departure from the house-slash-laboratory, Snivy closes the curtains and produces a key which he then proceeds to use on a secret keyhole behind a painting. \"The final ingredient,\" he whispers \"very powerful. Can't have my assistance knowing of it. Not yet at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom an aged yellow envelope he pulls out a single leaf. It's small and fragile. \"Holocopis gigantum,\" Snivy says proudly, as if it's supposed to mean something to either of you, \"also known as Giant's Bane. A very rare plant indeed. Not found on this island, nor any island nearby for that matter. Only the most archaic of books mention it, and briefly at that. I happened upon such a rarity purely by chance, you see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carefully snapped off a tiny fragment of the leaf and dropped it into a test tube of orange liquid. The liquid began to bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a collector of antique books, as you no doubt can see. My collection is vast and bears archaic and forbidden knowledge. Some of these tomes are written in tongues that haven't been spoken for a thousand years or more. In one such book, which I had bought from a wandering peddler of strange goods, I found this beauty. The matter of how I uncovered her, however, is in itself not so magnificent. You see, I had fallen asleep while reading. When I woke up I discovered to my great dismay that my book had fallen to the floor and the delicate spine had broken. It was a fortunate act, however, as in the spine was hidden a bundle of herbs with this leaf among it. I quickly cracked open the spines of all the other books I owned as well. A shame, to ruin such old books, especially since none others had such a hidden cache. However, I am drifting from the point. The potion looks ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe potion indeed did look ready. It had changed from orange to a purplish hue. You walk to the end of Leafeon's paw and she places you on top of a stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really ready? Can I drink it and return to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may and you will,\" said Snivy \"However, perhaps only take a little sip. We don't want to have another Arcanine incident, do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy pours the potion into a saucer and you cautiously stick you tongue in. It doesn't taste very pleasant. You begin to drink and you feel a strange vibration ring through your body.</span></div></div>",

A terrible sense of direction I'm afraid. He should have been back with the water by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's alright, I'm not really that thirsty anymore.

Suddenly feeling a bit foolish for the obvious oversight, you realize that you could just do what all psychic-type Pokemon would have done in your situation. You direct your gaze to where the fox lay his head, and, clearing your mind you focus your powers towards him. The jewel on your forehead glows, a pleasant tingle flowing along its edges, and you sense that this fox indeed has no knowledge of your presence. As a matter of fact, you reckon he is right on the verge of entering dreamland. The idea that the Ninetales had all along been pretending not to notice you disappears and you breath easier with this new knowledge. Feeling increasingly certain of your safety, but yet stepping lightly on tip-toe, you begin to approach the fox's endowment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelative to you, the Ninetale's penis towers at least five times your own height. You approach within distance to be able to gently move the longer of the fur out of the way and what you find makes the bulge inside your own sheath slowly grow. The red tip of the Ninetales' penis gingerly pokes out from within the sheath, the very tip is the size of your own head. The natural moisture makes it glisten in the dimming twilight and a faint pleasant aroma emanates from the warm fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden tempestuous rustle of golden fur; the sound of claws displacing dirt. You freeze in place and give a cautious glance upwards, hoping to avoid any further meetings with the fox's paws. You well know that further encounters with the bottoms of such large feet might not end so luckily for you. But the danger quickly passes: the giant golden fox had simply adjusted his posture to a more comfortable one, all four paws outward, now laying more on his side. You look back at the sensual sight you had previously been admiring and notice to your delight that the movements of the fox caused more of the red tip to slide out and the feral fragrance to become more powerful. Touching was out of the question you knew, at least for now. The Ninetales was still in much too light a sleep and a sudden foreign embrace of the sensitive organ might not end well for the curious Espeon. Besides, who knew how the glorious Ninetales might react should he discover you, an Espeon of such minuscule proportion so rudely spying upon him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing pink paws just within grasp of the vulpine's member, you feel a friendly warmth radiate onto your paw pads, a pleasant contrast to the cold dirt floor. The warmth is transferred to your cheeks as you place pink paws upon them, blushing from the delightful embrace tinged with the nether smells of the Ninetales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to investigate the rest of your unknowing host, you slowly walk beside the length of the sheath, admiring the curls and whorls of golden fur. \"All of my fur is short...and such a boring pink,\" you can't help thinking to yourself, before lifting your head high to take in what lay ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight in front of your stops you in your tracks. At the base of the sheath, the monumental reproductive orbs of the Ninetales lay in full glory, side by side, for all the world to see. You look down between your own legs, gently exposing your growing organ from furry pink sheath. You give an idle stroke, noticing your paw still faintly warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing naturally curious, as Espeon tend to be, you decide that it would be good to get to know the Ninetales better elsewhere as well. You figure it would be interesting to see...</span></div></div>",

More details..\" you surmised with a slight smile, padding closer, the closer you got, the more you felt the warm waves of breath from the kitsune's partly open maw, the heat felt good on your chilling fur from the cold breeze flowing around the cavern, and you blushed as it aroused you slightly more, giving yet another idle stroke to your espy rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were close enough, you could faintly see into Ninetales' warm maw, making out the semi-sharp canine teeth he posessed, no doubt used for tearing off flesh from meat, seeing them sent a quiver down your spine, you certainly wouldn't want to get chewed up by those fangs, at your size it'd practically be a death sentence, but shaking off those thoughts for the moment, you used your psychic sight to see further in the maw, making out the smooth, saliva-coated vulpine tongue that undulated with each breath. \"that sure would feel nice on my body...\" you murmured softly, imagining lying on that tongue as it rubbed and warmed you, arousing you even more, your face filled with blush now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were lamenting, a sudden reaction from the ninetales startled you as the great fox shifted a bit, yawning that inviting maw wiiiiiide open, showing off every inch of the beautious foxen mouth, you meeped, eyes widening a bit as you saw all the way to the fox's red uvula and the dark abyss that was his throat at the back, his tongue outstretched as well, til it was a mere inch away from you, your heart pounded in those few seconds as a bit of drool dribbled onto the ground, then breathed out slowly as the muscle retracted into the kitsune's maw, the muzzle closing to it's partly open state from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat.. Was actually very, <i>VERY</i> arousing.. Your erection was throbbing at the very much sexy act you'd just witnessed the Ninetales do, you shudder a bit as another chilly wind gusted past you and whimpered softly, your thin fur no match for the cold force of nature, you shook your head, realizing you had to find a warm place to rest and soon, you won't last long in the cold, that much is for sure, that leaves the Ninetales as the only source of great warmth that you could sleep with... or even within.. You contemplated where you could rest though, but soon realize that with the way the chills were increasing, his mouth was the only warm place within reach that you could rest within, sure there was risk, but it would be quite warm and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmh.. I'll freeze if I stay out here anyway..\" you thought, shaking a bit more you decided it was worth the risk, the golden fox was fast asleep either way, no doubt dreaming about something wonderful, steeling your nerves, you slowly approached the open muzzle of the vulpine... The warm breath was still washing over you, though more intensely as you were a literal inch from his partly open maw, and then...</span></div></div>",

Mmh...\" you stifled out, in high heaven bliss as you closed your eyes and grinded against the vulpine's arousing tongue, your shaft spurting a bit of pre, which uttered a deeper murr from the sleeping fox, seemingly enjoying the flavor, meanwhile saliva had been pooling quite copiously, that the entire maw shifted as you were held fast to the ridged palate, you wondered what was going on before a loud <b>GULP!</b> resonated around the maw, making you gasp again, eyes parting as you look just in time to see the mighty fox's throat in action, the Ninetales had let the excess drool strain to the back of his maw and swallowed... \"O-oh my..\" you whispered, that was the second sexiest thing you'd seen the fox do tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing such a lovely sight sent you over the edge, as you squeak, spurting your seed onto the Ninetales' tongue, panting heavily at the sweet release, and it sure seemed as though the fox enjoyed it as well, for the tongue strained the spooge out and swallowed it quite eagerly, sending another shiver down your spine... You wondered if you would be taken for a ride when the vulpine gulps again, as the tongue continues lapping and slathering all around your form, lowering you down and depositing you neatly underneath, letting the fox get a better angle of tasting and sloshing that muscle at you, the murrs slightly loudening, as you relaxed entirely in bliss. \"Mmmh.. Ooh I do hope I'm next down that tunnel..\" you excitedly whisper, rolling about as you were thoroughly coated with slimy, warm drool..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after what seemed like hours, but was merely moments, the tongue scooped you back upon it, rolled you so you were facing the Ninetales' throat, then slowly inclined upward, causing you to slide back, your eyes widened as you smiled and blushed heavily. \"Myuuu.. Such a hungry fox..~\" you giggled, smiling, you were ready, you dragged your paws along the slimy tongue as you slid, the entrance to the fox's throat quivering and opening in anticipation of it's delicious treat.. You could hear faint gurgles coming from the gullet, Ninetales' stomach.. It frightened you at first, but now you were more than happy to slide into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the tongue gave a sharp incline and you were rapidly sent into the throat, closing you eyes as you feel, and hear, the powerful <b> <i>GULP!</i></b>  ring in your ears, squeaking and moaning as the hot flesh squelched and pressed around you, oozing you down the sleeping vulpine's gullet, panting softly, your blush was full-blown as you wiggled, much to the fox's delight as he murred in delight, you could hear the soft, but powerful throbs of his heart as you passed his chest, as well as the squishing and squelching of his gullet muscles working you down.. \"So warm..\" you murmured, the gurgles getting louder, you were closing in on his awaiting stomach..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last your journey into the belly of the beast came to a close as you press into the firm muscle that was the sphincter leading into Ninetales' hot, gurgling gut, the flesh eagerly parting and accepting you as food, you oozed and squelched through the sphincter, and slid unceremoniously down the hot flesh of the stomach wall, the sphincter above closing tightly shut once your tail slipped through, sealing you within the fox's gut, coming to a rest at the bottom of the kitsune's gurgling chamber, in a mixed pool of saliva and your juices, you murred and relaxed, feeling the great heat around you, taking a moment to glance around, you smiled, the pulsating folds of flesh in the stomach walls.. hearing the gurgles of the digestive chamber, and feeling the fleshy sack churn softly around it's contents..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe near-silence was broken as the flesh shook, your ears perked up, picking up a certain noise. \"<i>Brrurrrp...</i>\" and blushed more at the Ninetales' belch, giggling, you rubbed the soft flesh of his stomach, happy that he enjoyed his \"snack\". sighing contently, you rested against the stomach wall, letting your eyes close, you were very warm and tired.. Sleep soon took hold of you, as the chamber continued to churn and gurgle through the night..</span></div></div>",

The other option was, of course, to simply climb over the leg, and that's where you initially started for, grabbing a tuft of golden fur, but reason soon surfaced and you decided that you would rather not risk getting lost in the forest of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning your short pilgrimage, you step with caution over the many pebbles, that, while you would have not even considered them in your former size, present a very real tripping hazard to you now. You arrive at the large hind paw, glancing at the yellow fox's round pink paw pads, black protruding nails contrasting with their delicate form. They're not much different from your own you think, save for the scale. Being so far from the radiating warmth of ninetales' body, you notice what you previously hadn't: the air in the cave is unpleasantly cold. You begin to shiver slightly as your short pink fur, standard among Espeon such as yourself, is of little protection from the elements. Arriving now on the other side of his thigh, you keep yourself closer near the fox for warmth as a chilly wind blows into the cave. Although it's not in the least bit discomforting for the ninetales, the wind seems magnified in both force and coldness on your tiny form. Already quite near the buttocks, you're now close enough to see the familiar round shape of the testicles rising on the horizon and before long you stop in awe, head going up and taking in the sight of the kitsune's nine golden tails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the butt itself is obscured because of the way the tails are arranged; some tails on his legs, some between, and the remaining tails flowing back; this does not deter you. You peek into the nearest entrance to the maze of tails and enter the inviting warmth within. You are warmer, but not any safer for you know that any sudden movement by the kitsune could trap you. The gem in your forehead begins to glow and you feel guided by the supernatural force to your goal. You follow where the tails get denser, as you know they will all have to converge at one point, and you soon reach the end of the labyrinth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpwards your gaze is pulled, you behold the wonderful sight in front of you. Exactly as expected just below where the nine tails all neatly join the pelvis lies one large pink pucker. The beatings of your heart feel stronger and you unconsciously give your erection of firm squeeze with one warm paw. You've always had a thing for big butts and this view just tops everything. The tailhole is several heights of your own body above you, but clearly visible. You think this a bit strange for a moment for you know it's completely night by now and no doubt pitch dark inside the cave. After a moments though, you deduce that perhaps being a fire type Pokemon, ninetales must give off a fair bit of infrared light which your keen eyes are good at picking up thanks to your sight-enhancing psychic powers. You continue to gaze upwards mouth agape, the glorious pink anus holding your attention for an lustful naturally long time before your mind comes back to its senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of fatigue dons on you and you notice your sleepiness for the first time. You better get to sleep soon, but of course, where? If you are to survive the night you'll have to find some place to stay. The place must be warm and most importantly safe. The ninetales is the only source of warmth in the cave so won't have to travel very far, but just curling up in his fur would be very dangerous. You know that the slightest change of posture from the massive fox could leave your tiny body crushed under a mindlessly wandering stray paw or suffocated under the waves of golden fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit, beginning to shiver a bit from a particularly heavy gust that had just blown across the cave's entrance, and run the options through your mind. You can't go anywhere that is liable of being laid upon at any time during the night, and that really limits your choices. There is no easy answer and after a lot of though you realize only two places meet the requirements of safety and warmth. Both options are slightly crazy but you see no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the inviting pink pucker, then down at the two heavy orbs beneath. Either choice is just as good and each has its downsides. One might be a bit stinky, but the other might be a bit wet. Seeing as you have no other choice you decide to leave it to chance. Picking up a small pebble, the flattest you can find, you scratch with your claw a line onto one side. Line up, I sleep in his sheath tonight, plain side up, in his butt. You toss the stone into the air and it lands a short distance from you. Walking up to it with clenched paws and a smile of hope, see that you'll be spending the night...</span></div></div>",

This gives you the idea that maybe you could get his attention and possibly get some help from him.  You then think that doing so could get you eaten, but keep the idea in the back of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide it's time to begin entering the sheath.  You press your paw forward.  The hole is tight, but it opens to allow your passage as you insert your other foreleg.  Your nose follows as you begin to hear the Ninetails moan in his sleep.  You push onward as your head is engulfed, noticing that although musky, the air is breathable.  As your shoulders enter with your belly behind, your hind legs lose contact with the ground.  Your world is flipped as the Ninetails rolls in his sleep, coming to rest on his side, your legs dangling from his sheath.  You try to push off something to get yourself inside, thinking you were still at risk of being crushed, but your legs touch nothing but fur.  As you started to think about how you would get your way inside, you notice yourself a little deeper than before.  At first, you think it's just your imagination, but your suspicions are soon confirmed as the muscles holding you in place begin to pulse, causing the sheath to gobble you up at an alarming rate.  Your hind legs are soon engulfed, followed quickly by your tail, and you're finally inside your bed for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls pull you in some more before holding you in place.  There is no light, so you rely on your extrasensory perception to take in your surroundings.  You find that your paw is just touching the tip of the Ninetails' penis.  You don't want to excite him and risk getting crushed by a fox cock, so you try to wiggle your way back toward the exit.  To your dismay, you find that the walls hold you firmly in place, preventing any movement beyond wiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only hope for the best, and you decide to get some sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in a few hours to find that...</span></div></div>",

Meeping softly, you remained as still as possible, then felt movement, uh-oh, looks like the fox has woken up..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mraahhhhhh...\" stretching out the Ninetales yawned, licking over his muzzle and shaking his fur, murring slightly as he peered down at his arousal. \"Mmmh.. what a dream..~\" he blushed lightly having dreamed of humping the hottest vixen ninetales he'd ever met. \"ooh.. better take care of this before I get the day started.. but how to go about it..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in trouble now, you well knew, you saw two outcomes, one: the Ninetales would suck himself off and you'd get caught in the action, more than likely getting swallowed, and two: the ninetales would indeed seek out a vixen to mate with, and you'd probably end up inside of her, or maybe even him if the ninetales turned out to be more into males..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrrrurrr..

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you again used your psychic ability to survey your surroundings, you found that, amazingly, one of your paws was inside the Ninetails' cock hole.  You tried to pull it free, but soon remembered that the muscles surrounding you had you hopelessly outmatched in strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the walls squeezed hard, forcing the air from your lungs.  You gasped for breath, trying desperately to retain consciousness, but just as you were about to pass out, the pressure released, leaving you panting for air.  As you regained your senses, you noticed wetness on your forepaws.  It seemed that your struggles were pleasuring the Ninetails, and that meant the cock would soon begin to harden and emerge from the sheath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped dead.  You didn't want the Ninetails to notice you and possibly eat you, so you made every effort not to pleasure the beast.  Unfortunately, the walls squeezed you again, this time, pushing you deeper.  Your forelegs, now lubricated with precum, slid almost effortlessly into the opening at the tip of the penis, and the pleasure this caused sent blood pumping to the organ.  As the penis moved toward the opening behind you, it sucked you up even more quickly, and soon your head and midsection were soaked to the bone in the viscous, pungent fluid.  You could feel cold air on your tail as it emerged from the sheath, but you knew that it wouldn't last long as the cock continued to suck you up,  soon reaching your ass and hind legs.  Soon, only the diverging tip of your tail remained, and that too was gobbled up by the hungry member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new tube was even tighter than the sheath, and it continued to suck you deeper, the slimy walls beginning to arouse you as they rubbed along your crotch.  You continued to slide down until you reached the base of the shaft.  Your paws pressed against a wall of flesh, but the sphincter soon opened to allow you through.  You could finally move your forelegs as your head slid through to an open chamber nearly filled with fox cum.  The tube spits you into the chamber, plunging you into the thick liquid.  You quickly flip around so your head is above the surface, gasping for air.  The chamber is big enough for you, but you have to curl up to fit inside.  You feel the entrance to the tube that just pushed you through, and it has tightened to the point that you can't even push your paw through.  You were trapped inside the Ninetails' ball, amazed that you could breathe, as he slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try your best to get comfortable, not wanting to go back to sleep on the risk of drowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could try to escape by wriggling around and making the Ninetails cum, but he would be curious about what was squirming around inside his balls, and you might get noticed and eaten.  Your other option is to wait for the Ninetails to ejaculate by himself, but using esp, you find that the cock is returning to the sheath, and there's no telling how long it would be before the fox decided to jerk off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

Snores from the giant Ninetales echo in the cave. Good, you think to yourself, at least he won't be minding what I'm about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you can climb up the kitsune's fur? You give it a shot, clenching tightly a lock of golden fur and to the best of your ability attempt to pull yourself up. It doesn't quite work; the fur simply slips in between your clumsy Espeon paws. But this doesn't stop you. You try again. And then again. Alas, the best you manage to do is to pull your centimetre-tall self up half your own height before you drop, landing on your butt, your tail slightly cushioning the fall. Curse these clumsy paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh...well obviously! You facepaw yourself at having once again overlooked an obvious solution. There is a certain move, one you have not quite yet mastered, but that would help you greatly if you could perform it. You've only done it once before successfully. Well, half-successfully. It is quite difficult because it is a technique that combines both levitation and paralysis, the result being that you can fly and whatever tries to touch you becomes temporarily paralysed. The last time that you attempted this move was when you were in a fight with a Swellow. You managed to fly after, and paralyse the bird-like Pokemon for a few seconds, but then your aura of power failed for whatever reason and you fell headlong into a quick-moving stream. No one won the fight that day, but you were the laugh of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, it's worth a try. You sit down, close your eyes, empty your mind and begin to focus your psychic energy. A dim yellow aura starts to grow near the centre of your body. You focus more deeply and the sphere grows, eventually large enough to surround your body. This yellow aura is, as you know, the levitation sphere. Now you refocus your energy up higher, towards your throat. This aura would be blue, but since it is already inside the yellow aura the colors combine and an orb of green light begins to expand outwards. This is the paralysis aura and, slowly but surely, the green aura eventually matches the diameter of the formerly yellow sphere. Now comes the tricky part. You quickly refocus your energy away from your throat and into your heart. A faint hiss, followed by a pop, signifies the auras have locked together successfully. The misty power extends no further than necessary to the edges of your body. You know you shouldn't make it too big, or else it might not fit into the Ninetales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was...actually pretty straightforward, you think to yourself. Never before have you managed the difficult manoeuvre with such ease. Maybe being in the presence of a fire Pokemon had something to do with it? No, that was nonsense. I'm just stronger is all, you instead think, grinning. Or...maybe since I'm so tiny the amount of skill needed for the aura was proportionally as tiny. Your momentary smile fades at this far more likely explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take to the matter at hand and begin to levitate yourself upwards. Up you go, the dim green light of the aura glistening on the shiny pink flesh of the Ninetale's rather large pucker. He's going to have no problem fitting me in, you think to yourself with a shudder. You are now right up next to it and notice the slightly sour smell. It doesn't bother you too much, indeed judging by the growing erection you were sporting it was arousing you more than anything. I may as well go in hind first, you decide, so I can always have a clear view of the situation outside. You gingerly touch one pink hind paw to the large equally pink pucker of flesh, and feel its intense warmth on your foot. Yep, I'm certainly going to be safe from the cold, there's no doubt about that. The benefit of having used the blue sphere of paralysis was that it acted as an anesthetic: not even had the Ninetales been awake would he feel the entering intruder. You put your other hind paw next to the one already sinking into the silky folds and use your levitation to push yourself backwards. The slide in is slow and sensual, even as you apply more psychic pressure in attempts to hasten it. The large tailhole isn't exactly lubed up or anything, and having to take you in against the grain of your own fur was also hindering the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do eventually, slowly but surely, make it up to your shoulders. The warmth on the half of your body already inside the vulpine's butt is intense, but not unbearable. You'd gone through hotter summer days without complaining. With your front paws you grab what pink flesh you can, and begin to pull yourself in. Fortunately this works more effectively than using your levitation, so you revert to the easier method. Before long, only your head is sticking out from the Ninetales' anus, but taking in a deep breath first, even that soon disappears as the middle of the anus slowly closes up over you and returns itself to a seemingly virgin state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour psychic power having done its job, you turn it off with a sigh of relief. The green aura slowly fades to yellow, and then fades completely. It's a bit cramped inside the Ninetale's hot rectum, this much is true, but it's going to be your home for the next little while so you might as well enjoy it (and yourself). You grab the protrusion between your legs that has had so little attention and begin to jerk, cute squeaks sounding from the rapid pumping. You won't be going for anything fancy \u2013 just a quickie \u2013 and you take in the aroma \u2013 the fact that you're confined in the much larger Pokemon's rectum \u2013 and such a sexy ninetales at that \u2013 and before you know it the pressure built up inside your cock is released, splashing against the roof of the colon in silvery ropes of spooge which drip down the sides of the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while you recline, the tube-like shape quite comfortable for this use by a tiny Espeon and pant in the humid air, enjoying the afterglow. You idly wipe the cum off your sticky paw, just anywhere, on your chest is fine, and thoughts of going to sleep enter your mind. You open your eyes fully as you feel the Ninetales move, though almost unperceptibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, you think to yourself, can he feel my movements inside him? My anesthetizing aura is no longer active so I can only guess. You continue to lay for a while, in thought, until you finally arrive at your decision. I'm going to...</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, her sharp hearing means you don't have to shout. \"I'm sorry,\" she says, \"but I'll never remember your name. Everyone here just calls each other by species.

It's true, it does look soft and warm. The things that your worried about are the pulsing, powerful throat at the back and the massive, sharp teeth lining the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing your uneasiness and hesitation, she closes her mouth and locks her red eyes onto your purple ones. \"Listen, Espeon - I wouldn't be suggesting this if I didn't think you'd be perfectly safe.

At first you cringe down instinctively, struggling to overcome your instincts, but eventually get yourself to loosen up and look around. She was right about it being warm and soft, your paws have gently sunken into her tongue a short way. You lift one up, and watch as a sticky saliva string forms between it and the pink muscle beneath you. You see the huge teeth around you, huge white spikes locked together to form a cage around you. At first you thought of it as trapping you inside, but you are now coming to think of it as a protective cage. They are cleaner than you thought they would be. Warm air drifts up from the throat behind you in soft blasts. Her breath doesn't smell bad, but more like regular air with a hint of berries and - you shiver slightly - raw meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales giggles again around your body, then opens her maw once again to speak. She manages to keep her tongue fairly level so that you don't fall off as she says \"Good night, Espeon.\" She yawns before closing her mouth around you again, then rests her head on her paws and drifts swiftly off to sleep. You yawn yourself, then curl up in the middle of her tongue. You don't mind her saliva, at worst it's mildly annoying you by matting down your short fur. Eventually, listening to your new friend's steady breathing, you drop off to sleep yourself.</span></div></div>",

You begin to panic, before the previous day's memories come flooding back to you. You are quite annoyed to find yourself still only 1cm tall, but you feel safer once you remember Ninetales. It was nice of her to look after you like this, you think to yourself as you stretch out across her soft tongue. Your front paws slide a bit in the saliva on the surface of her tongue, and sink into it slightly. You let out a yawn before collecting yourself back together into a more natural position, and wait for her to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have to wait very long. Only a few minutes have passed when you feel a slight shift in the gravity of your 'bedroom'. Light pours in as she opens her jaws in a yawn of her own. Once she has finished you call out, \"morning, Ninetales!\"<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, good morning, Espeon...\" her reply vibrates through you and the rest of her mouth. The gravity shifts again, and then the sharp teeth around you separate as her tongue rolls out of her maw and onto the floor, allowing you to slide down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone floor of the cave seems to feel wrong beneath your paws - it's hard and dry. You shake the majority of the saliva out of your fur, then smile up at Ninetales, who is watching you fondly. \"Looks like someone could do with a bath!\" she exclaims before extending her tongue once again. You hop onto it and it draws you back inside of her. You don't mind so much now, you are getting used to being inside her mouth. You feel her getting up and walking, presumably out of her cave. Only a few seconds later, she opens her jaws again and you fall straight into cold water. You surface gasping for breath; you hadn't been prepared. Looking around, you see that you are in a mountain spring, judging by the mountain that it is connected to. The cave is just a short way along the face of the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales climbs gently into the spring beside you, careful not to disturb you or create ripples which could drown you. You swim over to her and press against her for warmth. She notices you shivering, and thinks for a moment before smiling down at you. Using her fire abilities, she begins to create heat inside her body, which quickly spreads to the water around you. Soon the entire spring is heated to a comfortable bathing temperature. She grins down at you again. \"Better?\" she enquires. You stick your tongue out at her and then dive under the surface of the water. You are a strong swimmer despite not being a water type, and can hold your breath for quite long. While you're under, you take advantage of the fact that the water is now all around you and scrub off all of the saliva that was coating your fur. It doesn't take long, and you quickly resurface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of swimming together, Ninetales asks if you want to get out now. You agree, but before she can climb out of the water, your ask her to wait. Taking advantage of the fact that her head is now at the same level as yours, you climb onto her muzzle and up onto her head. You shake the water out of your fur, then tell her that you're ready. She swims to the edge of the water and climbs out. You can now see the world from the same perspective that you used to. \"Hold on tight up there, Espeon!\" she shouts up to you suddenly. By now you have learned that when you're this small, you should follow that kind of instruction as fast as possible. You lay flat on her head and grab a mouthful of her fur. She then shakes off the water from her body, and although she moves her head as little as possible, you still nearly fall off the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that really necessary?\" you ask as you recover from the dizziness.<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" she giggles. You roll your eyes, and then ask what you're going to do now. \"Well, usually I either go for a walk or look for some breakfast at this time in the morning,\" she crosses her eyes upwards in a futile attempt to look at you. \"Are you feeling hungry, Espeon?\"</span></div></div>",

You realise that since you don't know how long you were unconscious for, you can't tell how long it's been since you last ate.<br>\r\n\"Well then, I know exactly where we can go get some berries!\" Ninetales exclaims, still giggling slightly, before setting off into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you make your way through the forest, you find that you are noticing different things than you normally would, if you were normal sized, <br>\r\nsuch as where the drops of dew form on the petals of the flowers, and tiny cave-like knot-holes in the tree trunks.<br>\r\n\"Do you have a favourite berry, Espeon?\" asks Ninetales brightly. You think for a moment, then reply \"sitrus berries\".<br>\r\n\"That's lucky, there's plenty of those. I prefer hondew berries myself, but they're almost impossible to get...\" she trails off wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few moments later, you enter a large clearing, and all around the edges and dotted throughout are various berry bushes and trees. You can see what Ninetales meant about the sitrus berries, those are everywhere. Ninetales walks up to one of the sitrus bushes and lowers herself to the floor, allowing you to slide off from her head. You walk up to the bush and find a berry growing near the ground, several times your size. You bite into it, savoring it's sweet flavour, then pull it from the bush and drag it back to Ninetales, who is watching you with interest. Despite its size, the berry isn't very heavy at all, and it doesn't take you tong to get to her. You take bites from the berry until you are full, and offer the rest to her. She licks it up and swallows it without even chewing - it's almost as if she's showing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clamber back onto her head again and sit up between her ears. She gets up and begins walking towards a tall tree near the edge of the clearing. You can see that it is covered with hondew berries, and why Ninetales doesn't get to eat them very often: it's far too tall for her to reach. She sits down at the bottom of the tree and sighs. \"It doesn't look like any have fallen down today...\" she says with deep disappointment. However, you aren't really paying much attention. You are thinking about your psychic powers, and wondering to yourself... have your powers changed in strength along with your size? Can you now use your powers in relation to your size, or in relation to your <i>old</i> size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales sighs again, and turns to walk away. \"Wait,\" you say suddenly, and she stops, tries to look at you, fails, then turns back.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" she asks with surprise.<br>\r\nRather than answer your question, you simply say \"I want you to sit very still near the trunk of that hondew tree\". Ninetales obeys, and sits silently back down facing the tree. Now that you're both sitting still, you can focus. You select a particularly juicy-looking berry from one of the lowest branches, picture it in your mind for a good few seconds, then close your eyes and concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gem in your forehead glows faintly and the fluff on your cheeks and your ears stand up and straighten themselves out as the psychic energy flows out of you. You hear a small, distant snap, then Ninetales gasps in a mixture of shock and delight. You can feel the weight of the berry pressing down on your mind as you guide it slowly through the air, and smile to yourself - it's just as you had hoped; the berry weighed almost nothing to you, which meant that your powers hadn't changed at all. More confident now in your own abilities, you open your eyes to watch as the berry gracefully floats and dances through the air towards you. You swing it down alongside Ninetales' head and hop onto it, and ride it down to the floor in front of Ninetales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at her face, you find that Ninetales is staring at you open-mouthed, as though she can't quite believe that you just plucked a berry that was the same size as you from a tree several hundred times your height. Well, it is pretty unbelievable, but that's just psychic powers for you. You grin back up at her and hop off from the berry. \"I thought you would like one, in return for everything you've done for me,\" you explain in a matter-of-fact voice. She smiles down at you appreciatively, then eats it, clearly savoring it's flavour. Eventually, she finds her voice and says \"That... was <i>so</i> cool.</span></div></div>",

That's the first thing I've tried lifting since I shrunk,\" you reply thoughtfully. \"Although I used to be able to lift boulders twice my size\".<br>\r\n\"Lift something else! Pleasepleasepleeeeease!!\"<br>\r\nYou can't help but laugh at her, she seems like a child asking their parents to buy them something. Looking around, you see a stone and several assorted berries lying around. You stare at them, then close your eyes and picture each one individually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes again and watch as each one floats into the air. You bring them towards you and send them circling slowly around Ninetales' head, each one revolving itself at the same time. Ninetales just stares awe-struck at the multi-coloured halo around her and breathes the word \"wow...\" You spin them faster and faster until they become a blurred ring, then suddenly stop them all in place and gently lower them to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing...\" breathes Ninetales, almost as if hypnotised by the memory of the colourful halo. You grin at her, then say \"hold on tight, Ninetales\". You expel a massive amount of energy through the air and go as still as a statue with the sheer concentration. After a moment Ninetales lets out a startled \"eep!\" as her paws lift slowly from the grass. She is stunned silent as she gracefully floats into the air, revolving around slowly as her body drifts away from the ground. She begins to giggle with glee as she hangs there, completely unsupported save for your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her one last revolution before gently pulling her back down to earth. As her paws touch the ground, you release her from your power and walk casually over to her. \"Was that really necessary?\" she asks, still giggling from the experience.<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" you reply as you hop onto the stone from earlier and hitch a lift to her head. She laughs as you both set off back towards the cave.</span></div></div>",

As you leave the clearing, a glint of grey catches your eye, in stark contrast with the natural bright colours of the forest. \"Wait,\" you tell her. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" She replies, slowing to a stop.<br>\r\nYou slide down onto her muzzle, where she can see you, and gesture to where you saw the grey. \"That.\" You are worried that the flash may have been from the fur or skin of a forest-dwelling pokemon, a mightyena perhaps. If it can sneak up on you, it could take you both down as if you were its prey...<br>\r\n\"Oh, that,\" she says as she turns and walks towards it. You abandon your previous fears, as Ninetales clearly doesn't see this thing as a threat. \"I was going to show you this, but I got distracted by being lifted off the ground by amazing psychic powers\". She giggles again as you blush slightly behind your fur. She walks around a tree that was blocking your view, so that you can see the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr things, actually, six in total. They are all made of stone, five smaller pillar-like ones around one large one. \"It's an obelisk,\" explains Ninetales. \"Each pillar represents a different thing. Fire, water, air, earth and energy.\" You pull a leaf from a nearby tree and bring it up next to you, then ride it down to the floor. You approach the nearest pillar. Ninetales follows you up to it, and as you approach it, you begin to feel warmer as heart radiates outwards from it. \"This is the pillar of fire,\" she tells you. \"They go around in the order I told you them in, in a clockwise order\".<br>\r\n\"What's the one in the middle?\" You ask as you approach it. It looks different to the others, it rises above them, and is more slab-like. <br>\r\n\"This one represents Arceus, the god of all pokemon. It is said that he watches over and protects the beings in the forrest from this spot, and is even able to bring back the dead and make pokemon immortal,\" comes the informative reply, \"although he first judges their lives to see if they are worthy. There was only ever one pokemon who became immortal this way, but no-one has ever proved it. They say that it was a little Pichu who was being hunted and killed for fun by vicious pokemon. When he died, Arceus pitied him, and brought his soul here, building him a new body and giving him another chance. And they say that any time he died again, his body would just be rebuilt here, and he would just leave again,\" Ninetales concluded her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in awed silence for a few seconds, then ask if it's ever happened since.<br>\r\n\"Not that I know of,\" Ninetales replies. The two of you stand there for a few more moments, then Ninetales says \"Anyway, we should carry on home now\". You leap back onto your leaf and ferry yourself back onto Ninetales' head, sit down and get comfortable as she sets off again. The conversation soon changes back to the subject of your \"incredible\" psychic powers, and before you know it, you're back at the cave. What do you do next?</span></div></div>",

She lays her head on the ground between her forepaws, allowing you to slide down to the grass beneath you. You turn around to smile back up at her, and notice - for a fraction of a second before she could hide it from you - an anxious look in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Something the matter?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n\"No, it's nothing,\" she replies far too quickly, almost cutting off your question with her answer.<br>\r\n\"Come on, you can tell me,\" you say, calmly adding, \"otherwise I'll have to read your mind.\"<br>\r\nHer eyes light up with excitement. \"You can read minds?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can,\" you reply. You are half-lying here: you can't read minds, but you can read active thoughts, such as what people are about to say. The trick is to get people to think about what you want to know from them.<br>\r\n\"What number am I thinking of?\" She almost barks in excitement, subtly changing the subject.<br>\r\nYou sit down facing her. \"36,\" you inform her. She gasps, almost as though she wasn't expecting you to get it right. She opens her mouth to continue talking, but you aren't letting her out of this so easily. \"Stop changing the subject and tell me what you were thinking about just now\".<br>\r\nShe sighs. \"Okay, fine\".

Her face falls as she takes in your body language, her ears droop and she looks down at the floor. \"I knew you'd react like that, that's why I was too nervous to ask you...\" She confesses. As she talks, you shake off the initial shock and take a few steps back towards her, and sit down in front of her muzzle. She continues to speak, confessions flooding out in a steady flow. \"It was last night that it started, when you slept on my tongue. You tasted amazing, and I would have been more than happy to carry you around in my mouth all day if you let me. It happened again later with the hondew berry - it tasted like you! You're like a combination of a sitrus berry and a hondew berry. It was the sitrus berry that got me thinking, I could swallow it easily, and it was several times your size, so I could easily swallow you without hurting you at all... I was just worried about what you would think of me for saying it out loud. I didn't know how you'd react, I didn't know if you'd be scared or angry or if you'd think I was weird or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now she has worked herself into such a state that her voice is shaking and she's almost in tears. You get up and walk deliberately up to her muzzle and, standing on your two back paws, slide your two tiny forepaws onto her tongue. For a second she is shocked silent by your gesture, and slides her tongue out further in reflex. You nuzzle against the slick pink surface, purring softly as you rub your face across it. \"Would you be able to get me out in time?\" you ask her softly. Ninetales blinks a few times, and a wide grin spreads across her muzzle as she registers the meaning of your words.<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course! Watch!\" She draws her head back from you, causing you to drop to the floor as she carefully slides her tongue out from under you. She bends her head down, coughs a few times, then a very slimy object drops to the ground in front of you. It is your sitrus berry, completely unchanged from the last time you saw it (except for the thick coating of saliva, of course). \"See? I can control my entire digestive system almost completely. It's kinda like a party trick\".<br>\r\n\"In that case...\" you reply, trying not to laugh at the excitement on her face, \"yes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ceremony, Ninetales gleefully licks you up with her slimy tongue and draws you into her maw. She begins to lick you all over, clearly savouring your taste, but also sufficiently wetting you for your journey down her waiting throat. You turn to look at the opening, feeling your fears from the previous night surge up inside you as you do your best to subdue them with rational thoughts. Before you have time to calm yourself properly, though, the opening flexes wide open and the tongue arches beneath you, pitching you towards it. You just have time to take a deep breath of air before you tumble headlong into her throat, the muscles squeezing shut behind you. You pick up speed quickly in the lubricated fleshy tunnel as it turns sharply until it goes straight downwards. It flies past you at an amazing rate, and you feel adrenaline building up in your system, loving every second of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon come flying out into a large chamber which you assume to be her stomach. \"I'm here!\" You call out to her as you stand up and get orientated. The stomach walls suddenly light up and glow a bright orange, illuminating your \"room\" for you. Ninetales must have used her fire abilities to provide you with a little light. Your world suddenly flips upside down as Ninetales rolls onto her back. You see the new ceiling bulge inwards as you assume she rubs her stomach with satisfaction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes of thinking, all you could remember was a bright flash of light, then you passed out. \"What am I going to do now?\" You ask yourself.

You can be either a human or a pokemon, but you always start out at 1cm. You can change size during the story, but you can only become a giant yourself if you start as a pokemon. If you are killed by a pokemon, you can reform/re-spawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ~~ ABBREVIATED RULES ~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shortened version of the rules in case the full list is a little bit too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything goes, vore-wise; no anthros; 2nd person; good spelling and grammar; no human preds; keep the spare option in \"what pokemon are you\" open, or \"other\"; be descriptive; pokemon can't speak to people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA full explanation of each rule is listed below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--RULES--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. This is an adult vore and macro story, so you can have oral vore, anal vore, cock vore, breast vore (on the anthro pokemon, more on that later), tail vore (obviously only if the pokemon has a tail), unbirth, sex (if you can make it work between macros and micros), paw, stomp, anything goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No anthros, unless the pokemon is anthro normally, such as lucario or gardevoir. Female anthros have breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Keep the story in the second person, present tense (for example, \"you wake up\", not \"he woke up\").<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Please use good spelling and grammar, and write at least a paragraph per chapter, if possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Only have pokemon doing the vore and growing. Sorry, but humans aren't allowed to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Once the pokemon line in the \"what are you\" chapter (selecting what pokemon you are) goes down to two options per chapter, leave the second option as \"other\". This is just so that you can be any of the 600 or so pokemon if you want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Please try to make it descriptive, especially the macro and vore parts. Just having \"it eats you\" stuck in a chapter doesn't feel satisfying to read, does it? Just imagine what it would feel, sound and look like to be eaten alive, and the entire chapter would instantly liven up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. You can only speak to pokemon if you are a pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, have fun! That's what there stories are for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there are only a few minor grammar or spelling errors in your chapter, I am willing to edit them. Unless I am REALLY, REALLY BORED, I will delete chapters with far too many errors. If I can't work out what you are trying to say, I will usually delete the chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a chapter breaks the rules, I will remove it.</td>",
