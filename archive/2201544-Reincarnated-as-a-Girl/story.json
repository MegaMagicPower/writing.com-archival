            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Darkness. All you saw was darkness. One moment you were walking on the sidewalk, the next, a drunk driver comes speeding around the corner and hits you, killing you instantly. Now, there was nothing but darkness surrounding you. You knew you were dead, so you were wondering why you were still conscious, until a light appeared in front of you. In that light, stood a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya! Bet you\u2019re wondering where you are, huh?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that crossed my mind.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re in a place we like to call \u2018The Place Between\u2019. It\u2019s basically where you go when you die.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so I really am dead then. But who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, guess I forgot to mention that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d She giggled. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve had many names. Out of all of them, my favorite one is Genesis, but you can call me Gen, or even Genny if you want. I\u2019m the god of reincarnation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I never thought I\u2019d meet a god. So Gen, what happens now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, you get reincarnated in another world.\u201d Gen answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait really? Like in all those isekai anime and manga?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight!\u201d She exclaimed. \u201cNormally, people would be reincarnated randomly after having their memories erased. However, certain people, usually ones who died saving one or more other people, not only are reincarnated with their memories intact, but they also get to choose what type of world they are reincarnated into, and what race they are reincarnated as, choosing from a list of races that exist in their selected world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on a second, so I\u2019m going to have my memories erased?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, was I not clear?\u201d Gen asked. \u201cYou\u2019re actually an exception to the rules. The Higher Ups actually want to make things a bit more interesting in this case. They seem to like you, so you get to enjoy the privileges that only heroes get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHigher Ups? You mean there are gods higher up than you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, they aren\u2019t gods. They\u2019re higher than gods. And I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s even a word for what they are. So us gods just call them the \u2018Higher Ups\u2019.\u201d Gen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGods? As in plural? What other gods are there? Or are you all gods of reincarnation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit complicated. You know all the Greek Gods, Norse Gods, Egyptian Gods, and all those mythologies with multiple gods? Well those are all actually lower level deities that humans have mistaken for being the highest beings in existence. They\u2019re even below me. And each world has their own lower level deities that call themselves gods, and convinced the inhabitants of their worlds that they are the highest beings in existence. Which isn\u2019t hard since no gods above them ever really communicate with humans. I\u2019m the only one, but like I said, usually I erase people\u2019s memories when they\u2019re reincarnated so none of them remember meeting me.\u201d Gen explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sucks. If I were you, I\u2019d want recognition for what I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah no kidding. Unfortunately, even I have rules to follow, and this is one of the few times I\u2019m allowed to break them. Like I said, normally, I can only allow heroes to keep their memories, so they\u2019re the only ones that know about me.\u201d She said. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019re getting way off track. You need to decide what world you want to be reincarnated into.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018what kind of world\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there are worlds that your worlds would call \u2018fantasy worlds\u2019, and \u2018sci-fi worlds\u2019, those are the two big ones. Then there are also worlds that are mixtures of both, and there are worlds very similar to your own as well. The only world you\u2019re not allowed to pick is the one you came from. Oh yeah, and by \u2018world\u2019 I mean universe.\u201d She explained. \u201cOh yeah, there are also variations of each type of world, including variations such as worlds where women are the dominant sex, where men are slaves, where WOMEN are slaves, and many more. Just tell me what kind of world you want to be reincarnated into, and then I\u2019ll give you a list of races in those worlds, and you choose from that list which race you want to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, I\u2019ll choose-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! I forgot to mention that no matter which world or race you choose, you\u2019ll HAVE to be reincarnated as a girl.\u201d Gen added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno. The higher ups said that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll be allowed to keep your memories. They never told me why.\u201d She answered. \u201cThey probably just want to see you adjust to life as the opposite gender. It should be easy since you\u2019ll grow up as a girl, rather than just transforming into one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess if the alternative is having my memories erased, I can live with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! So, which kind of world do you want to be reincarnated into?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSurprise me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, then here\u2019s a list of races that exist in this world.\u201d A screen appears in front of you, as if you were in a full-dive VR game, showing various races commonly found in fantasy as well as some other races. \u201cOh yeah, before you choose which race you want to be. Let me explain how the Sci-Fi and Fantasy World is structured. Basically, it\u2019s set up like your typical Sci-Fi space series, with races living on various planets throughout the galaxy. Of course there are also inhabited worlds outside your chosen galaxy, but leaving the galaxy is currently impossible because intergalactic travel has not been accomplished yet. Most races use magical portals for intergalactic travel, sometimes taking entire spaceships through those portals, sometimes creating portals while on foot and stepping through, though only really powerful mages can do that. Some races use science for intergalactic travel instead of magic. Dwarves, who aren\u2019t proficient in magic, focus on science, even using projectile and energy weapons created through science, as well as melee weapons, and their ships create artificial wormholes for intergalactic travel. And that\u2019s most of what you need to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumans exist in this world right? Are they proficient in magic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, though not as much as certain other races such as the various Elven races.\u201d She answered. \u201cOh yeah, and also, each race has its own home planet, with various \u2018sub-races\u2019. For humans, there are what your world call caucasians, africans, asians, hispanic, and pretty much every race of humans that exist in your homeworld. Other races also have \u2018sub-races\u2019 including the Elves, such as High Elves, Forest Elves, Dark Elves, and various others. In addition to home planets, each race has various colonies throughout the galaxy, and there are also some neutral planets that have several races living on them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, anything else I need to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat should be it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said that before. Anyway, I guess I should choose which race no-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah! One last thing!\u201d Gen interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnew it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVampires and werewolves, also exist in this world. They\u2019re not technically races though, they are more like...disease victims. Maybe victims isn\u2019t the right word, but you know what I mean. Any race can be a vampire or werewolf. No matter what race you choose, you\u2019ll also have the chance to become a vampire or werewolf if you get bitten by one. Or neither. Also, demons exist as well. They\u2019re a special race that can leave their own bodies after reaching adulthood, and forcefully possess the bodies of other races. They reproduce with their host bodies. A demon child will be born with a body conceived by their parents host bodies, and be able to leave that body upon reaching adulthood. If only one parent is a demon, no child will be born, so keep that in mind if you choose demon as your race. And if you DO choose demon as your race, you can choose what your birth body will be. It can even be two different races. And demons can even possess vampires or werewolves, and their bodies can BECOME vampires or werewolves after being possessed if they are bitten by one, but while their host bodies and birth bodies can become vampires or werewolves, the demons themselves can\u2019t become vampires or werewolves since they don\u2019t have actual bodies besides their birth bodies, so if a demons birth body or host body  becomes either a vampire or a werewolf, and they leave that body, possessing a new body instead, the new body won\u2019t become a vampire or werewolf just because their previous body was one. That body would have to be bitten as well. Demons never die, unless their host body or birth body dies while they\u2019re still inside it, so demons could live forever if they can leave the body before it dies every time. However, a demon CAN die if it stays out of any bodies for more than a few hours, so be careful about that if you choose demon. Also, vampires can only be killed by decapitation while werewolves can only be killed with silver.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. That\u2019s it.\u201d She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, let\u2019s go with-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah! One more thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \u201cAnd that is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, I was just messing with you that time. Go ahead and choose your race now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll choose...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Each type of Elf specializes in a specific type of magic. High Elves are good at light magic. They look almost exactly like humans, other than the pointy ears of course. Forest Elves are good at plant magic, and have green skin, with plant-like hair. They have an offshoot, the Wood Elves, who are particularly good at magic involving trees specifically.

Apparently, you and your mother had legs when dry, and your legs changed into a fish tail when wet. The three of you lived together on land by the shore.

Orders, you know?\u201d She smiled. \u201cThough, that won\u2019t be until your teenage years. Probably when you have your first period. Oh, and one last thing before you go. Mermaids typically live on water planets, because they prefer to live in water, but their home planet is the same as the humans home planet, since they are an exclusively female race that reproduces by mating with human males. Mermaids can only give birth to mermaids, so all their children are female. A mermaid can\u2019t give birth to human babies even though the father is human. Even though most mermaids live on water planets, without humans, they tend to go to human planets for mating, and some live in the oceans of human planets. Also, they CAN live on land too, since their tails can become human legs. That\u2019s all, see you when you hit puberty!\u201d She snapped her fingers and suddenly, everything went dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darkness seemed to only last a jew moments, but in reality, lasted months.

The two of you live in the ocean of a human planet with your father living on the shore. You have yet to meet your father since mermaids tend to raise their children alone in the water until they reach the age of 13, and they are then allowed to meet their fathers unless they live on water planets without humans. Although, some mermaids live on land with the fathers of their children. You know this because you and your mother live in a mermaid village in the ocean, and you heard the mermaids mention the custom of letting their children meet their fathers at the age of 13. The village consists of houses made out of coral, with magic lighting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Or rather, they\u2019re not the same race.\u201d Gen replied. \u201cYou see, the \u2018Cylons\u2019 on the list are a mechanical race created by the Dwarves before they rebelled and established their own colonies on other planets. So they have the same backstory, but created by Dwarves instead of Humans. And they actually look more like the T-800 from Terminator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were created by Dwarves, so are they short?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, one of the many functions the Cylons were created for was to reach things that were too high for the Dwarves to reach. Especially on the neutral planets and when they were at war with other races and invaded enemy planets. Now, since the Cylons rebelled against them, they have tools that levitate anything they can\u2019t reach towards them.\u201d Gen explained. \u201cFortunately, the galaxy is currently at peace, but small conflicts arise here and there from time to time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...okay. How would my reincarnation work if I chose Cylons? You know, since they\u2019re mechanical.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCylons reproduce by building new units. You would be built. Don\u2019t worry, each Cylon has an individual personality and can customize their own appearance after they\u2019re built.\u201d Gen replied. \u201cAnd don\u2019t think you can get out of the whole \u2018girl thing\u2019 by choosing a mechanical race. Their endoskeletons may look like T-800s, but they cover themselves in artifical skin that makes them look like other races, and their endoskeletons are given distinct male and female shapes. Which means once your artificial skin is applied, you\u2019ll look like a woman. And though artificial, your skin will still have the same senses as any other race, so you\u2019ll be able to feel the things you touch, and you can even masturbate. They design their bodies to be a lifelike as possible. So despite being mechanical, you\u2019ll still be built female. The main difference between the Cylons and other races, aside from being mechanical is that they can\u2019t age or get sick. So they can\u2019t become vampires or werewolves either. And as an added bonus, Cylons, being mechanical, can\u2019t be possessed by demons either. They\u2019re powered by a Perpetual Magical Core, or PMC. Dwarves may not be proficient in magic, but they\u2019re such technological geniuses that some of them studied magic enough to learn how to create the PMC. It\u2019s basically a magic battery that continuously replenishes its energy as its being used.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you choose to be a Cylon?</span></div></div>",
