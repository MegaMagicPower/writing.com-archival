His best friend Jack (the loud guy currently jumping around and rambling about how they would have <i>so much fun</i>) had invited him on a trip for Spring Break, and he wasn't one to refuse. Also invited were Jill, Melissa, and Rachel, three girls he had been friends with since freshman year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze, Jack,\" Melissa started, \"calm down!\" Melissa was a fairly tall girl, tan skin and athletic build. Her brown hair was drawn back in a pony-tail, which would Thomas might call cute if it wasn't for the grimace she was directing at their mutual friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm?\" Jack asked, \"Come on! We're at Thrillride Park!\" The sign above Jack agreed with him; it displayed the parks name in big lit-up letters, along with it's slogan: \"<i>A Ride You Won't Forget!</i>\" It's probably one of the best and biggest parks in North America, and Tom was hoping it lived up to it's reputation. Of course, Jack's parents didn't feel the same way; they had elected to stay back at the hotel, promising to catch up later. This didn't seem to dampen Jack's mood any, much to Melissa's chagrin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa just sighed. \"You could at least be a little quieter...\" she mumbled, walking along as the group made its way through the main gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, let him be excited,\" Jill said, grinning. She was shorter than her friend, but her full figure ensured that no one would mistake her for a child. \"Hell, I'm ready to start shouting, too!\" Tom chuckled as he and his friends came to a stop in front of a large fountain, people moving in herds around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Rachel asked, \"what are we doing first?\" Rachel spoke softly, as usual, her red hair floating in the breeze. She was skinny, sort of a beanpole really, but Thomas had always found her pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to see the rides first, obviously,\" Melissa started, \"The lines are already starting to get long. I'd like to get on more than one of them today, y'know...\" Thomas noticed she was right; most people were funneling in towards the roller-coasters, which were peering out over the top of the trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but what about the water park?\" Jill asked, \"it's so hot today, and it's not like the rides won't be here tomorrow.\" Jill turned to face her red headed friend. \"What about you, Rachel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I was actually hoping we could take a look around first? I hear they have a haunted house...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up for anything!\" Jack said, \"Thomas, how about you?\" Thomas paused for a moment, looking back and forth between his friends, before deciding on...</span></div></div>",

Michael rolled his eyes, even as he blushed; it hadn't been his intention to get the girl's into their swimsuits, though he had to admit it was a nice side effect. Plain and simple, it was just <i>hot</i> out that day; Thomas had been starting to sweat since he stepped through the park gates. So, as they walked off towards the Thrill Ride Water Park, Thomas was hoping for a nice time in some refreshing water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of five stopped outside the changing rooms, with Rachel depositing her small backpack on a bench in front of them. While Jill and Thomas glanced around at the places in the park they could go to, and Jack and Melissa bickered, Rachel pulled out two pairs of trunks and two bikinis, along with a few towels; the group had decided before leaving the hotel to pack their suits together so they could change in the park but still have the minimum amount of baggage between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm good to buy us a locker so we can stash my backpack,\" Rachel said, depositing the suits on the bench for each person to grab their respective garb, \"Jill, you have yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wore it here!\" Jill said, pulling back the neck of her t-shirt to reveal the strap of a purple bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Rachel said. Nodding to Melissa, the two of them headed towards the ladies change room, and leaving Thomas and Jack to head into the men's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes trouble strike Thomas early, or does it wait until he's on a ride...?</span></div></div>",

So, changing as quick as he could, he made it out of the room in record time, ahead of his friends. Thomas was wearing a green and black pair of trunks, waistband bound tight and with velcro at the front, a new pair since his old ones had gone unused for a pretty long time and weren't exactly his size anymore. Jill, meanwhile, had doffed her shirt and shorts to stand there in a purple, triangle cut, side tie bikini and flip flops. Certainly a little more than some women would show, but still tasteful enough, Melissa looked pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing out soon after Thomas was Melissa and Rachel. Rachel was wearing an orange bikini, one with metal rings on either side of the hip and between the cups of the top, and Melissa was in green, though Thomas could only see the bottoms, as she'd elected to keep her white t-shirt on as well. Finally Jack came out after them, wearing a red pair of trunks, and smiling wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, everybody, gimmie your clothes and lets try to stuff this all into one locker,\" Rachel said, holding out her open backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prep for going on the rides was short enough-- the only real events of notice being when Jill teased Melissa by pointing out her underwear, poking out of her shorts as everyone filled Rachel's backpack, and when Jack was swiftly shut down in his offer to help the girls with their sunscreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Jack asked, grimacing as he wiped sun lotion residue off onto his shorts, \"where to first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group mulled it over for a moment, before deciding...</span></div></div>",

The windows are mostly dark, but every so often one lights up and a shadow crosses in front of it. The siding is missing in certain spots of the house, and as you approach the iron gates to the attraction, you notice gargoyles hanging on the ledge of the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This might be more frightening,</i> Thomas thought, <i>if it wasn't 10 AM, in the middle of spring. At least we don't have to wait.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are let through the gates (which, though they have been made to look rusted, Thomas notices they swing open just fine), Thomas takes a look at his friends. Jack and Rachel still look excited, and Jill doesn't seem any different, but Melissa seems to be faltering a little, looking back to the gates even as she starts up the front steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Melissa?\" Jill asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't I be?\" Melissa snaps, \"I just want to get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not scared?\" Jill smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting the two of them bicker, Thomas takes a look around the front entrance. It's a small room, with paintings all around the walls, their eyes shifting back and forth. There's a large double door in front of the group, flanked by a suit of armor on either side; besides that, there are two doors to the left and right. As Thomas tries to open the door, he finds it's locked; trying the other two gives him a similar result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Jack starts, \"now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response to his question, suddenly...</span></div></div>",

He was in what looked like a large cave, with small lights embedded in the walls, above him he saw the trapdoor swing shut, and looking around told him that nobody else had fallen in. He was alone.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" He called out.<br>\r\n No answer. <br>\r\n\"Jack? Jill? Melissa? Rachel?\"<br>\r\nStill no answer<br>\r\nThe 'pool' of water turned out not be be very big and there was solid land about nine feet away from where Tom had splashed down. Still confused about this bizarre attraction he quickly swam over and pulled himself up. He shivered, that cold water had soaked him right through and he wasn't sure if slopping through this cave in this state would be a good idea. He pulled of his shirt and dropped his now-heavy shorts, putting them in a pile, now reduced to his boxer shorts.<br>\r\nLooking down at the garment, it was just as wet as the rest of his stuff, wearing it could cause problems but then without he would be...<br>\r\nTom gulped slightly, this is a decision he did not want to make, but had to before moving on.</span></div></div>",

Not that the boxers alone weren't plenty embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if I'm lucky, Jack'll find me,\" Thomas muttered to himself, \"he'll make fun of me the rest of the week, but he'd probably help me out. Better him than one of the girls, at least...\" Shaking the hypothetical embarrassment from his mind, Thomas looked around the cave a little more. The lights were somewhat dim, but the reflection off the water made things a little brighter. The pool took up the middle of the chamber he was in, with stone ledges and rocks of various sizes jutting out all around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of searching, Thomas found a decent-sized indent along one of the stones. After moments hesitation, he stuck his discarded clothes in there.<i> No one will find these now,</i> Thomas thought, <i>I'll just take a look around first, and when I find someone, I can come back and get dressed before talking to them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his cold and clammy clothes concealed, Thomas gave the room another look around, seeing two different tunnels. One tunnel looked like it continued into the cave, small lights running along it's side. The other tunnel, however, changed partway through; the rock walls of the cave gradually blended into the bricks that made up the mansion.

Melissa had also noticed this and glanced downward.<br>\r\n\"Nice underwear.\" She said quietly, smirking.<br>\r\nTom let out a small gasp of laughter, of all the ways to wear his Bart Simpson boxer shorts...<br>\r\n\"Don't tell Jack.\" He said quietly, avoiding Melissa's eyes. \"I'd never hear the end of it.\" Then in his mind he thought <i>At least my erection is gone.</i><br>\r\n\"Not a word.\" Melissa said slyly.<br>\r\nLooking away from each other, the two examined the room they had fallen into. The soft surface they had landed on was the center piece of the room, a large red heart-shaped mattress with two end tables near it. The rooms decor was...not as sophisticated as the rest of the building. Portraits still dominated the room, all with the following eyes but each one depicted something out of an adult magazine, there were naked men and women, all in various states of harassment, some showing sex acts, two others showing rather disturbing BDSM, and the last one which involved four people, a banana, six cans of oil and what looked like a giant mouse trap.<br>\r\n\"Let's get out of here.\" Melissa said quickly, sliding off the heart bed. \"I can't believe this place is in a family amusement park.\"<br>\r\n\"Must be the 18+ room.\" Tom said, also getting off.<br>\r\nThere was only one door, a large double-door that was heart shaped and flanked by two incredibly detailed statues. One man and one women, both naked. The man sporting a disturbingly large erection, and the women designed to look like she was in the middle of an orgasm with her chest thrust out and her marble nipples erect.<br>\r\nMelissa tried opening the door.<br>\r\n\"Locked.\" She grumbled. \"OK underwear man, what should we do?\"<br>\r\n\"Underwear man?\"<br>\r\nMelissa glanced at Tom, her snarky attitude returning. \"Just figure something out.\"<br>\r\n\"There's a sign.\" He said. \"Look.\"<br>\r\nHe pointed at the base of the Male statue. On a gold plaque at the statues feet there was indeed a sign that said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cover is due to unlock the way.<br>\r\nGiven to us by couples say.<br>\r\nTwice to one, satisfied are we.<br>\r\nOne to each accepted by he and she.<br>\r\nOne to one the way stays locked.<br>\r\nChoice must be made, or here you rot.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same thing was written on the female statue.<br>\r\n\"We have to give them clothes.\" Melissa said quickly. \"That's obvious, but what is this twice to one deal?\"<br>\r\nTom thought for a second. \"I think it's saying we can either give two bits of clothes to one statue, or give them one piece each.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds fair.\" Melissa said. Then she blushed. \"So are you giving the statue your shorts then?\"<br>\r\nTom also blushed. \"What? I'm not stripping naked!\"<br>\r\n\"It's all you have!\" Melissa half shouted.<br>\r\nTom paused then realized something. \"Technically that shirt is still mine.\"<br>\r\n\"True.\" Melissa said quietly. \"But what about me?\"<br>\r\n\"You could give the statue your underwear...\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Melissa's face went scarlet as did Toms. Neither could believe this conversation was happening.<br>\r\n\"You'd still be clothed!\"<br>\r\n\"Barely!\" Melissa tugged the shirt down by instinct. \"I'd be a small breeze away from dieing of embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not getting naked while you stay clothed.\" Tom said decisively. \"The way I see it, I just lost my shorts so my boxers are out of the question. So it's either my shirt and your bra, or both your underwear. What do you say? What should we give up?\"</span></div></div>",

After dropping the strapless top to the floor, Tom forced himself to look away again. As much as his male mind wanted to see the contents of those panties, his stupid conscience told him it would ruin their friendship.<br>\r\nA few more seconds passed and Tom heard Melissa's shaky voice. \"You can turn around now.\"<br>\r\nTom did so and his hear did a double beat.On the floor were Melissa's bra and panties and standing there next to him was Melissa herself.

Just put the underwear on the thing before I change my mind.\"<br>\r\nTo, speechless scooped the underwear up.

It wouldn't budge.<br>\r\nHowever on the statues ankle he saw another small engraving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One of each to dress me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we both have to do it.\" Tom gulped, knowing what this meant.<br>\r\nMelissa took a deep breath and stepped to the other side of the statue.<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare peek.\" She said in a low growl. \"Eye level buster.\"<br>\r\nKeeping direct eye contact the two knelt down, Melissa letting go of her shirt, if anything was exposed, Tom didn't see it as he was to afraid of what Melissa would do to him if he did.<br>\r\nThe two grabbed the foot and lifted, it came up easily and Tom put it through the leg hole of the panties. Then lowering the foot down again<br>\r\n\"One down.\"<br>\r\nStill staring directly at Melissa's face, Tom did the same thing on the other side, but this time there was a problem. After Tom lifted the other side of the panties up, his fingers slipped, by instinct he looked down to catch the panties and for a brief second saw it...<br>\r\nA trimmed, neat, well kept yet still obviously full bush of dark hair. Melissa's pussy was on full display, her hand position currently unable to keep it down. at least for that brief second.<br>\r\nOn hand went straight to her groin, the other collided with Toms cheek in a devastating slap.<br>\r\n\"Pervert!\" She shrieked, looking away from him.<br>\r\nTom finished pulling the panties on the statue and they both heard the doors click as they unlocked.<br>\r\n\"Walk ahead!\" Melissa growled. \"Eyes forward, don't you dare look at me!\"<br>\r\nNot one to argue, Tom did as he was told.

Strangely enough for a bathroom, it lacked most of the fixtures of a bathroom, with no toilet or faucet in sight. In fact, the bathroom seemed to be entirely for bathing, as the only fixture was a large tub in the middle of the room. Like the bed, it was shaped like a heart, and as Tom stepped carefully across the tiled floor, Tom saw it was empty, flower petals littered across it's basin. Above the tub was a shower-head, also somewhat impractically shaped like a hear. Tom went to report his findings to Melissa, but as he looked up, he saw her walking towards a door. The first thing to cross his mind was how his shirt was just short enough to let a little bit of her bottom peek out from under it. The second thing to cross his mind was worry, considering their luck with the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Tom said, Melissa having stopped in front of it. \"We probably shouldn't touch anything.\" Melissa turned around, scoffing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the only other option is to sit here ogling each other.

But I go in first, turn around and no peaking!\"<br>\r\nTom walked over to the other side of the tub and did as he was told.

Well, there was Melissa, now without the bubbly bath water to conceal her, but given the circumstances, he had other things on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were plenty of things for his other senses to take in. His ears were full with the sound of rushing air and water, only being overpowered by his and his friend's screaming, which itself was cut every so often when on of them caught a mouthful of the warm water. Also audible in the darkness was the smack of flesh on flesh; the tunnel was big enough that Thomas and Melissa could defy away from one another every few seconds, only for the rushing water to slam them back together again. Again, in a different situation, it might not be such a bad thing, but Thimas was sure he was starting to get bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the tunnel started to narrow; not enough for them to get stuck, but enough for them to be pressed together and slide as one unit.

At first he thought it was just the wind, but that couldn't be right; being completely bare, he'd be intimately familiar with even the slightest breeze. And there was nothing. Glancing around the bushes along the path, he spotted one that seemed to be shaking slightly. Tom slowed as they approached it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Melissa-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh!\" Melissa cut him off nodding her head before tilting it in the direction of the animated plant. Slowly, they approached the quivering shrub. Tom, being the only one able to spare a hand, carefully, slowly reached out, grabbed a branch, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeeeiiiiihhh!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurled up in the bush was... Jill?! She looked mostly unharmed, but as the girl stood up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank God, I've been looking all over for you guy- oh. You too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill had her long, black hair draped down over her chest, just barely concealing her bountiful bust. Tom followed her curves downward, the top of the shrub coming up to just below her stomach. With the leaves in the way, he couldn't say for sure, but Tom took a wild guess and figured that, even if they weren't there, he'd still be able to see a bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cough from Jill woke him from his examination, as he blushed and brought his other hand to meet its partner over his package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I thought I was having an exciting time.\" Jill smiled despite her state of dress. \"Looks like the two of you have been having some fun too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jill...\" Melissa started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tom, see anything... 'interesting' in the mansion? \" Jill winked at her male friend, and as he stayed silent, blushing and readjusting the hold over his groin, she turned to the other girl. \"How about you Melissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you're joking at a time like this!\" Melissa dhouted, tightening the hold she had over her privates. \"How'd you even get naked, anyway?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill recounted her story, and her two companions found it shared more than a few similarities to their own. It had started with a simple scare: a thorn working its way up her legs and into her shorts, which caught on its thorns as it slipped away. Then she ran into a greenhouse, she fell into a secret tunnel (losing her panties in the process) and wound up in a shed. The door to the dead was covered with thick vines; a mysterious plaque above the doorframe told her she'd have to get naked to get out. Sure enough, as soon as she'd tossed her shirt and bra out the window, she'd found a pair if hedge trimmers. Having cut herself free, she was just wandering around looking for a way out when she heard footsteps behind her.

We might be able to put something together to cover us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa, who would be glad to find cover but was hesitant to go poking around the garden, and Jill, who would be happy to leave but was hesitant to do so naked, both looked to Tom for advice. Meanwhile, he had been looking back towards where he thought he saw light in the distance. \"... I think we need to go back,\" he said after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean,\" he explained, \"if me and Melissa ended up like this, and you ended up like this, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls arrived at the same conclusion. \"Jack and Rachel are probably in just as much trouble,\" Jill finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group frowned at one another.

It was a long trip down, but I hope you're ready for a week of fun and relaxation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn had to admit, as tired as the trip had made him, Ms. Thompson - Florence, or Flo, as she always reminded him he could call her- was definitely getting him excited again. It had been a long trip, but John managed to sleep most of the drive down, and Florence's eager voice was waking him back up, just in time to see the cruise ship from the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Mom, not so loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are we here? Finally...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the other passengers were having a little trouble waking up. Lily, Rose, and Magnolia, the Thompson sisters. John had been friends with Magnolia since middle school, and when her mom said she could invite a friend along on her graduation-gift cruise trip, it didn't take much for Maggie to convince John to come with her. Speaking of which, she was just waking up next to him. She was an active girl, with long brown hair and a lean physique, though it was taking her the longest to actually get up after the long drive. Everyone else had their feet on the parking lot asphalt before Magnolia even thought to unbuckle her seatbelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough,\" John said through the open window. She stuck her tongue out at him, wobbling out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was too excited to sleep last night! So sue me if I take a little while getting out of the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't be so bad if you didn't take so long getting into the car too,\" said Lily, leaning against the passenger seat door. She was the oldest of the three sisters, being out of college. She was tall, slender for the most part, but widening out on her lower half with flared hips and a butt that John had gotten caught staring at more than once. He was lucky that the girls were kind enough to laugh it off, but he got teased a lot for it, mostly by Lily herself. Flicking her died-black hair out of her face as she glanced at her phone, she half-helped half-pulled her sister out onto her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking forward to the cruise, Johnny?\" John jumped at the voice behind him, and Rose giggled. She was good at pulling things on him like that, amazingly sneaky for how chubby the bubbly girl was. She was a junior in college, and a full-on party girl from what he'd heard from her sisters. With her cheerful attitude and impressive endowments, John wasn't surprised that she was so popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah,\" John started, still a bit shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Cause we need your help carrying stuff,\" Rose said, and John found his arms full of his own suitcase, plus a few other miscellaneous bags. They all got grouped up behind Florence, each with a number of bags in hand. You could see a little bit of Florence in all of her daughters, and the reverse was true. She was a curvy woman, not fit but not out of shape either. With tickets in hand, she lead the group through the arduous process of getting into the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-------------------------------------------------------------------- -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you kids enjoy yourselves for a while,\" Flo said. It had taken a lot of passport checking, bag handling, and grouchy half-arguing, but the group of Thompsons +1 was finally on the boat. \"I'm going to go ahead and square things away in the room. You kids have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't have to be told twice. John had been in his trunks the whole trip over, and the girls all had swimsuits on underneath their clothes. They passed a few attractions they made sure to remember for later- a ballroom with a number of shows and parties listen on a sign next to it, a big on-board casino, a number of different facilities like an arcade and a spa- but all they were interested in was the pool. Big, clear, and situated perfectly on the sunny open deck, the group was quick to jump in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn considered himself lucky to be around the girl's, and while he did his best not to stare, he couldn't help but admire their appearance. Lily surprised the group with a tattoo running up her left leg, all the way up to her thigh, her tight black bikini doing nothing to hide it against her pale skin. Meanwhile, John found himself wondering at Rose's tanlines, or lack thereof- her string bikini was small, and he couldn't see any part of her that wasn't tanned, meaning she had gone out before either in something really <i>really</i> small, or nothing at all. Magnolia impressed them all with her athleticism, her long toned legs beating the water white. In turn, though he couldn't really be sure if he had caught them staring or not, the girls got a good look at John's toned chest and arms as he splashed around beside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the four got tired. It was getting dark, and the pool was getting crowded, so they were content to call it a day, knowing their week-long cruise hadn't even really started yet! The pool would be there for them tomorrow, along with so much more. So, toweling off and grabbing their discarded non-swimming garments, they headed down into the hull to meet up with Flo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----------------------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so here's the deal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlorence gathered her charges outside the two rooms they had been given. \"We hadn't really decided on room arrangements yet. Between the two rooms we have 5 beds. 3 to the room on the left,\" Flo gestured accordingly, \"and 2 in the right. Now, having John around complicates things- not that I don't trust you,\" she added, seeing John's confused, kind of offended look, \"just... doesn't feel right, leaving you in the room with just another one of the girls there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! It's fine!\" Magnolia was blushing, as was John, while her two older sisters giggled behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it should be simple. Everyone will be comfortable if we arrange things like...\"</span></div></div>",

Still, though he and Maggie were both visibly annoyed at the situation, they both stayed quiet. It wouldn't do to upset the person who brought them all there, and it wasn't like they wouldn't have plenty of time to hang out outside of their rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as he brought his bags into the 3-bed bedroom, John felt kind of intimidated at the prospect of sharing a room with two older women for a week. Lily had already set up on her bed, her relatively little amount of luggage tossed against the wall. Her phone was once again in hand, and she'd only put her tank top back on- her long legs were almost too long for the bed she had, and John had to tear his eyes away before she looked up from her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, Rose lugged her bags in and tossed them onto the bed on the far right; leaving John to sleep in the middle of the two girls. Rose peeked into the bathroom they had; \"Were you going to take a shower, John?\" she asked, already grabbing a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, no, go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" And with that, Rose retreated into the bathroom, the sound of running water starting as the door closed. The last thing John saw before the door shut completely was Rose reaching for her bikini ties behind her back... and giving John a wink as she met his eyes in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, John sat on the edge of his middle bed. He had planned on taking a shower, but he could wait until Rose got out. Or even until tomorrow morning, he thought, suddenly feeling very tired after the long time spent swimming. If he could even get to sleep that is; without the space of the bathroom to change in, he'd be sleeping in just his trunks, and he still wasn't totally comfortable next to these two ladies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn leaned back on his bed, hands behind his head on the pillow, and...</span></div></div>",

They both turned their heads to look at him; Rose with most of her body hidden behind the door was smiling at him, her still slightly wet hair falling in front of her face, while Lily was fixing him with a stern look, her arms folded. John gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, look,\" he said, \"I won't say anything, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. You better not,\" Lily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be so hostile, Lily,\" Rose said, a smirk creeping onto her face, \"In fact, John, do you want to come too?\" She held out an arm to quiet Lily's protest, and looked expectantly at John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn thought it over. \"It seems kind of mean to leave Maggie behind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, it sucks that she's stuck in the room with Mom, but, she's probably beat too,\" Lily explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Rose added, \"you saw how tired she still was when we left, and after all that swimming?

We'll let you decide what we do!\" Rose offered. \"If you choose the bar,\" Rose winked, \"I think the ship has sailed far enough down the coast that we've passed the border.\" When no one reacted, Rose looked to Lily. \"18 is the drinking age in South America right?\" Lily shrugged. Rose rolled her eyes. \"Well, whatever.

Meanwhile, he and Lily were both still partially dressed, John in just his trunks and Lily in her bikini and tank top. They took a single room key- placed in Rose's handbag, and headed up towards the hot tub, chatting pleasantly the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot-tub Lily had seen was on the other side of the pool from the entrance. The deck was decently populated, plenty of people enjoying the pool and bar, though less than there were before. Most people were likely settling into their rooms or exploring the rest of the ship, waiting for the rest of the scheduled festivities to start over the course of the week. All in all, it felt pretty relaxed on the deck, and the trio was looking forward to kicking back in the pleasantly and surprisingly vacant hot tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaah...\" Rose sighed as she slid into the tub, Lily and John following her lead. Lily slipped her phone into Rose's handbag, piling her shirt with it next to the tub, while her sister turned the jets up enough to cover the surface of the water in bubbles. \"You were right, Lily,\" Rose said, \"this was a great idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you're enjoying it,\" Lily replied, \"What about you, John? Glad you came?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's nice. I just kind of wish, y'know...\" John trailed off as Lily shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it would have been cool if Maggie could have come, but you know how our Mom is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She means well,\" Rose continued for her sister, \"but what that ends up meaning is that she doesn't like letting you go anywhere without her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll lighten up over the course of the vacation-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-so we won't have to sneak around like this past today,\" Lily finished. The girls both looked at him, a little concerned, but eased up when John just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it,\" he said, \"sorry for being a downer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop!\" Rose said, \"you're fine! Let's just relax for a while, no more talking about this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they did. John had to say, it was really nice, talking to the two girls and relaxing in the hot tub. John was a little bit worried when Rose decided to pop over to the bar- using some cash she had on her so it wouldn't get charged to the room- and came back with drinks for her and Lily, but he figured that they were both of age, one drink wouldn't completely wreck them. <i>Plus</i>, added the little voice in the back of his head, <i>seeing her half-jog across the deck in the bikini was nice too.</i> The three just relaxed for a while, letting the jets push against their legs, the bubbles foam against their skin, and the just-cool-enough night air play across their top halves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was feeling really comfortable around the two girls when Lily decided she needed to check her phone, and John was treated to a view of her backside. She was leaning over the edge of the tub, arching her back as her chest rested on the rim, digging her phone out of Rose's handbag. This meant that her ass was pointed straight at John, covered only by the tight, black bikini bottoms that had only ridden up to expose more of her pale cheeks as she sat in the hot tub. As she looked at the small screen, her hips swayed back and forth absentmindedly, and John was hypnotized... until Rose's giggling snapped him out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See something you like, John?\" Rose was grinning at the rapidly reddening boy across the tub from her. Lily noticed her sister speaking too, and seemed to piece things together quickly as she looked back over her shoulder. John saw her mouth tighten, but he couldn't quite tell if she was smirking or frowning; either way, she wasn't changing her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was staring at yours too, y'know,\" Lily said. John felt a pit in his stomach as his face grew warmer. \"When you went over to the bar.\" While John was embarrassed to have gotten caught, and further embarrassed to have Lily explain it to Rose, the girl herself just smiled wider, though it certainly had an edge to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry! I just- I didn't mean to-\" John stopped his explaining short as Rose turned, kneeling in the tub as she faced the same way as Lily. Her plus-sized posterior, clad in the pink string bikini, breached the surface of the water and joined Lily's bubble butt in facing John. He once again found himself staring, though when Rose placed her hands on her hips, John followed her arms up to her face, looking her in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Were</i> you staring, John?\" Rose asked, wiggling her ass at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah,\" John said, and even Lily snickered at that, \"I'm really sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't apologize!\" Rose said, her thumbs moving underneath her waistband. \"In fact...\" John's eyes went wide as Rose bent over further, and pushed her bottoms down to just below her cheeks, exposing her massive behind and complete lack of tan lines to John while still covering between her legs. \"How's this for a closer look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose!\" Lily cried, but she was laughing as she barely-admonished her sister. John meanwhile, was speechless; Rose's full moon was a hell of a sight, even as she pulled her suit back into place, and the display had his blood rushing in two opposite directions. His face was beat red, and the uncomfortable tightness in his trunks that had been growing since Lily had turned over was now a full hard-on, pressed firm against the netting of his suit. He heard Lily snickering and, with a start, realized she must have caught him shifting where he sat, trying to readjust himself. As the girls both turned back over John couldn't bring himself to meet their eyes, but he did hear them whispering to each other. When he found the two of them suddenly much closer in the tub, on either side of them, he forced himself to look up even through the embarrassment. Lily had her left hand on his right arm, and Rose had her right on his left. Rose also placed a hand on John's chest and a shiver went up his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, John,\" Rose said, and John could make out the faint smell of her drink from earlier, \"we're sorry for poking fun at you, but that's what this trip is about, right? Having fun?\" John glanced between the two sisters. Their expressions were soft, but they were holding his arms with a strange amount of force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah,\" John said, forcing himself to chuckle, \"right. I mean, I'm having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Rose said, and leaned in close to John, her chest dangling in front of him, not an inch from touching his own. \"In fact, me and Lily had an idea for even more fun,\" she whispered into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? What did you, uh,\" John paused, gulping, his mouth suddenly very dry, \"what did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose smiled. \"Oh, I don't know... Maybe something like... this!\" On the last word, Roses hand slid down his chest to join Lily's suddenly at his waistband. John realized too late what was happening; struggle as he might, both girls had one of his arms pinned each, and there was nothing he could do as they pulled his trunks down. His erection popped out into the bubbling water as his suit was pulled down past his crotch, down past his knees, his feet, and off! As the girls released him and pushed to the other side of the jacuzzi, John started to push after them- but the motion was bringing his crotch closer to the surface of the water, and as he felt the foaming bubbles play across the tip of his penis, he quickly sat back down, arms darting into the water to cover himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Guys!\" John cried, then quickly glanced around. None of the other cruise-goers seemed to be paying them much attention, but if John kept shouting, someone would be bound to catch them. \"What the hell?!\" he hissed, a harsh whisper turning into a scared tremble. Lily and Rose were laughing up a storm, his trunks firmly bundled up in Rose's hands. His question brought their attention back onto him, and much to his dismay, the two sisters...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, Lily's phone was back in her hands, and John saw a light go on as she started recording. He didn't have time to worry about that, though, because as soon as his trunks were stowed away on the opposite side of the tub, Rose went right back to John, pressing herself close against the naked young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, John, lighten up!\" She laughed. She slung her arms around John's shoulders, pulling his head into her chest. He could feel is dick twitching under his hands, but he didn't want to spare either of them to push Rose off. Even with the bubbles covering the surface of the water, he didn't want to expose anything to Lily's camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Rose, stop! What if someone sees me like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sees you like what?\" Lily asked, smirking behind her phone, \"Sees you naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn glared at her, but his expression immediately turned to panic as Rose tried to slip her arms under his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, no ones going to see anything,\" Rose said, and she was kneeling straddling his legs now, trying to wrap her arms around his chest while also moving his arms away from his body. \"I'm right on top of you, and<i> I</i> can't see anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So get off of me!\" John said, and he was forced to move an arm to keep Rose at bay, as she tried to press against him again. He could feel the insides of her legs pressing the outside of his, and he was worried that if she came any closer he'd feel the fabric of her bikini against the hand he was using to cover himself, and the thought was making it a lot harder to cover himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, but that's not fair,\" Lily explained, and there was a playful edge to her voice that John didn't think he'd ever heard before. \"You got to stare at us plenty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", Rose chimed in, \"I showed you plenty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the same!\" John said. He was having a hard time fending off Rose with one hand; the bigger girl had turned around to emphasize the plenty that she had showed him, and was now trying to fall backwards to sit on his lap. John was forced to pull his legs close to his body, using both hands to push Rose away while trying not to actually grab her ass. \"That was just your butt,\" he said, when she finally slid back into the water, just off to his side, \"and you still had your suit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so you only have to show us that,\" Lily said. \"Just a quick peek of your ass, and you get your suit back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound fair, John?\" Rose asked, giggling. She was on her hands and knees now, facing him eagerly. \"Come on! Turn around and stick it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was torn. It wouldn't be as bad as the girls seeing his penis, but it was still humiliating enough to let them get a view from behind. Not only that, but Lily didn't look like she was about to put her camera away either. And, he had no guarantee that he'd actually get his trunks back. He didn't have many options, but the girls didn't seem like they had much patience either. Swallowing hard, John prepared to be embarrassed and bare-assed, as...</span></div></div>",

Instead, here he was, not even through hour one of the six hour car ride, and he was already dying to just <i>get there</i> already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to him was Diana, the friend who had invited him in the first place. She was on the short side,with pale skin and curly brown hair, but was curvy and mature enough that people often mistook we for a college student, instead of the high school student senior she was. Eric and Diana had been friends since freshman year, and the two had been almost inseparable since. When Diana's mom (currently driving the car, and looking much like her daughter, but older and with wider hips) had announced their trip, Diana's immediate reaction was to invite Eric. Eric had always admired her, and he hoped the trip went well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Diana hadn't invited Eric only. Sitting behind the passenger seat was Sam. Sam was short for Samantha, but Sam herself was anything but. She was one of the tallest kids in school, even among the guys, though she hadn't always liked that. She'd moved to their school district during sophomore year, and had been rather awkward at first. But then she joined the volleyball team, and her confidence soared; in part to her incredible aptitude for the sport, and in part due to what the constant exercise had done for her figure. Now, the dark-haired, dark-skinned girl sat nodding off next to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the passenger seat sat Julia. Julia was Diana's older sister, a junior in college. Eric didn't know her too well, but she seemed nice enough... If a little absent-minded sometimes. Embarrassingly enough, the first time they met, Julia had pulled Eric into a great big hug- and pulled his face right into her great big chest, something Diana and Sam still loved to tease him about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with all his stuff packed either into the back of the car or on top of it, pins and needles slowly starting to prick up and down his legs, and his mind starting to ache from sheer boredom, Eric tried to think of something, <i>anything</i> to alleviate the boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

It was then that he became acutely aware of a damp, chilly sensation.

He's only a thin sheet of paper from being discovered naked in a car full of attractive women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana obviously wants to expose him and now Sam has a motive too. She shifts in her seat uncomfortable wearing only white panties on her lower half next to a male she doesn't know well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pokes Diana in the back and as she turns runs his fingers across her stomach, just between her hoodie and pants. Diana starts laughing and wriggling with both of her hands pushing Eric's hand away. With his other hand he unzips her hoodie, getting a glimpse of a white bra against her tanned body. Diana starts to protest and stops herself, realizing they might be caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he grabs one of her hands and with the other tickles her armpit. Diana reflexively pulls her arm towards herself and out of the shirt. He does the same on the other side and find himself holding her hoodie. He quickly throws it to the back of the large trunk along with the girls shorts and skirt and behind a large stack of luggage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo reach back there the passengers in the back would need to bend over the back of the seat, which all of them are now reluctant to do, especially Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Diana was comfortable leaving Eric in a bind, potentially to be caught by her mother and older sister Julie, she recognizes that the three of them need some alibi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, we're going to sunbathe a bit.

Eric is again distracted, this time by bra and large breasts pushing into his chest and arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Sam. If you're not tanning, my mom or sister will catch on. I know you're shy but your hot. Take off your shirt\"<br>\r\n\"But Diana...\"<br>\r\n\"Loosen up. We're all friends here\"<br>\r\n\"You don't know\"<br>\r\n\"I know. I used to be shy\"<br>\r\n\"That's not what I mean\" says Sam, nonetheless she starts lifting her shirt. She takes it off and sets it next to her thigh on Eric's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keeps one arm covering her chest. Eric finds it funny that she's so shy while sitting next to an essentially naked male. He decides to flirt to lighten the mood. He can't think of anything funny to say and decides to swipe her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice bikini\" says Eric, holding the top away from Sam next to his head<br>\r\n\"Hey, give me that\" whispers Sam, blushing deeply<br>\r\nDiana bumps his elbow and throws Sam's top into the back of the car with the rest of their clothes (except for Eric's which are discarded on the road dozens of miles back).<br>\r\n\"Eric, why did you\" she whispers urgently \"I'm not wearing a bra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's Eric's turn to blush.

I mean, look around, my clothes are gone!\" Eric answered desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Sam said, looking down to the floor real quick.  \"That's true, they aren't down there.  Did you really throw them out the window, Diana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No, of course not,\" Diana said, lying through her teeth.  \"Eric probably just threw them in the back, like he did with my shorts after I so graciously gave them to him since it looked like he was having so much trouble getting changed,\" Diana said, laying it on really thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, but why would you do that?\" Sam asked.  \"We're 18, what kinda guy's embarrassed about being seen in his underwear by now?  It's not like he's not wearing any, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was stone silent, eyes held shut.  He could feel sweat trickling on his brow as the silence permeated the car, leaving Sam's question unanswered.  Diana, in turn, looked around at Sam, raising her eyebrows suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  You mean-\" Sam said as she glanced down towards the map held tightly over Eric's crotch.  \"No way, WHAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not clutching that map because of a sudden love for geography, if you know what I mean,\" Diana winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!  Okay, fine!\" Eric said, pinned into a corner surrounded by his half-naked schoolmates.  \"I just was low on underwear this week, so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Sam said, turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha!  Crazy, isn't it?  He's been like that for the past 10 minutes at least!\" Diana laughed.  \"And after we gave him so much time to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to, I just-I couldn't reach my clothes where I was!\" Eric shouted pleadingly as Sam made to climb over the seat.  \"They were off to the side behind you and to get them I would have had to climb all over like this and- everything would have been fine if you didn't throw my wet clothes away, Diana!\" he shifted from shame to anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go again,\" Diana said smarmily.  \"Such wild accusations.  The only one acting like a huge perv here is you, naked guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only me!?\" Eric argued. \"You made Sam take off her skirt for no reason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so I could swap my shorts with her, Eric, don't you remember?  Then you just threw them both in the back.\" Diana continued confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Sam interrupted, now in the back of the car. \"Didn't you just say you tried to give Eric your shorts so that he could cover up?\" she asked, suddenly suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Diana hesitated.  Eric could have cheered.  \"I, well, um, whatever happened, Eric, you then tickled my sweater off of me, making me have to improvise so that Mom wouldn't catch on,\" Diana moved on, avoiding the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then you threw it all in the back,\" Eric stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that Mom wouldn't get suspicious!\" Diana said.  \"Besides, you where the one who took Sam's swimsuit top as she was changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did do that, Eric,\" Sam added, frowning at him and clutching her chest tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah,\" Eric muttered sheepishly.  Why did he do that anyways!?  He ended up doing to her what Diana was doing to him!  Getting Diana more naked to share in his misery was one thing, but Sam was a complete bystander in this, and anyways, he liked Diana more, right?  So why did he think that that would have been a good idea?  Was Diana's sudden strange behavior starting to rub off on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, this was not going as well as he hoped.  \"But, Sam, Diana was the one who had you to take off your clothes in the first place, remember?\" he tried to speak up again.  \"I'm the victim here, not her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did take my top, but, hm...\" Sam said, thinking.  \"You were pretty eager too, Diana.  And wait, don't we wear different clothing sizes?  Your shorts would have been too big on me, and my skirt too small on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what belts are for.  Ah, whatever,\" Diana interrupted, seemingly eager to change the topic.  \"That doesn't really matter.  Eric, you can lie all you want, but you're still naked and Sam's still topless, so I'm gonna go get Sam her top, like a true <i>friend</i> would.  And if you're good, maybe I'll get something for you too, just so that Mom doesn't throw you out of the car or anything, you can't hold onto that map forever, you know,\" she said, unbuckling her seatbelt and shifting to climb to the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" Eric yelled, unbuckling himself, reaching over and wrapping his arms around Diana.  If she made it to his luggage where the rest of his clothes were there was no telling what she would do to them, given what happened earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Diana yelped, struggling to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Hey!\" Sam gasped, running over, arms still crossed, not having found her top yet, evidently. \"Ehhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's face turned bright red, but not because it was buried in the \"Y\" written on Diana's glamorous panties, though that wasn't helping.  No, his shift in position meant that his bare butt was now sticking up in the air, which Sam likely saw given her awkward groan just now.  He winced in shame, hoped she couldn't see his front as well, and wondered would it have stung more if she didn't already know he was naked?  It was hard to say, but it didn't matter now, Diana needed to be stopped.  Feeling her start to slip away, Eric reached to Diana's panties with his left arm and pulled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!  Hey, someone's a little grabby aren't we?\" Diana said a serious edge to her previously playful tone as she resisted, reaching with her own arm to stop Eric.  She succeeded in keeping them up, but they had fell enough to reveal some of her behind.  \"How about some payback?\" she said felt around with her foot toward Eric's erect and vulnerable penis, no longer covered by the map (which was now on the floor,) and kicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\" Eric let out an unearthly wail.  He was completely unprepared for such an attack!  But he stubbornly held on, the desire to give Diana her comeuppance giving him strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!  Knock it off, you two!\" Sam shouted, reaching in with one arm to try and break the pair loose, the other continuing to shield her topless state.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkward struggle continued to grow into some weird display some people might have found artistic: Eric, naked and kneeling on the car seat with his arms wrapped around Diana, one of his arms trying to pull down her panties in a fit of rage.  Diana, trying simultaneously to crawl over to the back seat, all while keeping her panties up with one hand with moderate success and reaching forward with the other towards some luggage as a handhold, using her foot to crush Eric's vulnerables.  And lastly Sam, wearing only her panties, using one arm for modesty and the other to try and break apart her quarrelling companions.  With only half her strength, she wasn't having much luck in doing so; the others were just too stubborn.  Hopefully she could stop them before things got even more out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out...</span></div></div>",

He couldn't see her eyes so it was possible they were still safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, girls, and Eric?\" Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Diana said, somehow fully calm once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda thirsty here, get me a soda, please?\" she asked casually, stretching an arm out towards the middle of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at Julia's extended hand, then back towards each other, the trio shifted glances between each other, Eric's and Diana's focusing on Sam.

Picking up the soda with her free arm, she passed it to Diana, who passed it over to Eric, who reached it out to Julia, just barely making the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Julia said, cracking it open and taking a sip.

This was not how he pictured his spring break with his friends would start out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*wh-whwhew* a little whistle to his right startled Eric, alerting him to Diana, who was dangling the map playfully from her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes bulging, he clamped his hands down in front once more, then reached to take the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and isn't there a map back there?\" Julia's voice asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A map?\" Diana asked, as Sam yelped in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna need it up here to navigate.  Can't use my GPS if we hit a dead zone,\" she said again, stretching her arm out once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric fixed Diana with the most serious glare he had, and she looked back at him.  He slowly shook his head back and forth, she looked towards the front and Julia's hand, then back at Eric, tilting her head towards Julia.  He grimaced, and shook his head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is,\" said Diana, throwing a shrug Eric's way before handing the map up to Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again,\" said Julia, taking the map to the front and out of Eric's reach.  \"Oh, by the way, it looks like Mom's just about done with the gas, so you better finish your business and get seated now, cause we're going as soon as she gets in, you know her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat warning was pretty on-the-nose, Eric noticed.  Was Julia aware, or was this just a warning?  After waiting a few seconds to make sure she wasn't listening, Eric turned toward Diana and opened his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but what can we do?\" Diana preemptively interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's nothing else up here!\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Them's the breaks, freeballer,\" Diana giggled.  \"But maybe Sam is having better luck?  Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't find them!\" Sam said desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your swimsuit?\" Diana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've changed already.  I mean Eric's clothes,\" Sam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Eric gasped, turning around.  Did something happen to his luggage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, no.  Sam was now wearing a matching bikini, and his luggage was right behind her seat where it was before.  \"But my suitcase is right there!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant your wet clothes, you idiot!\" Sam replied.  \"I've found all of mine and Diana's but yours aren't here, and I've searched all over this place.  But that means that Diana really did-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffffff... HAHAHA!\" Diana suddenly laughed uproariously, doubling over in her seat.  \"Yes, it was me!\" she crowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  But why?\" Sam asked, the same question that Eric had wanted to know for quite a while now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ever had wet soda mess up your clothes before?\" Diana asked.  \"It's terrible.  The stains last forever and the smell, whoof, don't get me started.  They were ruined anyways and there was no way were we going to sit in this car for 6 more hours with that stinking up everything.  We would have been miserable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why you just threw them out?\" Eric asked.  They were going to be in there for a while, but this was the first he heard of such a thing.  Maybe Diana was getting confused with leather clothes as opposed to cotton?  Or maybe... he shook his head  \"You could have let me known earlier, or helped afterwards!\" he said indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't want Mom to catch on,\" she replied. \"She's got eyes and ears like a hawk you know.  Didn't think you were naked underneath until after it was done though.  Oh man, seeing your reaction then was priceless.  Sam, you should have seen the look on his face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, what-\" Sam started to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, however, the car door opened, and Linda returned.  \"Sorry that took so long everybody, but now we're gassed up and ready to go,\" she said, entering as Eric covered his privates and Sam climbed back to the seat.  \"How's the 'tanning salon' going?\" she said, glancing back towards her mostly-naked passsengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing well,\" Diana beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Eric said somewhat nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Sam said indifferently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Map's here,\" Julia chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" said Linda as she started the car.  \"We are good to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the car started once more, Eric whispered to Sam, \"Anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Sam said. \"Diana's mom got back before I could get to your suitcase, so...\"</span></div></div>",

She made him jump; in his focus on getting some clothes, he'd almost forgotten she was in the car! \"You've been stalling so long people might start to think you don't <i>want</i> to cover up...\" Eric just glared at her, and she eventually shrugged in response. \"I'm just saying...\" she said turning and looking away as well. \"If you're going to cover up though, do it fast. You took forever the first time, I'm not staying turned around that long again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric scoffed, but couldn't help swallowing nervously in response to her... warning? Threat?

Not that he thought it would be going away anytime soon, surrounded by women as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed heavily as he buckled up.  It wasn't pretty, but at least he was finally dressed again. And with luck, maybe the two up front would just think he was wearing some kind of speedo, and that the worst they would think of him was that he had terrible taste in swimwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully though, both Linda and Julia didn't have much business in the back.  Julia was still on her iPad, only piping up for any navigation questions Linda had, who was focusing on the drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the rest of them, Sam was keeping to herself looking out the side window and Diana seemed to be thinking on something.  It had been 15 minutes since they got on the road again yet it was practically dead back there.  And Eric was starting to get bored again... something needed to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Diana,\" he started.  \"What do you wanna do first when we get to the beach?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beach?\" Diana replied, somewhat startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah?  It is Miami,\" said Eric.  \"And we're already 'tanning,' so I was wondering-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, what kind of question is that?\" Diana asked.  \"You do whatever you want, obviously.  There's swimming, surfing, bound to be parties seeing that it's Spring Break, sunbathing... um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Volleyball,\" Sam added, turning back towards the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!  Volleyball,\" Diana continued.  \"And so much more, if you can only think it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great,\" Eric said.  \"Hope we brought enough sunscreen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, don't just think we're gonna lie around on the beach like a bunch of bums all Spring Break,\" Linda suddenly added from up front.  \"We've got plans as well, kiddos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, there's a bunch of museums and culture places Mom's got planned that we gotta go to,\" said Diana.  \"But on the downtime we can all just go wherever!  Just think of all of those places on the boardwalks: the shops. the clubs, the night life, the day life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana continued to talk about Miami and all the stuff she wanted to do and do with them.  Her excitement started to bring Sam back into the conversation more and more as well, and even Julia had perked up from her device to join in, until all five of them were talking jovially.  Eric smiled to himself.  This was starting to feel more like the vacation he signed on for.  And since he was spending the next two weeks with these girls, he starting to feel very relieved that things were less awkward.  His boner was even starting to relax and shrink down to its normal size, only slightly noticeable in Diana's shorts now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good cheer continued as the drive went on, time passing until they were more than halfway there, only one and a half to two hours left to go when Linda said, \"Lunch time everyone!\" and all of a sudden the car was pulling off the main highway to the next rest stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch time?\" Eric asked, and noticed that he was hungry indeed.  It was now 2:30 and he hadn't eaten since breakfast!  Also, he had to pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, I'm starving!\" Diana said, stretching in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Sam said, leaning over Eric to Diana.  \"Diana, could you, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right! Eric realized.  They could take this time to get changed into real clothes now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure,\" said Diana.  \"Hey, Mom, we've been sitting in our swimsuits like this for a while, do you think we could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can eat like that,\" Julia interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's face stiffened in shock.  He could see Sam's face in front of him mirroring his own expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Linda asked.  \"It could be a little chilly with the air conditioning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll be fine Mom, I mean, it's Spring Break,\" Julia continued.  \"I know you all couldn't wait to start tanning in the car, so why not just keep it going?  Everyone in the vacation spirit is already wearing a swimsuit or less, so you won't stand out at all, trust me.  And if we hurry, we can still make the early reception at the hotel by 5:00.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Linda asked.  \"And that's fine with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Diana hesitated.  \"Yeah.  It's like you said, keep the party going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda and Julia then left the car.  \"Diana!\" Eric and Sam whispered almost in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but after what Julia said I had no reason to have us get dressed, especially after our talk earlier.  I mean, we're gonna be walking around Miami dressed more or less like this for two weeks, so what's wrong with a little meal before like this?\" Diana said, a sheepish smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Sam said seriously, fixing eye contact with Diana.  \"I'm decent, and Eric's... well... Eric's balls are covered, at least-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric flashed a hurt, red-cheeked look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're in your underwear, you know!\" Sam continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'll be fine,\" Diana said reassuringly.  \"Sure, my panties are a bit... yeah, but my top covers a bit more than yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam glanced down reflexively and gaped a bit, seeing that her thin bikini straps did indeed cover less than Diana's bra straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just go eat, before Mom and Julia get suspicious, okay?\" Diana said as she opened the door and hopped out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Sam followed, and the three of them went to catch up to the others.  Diana, in her white, semi-lacey underwear with \"Juicy\" written on her butt, strode fairly confidently, while Sam and Eric followed along, a bit more self-conscious.  Eric especially, as the latest talk had started to arouse him yet again, threatening his small cover.  He could only hope he could keep it down while they had their necessary, hopefully quick meal at-</span></div></div>",

The diner looked like it had been around for a while, in the way that all diners seem to; black and white checkerboard tile floor, white walls with the occasional framed newspaper clipping about some award the place had own years ago, polished countertops with red circle barstools, the works.  There was even a jukebox against the back wall, lifted straight out of the 50's<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sign at the door said to \"seat yourself and a waiter will be with you shortly\", so the group proceeded to do just that. The place wasn't too crowded; aside from the staff, there was a handful of people sat at the counter, a family on the opposite end of the restaurant, and an assorted group of people sat a few booths past where they eventually stopped. Call him paranoid, but Eric swore he could hear whispers and faint giggles as they walked to their seat. It took everything he had not to glance around despite feeling (imagining?) the holes they were burning in his shorts with their eyes. Sam evidently felt the same way; the two of then tried to hide behind each other the whole way to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the table, a nice booth sat alongside a window, Sam and Diana ended up on one side, with Linda and Julia on the other.

It was clear she'd hoped to get the middle or window seat; but Diana, seemingly unbothered by her state of dress, didn't at all hesitate to slide into the booth ahead of her friends. A second later Sam and Eric quickly came to the shared realization that one of them would be on the outside seat. The difference was that Eric realized it a split-second faster, and rushed his pink-shorts-clad behind into the seat just as Sam tried to squeeze in behind him. She turned and glared at the other two. Eric's grin was at least partially apologetic; Diana wasn't even showing she knew something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really have to be... y'know...\" Sam said, gesturing to the side of her completely exposed to the rest if the diner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having second thoughts?\" Linda chuckled, \"You look fine! No one here will goe it more than a second thought!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Sam,\" Eric added, \"It can't be <i>that</i> bad to be seen in a <i>swimsuit</i>.\" Obviously, Eric didn't want to call attention to the way he and Diana were dressed, but he hoped that Sam got the point that if she, in a proper bathing suit, was most visible, then maybe the other two in their less-than-appropriate attire, could go unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....Plus, he just really didn't want to be on the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sulked, and did her absolute best to sink into her seat. \"...Fine,\" she muttered, and relented just in time for the waitress to show up. The waitress was a young woman, tall, with short blond hair. As per the general decor of the place, she was dressed in a soft blue blouse and skirt, with a name tag that read \"Tina\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey folks, welcome to Murphy's Diner. I see we've got a bunch of spring breakers here,\" and she gestured to the less-clothed side of the table. Eric was sat hunched over the table slightly to hide his lower half, and Diana sat with one arm propping up her head, and another on the table in front of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Julia started to explain, and from across the table, Eric was convinced her eyes had dipped to where his bottom half would be under the table. \"They decided to open the sunroof and tan, and we figured it wouldn't be a problem if they came in like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't be,\" Tina said, \"then again, we don't get a lot of people who come in dressed like this.\" She seemed to mull it over for a moment, before getting a sly smile. \"See, final say on that sort of thing is up to the manager, and seein' how they're in the back rom right now, well,\" she winked, \"I won't tell if you won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone chuckled at that, some more nervously than others. \"So, what can I get you all to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all ordered their drinks, Eric getting another soda. Diana giggles to herself next to him, and muttered \"Are you sure you want to try that again?\" He blushed and brushed her off... though he did think to place a couple of napkins over his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation eventually shifted to more general vacation talk; what thy wanted to do when they got down there, past vacations they had been on, though strangely enough any talk of the car ride so far died down on at least one side of the table, who would go quiet and slightly red faced, with a little snickering from Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, despite the awkwardness of some of them, they quickly settled in for a nice lunch.

It was a sports bar, and like Julia had said, everyone seemed to be well in the spirit of Spring Break. The bar was packed, every other TV along the wall displaying a different sports station, the patrons loud and drinking, though none all that more drunk than you might expect someone to be in a 2:30 pm crowd. There were fewer people than Eric hoped in swimsuits, but there were some here and there. None of the guys were in anything smaller than a pair of trunks, sorry to say, though quite a few if the ladies were in bikinis, most of them having a shirt or pair of shorts over at least half of it. Still, it was enough skin showing to keep Eric uncomfortable in Diana's shorts, and he and Sam did their best to hide behind the seemingly unfazed Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too close back there,\" Diana whispered pointedly at Eric, stopping for half a second and causing him to stumble to a stop, lest her backside and his front come into an awkward collision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Eric started, only to be sssssssh'ed by Sam as they caught up to Julie and Linda. A waitress had already brought them over to a circular table. It was nice in that they'd all be able to speak to each other directly, and no one had to shuffle around like in a booth... but the chairs were such that the three younger diners were dreading having their rear ends on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress left them, promising to return with drinks, but as she passed Eric, he saw her expression change. She'd been smiling and looking him in the eye one second, only for her gaze to wander down towards his odd attire. When she looked back up, she was still smiling, but something else was noticeably just under the surface. Eric couldn't tell if she was trying to disguise disgust, or stifle a laugh, or simply not seem surprised. Whatever it was, he blushed all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving lagged behind the ladies in his encounter with the waitress, Eric looked back at the table to find them all sitting down. Linda was about  to look up, in fact, and he'd rather she didn't get a full shot of his package. Moving quickly Eric...</span></div></div>",

Despite having gone through the labors of two childbirths, Erica did not worse for wear at all. She stood at 5'11, had curly brown hair, an amazing set of D-cup breasts that could still hold up their own weight even at her age, and a curvy athletic figure which was to be expected as she was the fitness coach for their local high school. Despite being 38, she easily looked like somebody ten years younger.<br>\r\nHer sister Jess on the other hand, while still beautiful, did not hold up as well. Her C-cup breasts had began a small, but still noticeable sag when not held by a bra. She had a nice hour glass figure on the outside, but under her clothes she was unhappy with how she looked, believing her legs and tummy to be a bit flabby. She was shorter than her big sister at only 5'5, her own hair was straight and black, and despite being the younger sibling she had some noticeable lines on her face, most of this was caused by having two eight year old twin girls: Cindy and Sandy<br>\r\nBy the time the sister got to the group of kids, the little one had began to argue about where to do first.<br>\r\n\"I wanna go on the roller coaster!\" Jake was yelling, being the only boy in the group, he wanted to do as many exciting and scary things possible.<br>\r\n\"No! I wanna play in the water!\" Chloe countered.<br>\r\n\"We want to see the haunted house.\" Cindy said with Sandy nodding in agreement.<br>\r\nAll four kids turned to their parents and if in unison...<br>\r\n\"Mooooooooooooom!\"<br>\r\nErica glanced at Jess who shrugged.<br>\r\n\"You're the one paying sis, your call.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\" Erica said. \"The first thing we'll do is...\"</span></div></div>",

The end result was that she <i>desperately</i> wanted to cool off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we have some fun in the water park?\" she started. Jake groaned, Cindy cheered, and the twins didn't seem to bothered or happy ether way. Jess just shrugged, starting to usher her kids in the proper direction. Of course, this path wasn't without hassles either. Getting the kids into suits was a struggle in and of itself. Especially Jake; bringing a rowdy boy like him into the ladies locker room was going to be bothersome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the whole group was too impressed to be bothered as they neared the water park. A series of water slides, almost a maze of them, with a jungle gym-like structure running through the middle. It was lined with water guns that patrons could use to shoot at the people going down various slides. At the top of it, a bucket slowly filled with water, occassionally sounding an alarm before dumping its contents onto the crowd below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing the kids into the changing room, the two adults decided to change first, one after the other so that the kids could be attended to. Jess went in and came out wearing a blue one-piece swimsuit. Erica went in a second later, undressing in a private stall. She'd chosen a purple bikini; not the most revealing swimsuit in the world, but still enough to make Erica feel a little self-conscious as she stepped back outside to meet the group. They changed the kids easy enough, Jess bringing the girls in one stall while Erica waited outside another for Jake to get into his trunks.

They weren't as comely as the dude on her left, but twins!  They had there phones out recording the beach and presumably some of its goers, which might make the lotion applying a bit too permanent for Claire's taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was a young brunette swimming.  The lotion was water-resistant, so going to ask the young lady wouldn't be a loss, and maybe she could offer to do the same for her.  The brunette had a pleasant face with a petite build.

She stood there for a moment, turning on the spot, eyes darting nervously at all the people staring at her. She couldn't believe this was happening to her. Trying to hold back the tears, she began to run back up the beach, back towards her cabin. Her flip flops caught in the sand, but she was too embarrassed to stop and free them so she merely kicked them off her feet and continued running. The rough sand soon turned into hard wood, and she found herself back on the deck of her beach cabin. She dropped her book to the ground and with her free hand reached out and turned the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, desperate for somewhere to hide. On the decking there was a table and chair set which was bolted down, and there was also a barbeque a foot away from the cabin door. She ducked behind the barbeque, hiding herself from the beach as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, don't panic.\" she muttered to herself. \"The key is in the bag. Just... oh wait. Oh no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly came flooding back to her. The front door was operated by a keypad while the back door was self-locking. She hadn't taken the key for it with her. She'd been planning to take a walk down to the pier, once she was finished sunbathing, and enjoy a nice drink before walking around to the front of her cabin and getting back in that way. There was no way to simply walk between the cabins to the front; they were packed closely together. She wasn't very familiar with the area, but as far as she knew that was the only way to get back into her house. Even worse; the front of the cabin opened up onto a road, and on the opposite side of the road was all sort of touristy-things; ice cream parlours, bars, souvenir shops, arcades... when she'd looked out of the window this morning it had been absolutely smothered in tourists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely naked, she was going to have to walk down the beach, walk down the pier and walk down the busy high street to her front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to steal something.\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peeked over the barbeque. Thankfully nobody was looking her way now. They'd probably assumed that she'd gone back inside her cabin and had lost interest. She looked at the ground near to her cabin, and saw two items that might be of interest:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an abandoned SpongeBob towel lying in the sand, crumpled in a heap. It was hard to tell, but it looked just a little bit smaller than an adult towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also a matching pair of red rubber rings which Claire reckoned would just about fit over her chest and waist. It was slightly risky, however, as two children were sitting not very far away from it building a sandcastle; one boy and one girl. They had their backs to her, however, so they might not see if she was careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do?\" Claire mused.</span></div></div>",

As cumbersome as the rubber rings were, Claire managed to silently, if not gracefully, creep away with her makeshift coverings. She felt a little bad, considering she was, y'know, stealing from a couple of children, but desperate times, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso quelling her conscience somewhat was frustration with the meager cover she'd acquired. Far from a perfect solution, she knew that she'd make quite a sight walking down the pier, especially since it was quite obvious these rings are ALL she's wearing. Not to mention, as well as they fit while she was standing up, the rigid rubber rings did not take kindly to her shifting into other positions. Case in point, the lower of the two rings slid up as Clair crouched down to retrieve her bag, briefly exposing her before she stood up straight and pushed the ring back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with rings around her private areas and her bag in hand, Claire mentally prepared herself for what would hopefully be a quick and relatively painless journey. Of course, she wouldn't be expecting a happy journey if she had known...</span></div></div>",

Claire started walking down the pier, holding her bag with one hand she found herself constantly adjusting bottom ring as she walked. Claire's heart pounded as people passed her, not showing any interest. Maybe they thought I was wearing a very skimpy bikini she wondered. Reaching an intersection along the path, which heads towards the road Claire looks down and gasps! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's noticed the top ring is about half the size as before and is starting to slip down. Oh my god, she thinks as the realisation kicks in there must be a hole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she can't run, leaves her only able to keep walking. Trying to stick to the side of the houses she heads towards the road. Almost there the last bit air deflates and falls down on top of the other ring. Claire quickly puts an arm over her exposed breasts. Meaning she'll need to use her bag in hand to struggle with the lower and only remaining ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to panic she continues to the road, no one had been walking this stretch so her expose was missed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she hits the road the horns start! Unable to run Claire strides down the footpath. She can see people from across the road taking photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo no no! She screams internally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the porch, where she has left the outta door open, her dash for freedom is halted. With the ring she's too big to fit through the entranceway. Determined she pushes through anyway... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP! The ring explodes and both fall off Claire who lets out a scream. To her discomfort people across the road are still taking photos. Clair hurries to the keypad enters the number and a system error appears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my god, she screams as she tries again confronted with the same error. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe runs back to the porch entryway and closes the door, wishing she had done this before. She then closes the outside blinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the keypad she notices it has a service phone number.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She rarely carried anything, but when she did, she made sure it didn't clash with her outfit. Growing up as a rich heiress to one of the most expensive cruise lines on Earth, Jade had been given everything. From the jewel encrusted handbag she was toting, to the designer clothes on her back, as well as in her many suitcases. She was used to being pampered, so it came as no surprise that for her eighteenth birthday, her father arranged a special trip for her around the Mediterranean Sea/ She would see all the picturesque landscapes and ruins, and hopefully learn a thing or two about other cultures. You see, Jade isn't a very bright girl. She barely graduated high school, and her father had to basically pay so Yale would accept her. He hoped she would broaden her horizons, and return with a thirst for knowledge, instead of her usual thirst for new shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was the perfect image of a spoiled heiress. Her figure was many a woman's envy, but they would never try to alienate someone so powerful. As she was escorted to her room, the staff were made to stand at attention either side for \"inspection\". It was Jade's idea, as it gave her another excuse to use her power over them. She wanted them to know she was watching all of them. She was looking to find someone to make an example of. She found her mark with Jessica, the fitness instructor. The woman was nearly ten years her senior, but she was sweating profusely and her lips were quivering in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, who are you?\" Jade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm Jessica. J-Jessica Walker, the f-fitness instructor, m-miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fitness instructor named Walker? Nice try. From now on, you'll be Jess Goode. Much more fun sounding, right? Now, let's talk about that outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess was wearing a tight pink tank top with a white sports bra visible underneath. She wore white spandex shorts to match, and white sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like Tennis Instructor Barbie! Take off your top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take. Off. Your. TOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess fumbled, but managed to remove her top. She stood in just her sports bra and shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, much better. Avoid pink at all costs. Pink makes you look cheap. Now, resume your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess stepped back in line, quivering at being dressed down figuratively and literally. Jade completed her journey to her living quarters for the duration, and the whole ship sighed as her door closed behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a bitch, Jess. You don't need to take it so personal.\" Rebecca, Jess's best friend consoled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but you know how self conscious I am about my chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have nothing to be ashamed of. So what you're showing cleavage? We all do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's not exactly respectable when they're bouncing around during spin class or yoga. Everyone will think I'm such a tease!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I saw what Jade did to you, and wanted to see if I could help.\" The captain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll be fine. I just wish we could do something about HER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd all get fired, Jess. Her father can buy and sell this ship and its crew at least 100 times over.\" Rebecca said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't be too hasty.\" the captain commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jess asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I heard a conversation Jade had with her dad. Apparently this isn't only a vacation for her. He wants her to learn something. Apparently she's no Einstein, so he wants her to explore a bit during the trip, and maybe return not so spoiled.\" The captain explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you have in mind?\" Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can bring that brat down a peg or two. It's not going to be easy, and it's going to really embarrass Jade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can really pull it off, I'm in.\" Jess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I think I can mobilize the entire staff on this, so just wait until the staff meeting tonight. We'll make our plans then.\" the Captain explained before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, the staff were gathered in the ballroom to discuss how best to \"educate\" Jade. There were many who offered to throw her overboard, which got many laughs, but no real plans were being offered. They were either too malicious or not harsh enough. Finally, someone spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we take her stuff away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that?\" the Captain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me. Isaac from the kitchen. Why don't we take all her belongings? Cell phone, credit cards, even her clothes. Once she lives like a normal person, she should appreciate what she has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea, but I think she'll just return to her old ways once she gets home. Plus, if she complains, we're all fired.\" the Captain explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we make sure she doesn't talk?\" Rebecca spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you propose we get leverage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen her in the gym locker room. She's a very modest girl, despite how she dresses. She doesn't want anyone seeing her naked. If we somehow get naked pictures of her, she'll have to keep quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a tall order. Not to mention a high risk if we get caught. I mean, this isn't some noble quest for information here. We're exploiting an eighteen year old girl.\" the Captain argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. But I think I have a plan that will get us what we want, and minimize the blow back on us. With any luck, she'll assume we're just bad at our jobs, but still helpful enough to not fire us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Currently out in the Atlantic, close to South America, the ship was bustling with life. It was the second day out at sea; the crew were all ready for the work day, the passengers were still full of excitement, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. And down in belly of the ship, room 448, Lucy Parr slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been wanting a vacation for some time, but had been busy. Work, mostly. But then she got a lucky break; one of those radio sweepstakes had landed her a week on a major cruise-liner, not too long before her 23rd birthday. And now she was finally waking up to enjoy the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a second at first, to remember where she was. But when she did, she practically flew out of bed. Lucy stood at about 5'6\", her shoulder length black hair still a mess from bed. Her tank-top clung to her C-cup breasts, and her pink boyshorts strained against her flared hips and ample backside. She bounced in more ways that one as she stepped around her cabin; this was the moment she had been waiting for! The whole week was wide open in front of her, and she was going to start it off right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping the sleep out of her eyes, she opened up the drawers on her dresser, smiling wide as she pulled out...</span></div></div>",

The white and pink cotton of her tank top and panties were swiftly shrugged off and replaced, the sleek black fabric of her bikini replacing them. The top hugged her chest, tied once behind her back and again around her neck. The bottoms were Brazilian cut; not as revealing as a thong, but still skimpy enough to show a fair amount of her more-than-fair rear end. After taking a moment to smooth out her hair and give herself a once over in the mirror, Lucy made her way to the pool, towel in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp on the deck, Lucy pushed her way past the throng of people on the around the pool. With a bit of luck and a short amount of time, she found a free lounge chair to lay her towel on. Looking around, Lucy grinned. When she had bought her swimsuit, she had been nervous that it was too revealing, but a quick glance told her she had nothing to worry about: plenty of women were wearing far less than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose worries pushed out of her mind, Lucy decided she'd take some time and enjoy herself...</span></div></div>",

He was about her age, or slightly older. One to two years different at the most. He had short, but untidy black hair and a goatee. He was several inches taller than she was, and buff, with broad shoulders, muscular arms, well-defined pecs, and the sort of stomach you get from hundreds or even thousands of crunches. <i>Wow</i>,  Lucy thought when she saw him. He was dressed in red and white board shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" he said again. He held out his hand. \"I'm Kyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy,\" Lucy said, taking his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think of the ship so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy shrugged, aware of what the movement did to her chest, and aware of how much attention Kyle was paying to the motion. \"I haven't seen much of it, yet. It looks like a nice ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'll like it,\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucy and Kyle talked, neither of them noticed a woman, a blonde of about Lucy's age, but taller and curvier, with a bigger chest, glaring at them. Her name was Casey, she was Kyles' girlfriend, and she didn't take kindly to him talking to other girls when she was with him. She took even less kindly to the girls he talked to leading him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy talked to Kyle for several minutes, but started to lose interest in him when she learned that he had a girlfriend. As soon as she could, she made a polite withdrawal, accompanied by some words that could be a promise to call him, but might not be, and headed to the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to Lucy?</span></div></div>",

A little girl behind her says, \u201c Are you scared?\u201d Lucy just looks at her and doesn\u2019t want to admit it so she said, \u201cNo I\u2019m not, I think you\u2019re just confused.\u201d The girl said, \u201cyeah you are, because other wise you would\u2019ve gone by now.\u201d Lucy was starting to get a little ticked with her. \u201cI\u2019m not scared, what would you know anyway, you\u2019re just a kid!\u201d The girl got frustrated and then said smugly, \u201cIf you\u2019re not scared, then go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy proceeds to go farther out onto the board, the girl waiting. She went out all the way to edge and looked down, she was amazed and scared at the same time. Because she likes how there could be a deep pool on a boat with a diving pool this tall and was scared that they allowed this. She summoned her courage\u2019s and took a leaping dive off the board and into the pool. She land with a huge splash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplause were received from Lucy as she plunged into the pool. The little girl just rolled her eyes and looked at the stupid girl.

That little girl behind her got out of the pool and that\u2019s when Lucy felt, off. The water was much nicer than it should\u2019ve been, getting all her areas, ALL of them. Lucy the saw a black bikini floating on the pools surface, a top and a bottom, it looked really familiar. Too familiar... she felt around her body and then looked underwater confirming her fears. She Was NAKED! The bikini had slipped completely off her from the dive. She looked around hoping no one had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was good on that end and started swimming toward her lost suit. The little girl then scooped both pieces out of the water before Lucy could reach it. The girl grinned at Lucy, \u201cMy how the mighty fall\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was in deep trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

P-p-please I\u2019m really uncomfortable can I have my bikini back please?! This is embarrassing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasey looked at Lucy and then the bikini in her hands.

Casey lowered the bikini to her, but then yanked it away as Lucy\u2019s fingertips touched it. Casey had a \u2018sudden realization\u2019 look on her face. \u201cIf I give you this back, you wouldn\u2019t learn your lesson, and you would try to make another move on him.\u201d Lucy shook her head vigorously and was scared. \u201cNo I won\u2019t, I swear!\u201d \u201cWell I\u2019m sorry I just don\u2019t believe you. And next time you jump off a diving board, here\u2019s a tip, tie your bikini tighter or get a better suit.\u201d \u201cP-please you can\u2019t leave me here like this!\u201d Casey just shook her head and walked away. \u201cNext time bring an extra bathing suit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that Casey walked away, Lucy\u2019s bikini with her. Lucy in shock looked around making sure no one had seen that little confrontation, then looked down at her C-cup breasts, shaved area, and hot ass, before coming to the conclusion that she was screwed. It didn\u2019t help that some kid had chosen this moment to put on some goggles and go underwater. Lucy panicked and swam away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes had passed and Lucy was still naked and terrified. She couldn\u2019t get out naked but she couldn\u2019t stay in the pool forever, so she had to come up with something.

And maybe she would meet a member of the ship's crew on the way, whom she could ask for help. She cringed at how it would look, topless and bound, to have to ask someone for help, but, she didn't have much choice, and plenty of people had already seen her boobs anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator was at the end of the corridor, in a small alcove. Holding her breath, Lucy went down to the alcove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer luck was good. She didn't see anyone in the corridor, and no one was in the alcove. Figuring out how to press the elevator button took a minute or so, but Lucy finally managed it. Holding her breath, Lucy waited while the elevator door opened. She let out the breath when the elevator turned out to be empty. She stepped inside and pressed the button for her floor. Doing so while bound was easier this time, now that she had done so once before and knew how to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Lucy's relief, the elevator went right to her floor with no stops. The door opened and she stepped out, looking around as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch as it had been on the previous deck, the elevator was concealed inside an alcove that blocked the view from the passageway. As Lucy stepped into the alcove, she heard the sounds of voices. Still not certain she wanted to be seen like this, and not sure what to do, Lucy involuntarily backed up against the elevator doors, which were already sliding shut. She didn't realize that, as close as she was standing to the elevator, a string from her bikini bottom had become caught in the closing door. At the same time, one of the numbers above the elevator lit up, indicating that a guest on another deck had called for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy shrieked as the elevator pulled her bikini bottom off. She turned and watched as it disappeared between the closed doors. She had no time to reach for it, and no way to do so in any event; she could only watch helplessly as it vanished from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a voice from out in the passageway called out, \"Is someone there? Are you in trouble? Do you need help?\" The voice was getting closer.</span></div></div>",

She tested her new bonds and her reinforced old ones, and quickly decided that, as futile as struggling had been before, it was even more useless now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe how this day was shaping up. In the course of less than an hour, she had wound up bound with her bikini top, then gagged and hobbled with her bikini bottom and towel.

Not before reaching the lobby.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other thing in the elevator was a poster beside the buttons. It was contained within a plastic case, and featured a picture of a woman crouching over a handbag. A comic assortment of items - lipstick, mirrors, makeup, a hat, sun cream, a kitchen sink - were scattered on the floor as the woman desperately looked for something within her purse. Big, bold letters underneath read \"When disembarking, please keep your sea pass close at hand to reduce waiting times!\" Although the woman was wearing shorts and a tank top, the way she was crouching meant that her knees hid most of her body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of inspiration struck Lucy. She crouched in the corner of the elevator, her knees pressed tightly against her chest and her feet in front of her bare pussy. She rested the bag on top of her knees and opened it, hiding her bare sternum while making it seem like she was looking through her bag for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please make this work...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped in surprise as the elevator 'binged', and the doors slid open smoothly. A middle aged man dressed in a suit entered the elevator. His eyes widened slightly at the sight of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god please make this work.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi there. Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. I just can't find my, um, my sun cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!

It was like something out of a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator stopped at the third floor, and the man made his farewells before stepping out. Lucy breathed a sigh of relief as she was once more alone with her nudity. The elevator reached her floor and, still clutching the bag to her crotch, she stepped out into the hallway.

She took a sharp breath as the doors opened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and revealed two familiar faces.

For one thing, the towel didn't quite make it all the way around her on the first try. So as she went up, the towel went ever so slightly down; it was only Lucy's reflexes that kept anything more than a bit of her breast from being bared. Then, once she had situated herself better, the towel still wasn't very long. She'd gotten it from the cruise liner as a small, complimentary gift; but the complimentary gift wasn't doing her any complements. Evidently her assets were a bit above average compared to the baseline the towels had been measured for, because she was showing a bit more of her chest than she wouldn't have liked, and there was a peek of her cheeks down at the lower hem.

She blushed as her body was completely exposed now.  And while sunbathing topless might be acceptable, doing so completely naked was another story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked towards the boys, and they seemed to be looking away, as if they were innocent.  Of course, Lucy knew there was little truth to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was <i>her</i> vacation, and she was not going to allow them to ruin it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow Lucy had a bit of luck, nobody had noticed she was completely exposed yet.  So, she carefully tried to get up, and pulled the towel free from underneath her.  Then she draped it over her backside, to cover her recently exposed tush.  After which, Lucy laid back down and returned to tanning her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer temper cooled quickly.  All she really needed to get back was her room key and her towel.  Doing so naked would be a bit embarrassing for sure, but resort towels were big and covered a lot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gentle rocking off the ship had nearly lulled her back to sleep, when she heard a little giggle.  With a little growl, Lucy looked behind her, and saw her towel.  The top of her butt was exposed!  And it was slipping! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy grabbed it to pull it back but felt resistance, and something from underneath the chair was pulling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was more giggling, and Lucy looked in front of her.  There was the two boys, one holding both the top and bottoms of her swimsuit.  The other, held some kind of string.  In Lucy's stunned confusion, the second boy pulled with all his might on the string, which pulled the towel completely away from Lucy, under the chair, and into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you boys want?\"  Lucy said, struggling not to furiously shout.  This was dangerous, they had her towel now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now we want what you have, nothing!\"  Said the first boy.  He turned and tossed both pieces of the swimsuit overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy's eyes widened as the second boy followed through, and tossed her towel off the ship too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to slow down for a moment.  Lucy didn't even notice the two giggling boys running off!  She got up and looked over the edge of the ship, to see her things fluttering to the water below, where she couldn't reach them.  Her heart was racing, as she fell to her knees.  There was no way to hide the fact she was naked now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the foot of her chair was her key card, the boys had thankfully forgotten about that.  Getting back to her room wouldn't be easy, but no matter what, she needed that key!  She carefully lifted the chair, grabbed her key and crouched low.  There had to be something she could do to be unseen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked around, trying to spot a towel rack.  At the end of a long line of sun bathers, there was such a rack.  If she was quiet, Lucy could reach it, and at least have the towel she meant to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, there was a couple of large chests by the side of the pool where nobody was looking.  One was labeled life jackets, the other was pool toys.  A jacket to cover her breasts, and an inflatable ring to cover between her legs?  It would be obvious she was naked, but it would be better than just leaving things on display.  Plus, those things would be easier to reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The path to that towel rack was somewhat far away, but all that was there seemed to be sleeping sunbathers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning straight to it was out of the question, she'd be seen for sure.  However, there was a more narrow way to the towel rack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy bit her lip and got on her hands and knees, and began to crawl close to the wall of the ship.  With the sunbathing chairs between her and the pool, she was somewhat concealed.  However, there were people on all of these chairs, and she would be instantly found if one woke up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, carefully and slowly, the naked crawled forward.  The position required both of her hands to crawl, so her breasts freely bounced with each motion.  She was having a bit of an adrenaline rush, but every motion she took felt like it took a long time to complete.  Her heart was pounding, as the world around her was tuned out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost halfway there, Lucy was starting to build confidence.  That is until Lucy heard a yawn.  It came from behind her, which almost made her blood run cold.  Lucy looked, and saw a woman turning to tan her back.  She seem quite relaxed, with her eyes closed, and her hands were idly toying with the back of her bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this woman opened her eyes, she'd see Lucy's uncovered rear end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn impulse, Lucy dropped her key card and moved her hands to protect her pussy.  She gasped from touching her own sensitive spot.  It was quite warm.  Was this risk giving her a thrill?  Lucy let her fingers rub up and down for a moment, a small part of her enjoying this.  Her eyes suddenly widened, as she pulled her hands away.  This was <i>not</i> the time or place for <i>that</i>.  Lucy looked behind her, and the woman that almost saw her was now facing the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sighed with relief, and continued to crawl towards the towel rack.  After several moments of being startled by yawns and snorts from the sleeping sunbathers, Lucy had finally reached the towel rack!  She smiled, and looked around.  Nobody seemed to be looking her way, so she got up, and quickly grabbed a towel.  After her hands fumbled it for a moment, she finally wrapped it around her naked body.  Covered at last!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tightly wrapped the fluffy warm cloth around her body, she looked around for those two boys that left her in this position.  She couldn't spot them, which only made her worry a little more.  It was time to get back to her room.  If she walked around back the way she entered the pool area, those boys were likely to spot that she found a towel and peruse her.  The path near the towel rack, was one she was unfamiliar with, but was sure to shake those boys.  </span></div></div>",

So, she walked through the door by the towel rack and made her way inside the ship.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Lucy had noticed many people walking around.  Being on swimming floor of the ship, most people were dressed to swim.  Almost everyone was in swimsuits of some kind.  However, Lucy lacked her own for the moment, which made her hold her towel a bit tighter.  The fluffy towel brushing against her nipples was a reminder that she was naked right now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy wasn't sure which way to go on this part of the ship, as she walked down the hallway.  Nobody seemed to be as nervous about a towel as she was.  She looked behind her, and sure enough, those boys were not following her.  She moved one of her hands to hold the bottom of the towel and try to hold it in place over the area between her legs.  The towel seemed a little smaller than she liked, and her lips continued to give out a little warmth from her little rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe further she walked, the more nervous she got.  She had no idea if she was actually getting closer to her room or not.  But this towel clearly wasn't going to do it's job.

It seemed a little secluded, so she snuck over and took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what, the towel just did not feel big enough to Lucy.  The one that was tossed overboard offered better coverage.  She needed to find something better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator was ahead.  She could at least get on her floor if she wanted to just press though this.  Though she didn't know where on her floor she was, and that worried her.

Stepping into the room, Lucy noticed the receptionist at the front desk give her a strange look. Not that she could blame her; most people didn't enter the spa wearing towels. Still, it was only a second before the woman's professionalism reclaimed her expression, and she gave Lucy a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome,\" she said, \"what can we offer one of the cruise's fine passengers today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Lucy was unprepared for such a question; but just asking for a robe or a towel probably wasn't going to go over well, and she'd like to at least pretend that she wasn't nearly naked already. Thankfully, the woman behind the desk saw her faltering and decided to help her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a number of services if you don't have anything in particular in mind.\" She smiled and pointed down the hall. \"On the left we have a sauna, right past the changing rooms, and that's available for anyone at any time. We also have a number of skin and nail treatments, as well as massage therapy, but those will take time to schedule. Though, on a day like today with so many people out on the deck, I can't imagine it'd be too long of a wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" Lucy nodded to the woman, and slowly turned to the hallway. Her mind was running through the options she had been given. The sauna was likely to have robes or towels around, considering it was meant for people dressed like she was already. Of course, right next to it was the locker room, which in addition to what she might find in the steam room, she might also find actual clothes. Not her clothes, but if it came down to it, she'd have to feel bad about it later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with everything she's had to deal with for the past hour or so, taking some time to de-stress might not be the worst idea.

A quickly glance around the room, and seeing a \"No Children Beyond this point\" sign, sealed the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly walked back to the desk, and said, \"Um, excuse me, how much longer would the wait for a massage be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist checked the clock, and then checked a clip board.  \"Roughly five to ten more minutes, would you like to be scheduled for the next one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please,\" Lucy blushed and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the receptionist smiled and picked up a pen and held up the clip board.  \"Okay, you'll be next in line.

I feel I should recommend, our massage therapists are among the best in the business!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy bit her lip, she had a little problem she was yet to speak up about, her lack of attire.  But full relaxation was a tempting idea.  Finally, she said, \"That sounds wonderful.

She opened the door and went inside.  It was noticeably warm inside, and the room had a very relaxing atmosphere.  As Lucy looked around, she noticed another full towel rack.  Her face lit up a little.  She could borrow a second towel and cover her body a little better when she made her way back to her room.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, walking around in a bikini somehow felt less naughty than doing her Marilyn Monroe impersonation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the sunbathers, there were slides and a set of fountains, which she saw several children playing in.

Flat, fluffy pancakes just waiting to be drenched in syrup, with crispy bacon and fluffy eggs waiting on a separate tray to the side, with a bowl of fresh fruit just behind. A small pitcher of orange juice completed the breakfast special, along with a single white flower, compliments of the cruise.

It seems that the idea that a young brown-haired woman stripped out of her skirt moments ago just slipped their mind. No laughter or snickers-not even from her brother. In fact, Molly\u2019s father was keeping him occupied with stories from his youth that revolved around some of the buildings they were passing. Relieved that her dilemma had gone unnoticed, Molly smiled and said \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother nodded in response as her smile grew to what Molly was accustomed with and resumed her role as a tour bus passenger, looking out the window and glancing back to the tour guide every once in a while.

The young woman soon learned that this was not an activity advised for a light blue tank top as the fabric stretched, giving anyone who turned her way a good look at her bra. Molly scrambled to wrap the shirt around her chest once again but the damage was already done. Unless she wanted the world to know that she was a snap of a thread away from only being clad in her underwear, the brown-haired girl needed to keep her focus on her shirt yet her panties were already on display for everyone now since her shirt couldn\u2019t reach.

With her new resolve, she took a long, deep breath, and dropped her hands to her side. Her breasts jiggled noticeably with every step, a fact all too obvious to Molly as she started to walk. The already captive audience became even more invested at this sudden change of heart, and eyed Molly as she marched towards the cafe across the street. There was a whole lot of staring, and of course a few lewd remarks from the men, but Molly ignored them and her naked march went largely uninterrupted.

Just as she planned, she acted as if there was nothing unusual at all with this situation on the surface, but deep in her thoughts she was anything but calm. With almost every pair of eyes on her, she reached the table of her mother, whose back was turned to the entrance of the cafe and thus failed to notice the arrival of her very nude daughter. Still keeping up with her plan, Molly gave a typical \"Hey mom!\" and casually sat down at the table, acting like everything in this picture was normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, her mom looked up and... </span></div></div>",

While she did this, Molly looked around, and blushed as she noticed all the eyes on her naked form. Not only men, but women of different ages seemed transfixed on Molly and would not relent. Looking back at her mother, Molly wondered why she didn't say anything, though perhaps of seeing her daughter go naked in public was a bit of a shock to her? She couldn't really tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly's mother was not shocked, in fact, she wondered exactly how long Molly could keep up being bared to everyone. She had planned on embarrassing her daughter to the point that Molly would actually cave and seriously beg for clothing. However it appeared Molly wanted to drag this out, and that's why she had looked disappointed earlier, though now that she thought about it, perhaps her disappointment was taken wrong. Perhaps Molly saw her look at her newspaper covering with that expression, and thought she disliked her daughter covering up. Whatever the case, she would drag this out as long as Molly would, to see who would crack first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the server came over with the drink, a young woman, she bent over between Molly and her mother to set the cup down. She was half distracted though, because her eyes kept wandering to the naked girl. Normally, she would be calling her manager to handle this sort of situation, but she found the nude girl so beautiful, she didn't have the heart to. Standing up again, she smiled at Molly with a wink then made her way back to her duties. Many other customers and employees were smiling at the naked girl, and a few gave her thumbs up in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly blushed at all the attention. As she had been sure her bold tactic would have gotten her thrown out or arrested. Sitting a little straighter, she didn't care how she sat, which caused her legs to part enough to display her soft labia and clit to the cafe.

Any chance you can let her borrow your jacket?\" Kerry asked his friend, who nodded and shrugged off his leather jacket and handed it to Molly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank you, thank you.\" Molly said quietly, grabbing the jacket from the boy and pulling back from the seat, showing both boys her erect nipples and B-sized breasts. She blushed bright red at what she had accidentally done, and the fact that the two blushing boys were staring at her exposed chest, but she slipped on the jacket and zipped it up. Thankfully, it was a bit too large for the boy and just big enough on Molly to where it covered her all the way to her mid-thighs. Molly hugged herself and sighed, leaning back in the bus seat. She was completely covered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You boys are the best.\" Molly said gratefully to the two teens, who both fist-bumped with matching grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We try. Hey guys, she's good now. Come on over.\" Kerry called to his buddies, who joined them. Molly felt a bit nervous being around so many teenage boys while wearing just a borrowed jacket, but Kerry caught her look and said, \"No worries, Molly. We're generally pretty cool.\" Kerry turned his attention to his friends and said, \"Hey, try not to freak her out. She's had a pretty bad day, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerry explained Molly's story to his three buddies, who all were pretty sympathetic to Molly's situation. As the bus came to a stop once again, Kerry offered even offered to let Molly hang out with him and his friends and even help buy Molly some clothes so she wouldn't have to walk around barely dressed. After thinking about it, Molly decided to go with the boys, grateful for their kindness. Besides, her family would likely make things worse and she was sort of done with their crap for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon talking with the boys, she learned a bit about them and before she knew it, realized that they got along well. It turned out that Kerry, a blond and rather short 16 year-old, was sort of their ringleader. Then there was Drew, the large and tall red-headed 17 year-old boy who gave her his jacket. Ren was a rather quiet Asian boy who looked no more than 13. And then there was Johnathan, a pale 14-year old boy with dark hair who had glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hopping off of the bus, Molly pulled down the leather jacket as far down as she could and shuddered. It felt so weird, being nearly nude and surrounded by so many people. She could feel her pointy nipples rubbing against the inside of the jacket, and could feel a warmth beneath her legs that she couldn't make sense of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, the young woman followed the boys down the road while making sure the jacket didn't ride up and expose her naughty bits. Finally they arrived at a small shopping mall in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do the boys go from there?</span></div></div>",

Regardless, she pushed onward and followed the boys to a nearby American Eagle, where they watched as she began to pick out clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any chance we can watch as you put them on?\" Drew joked, with Molly blushing at the remark. Kerry looked at his friend and scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, not cool. I mean, I wouldn't be opposed if she did that, but don't be a perv and ask a lady like that.\" Kerry scolded Drew. This allowed Molly time to grab a few more things, including some extra underwear just in case her stroke of bad luck continued. Kerry and his buddies watched as Molly stepped into a dressing room, and once the door was closed Molly stripped off the jacket and took a moment to examine herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm naked...Completely naked. Thank God for those boys, or who knows what would have happened.\" Molly whispered, running her arms up and down her body.

Regardless she moved on, grabbing her matching bra and slipped it on.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Finally. Underwear again.\"</i> Molly thought to herself, smiling and feeling much better. She put on her black faded ripped jeans and her blue t-shirt and took a moment to examine herself in the mirror again, including her smile. Molly took a moment to fix herself, straightening out her head and checking her clothes over. Satisfied, she pulled on her borrowed jacket, put on her shoes and stepped out to see four boys staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Still just as pretty with clothes on as she is naked.\" Drew joked, with Kerry punching the boy in the stomach. Molly blushed at the comment, but now that she was properly dressed again she couldn't help but feel flattered at the compliment. So, she walked over to the boys and gave them each a hug, which they all enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much. I'll be sure to pay you back for this, Kerry.\" Molly said to the boys, though Drew waved his hand dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm good. Helping pretty naked ladies out is its own reward. Besides, what kind of douche would I be if I took advantage of someone like that?\" Kerry asked as they group walked out of the store and back out onto the streets.

She then slipped on the black lacy bra she had chosen, snapping it on and striking a pose that no one could see. It felt silly, but also a little naughty, which she sort of liked.

A pair of sunglasses covered her piercing green eyes, and a pair of cutoff shorts covered her generous hips and thighs, with a simple tank top covering her chest.

Then, entire lanes full of them, things slowing down, and finally, as she stopped near a town off the highway, bumper to bumper traffic. Annoyed, Nadia switched the radio over to a new station. Turns out, a truck had over turned nearby as it left the town. Nobody was seriously injured, but it was going to take a while to clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia groaned, slumping down in her seat. Her car's AC was busted; she'd been depending on the breeze as she hurtled along the highway to keep her cool. Not to mention she at least had something to keep her mind occupied as long as the car was moving. As if on cue, she felt her phone vibrating in her pocket. Taking a look, Nadia smiled; her friend Vera was texting her at just the right time. They'd been roommates a while ago, and had been friends ever since. Sure, Vera was a little... 'reckless' sometimes, a little hard to live with when it came down to it. But Vera was always there to knock Nadia out of a rut, and get her going again when she was feeling down. If Nadia remembered right, Vera was on her own beach vacation right about now. She quickly went to text her friend back, realizing that her car was going to be moving very slowly for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">hey girl! how are u doing?</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Was doing fine until a little while ago. traffic just got bad.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">aw sucks D:<br>\r\nyou should check me out down here!</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera sent over with a picture of herself in front of the beach. Vera had pale skin, at least over most of her body. She clearly hand't been down at the beach long, what with the t-shirt-and-shorts tanlines. Still, with her short black hair, her curves, and the revealing bikini she was wearing, Vera made quite a sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Looking good!<br>\r\nWish I could cool off like that. acs been busted for foreveeer</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">more than one way to cool off...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was followed by another photo; this time, Vera was lying on her side on a towel. She was sticking her tongue out, and her top had been pulled to the side. One hand was holding the camera, and the other was covering up her exposed chest. All while a man in the background stood completely unaware. Nadia felt her face flush, and she almost fumbled her phone as she texted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Vera!

She could already feel beads of sweat on her. She wasn't sweating a lot, but if she stayed in the heat not moving like this then she would be coated with sweat in no time. She looked back at Vera's text and back at her shorts. She would like to cool down some.<br>\r\nShe unbuttoned the button on her shorts and double checked that no one was watching her. <i>\"Am I really going to do this? \"</i> she internally asked herself as she pulled the zipper down on her shorts. <br>\r\n<i>\"it's not like anyone can see what I'm wearing below the waist,  anyways\"</i> she rationalized to herself before she slid her shorts all the way off and put them on the seat next to her.

She sighed in relief, talking off her shorts had actually given her some nice relief from the hotbed of heat that was her shorts. <br>\r\nHer panty clad butt was now sitting directly on her driver's seat and she had to admit she liked the feeling of it. She wiggled her butt into the seat a little to feel more of it and blushed about what she was doing. She had never been in her seat without shorts and she noted how different it felt. It didn't feel the same at all, you felt the seat much more without shorts and it felt unusual but in a nice and welcomed way. <br>\r\nShe saw traffic had moved a few inches and switched the car back to drive and moved it forward a bit, before putting it back in parked.

The woman behind the wheel kept looking over her shoulder and talking, but the windows behind her were too dark to see through. At least her passenger was distracted enough to be looking at their driver, and not in Nadia's direction. To her right, a man on his phone. It didn't<i> look </i>like any of them were paying attention to her, but what she had in mind was a little more noticeable than taking off her shorts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing completely bottomless would be a little too much for Nadia to be comfortable with, and taking off her tank top would leave her in just her underwear. She didn't have a problem with her shorts off, because her lower half was hidden inside the car. Taking her tank top off meant she'd be totally visible driving around half-naked. So, that left Nadia with the option to take off her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she snaked an arm up her back, reaching for the clasp. The second it was undone, Nadia let out a sigh, the garment going slack. Looking around again, she pulled the straps down her arms under the tank top, before pulling the bra itself off and tossing it onto the seat with her shorts. Nadia had to admit; in the growing heat, it felt good to let her chest breathe, even through the material of her tank top. It looked... well, the lack of straps beneath her tank top was a little conspicuous, and there was definitely a lack of support, but... Nadia figured that if no one thought to check if she was wearing a bra, then no one would notice, that it wasn't immediately obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia sat there for a moment, adjusting to the feeling of the tank top against her otherwise bare breasts. She giggled softly to herself, taking a snapshot of her bra, lying there with her shorts, and another photo of herself, making sure to get her chest in frame. She sent them both off them off to Vera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Alright, this does feel better<br>\r\nMaybe I should stop now though...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia's eyes darted back and forth between her phone and the cars next to her.

She was glancing around to see if there was anyone watching her or looking in her direction, she was more nervous about doing this than she had been about removing either of the other two articles of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard her heart pumping a mile a minute. Unlike the other two times, this time she would actually be leaving an intimate part of her body bare. Before it wasn't as big of a deal as it was now, because everything important was covered. Now, no matter what she took off, she would be leaving something bared to the world. At least, with removing her panties it was something that people wouldn't be able to see from just looking in her car, unless they were in a vehicle taller than hers and were looking down at her. That had been her reasoning for choosing her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had chosen her to take her tank top off, then it would be extremely noticeable, anyone looking at her or in her direction would be able to see her bared breasts! Sure, it didn't help her case against Vera that she could be wild and crazy if she chose the more tame route because it was less risky. Taking off her panties was still risky, it was just the lesser of two risks. She would prove that she could, too, \"play with the big girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found her fingers trembling on her waistband, this was a big thing to do. She raised her butt off of her seat slightly and pushed her panties down her legs to her knees, where she pushed them and let them drop to the floor of her car. To anyone else, the sound of such a light piece of clothing would be inaudible, but to her it sounded like a meteor hitting the ground. She could hear her heart throbbing so loudly that it felt like it was between her ears. She slowly pulled her feet out of the leg holes on her panties and allowed her butt to touch her driver's seat. The experience was breathe-taking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, when she removed her shorts, she experienced the feeling of her seat more than she ever had before, until now. She now could truly take in the feeling of her driver's seat. Earlier, her panties were acting as a buffer for her personal parts and the seat, now that they weren't there, she had to admit she liked the feeling ever more. She rubbed her butt around her seat and pushed it as far back as she could, thoroughly enjoying the experience. It was nothing like she had experienced before. She blushed at her own antics, but she was enjoying the feeling enough that she didn't let it end, yet. It was a sensory experience that was unique for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer intimate areas had only ever touched a diaper, when she was a baby, and the various pairs of panties that she has worn since she had gotten out of those diapers. They had never experienced anything else before, and this was a welcomed experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spread open her thighs some, letting the bottoms of her thighs enjoy the feeling of her seats. Then, she pulled her thighs back together, giving some of the delightful feeling to her inner thighs. She repeated the process a few times: moving her butt around and letting the seat envelop her butt, then opening and closing her thighs. She looked down at herself doing this, seeing her two thighs leave each other and meet back up. She blushed hard, thinking that she was getting more pleasure out of this than she probably should be, but she ignored herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened, when her thighs departed again, she unintentionally leaned her body a little farther forward and felt her woman's cleft come into contact with her seat, and it felt electrifying. She considered going further, but she shook the thought out of her head. Instead, her face shot crimson red just thinking about whether or not someone saw what she had been doing. The thought mortified her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What was I thinking!?</i> She thought to herself. <i>That was crazy and reckless and what if someone saw that!?</i> She quickly pulled her tank top's hem down to cover her lower regions and looked around at all the other cars, it didn't seem like anyone was looking at her or saw her little intimate moment with the seat of her car. Surely, if someone had seen, then they would be staring at her with that look on their face that all but said \"I know what you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieving herself to be in the clear, she put her panties on her stack of clothes, grabbed her phone and took two pictures: the first was of her stack of clothes in the passenger seat that now had her panties stacked on the top of it and the second one was a picture of herself and her lower regions, covered only by the part of her tank top that her hand held down in front of them. She sent them along with the text \"Who's tame? I'm a total risk taker ;P\"</span></div></div>",

It didn't scare the pants off of her, not that it could at this point, but she did drop her phone, which dropped between her legs. Her hands followed after, not to retrieve it, but to cover up what she hoped no one could see anyway. A few frantic minutes of looking back and forth, and Nadia realized what the problem was- the car behind her hand't see what she was doing, but it had seen that the car ahead of her had started to move, and Nadia could see that traffic was clearing up. She'd been willing to go along with it while the car was crawling ahead slowly, but driving in just the tank top was something else entirely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother honk told Nadia she didn't have the time to redress, or wait any longer for Vera to text her back. In a flash, she had the car moving again. It wasn't a bad experience, all things considered.

It had felt good before she'd started stripping; now it felt electrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got back into the swing of things, Nadia felt like she could easily get through the rest of the drive with no pants and no problems.

She also knew that the longer she took to do this, the more likely it was that she would get caught.

She felt them glide over her cleft, navel and stomach. She hesitated before having them rise over her breasts. Slowly, her hands crept on to the bottom of her breasts. A second later, her finger circled around her nipples, careful not to touch them. She knew she was wasting her time, that she desperately needed to finish this, but she drew the moment out for a few seconds. She teased her nipples, careful not to touch them, and, then, after circling them each a dozen or so times, she allowed her fingers to touch her buds. She let herself take in the feeling for a few moments, before she.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then she pulled her phone in front of her, covered her solid buds with her left hand (<i>I can't let Vera see this</i>), closed her legs tight, and took a picture that included everything from her shoulders down.

To her horror, she sees the car in front of her pulling away- and the cars ahead of it spreading out as traffic ahead seems to have cleared up. Nadia would have been happy to see her trip getting quicker, if it hadn't happened at the exact moment that she'd just pushed the last bit of her clothing up to where it didn't cover anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia quickly (shakily) let her tank top out from under her chin, but in the midst of her scramble to get at least her tank top back in order, a car horn sounded a few cars behind her. Then, another one, closer, and another. Nadia panicked; rather than take the time to push her arms back under the straps, (time in which people behind her could come up into the other lane and see her), Nadia shoved her arms back up through and over the band, wearing it like a tube top like she'd almost done. Not wanting to delay longer, she jammed her foot on the gas and started forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the car was moving at a decent speed, the wind playing over her body suddenly felt very different. Through the window, over bare shoulders, down her stomach, around her thighs... It didn't help that the tube top was hardly secure- it was still bunched up enough to leave her stomach bare, but without the straps on, it wasn't very secure, and she didn't feel like she could adjust herself enough moving as fast as she was. Not to mention that without a bra, there were now two distinct bumps showing against the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vibration of the car was also something different, now that the upholstery and her bare backside were in direct contact. It wasn't a huge change, but enough to keep her distracted. Her eyes kept racing back and forth; to the road ahead of her, to the cars in her mirror, her own almost- totally naked body, the clothes in her passenger seat and back. It was terrifying, the idea that someone might look over and see her as she was, but for some reason she couldn't think of anything else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until...</span></div></div>",
