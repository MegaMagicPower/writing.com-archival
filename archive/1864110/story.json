Nothing difficult, nothing you haven't seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow wrong could you have been?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your shipmates, beaten by a small group. Your leader dead, a majority of your friends, too. You surrendered the moment you saw the man you called 'captain' fall, and let yourself be captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were laid down, bound, gagged and alone in a dark room under the decks. You were terrified for your life but... you were also quite aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls who managed to beat you were rather beautiful, particularly the mature redhead, who, by hearing the others speak, you knew was named Celica. You hadn't fathomed seeing such a beauty on a ship like the one you stormed... so why? why was she on that ship? and why did she spare you? was she some kind of saint?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted by the same Red-Haired beauty entering the dimly lit room, a flame in her hand, her other hand on the hilt of her sword. She was still rather cautious of you, despite your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the only soldier who surrenderred without so much as a struggle. Why?\" She asked curiously. Seeing her, high above you, looking down at you with both disdain and gentle kindness in her eyes, you began to feel something within you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason\" you tried to say, the cloth around your motuh stopping you. it was here, she ungagged you, letting you speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies. I should have asked after that\" She bowed her head in forgiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright\" You said, stretching your body a small bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Celica, a Priestess of Novis\" She smiled gently. \"What might your name be?\" She questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not important. What I wanna know is, why're you here?\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is... I wanted to know, why did you become pirates? and... do you know your way around these waters?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to explain what you knew, You didn't know much, but you explained your situation, your life as a pirate, how you were driven to it by starvation and desperation. Celica could only look on in pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible...\" She sighed. She lit up the small torch scones in the room, and took her hand off of her blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not much, but it was something\" You said back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat herself down on a rickety chair in the corner of the room, bringing it closer to you. It was here you began to look more at her attire. Her beatiful clothes, all light and graceful. She was almost akin to a Goddess, like the one she likely was a Priestess of. Your eyes eventually looked down to her boots, Beautifully fashioned, right in front of your face, and seemingly having been worn for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then... what might it be that I have to do? that is, to have you help us?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help you...? I mean... regular stuff and... well, a guy's got his other needs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Right\" She bites her lip. \"And how exactly would you satiate those 'other needs', if I accepted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was the moment. You knew you could say almost anything in your perverted fantasies, as long as it didn't do anything bad to her group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it'll only affect you positively, I'm sure\" In that moment, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

This beautiful priestess was really letting you are her feet! but you knew you had to be careful... she held all the power in this arrangement. You delicately wriggle closer, taking more of the boot into your mouth, its pristine texture filling it, overpowering your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend almost 10 minutes just kissing, licking and engulfing the front of her boot, the incredible flavour only making you more and more excited and lustful. You began to lick and kiss faster and faster, hungrily lapping at it like a wild beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see Celica's shocked face. She seemed concerned and confused at the sight of you going at her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... enjoying yourself, I see\" She finally speaks up. You stop for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course!\" you look back at the boot, and remember how rabid you had become. \"I'm sorry!\" You exclaimed, slamming your head into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's alright!\" She tries to calm you, kneeling down and patting you on the back. \"It was... just confusing, is all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Suppose so. It's something you don't expect someone to like\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Priestess or whatever... how 'bout I show you a bit more reason why it can be beneficial\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica goes back into her seat, putting one leg over the other. \"How so? I'm afraid I... can't quite understand yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off your boots and I'll show 'ya\" You goad. You manage to make her curious enough to entertain your request. Her black stockings slowly emerge from the white boots, soft, medium sized and quite damp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies... but my feet are quite wet. I haven't been able to change out of these\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine... just makes it better\" You grin as you hop your bound body as her stocking clad feet, sucking the sweat from it, and licking at it with your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica looked down, the trace of a blush on her face. You got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to do as you did with the boot, letting the wonderful aroma engulf your nostrils and the intoxicating taste at your lips. Celica's face at this point was deep red and a small smile spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Celica pulls her feet away, putting them back into her boots. \"Thank you... I think you've made your point\" You were slightly disappointed you couldn't continue, but she was adamant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then... since you're into this... humiliating... thing. Perhaps you would prefer staying down here like this when we don't need you? we'll come down every once and a while, to fulfill our end of the bargain\"</span></div></div>",

Well, I'll stick with Priestess. has a better ring to it, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica nods. \"I thank you for your co-operation\" before she leaves the room, she takes off her boots one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I... get a final kiss?\" She asked sweetly and innocently. She seemed rather sheltered, to your point of view. You oblige, giving her foot a large kiss in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you... here, enjoy these, for now\" She responds, taking her stockings off, and shoving them in your mouth, using one to hold the other in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan happily, turning upright, revealing a tent inside your trousers. Celica's eyebrows raise, but she ignores it, putting her boots back on and leaving the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left to yourself for a while, all left for you to fester on that taste. That sheer flavour contained in those stockings. the sublime scent and taste teased you for hours, and you were left constantly frustrated from your inability for relieve yourself of your overwhelming euphoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you began to feel tired, but your aroused state didn't seem to let you sleep.

Mae simply say beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soo... let's get started huh, Mr Pevypants?\" Mae teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Mae and Celica took their feet out of their boots. Celica had replaced her stockings and Mae had only some short socks to contribute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ooo, Celica... this is gonna be a nice learning experience, yeah?\" Mae said as she unitied you. You take the moment to move a bit, the ropes were starting to chafe, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, buddy, put your clothes all over there!\" She commanded. You did as instructed, Celica witnessing every part of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou eventually were down to just your underwear, to which Mae and Celica pulled them down themselves with their feet.

Get ready, boy, cuz we're going aaaaaaall in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMae and Celica tied you up all over again, however, Mae seemed to be more... instructive, like a teacher. She tied intricate knots of rope all  over your body, keeping you in an almost immovable bind. It didn't help that the crotchrop around your groin would irritate you when you tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were helpless as Mae sat behind your head, playing with your face with her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Celica, start using your feet to rub his dick, will 'ya?\" She asked. Celica, still seemingly surprised at her friend's more sadistic and kinky side, could do nothing but obey, taking her stokcing clad feet, and rubbing them all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotal euphoria filled your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pumped up and down, the pleasure became more and more intense, you moaned and groaned into your gag in pleasure and satisfaction but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbefore you could ejaculate, she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on! perfect Edge!\" Mae clapped. She struggled around the frustration intense. Your denial only made you more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Uhh... how did you like that?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grd! grrrd!\" you tried to say through your gag 'good, good!' but the thickness of the stockings and the packing stopped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... well! let's see if you like THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMae rose up and planted her soft, large, cozy arse on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were enveloped by soft, supple, bare skin, you could see nothing, you couldn't speak, you could feel nothing but this weight od her arse on you. You loved it. You were enamoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica and Mae began to pump at your dick again, using both of their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nup and down<br>\r\n<br>\r\nup and down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so close, but were denied again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo, mr Pervypants...! wanna cum?\" Mae asked to you still underneath her arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! yes!\" you tried to say, but you were almost inaudible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... seems he doesn't want to!\" She chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor almost 30 minutes, the two of them just kneaded your cock, jerking it up and down, but gave no release. Your frustration adn arousal was rising to heights you thought almost unreachable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mae and Celica got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh... sir. Thank you\" Celica bowed .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah! this was fun! shame about not cumming, huuh?\" She teased, flicking your cock with her finger, causing you to writhe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... really alright with this?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, Celicaaa, he's a pervert, and he loves humiliating stuff like this, right? not being able to cum is probably like a field day for him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now left alone in that room, with as raging as a hard on as before.</span></div></div>",

You made it to the Zofia coast just before the setting of the sun, due in part to your skills. The whole group left the ship and on to dry land quickly. Celica decided that you all should rest at the Inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica had her own room, which she invited you to.

Since then, the two of you have been through a lot, hoping to help her Grandfather and defeat Lord Lundgren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout your travels, you've stopped at many Inns, and made camp in many places, alongside your ever growing army. Yet there was something about Lyn that you couldn't help but love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer large, long, shapely legs, combined with her perfectly sized feet, were perfect. A true joy to behold in the moments you had to see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough now... you thought perhaps you may have been looking too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn called you into her tent for a private meeting. To talk about the next plan of action, you had thought, but instead, you were welcomed by Lyn sitting on a chair in front of you, her bare feet resting on top of a desk, something you couldn't help but look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem?\" She asked. You shake your head, taking the chair from the side. You waited for a moment for her to put her feet down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking you so long? Come on, sit down\" She gestured to the other side. Your mind began to race. 'Did she know?' you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you sit down, right in front of Lyn's feet, the beautiful soles barely a few centimetres from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? enjoying the view?\" She smirked knowingly. \"I've noticed you've been looking at my feet quite a bit, so this shouldn't bother you much, right?\" She asked, feigning a stretch, pushing her feet into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! my bad\" She said, moving her feet back. You face seemed to follow them for a moment before you moved it back, not out of anythign stuck to it, but rather your fixation on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you enjoy that?\" She asked knowingly. You gave a small, curt nod. \"Seems I was right, you like feet, hm? well, I can't say I expected this from you\" she sighed, looking away for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked about what it was she wanted to talk about. She then replied \"Not a lot to discuss now, really. I know almost all I want to know. All I want to know now is... want to experience that again?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, wide-eyed. Lyn pressed her feet back onto your face, smothering yout lips, nose and eyes. She shuffled them around, massagin your face with the perfect soles. You penis began to perk up from under your trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a small lick at Lyn's sole, to which she jammed that sole straight into your mouth, using the other to slowly reveal your now erect penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like someone likes this even more than I thought\" She smirked. She began to rub the tip of your penis almost professionally with her toes and demanded you suck on her other ones. You oblige, getting between the toes with your tongue and slathering them in saliva. You began to suck harder and lick faster the harder she stroked your penis, feeling almost ready to cum when she kicked it, and slid her foot out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other one?\" She asked sweetly. She swapped the feet's roles and you could feel the saliva-covered feet jerk your penis whilst your mouth licked at a fresh dry sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, both feet were clean, and you were highyl on edge, having been edged for the past 10 minutes. \"I'm sorry but... people like you don't get the right for something like that\" She smiled innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lyn took out a long length of rope from her chest in the corner of the room, and began undressing the rest of you. your cloak, your shirt, all of it. Eventually, you were naked, your penis still erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn tied you tightly, keepig you on your knees. She tied your hands behind your back. Your legs were tied spread out, showing your erect penis to the world like some kind of great treasure. Finally, she looped some around the robe harness she made around your body and secured you to a pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't be moving out for a while, due to some of the wounded, so we'll have plenty of time for you to get to know my feet a little better\" She came in close, using one of her bare feet to give you a final stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... what to do with you tied down like this?\"</span></div></div>",

It was then that Lyn asked Florina to come live with her on the plains... and she accepted. The two were happily married a few weeks after the war's conclusion, and it was now a month since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliwood and Ninian had just announced their engagement, and Hector had formally stated that he would be marrying Serra immediately after. For all intents and purposes, the land of Elibe was finally, truly at peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Florina had recently begun to... feel strange things, attractions, to a very peculiar body part of her wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecifically, her feet and toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she first realized this, Florina's immediate reaction was to hide it from Lyn and find out what it meant on her own. Following some extensive research, she came to the embarressing conclusion that she had what was known as a 'foot fetish'; in other words, a sexual attraction to a person's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started off innocent at first; she would capture glances of her wife's bare feet, her soft soles, her lovely toes, and imagine what it would be like to sniff them, to taste them. She kept said thoughts to herself, however, and never acted on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a week later, while her wife was out training some new recruits, Florina boldly snuck into her beloved's closet, and stole a pair of socks. She then proceeded to rub herself sore while sniffing the sock for a good two hours... completely unaware that Lyn had returned home early and stood outside the door, peeking in with a massive blush on her face. From there, it became a sort of mutual activity, albeit with Florina blissfully unaware that Lyn knew of her fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Lyn would take to deliberately sleeping barefoot, or gently rubbing Florina's shin with her ankle to tease her. She would always giggle upon seeing Florina's reaction, but never told her that she knew of the knight's fixation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, a month came and went. Lyn decided to take action, and called Florina to their shared quarters. The knight smiled and tilted her head. \"Is something wrong?\" Lyn smirked and spun around as she raised a socked foot and began to remove it; slowly, while wiggling her toes. The action, in turn, caused the knight to tigthen up and sweat. Lyn waved her finger, smiling mischeviously, as she said...</span></div></div>",

You began to search through her drawers for her stockings, finally finding multiple sets of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your time to indulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniffed, licked and sucked on these stockings, your penis slowly growing beneath your trousers. Eventually you could take it no longer, and tore off your trousers, wrapping one around your penis. The feel of the silky smooth stockings was euphoric, to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese stockings engulfed you in lust, You lost track of time, and jolted back to reality when you saw Edelgard staring down at you, trousers off, a throbbing member covered with her stockings, with more around your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the- you pervert!\" She accused slamming the door shut, piling on top of you.

One month later, when the Imperial Army attacked Garreg Mach Monastery, the green-haired mercenary single-handedly defeated all forces in the battle... only to vanish from sight after. All forces beaten and bewildered by the woman's brazen stance in the conflict, the war seemed to end as quickly as it had begun. But upon her return, the new 'Liberation Queen' desired a new future for Fodlan; one that would only come to pass with the destruction of the West Church and Those Who Slither In the Dark. Traveling the massive continent, she rallied people to her cause, and even brought an end to the darkness that tormented the hearts of the former House leaders; Claude, Dimitri and Edelgard herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnited under a single cause, the Army of Flames struck against the Agarthans and their sinister leaders, followed immediately with a culling of the madness-stricken Children of the Goddess, who had been long corrupted by the activities of the Western Church. Archbishop Rhea unfortunately died as a result, mercifully killed by the vessel of her mother; Byleth. With the war over and peace truly established, only one thing remained; who would Byleth choose as a partner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chose Edelgard; the girl she had risked everything to save five years prior. One year has passed since then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Byleth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women were lying in their private chambers at the newly rebuilt Officer's Academy of the United Nation of Fodlan... of which Byleth Eisner was the ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green-haired savior turned to her wife, chuckling. \"What's this about?\" Edelgard sat up and pulled her knees close, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just had to say thank-you. For everything. You refused to surrender to the vices and sins of war, even as everything crumbled around us. You saw there was another way; a way to unite Fodlan and prevent needless death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe retired mercenary shook her head. \"I was naive, but it paid off. I just... couldn't bear the idea of you and our friends killing each other. We all wanted the same thing; just in different ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Do those things you wanted include me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughed and playfully shoved the white-haired empress. Her condition, through the efforts of countless researchers from across Fodlan, had been countered. Her hair would never return to its natural color, but at least she would live a proper life; the life that had been stolen from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do now, my love. They do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently cupped Edelgard's face and kissed her upon the lips before parting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Byleth, a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have an answer, Miss Hresvelgr.\" The empress rolled her eyes and got off the bed, walked over to a chair, and sat upon it. She scooted closer to the edge of and raised her legs. Byleth instantly turned red, her face illuminating the moonlit room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you... have a 'foot fetish', as it's called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell shit, Byleth thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... yes, I do. I happen to like girls' feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard smirked and raised one of her legs, wiggling her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dearest Professor... I would like to study the effects and... other attributes of this fixation. Would you please give me a lesson, using my feet and toes to demonstrate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth felt her throat turn dry as she slowly nodded. \"I-I... I can?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor, please. Do take this seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth chuckled and crawled over, crossing her arms. \"In that case, Miss Hresvelgr... I do believe I can demonstrate the effects of a foot fetish to you. After all... such lovely toes and soles like yours deserve only the most reverent of worship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard's face turned bright red and she held back a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-then... please begin the lesson, Professor.\" She wiggled her toes and Byleth licked her lips. This was going to be fun...</span></div></div>",

She was seen as a Bewitching Beauty by the other students, and now, you got to hang out with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, right on time. I shouldn't have expected less, now, should I?\" Dorothea greeted as you walked up to her. You took a moment to glance over her apparel. She was dressed in the Officer's Academy Uniform, but she had a black hat over her head, on top of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing that stuck out to you, however, was her boots. They were black, heeled boots with golden lining, almost like that of the Officer's Academy Uniform. They emphasised her feet, making them all the more attractive to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then... shall we be off?\" She smiled warmly, gesturing for you to follow her. you obeyed, striking up a conversation with her along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Dorothea spent your time walking around the monastery, making idle chitchat. She seemed to take a teasing side with you, almost stringing you along with compliments and quips. Something you noticed was how direct and to the point, she could be. If you told her how all the men at the academy thought of her to be incredibly beautiful, Dorothea would respond with 'do you think that?' with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as you walked, you spent a lot of time ogling her feet, rather than her face. You had a lot you wanted to do to them... though you wondered if you would ever have the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if right on cue to your obvious visible disappointment to your own remark, Dorothea said \"Ahh... I am tired. Would you lead a girl back to her room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. A plan starting forming in your head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou lead Dorothea back to her room, to which her first impulse was to take off her boots and neatly place them at the side of her bed. \"That is much better!\" She remarked with a sigh. You couldn't help but stare at the feet before you. Whilst they were still covered in socks, you could tell underneath that cloth cocoon was a sole like that of a Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately averted your gaze. Did she notice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so tired... my feet are so worn out... hey, do me a favour, will you?\" Dorothea asked, bringing a foot up towards you. \"Give me a massage, It's what a gentleman noble would do for a lady after a long walk, right?\" She asked, a sadistic undertone present.</span></div></div>",

As soon as the piece of clothing left her foot, a sweet, almost intoxicating smell came from her now bare foot. It was like a mix between flowers and fruit. You moved her bare foot closer to your face, and inhaled the smell of it. She giggled as she saw you do so, and leaned forward while resting her head in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very particular about my hygiene,\u201d Dorothea said. \u201cI make sire to wash down every part of me with scented lotion before I leave my room. I can tell you like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed your lips against her warm, smooth sole, and kissed it. Dorothea\u2019s feet were simply perfect. They were arched, smooth, soft, and her toes looked absolutely succulent. You just wanted to plop those in your mouth and suckle on them like a calf suckles on an utter. You wanted to lick the sole of her divine foot and show it the respect and worship Dorothea\u2019s feet deserve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently rubbed her feet, making her moan a little due to the release of pressure. Your hands massaged all over her divine soles and toes, applying pressure when needed. The occasional crack of her bones and the feeling of it made Dorothea writhe slightly in her bed. Her breathing was labored, and she looked to be in deep pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like that...\u201d Dorothea moaned. You kissed her foot as you massaged it, and felt something come over you. You stopped rubbing her foot, and instead began to kiss it like one would a lover. Your lips trailed from the heel of her foot to the soles and eventually her toes. You kissed and kissed and kissed, showing your passion and love for the Songstress\u2019 feet.

Your family was never especially important in the grand politics however, so your nobility was pretty much limited just to having a fancy title. Nonetheless, wanting best possible education for you, and perhaps hoping you would elevate the family status even despite you not even having a crest, you have been sent to attend education at Officer's Academy in Garreg Mach monastery. Due to your Adrestian nationality, you obviously joined the Black Eagles house, and studied as well as trained as much as possible hoping not to disappoint your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your time, you got to know many of your classmates, among them even Edelgard von Hresvelg, the future empress. More importantly however you regularly spent time with Petra, a princess from Brigid, who was a political hostage of the Empire due to failed invasion of her country on Adrestia. Despite that seemingly tense sounding political situation however, you two actually got along quite well, with you helping her get a better grasp on the language, while she helped you get better at combat training. Your life at the academy seemed quite ordinary, until one day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes, and suddenly realized you were on the floor in someone's room!

I was worried I put too many of the special herbs in your tea.\" A familiar voice you quickly recognized as Petra's said, as she walked in front of you<br>\r\n\"P-Petra?! What is this about? Why am I tied up?!\" You asked, panicking slightly as you struggled against the bindings on your wrists and legs to no avail<br>\r\n\"It's an old Brigid tradition. When a huntress is looking for spouse, she has to hunt and capture the spouse. In past it was a way to prove that they are skilled to provide food.\" Petra explained calmly as if it was the most normal thing ever<br>\r\n\"Hunt and capture the spo... SPOUSE?! W-wait... d-does that mean y-you want to...\" You said, but interrupted yourself after realizing... was it Petra's way of proposing?!<br>\r\n\"Yes, I tried doing it in more Fodlan-like way first to make you notice... but didn't seem to work, so I decided Brigid way might work.\" The huntress explained, blushing a little but remaining rather calm and serious<br>\r\nYou recalled Petra asking you a few times if you would like to come to Brigid with her once your education was over... but you didn't quite get the clue of it being a romantic kind of proposition, so you only gave vague non-committal answers, knowing your family was counting on you to help their status once you graduated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm flattered... b-but can we talk about it more after you untie me?\" You asked, feeling rather uncomfortable to be talking to Petra from the floor like that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First I must do a special ritual... to prove my hunting success to the spirits. Then we can discuss.\" Petra explained with a slight blush, as you saw her suddenly removing her boots right next to you... unlike most students, Petra didn't wear any socks, and wearing those leather boots was undoubtedly making her feet sweat quite a bit. A fact that was pretty obvious the second the first of her boots dropped to the floor, revealing her beautiful slender foot, and sexy nimble toes that flexed once they made contact with fresh air, it also glistened with sweat from wearing her boots all day. Her other equally beautiful foot soon followed as the other boot dropped to the floor, and Petra started walking closer towards you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit that you took a peek at her feet a few times after she removed her boots once the two of you were done training... but could it be she noticed you looking?! Or was it all part of the mysterious ritual? And also what was she about to do to you while being barefoot like that...</span></div></div>",

You went to Garreg Mach in order to learn more about combat so that you could prevent bandits from raiding your parents\u2019 business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came to the academy, you were slated into the Blue Lions House, and almost immediately adopted by your classmate, Mercedes von Martriz. She was originally from the Empire, but moved to the Kingdom. She was like an older sister of sorts, or at least that was what she treated you like. She always doted on you: giving you her food from her own utensils, allowing you to rest your head in her lap, and she even asked you to rub her shoulders(which you readily agreed to).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday however, was entirely different, as you were currently in her room. Mercedes had asked you to help her test some new recipes she had been thinking of. Normally, she\u2019d ask Annette, but the girl had been busy training recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of the baked goods she had prepared were absolutely amazing. The cookies, pies, cakes, they all looked and smelled divine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what are you waiting for,\u201d she asked. \u201cDig in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the fork and knife in front of you, and began to dig in. First, the slice of chocolate cake. It tasted amazing, like silk in your mouth as it dissolved. The pie was spectacular as well, with the crust being a perfect gold, and the blueberries were sweet and delectable. The cookie was soft, and had a gooey center that  you weren\u2019t expecting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes was watching you eat with a smile. Her head was resting in her hands, and a slight chuckle escaped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next though, almost made you choke. You felt something covered in a thin cloth glide up your leg, and rest on your crotch. You looked down, and saw Mercedes\u2019s sticking clad foot there. She rubbed her foot around, slowly making you erect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter,\u201d she asked, completely acting oblivious. She continued rubbing her foot on your constrained erection, watching you squirm in discomfort. A single gasp left your mouth. Mercedes placed her other foot on your crotch now. The feeling of her small soles all around your strained erection was euphoric. All the stimulation was you about to make you burst, but then she stopped. Mercedes removed her feet from your crotch, and began to take off her stockings. She placed them aside on the table, and then placed her feet on it. One foot entered the remnants of the pie, while the other entered the remains of the cake. You swallowed the saliva in your throat as you watched her scrunch her toes. Her feet were small, soft, pale, and most definitely a gift from Sothis herself. Her high arched made you want to fell them all over you, and her toes lucked more appetizing than her sweets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want a taste,\u201d Mercedes asked. You slowly nodded, and went for </span></div></div>",

Out of habit, you turn to face the door, partially scared shitless that someone might walk on by and see what is happening. Odds are if you were spotted, the least of your worries would be getting ousted from the academy. You'd likely be disowned by your parents, branded a deviant and hunted by who knows how many of this beautiful girl's relatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a slender finger touch your lips and when you turn to face Mercedes, she gently cups your face in her hands and kisses you deeply. Her tongue penetrates your lips and she parts after a few seconds, giggling mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had my eye on you for quite some time,\" she admits with a grin. \"Annette and I... we're more than just friends, you see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf your erection could grow any larger upon hearing this, it'd have made a hole in your trousers. Taking a cloth and wiping the foot covered in pie, she places it on the tent between your legs and gently rubs it while her cake-coated toes gently sway in front of your face. Without any hesitation, you lean forward and extend your tongue, lapping up the icing and other remnants on her tiny, heavenly sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remind me of someone I loved very much. A brother of mine, we... parted ways many years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was news to you, but it only went halfway through your ears as most of your mind was focused on the beautiful feet you were currently lavishing affection towards. Mercedes covers her mouth and giggles some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... Annette likes to focus especially on my toes, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh gods. Oh GODS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette had a foot fetish too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cock was straining, pressing so hard against your pants that it caused physical pain, and you strained your back in order to fight it. Swiftly, Mercedes used her now pristine feet (thanks to your loving affection and worship) to undo your belt and lower your pants, immediately followed by your undergarments. Before you could say anything, she quickly chanted a short spell and a small ball of light hit your penis, causing relief to envelop your body... along with near limitless stamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your expression, Mercedes licked her lips and snapped her fingers. Your body began to float in the air and was swiftly moved to the bed, upon which you were gently placed. The lustful girl who was in no short way your self-designated adoptive sister climbed atop the mattress and sensually crawled to your throbbing erection. Her mouth was watering, and she looked at you with a smile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agree to become me and Annie's adorable little pet. We'll love you oh-so dearly... even after she and I are wed. You'll be our sweet, precious pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans in close and whispers into your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't you be our foot-pet?\"</span></div></div>",

Her arms were wrapped around your shoulders, and you felt her breasts against your chest. Your hands moved down to her soft, large behind, and the kiss continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Mercedes separated from the kiss, smiling as she did. She scooted back, and rested right in front of your cock. She took it in hand, and slowly began to stroke it. You bit your lip in an effort not to moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my...you\u2019re so big,\u201d she said, giggling. \u201cJust another reason as to why I love you so.

She then removed her shirt, and you realized she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra. She tossed it aside, and slowly began to move her small, smooth feet up and down your cock. You gripped the bedsheets as you remained still, and on your back. Your hips thrusted on their own with each stroke Mercedes made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look so adorable like this,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are so beautiful on your back, moaning and squirming. I want to eat you up...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned as her feet milked the cum from your balls, and you felt eager to blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, do you want to cum? Unfortunately I can\u2019t allow that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes took her feet off of your cock, and scooted up to your chest. She placed her feet on your face, while she leaned back and stroke your cock slowly. Her single hand barely was able to cover your cock, which pleased her greatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou licked her soles, and kissed them eagerly as Mercedes stroke you. You grabbed her ankles and lavished her feet with your tongue, licking between her toes and sucking them individually, before taking them all in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt her lick the tip of your cock, and then spit on it. She slowly suckled on the tip, before taking more in. She gagged on your cock as she went deeper and deeper, until her nose reached your pelvis. She then began to bob her head up and down, starting by rising all the way to your tip and going all the way back down. Her saliva dripped down your shaft as she continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm...you taste so good,\u201d she said, separating from your cock with a pop. She removed her feet from your face, and the sat up on your lap. She grabbed your hands, and placed them her breasts. You instinctively squeezed them, and then sat up to take her nipple in your mouth. The sight made Mercedes giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like a baby,\u201d she said. She held the back of your head and smiled down at you. She stroke your hair, and kissed your forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking at you like this...makes me want to spoil you even more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes got off of you, and got off of the bed to kneel on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here,\u201d she said. You did as she said, and scooted to the edge. She looked up at you from on her knees, and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, my love, do you want me to-</span></div></div>",

You felt your heart shatter into a trillion pieces, and you very well felt that your life was over. It was, until, a loud and familiar voice spoke that your heart reconstituted itself. It was Annette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMercie, I\u2019m here to play!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head snapped to the voice, and your eyes widened. Annette\u2019s eyes wandered to the two of you, and a pout appeared on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, no far! You got all started without me, Mercie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Annie...I just couldn\u2019t help myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mercedes finished saying this, she turned back to you, and grabbed your erection. She slowly moved her hand up and down, forcing you to hold back your moans. Annette hurried up to you, and placed your head on top of her thighs. She held your head in her sift hands, and looked down to you with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, will you be our pet,\u201d Annette asked. Her head came closer and closer to yours, and you began to pant as Mercedes jerked you off. The next thing you felt was Annette\u2019s lips against yours. Her eyes were closed, and her tongue somehow entered your mouth. After a little while, she lifted her head. Your panting had increased now, as your arousal grew even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. You didn\u2019t care about the consequences might be, you wanted nothing more than to be around these two beauties, to feel their naked bodies against yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe said yes, Mercie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes smiled, before grabbing your cock and slowly licked the tip. The sensation of her tongue against your flesh was too much, and your concealed moans were finally released. Mercedes then placed the tip in her mouth, and then went a little deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette briefly removed your head from her thighs, and removed her boots and stockings. She laid your head down on a pillow, and sat on a chair close to the bed. She placed her small, soft feet on the side of your face. The smell reminded you of peaches, and as Annette rubbed her delicate, smooth soled all over your face, Mercedes took more and more of your cock in, until she eventually reached the base. Her nose nestled against your pelvis, and she stayed there. Your moans were muffled as Annette placed a few of her plump toes in your mouth. You began to suck on them slowly, savoring the fruit like taste to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes began to move again, slowly bobbing her head up and down your cock. Saliva began to drip from her lips down your length, and you began to subconsciously jerk your hips. Your cock went deeper in her throat, to which she quickly adjusted to. You felt her grab your balls, and slowly rub them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette took her toes out of your mouth, and you immediately lapped at her soles. You kissed them eagerly, making Annette chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a really good pet,\u201d she said, messing your hair as she rubbed her feet all over you. \u201cI bet you wanna have a taste of Mercie\u2019s too, right? Maybe, the both of us can someday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes eventually stopped sucking you off. She lifted her head, and your cock slowly exited her throat. She held it in her hand, slowly jerking it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you? For you and Annie to be at my feet.

Not you, that much was certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave your answer, and out of the corner of your eye, you saw Annette begin to drool and her eyes fog over, as her tongue hanged out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get to taste Mercie's feet already? You really are the best pet ever.

Not that you'd ever want to, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't wrong. These two could order you to crawl over hot coals naked and you'd do it with a smile if it meant getting more of this heavenly treatment and affection. Mercedes giggled and positioned herself on the edge of the mattress, her legs crossed and feet completely bare. Annette was physically restraining herself from lunging at the tiny digits of her girlfriend, while you were trying to calm the raging beast between your legs, albeit to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing at her partner, Mercedes extended her right foot and smiled, waving it from side to side in front of the younger Blue Lion. Her eyes were fixated on the foot, and her mouth was watering at the sight. You caught a glimpse of her panties, and turned crimson; they were absolutely drenched with fluids. If Annette got any more turned on, she'd probably start flooding the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie... my sweet, darling Annie. Tell me how you love my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love your feet, Mercie! I love them, I love you, and I love our wonderful new pet!\" Her friend covered her mouth and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How precious. What would you like to do, my sweet? Kiss them? Lick them? Smell them, perhaps? For you and our beloved pet, my feet and body exist to give the two of you immense pleasure unlike no other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette's forehead glistened with sweat and she nervously swallowed the reservations building up in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I... I want to do so much with your feet, Mercie. I love you so much that I want to... to...\" She began to shudder and her breathing turned erratic, while your cock was twitching with anticipation. Mercedes leaned forward and brushed her toes along Annette's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lavish your affection onto my toes, Annie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last straw for her small girlfriend. Annette lunged at the bare foot she was presented with and began running her tongue along the sole in every direction, leaving no inch of it unworshipped. She shoved her nose between the second and big toe, taking in the lovely scent of flowers that were present on her beloved. She earnestly wrapped her lips around the pinky toe, sucking it relentlessly while her other hand dove into her crotch area and began pumping wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sat there, completely bewildered. You feel something prod your cheek and when you turn, there is the other foot; awaiting your attention.</span></div></div>",

You watched as she slammed her lips against Mercedes\u2019, and she gripped her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMercie...\u201d Annette murmured between kissed. You watched as the orange girl\u2019s hands roamed down to Mercedes\u2019 breasts, and Annette grabbed them. Her small hands were barely able to cover even a fraction of her chest. Your cock was aching the longer you watched. Their tongues clashing against each other, their lips smacking into each other, and their moans filling the air made you grab your hard on. You slowly jerked yourself off at the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette removed Mercedes\u2019 shirt, tossing it aside to briefly separate from the kiss and submerge her face in the older girl\u2019s breasts. Mercedes seemed to have not worn a bra today, making you feel like she knew what was going to happen. As Annette sucked on Mercedes\u2019 nipples, Mercedes rubbed her hand through Annette\u2019s hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re always so needy, Annie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes moved her hand, and slowly ran it down Annette\u2019s back, ultimately stopping at the small rump of her rear. She gently gave Annette a little smack, making her squeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really need to learn to calm yourself,\u201d Mercedes said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry...\u201d Annette answered, briefly removing her mouth from Mercedes\u2019 nipple before going back in. Mercedes simply sighed. Annette finally stopped, and rose up to her knees. Mercedes placed her hand between Annette\u2019s skirt, and a sly grin came across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnie, you aren\u2019t wearing any panties. You were so prepared weren\u2019t you, like a good little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes began to finger Annette, making her moan as she did so. Her slim fingers entered Annette\u2019s wet pussy, and she began to stimulate her. Annette bucked her hips, moaning loudly as Mercedes fucked her with her fingers. She scrambled to take off her shirt, and began groping herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMercie...I love you! I love youI love youI love youI love youI love you! Please don\u2019t stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes smiled, and kept up the pace. Annette squirmed as she was being pleasured even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMercie...I...I can\u2019t take it anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes abruptly stopped, causing Annette to pout. She removed her fingers from her pussy, and slowly licked the juices from it. After that, she lifted her legs, showing that she had no panties either. She spread her pussy, and you saw Annette\u2019s mouth open and saliva pour out of it. The next thing the smaller girl did shocked you. She pointed her finger at her own crotch, and murmured something. Then, a light shone, and a large, penis shaped ray of light appeared on her pelvis. It was around your own length and girth. Annette waisted no time, plunging it inside of Mercedes. You watched as she bucked her hips in and out rapidly, making Mercedes moan and squeal in pure pleasure. She kept her massive thighs up with her hands, and pounded her. The sound of moans and skin slapping against skin was evident throughout the entire room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnie...It feels so good! Don\u2019t stop, whatever you do don\u2019t stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette lowered her back to suck on Mercedes\u2019 nipples again, kissing them, nibbling them, and massaging her massive breast. Mercedes ran her hand through Annette\u2019s hair, looking down at her as her insides were ravaged. Annette\u2019s thrusts were primal in a way, and to you it seemed that she was like a wild animal fucking its mate. Annette gave Mercedes\u2019 large ass a nice slap, making her moan even louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarder Annie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette slapped Mercedes\u2019 ass again and again, with the same gentle sternness each time. Sweat rolled down Annette\u2019s back as she fucked Mercedes in front of you, and the smell of sex filled the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the sight before you, your cock never being as hard as it was before now. As Annette\u2019s soft, round ass bounced with each thrust, and Mercedes\u2019 thighs jiggled in response, you bit your lips in order to keep yourself from joining in, although you assumed it wouldn\u2019t be unwelcome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes\u2019 hands moved to Annette\u2019s cute bubble butt, and she smacked both of her soft cheeks, leaving behind faint palm shaped prints. Annette moved from sucking Mercedes\u2019 nipples to slamming her lips against hers yet again. The sounds of fucking and kissing riled you up even more, and Annette saw you jerking yourself off when she separated from the kiss to get air. With a lewd smile and lust filled eyes, she-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being a second son of simple bakers, it made you wonder whether there was a point for you in attending such a place... nonetheless, your family funded you education there, and it would be rather disrespectful to refuse.<br>\r\nNonetheless you tried to make the best of the occasion given. With time you even managed to befriend Lysithea von Ordelia, a noble from your house, considered a magic prodigy. She wasn't the easiest person to get along with at first... until one day you caught her eating various baked sweets by herself. She had a certain complex about being considered a child, due to her short stature and being a little younger than most students, so she tended to hide whenever she did things she perceived as childish like that. Nonetheless, after initially being angry at you and demanding you \"not tell anyone or else\",she actually warmed up noticeably after you offered to bring her sweets she wanted, so that she didn't have to get them herself, and risk being caught by others. On top of that she seemed quite interested in your knowledge of baking that you learned from your family...<br>\r\nIn return for your help, Lysithea offered to help you with your studies, and while a bit of a bossy tutor, she certainly helped you make your grades go up quite a bit thanks to regular studying with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Lysithea were sitting in your room, studying while enjoying the batch of sweets you bought earlier today.<br>\r\n\"... and this is how you use Dark Spikes to effectively annihilate enemy cavalry.\" Lysithea ended her little lecture before taking a bite of a cake you bought<br>\r\n\"Hmm~ This one is new, I don't think you bought it before.\" The girl said after taking a bite while you were taking notes<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that merchant lady, Anna had that one on sale, it looked pretty good for my eye... so I figured I might take it for a try.\" You explained, deciding to also take a bite of it, it really was tasty, and sweet, though not in a way you ever tasted before...<br>\r\n\"Huh? She always seemed a bit shady to me... but the cake is good I suppose.\" Lysithea said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you kept taking notes while Lysithea read and explained things... you suddenly noticed Lysithea taking her boots and stockings off!<br>\r\n\"Ugh... is it just me or it's strangely hot in here? Hope you don't mind if I take those off? I had to walk around the library, and then take those books here, so maybe I just got a bit tired...\" She said leaning under the table for a moment<br>\r\nYou had to admit she had a point though... it certainly seemed like the temperature in the room rose a bit since few minutes ago, furthermore... you suddenly felt yourself getting aroused by the mere thought of Lysithea removing her footwear right next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a foot rub few times in the past, as she often complained about her feet hurting, and certainly couldn't deny that Lysithea had really pretty looking dainty feet... but you never felt like this just from thinking about her removing her footwear in your room! Could it be... the cake from Anna actually had some aphrodisiac ingredients in it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts however are quickly interrupted by the dainty pair of cute feet you were just thinking about suddenly plopping into your lap!<br>\r\n\"Could you rub them again? It felt great last time... don't worry, we will do more material today, but... I can't focus at the moment for some reason.\" Lysithea said, seemingly calm, but her face seemed flushed as if she had a fever... she was presumably also feeling aroused just like you were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her cute feet in your lap, having them in front of you made your pants feel a lot tighter in an instant, you didn't want to seem like a perv to Lysithea... but her adorable toes flexed a bit awaiting the massage looking so inviting, and filling your head with lewd thoughts... this girl worked so hard every day, perhaps she would enjoy something a bit more than just simple rubbing? Especially since she was probably aroused now too because of that weird cake...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You weren't exactly the most notable or important of people within the Leicester Alliance. In fact, you were about as common as commoners were. An ordinary girl from a small, quiet hamlet in the middle of Alliance territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe ordinary wasn't the right word to describe you, however, given your... sexual fantasies. Ever since you were young, you had known two things; one, you were very much attracted to the fairer sex. Sure, men were okay and all... but you couldn't see yourself settling down and marrying a guy unless they were your best friend or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing you knew was that your fetishes and fantasies were very much not normal. Whereas most people wanted normal sex things with normal people, you were more of a deviant, so to speak. Instead of tits, you preferred women's feet. And instead of same-size or smaller girls, you preferred women who were taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, way taller. As in, you are the size of a bug in comparison to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a size fetish, and it manifested itself in the strangest of ways. Ways that you had, for the past fifteen years, kept under the rug from your family. You were somewhat gifted in magic, and once it became apparent that you were only going to get better, your tiny village somehow paid for you to enroll in Garreg Mach Officer's Academy. A gift you were eternally thankful for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing of Leicester origin, you were admitted into the Golden Deer House, and almost immediately fell in love with the group's resident shy girl; Marianne von Edmund.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer love of horses and aptitude for magic quickly captivated you, but her self-esteem and confidence were already rather fragile. So you took the relationship slowly, getting to know her over sessions of tea, studying, and training activities with one of the academy's professors; an independent foreigner named Byleth. Strangely, she did not lead any of the Houses, but instead acted as a neutral party to the academy, teaching and giving lessons to all who passed her doors. From time to time, you swore that she had an ability to predict the future with perfect accuracy... but you just passed it off as a coincidence. She was beautiful in an otherworldly sense, and yet you couldn't help but feel there was much weighing on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, right. Marianne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two of you became close enough to hang out on a regular basis, and it was during one of your trips into town where you gathered up the courage to ask her on a date. She didn't reply, instead, she slowly turned and walked back to her room. You were heartbroken, and wandered the streets on your own until night fell. Exhausted, you returned to your dorm... only to find a cup of tea and a note next to it upon your desk. You opened it, and read the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Lisa,</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm sorry for leaving you without saying anything earlier today. Your... question simply caught me off guard, and I needed time to process it. As an apology, I made some tea that should heighten your magical abilities for a few days, and make it easier to learn new skills in our classes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And... please call me Marie from now on.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>From, Marie</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face turned crimson and you let out a childlike squeal; did she accept? Hopefully. Almost forgetting the tea, you quickly took the cup and drank the whole contents in a single gulp. It was delicious, and like the note said, you felt as though you could cast the most destructive of spells with ease. At the same time, though... you also felt oddly tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off your clothes (you always did prefer to sleep nude), you crawled beneath the covers of your bed and quickly drifted off to slumber. You did not even hear the sound of your door opening, Marie's shadowy form approaching yours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lisa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGods, that voice was beautiful. How you would love to hear it every day, waking up next to your maybe-lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, please wake up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shot open and you quickly rose up... on a wooden surface. Strange; the academy beds were hard, but not that uncomfortable... and since when did they have comedically large books? And maps? And giant, slender, beautiful fingers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze. Slowly, you began to turn around... and stopped dead in your movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie's giant, beautiful face was staring at you, beet-red with embarrassment. You looked down, and noticed you were completely bare, exposing all of your body to your crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Marie? What's going on? Why am I small? How did I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-haired mage looked away shyly, rubbing her cheek. \"W-well... about that... you see...\"</span></div></div>",

You had little resources growing up, and it took everything your village had to get you to Garreg Mach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you were here, you weren\u2019t of much help. You were only good at archery, and you were quite mediocre at that even. Because of this, you asked the renown archer from Dagda, Shamir Nevrand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to teach you,\u201d she said, repeating your question bluntly. You nodded in response, causing Shamir to sigh. She placed her hand on her hip as she looked to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a busy person, I won\u2019t have the time to teach some kid,\u201d she said, keeping eye contact with you. Your heart thumped in your chest as you heard those words. You asked her to reconsider, that you would do anything to gain her teachings. She looked to you again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d she said. Your eyes widened as you followed the Knight. The two of you eventually came to her room. She opened the door, and stepped in, sitting on her bed as she faced you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you want me to teach you archery, and you\u2019ll do anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded without hesitation. A smile came upon Shamir\u2019s face and she crossed one leg over the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case then, take off my boot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to protest, but you held your tongue. You went down on your knees and removed the boot from the foot that was extended toward you. A stench similar to cheese came from Shamir\u2019s now exposed bare foot. You noticed that it was also pale, and covered with sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re serious about this, I want you to massage my foot,\u201d she ordered. You swallowed the saliva in your throat, and grabbed her small foot. It was rather soft, and she seemed to take care of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly began to rub Shamir\u2019s feet. The look she had was indecipherable. She had no sense of contempt or disgust in her gaze, and yet you still felt uneasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked if you were doing well, and Shamir simply hummed in approval<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all that you needed to reassure yourself. You applied pressure to her joints, making sure that the tension from them would be released. A soft gasp escaped her mouth. That surprised you, and made you want to continue more. The longer it went on, the more Shamir tried to hide her moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk...that\u2019s enough,\u201d she said, panting heavily. \u201cYou...did good...kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked if you were done, to which Shamir simply chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, nowhere near done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir them placed her bare foot on your chest, squishing your breasts and making you slightly uncomfortable.

You were conflicted with something personal, and asked Rhea for advice. The archbishop them invited you to her private quarters. Ordinarily you would be honored, but that made you even more terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knocked at her door, and she told you to enter. She was still dressed in her formal attire, and when she saw you her face glowed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is wonderful to see you here,\u201d she said. Her voice was smooth, calm,  and relaxing. You hesitantly entered, and she sat on her bed. You had no idea what to do, until she spoke again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome, kneel before me and tell me what is on your mind, so that I may help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obeyed, moving toward the archbishop and knelt before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what is the problem, my child?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told her your thoughts on the recent events. The event at Remire Village, Lord Lanato\u2019s fate, and the appearance of the man named Solon. You told her how your faith was tested, and when you looked ip to see her, you witnessed the face of an angel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt pains me to see you conflicted so,\u201d she said. Rhea rested one leg over the other, and you could see her white heel poking from beneath her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemove my shoe, please,\u201d she said. You knew that request to be odd, but it felt like your body automatically did it anyway. You grabbed her heel, and slowly took it off and placed it near you. Now in front of you was a pale foot, one that far outshined all you had seen before. They radiated a holiness expected of lady Rhea. You instinctively grabbed it, and the warmth of it took you for surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, little one,\u201d Rhea said. \u201cSlowly rub my foot, and let all your doubts wash away. Feel your hands massage my smooth, delicate feet and feel your worries vanish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as she said, running your hands all over the soft, delicate flesh that was Rhea\u2019s feet. They smelled like flowers, and were absolutely hypnotic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel all your confusion disappear as you worship me, as you would worship the goddess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed a kiss on Rhea\u2019s toes, making her giggle. She reached down and ruffled your hair as you continued to rub her divine foot. She retracted it from you, making you sound your disappointment. She took off her other heel, and placed it in your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmell it, my dear,\u201d she said. You obeyed, and the smell of flowers once again enveloped you as Rhea stuffed her shoe in your face. Your heart was beating fast, and your breathing was growing more and more labored. You soon found yourself licking the insole, little bits of sweat stuck to your tongue as you did so. You eagerly swallowed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like that, breath it in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea allowed you to continue for a little while more, until she removed her heel from your face. She looked at you, panting mess that you were, and smiled. Her divine sole rested on your crotch, which was barely containing your erection. Lady Rhea...</span></div></div>",

She took off her other heel, and placed it aside. \u201cIn my years, I have helped many people who\u2019s faith was tested. I will be here for you, whenever you need me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Rhea moved her feet up to the sides of your face, and your heart beat heavily as you felt her soft soles on your cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does it feel,\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you like it, the feel of my warm, soft feet on your face? The aroma that calms you and soothes your nerves...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to pant as she rubbed her soles across your face. Your erection grew even more, and you were subconsciously humping the air. The feeling was like nothing you\u2019ve ever had before. It was sublime. You felt more warm and protected than ever before. Her feet were soft on your skin, warm and inviting without so as much as a hint of sweat or dead skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, it seems like someone is quite energetic. No worries, my child. I shall relive you soon enough. Now, what would you like to do to my feet? Would you want to massage them some more, or would you prefer to lavish your affections upon them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout responding, you grabbed one of Lady Rhea\u2019s feet, and began to deeply kiss it like you were kissing a lover. She smiled as she felt the sensation of your lips on the sole of her foot. Your labored breathing and eagerness in worship displayed your arousal, and your lips traveled from the bottom of her heel to the tips of her toes. They had a taste to them that reminded you of fruit, and as your lips traveled to the top of her foot, you slowly began to stick out your tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, let your stress vanish, and let your desires make themselves known. Do not be afraid, for the goddess Sothis allows us to give in to our inner temptations in order for is to heal. My body is yours to use as you see fit, for as long as we are here, I am simply Rhea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trailed your tongue across Rhea\u2019s soles, stopping occasionally to worship a specific spot while losing your mind over how soft they felt upon your tongue. They tasted amazing, the felt amazing, the looked amazing, they surely must belong to Saint Seiros or Sothis herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tongue eventually reached her toes, where you began to lick them and in between them. There was no grime nor sweat, all that was there was the all encompassing taste of strawberries. You began to suck Rhea\u2019s toes, and she giggled as you did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like a child at their mother\u2019s breast,\u201d she said. You sucked each one individually at first, savoring the taste, until eventually sucking them all at once. You kept them in your mouth while licking between them, making Rhea giggle even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look so precious like this. Your face is red with desire, and your body seems quite eager to do even more. I shall accommodate your desires. Now, my child, would you prefer if I...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You looked around, but saw no one in the darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoung man,\u201d a voice said, startling you and making you jump back in shock.

Instead, you were the one that did all the menial tasks. Cleaning the chamber pots, cooking, repairing armor, things like that. So, when one of the actual Shepards came to you, you were honestly surprised. Miriel was the mage of the Shepards, and her asking you of all people for something was peculiar to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize if I interrupted you,\u201d she said as she watched you slowly rise to your feet. You shook your head, and told her it was ok. She walked closer to you. The look in her eyes was impossible to figure out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThat is pleasing to hear. The reason I am here now is to research a spell I discovered. Ancient texts had shown a possible way of surrendering the mind of ones opponents. I can assure you that no harm will befall you if you consent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitantly nodded, and Miriel smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage casted a spell, and the next thing you knew your senses became clouded. You could still see, but it wasn\u2019t the same as before. It was off somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel sat down on a nearby stool, and crossed one leg over the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you feel anything different?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head, and she wrote something down. You noticed Miriel kick her boots off, and suddenly you were on all fours rushing toward her freshly released feet. Miriel didn\u2019t seem phased at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTarget is obsessed with the caster\u2019s feet,\u201d she wrote down. You felt your mouth salivate as you stared at her pale bare feet. They were the most attractive pair of feet you had ever seen in your life. Her soles had high arches to them, and despite the slight smell from her wearing boots all day, they still looked like something the dragon Naga would bestow upon a human as a gift. Her toes were plump and suckable. Your breathing was heavy, and your heart pounded in your chest as you looked at them. Miriel scrunched her toes together, then spread them apart. She rolled them, crossed one over the other, and did many more, seemingly absent minded things, that drove you insane. You needed more. You needed to touch them, and so you did. You grabbed her foot by the ankle, and she looked down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTarget seems to be craving the caster\u2019s feet,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTell me, what do you want to do with my feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told her everything on your mind. You told her that you wanted to rub them, lick them, suck them, kiss them, smell them, and feel them all over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well then,\u201d Miriel said. \u201cFor the next step in this experiment, you may...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Maribelle's package fell right next to you, hopefully not damaging the insides.<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry! I-I was just bringing this package to you!\" You say, as you sat on the ground awkwardly trying to explain yourself<br>\r\n\"S-sure you were! And this... i-indecent thing here is like this for no reason?!\" Maribelle said, still visibly angry and embarrassed, while covering her breasts<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what she meant by indecent thing... until all of a sudden she put one of her beautiful feet between your legs, and pressed down on your growing erection. Despite her forcefulness, her foot felt amazingly soft, even through your pants... making you get even harder despite the humiliating situation<br>\r\n\"I-Is it getting bigger?! You really are a perverted scum!\" Maribelle said, lifting her foot and prodding your erection with her toes a few times... making you let out a few quiet moans.<br>\r\n\"M-Men really are disgusting to enjoy something like this...\" She mumbled to herself<br>\r\n\"You bastard... peeping on me like this, y-you will be punished!\" Maribelle said, though she didn't put her foot back onto your erection... which felt oddly disappointing<br>\r\n\"Cover your eyes right now while I dress up! If you don't, I will make sure you are locked in deepest and darkest dungeon for rest of your deviant life!\" The angry noble girl demanded<br>\r\nYou figured it's better to listen to her... nonetheless you also worried what her current idea of punishment might be...</span></div></div>",

You had an incredible track record, but not even yours could compare to Cordelia's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer beautiful figure, her mastery of Combat. A true prodigy, although she disliked terms like that. Her body was like that of a Goddess, and her luscious red hair made her easily stand out in a crowd even more than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning, the two of you were training together. Unmounted Lance Combat. The two of you dodged and weaved through each others attacks like it was a sort of dance, until finally, Cordelia managed to strike a clean, decisive blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" She announced in victory, holding her lance to the sky. \"Phew... you did manage to tire me out, though. Almost got me\" She extended a hand, to which you took, raising you back to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a workout...\" She stretched. \"Come with me, let's go and relax for a bit\" She smiled warmly. The two of you headed into a nicely lit room. It was cool inside, quite relaxing in comparison to the scorching heat outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...\" Cordelia stretched, taking off some of her equipment, though notably not her breastplate. She pulled off her boots and a wonderful aroma came spiralling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... apologies. I suppose I was starting to sweat quite a bit in those boots...\" She sighed. You assured her it was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy a massage? those feet are looking like they could use it\" Cordelia looked to you with a slight blush, extending one of her perfect legs towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead...\" Is all she said. You began to knewad her feet like dough, getting your thumbs into her feet. They were large and beautiful, much like her thighs. Cordelia closed her eyes and her posture relaxed. \"That''s good...\" She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly began to get aroused by her tender feet. When you sayw her toes wiggle, when you heard her sighs of relief and relaxation. It was all beautiful anf contributed to your arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot was so tantalising from this close. The sweat still dripping, her soles ever so close to your face. Surely at least a sniff wouldn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you gave into your temptations and began to sniff her feet every once and a while, as well. Despite being stuck in boots for a while in warm weather, they were actually quite good-smelling. They were not bad by any means at all. You began to sniff more and more, until you couldn't hold back anymore, and gave a small lick across the center of the foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a tap on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see an arm, leading down to Cordelia's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... enjoying them that much, are you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" Was all you could say before she cut you off. \"Don't mind me... you can keep going. It's... nice, but... don't go too far\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were a common man of similarly boring background. Despite that, however, you found yourself involved with the Shepherds of Ylisse, a militia ran by Prince Chrom. With them, you fought in countless battles, defending the world from the machinations of evil men like Mad King Gangrel and Walhart the Conqueror, as well as the unholy abomination known as Grima. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rough life, but you found yourself enjoying it. You began to enjoy it more when a beautiful, red-headed Pegasus Knight joined up. Her name was Cordelia, known to some as the Knight Paragon due to her prowess in battle and her amazing set of skills that impressed all who witnessed them. You couldn't help but introduce yourself to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started out as small conversations at first. A small bit of talk to make the long marches go faster. But as you two grew closer, the line between friend and something more began to blur. Small, fleeting touches turned into embraces, and the talks turned into dates. You helped her through her problems, there for her when she confessed she loved Prince Chrom. You resolved that you could still be friends with her, even if you couldn't have her for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all changed on the day she kissed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral months' worth of feelings spilled out on a single night, and you found yourself engaged, and then married to, the woman of your dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven then, she never knew your secret. Your foot fetish. It wasn't something you were particularly proud of; it made you feel lesser, somehow, as if you liking a specific body part usually seen as dirty and disgusting made you something inhuman. Such dark thoughts became more and more prevalent as time passed and your married life with Cordelia began. You would take glances at her feet. Nothing major, just a quick look here and there. Her usual pegasus knight outfit consisted of boots worn over stockings, although if you removed her boots you'd see that they ended in stirrups, leaving most of her bare feet exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, however, Cordelia had noticed. She'd found you out, but was too nervous to tell you. Your marriage was young, after all, and she didn't want things spiraling out of control. With that in mind, she visited a good friend of hers, Sumia, one day. You knew she usually had tea with the clumsy pegasus knight, so you didn't pay much attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came back a few hours later, looking a little more confident somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back,\" You greeted her, spinning away from your desk to look at her. \"How'd it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Oh, fine. Just fine.\" Cordelia replied, sighing as she flowed her fingers through her red hair. \"It was, erm, very enlightening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" You chuckled, turning back around and filing away the parchment you'd been writing on. \"In what way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the bed creak as she laid down upon it. \"Well, let's just say I had a lot of questions... and she gave me a lot of answers. To be honest, I'm glad I did; I don't think I'd have the courage to do this otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what-?\" You stopped as you turned back around, seeing Cordelia stretched out on the bed, with her boot clad feet pointing straight at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you please come over here?\" She asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide...</span></div></div>",

And the way her feet were pointed at you made you suspect that she knew. You got up from your chair and followed her orders. Sitting down on the bed, just next to your legs, you looked at her ruby red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this about?\" You asked nervously, playing with your fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've... noticed you staring at my feet,\" Cordelia began, causing your heart to sink into your stomach. \"I thought it strange, at first. I'd never heard of such a thing before. I didn't want to scare you, so I... I decided to speak with Sumia about it. She promised me she wouldn't tell anyone else, by the way. If you truly have this foot fetish she speaks about, I can understand why you would want it to be a secret. Rest assured, only she and I know.\" Cordelia took a deep breath. \"So, please, tell me the truth. Do you have a foot fetish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down, ashamed. It was inevitable, perhaps, that this would happen. Cordelia was as sharp as a polished sword; she'd notice anything about you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I do,\" You admitted. \"I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier. It's rather embarrassing, isn't it? You decided to marry a pervert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Cordelia tilted her head. \"How does that make you a pervert? I certainly don't think of you that way. I admit, it's a... strange fascination. Outside the norm, but then again, everyone is unique. Sumia told me a lot about it. I almost think she has a fascination with it herself...\" Cordelia trailed off before shaking her head. \"Either way, if it is a part of you, I will accept it. It certainly could be stranger, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised a brow as you stared at her. \"Does that mean...? Is this why you have your feet out to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia blushed. \"It's strange, and not something I'd usually condone, but... but since it's you, I'm willing to be open about it. But please, contain yourself until I get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently held her boot-clad feet in your hands, looking to her for permission. You almost couldn't believe what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia nodded. \"Go ahead. Take them off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed your saliva, feeling your chest constrict as you pulled Cordelia's thigh-highs off. You'd seen her milky white legs before, but somehow it was more tantalizing than it was before. With a final tug, you took her boots off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia's feet were as beautiful as you imagined. Her feet were slightly larger than you'd expect, being about a size 8. Her soles were pale, slender and soft-looking, with high arches and somewhat long toes, topped with perfectly pedicured and clear nails. She scrunched her toes and wiggled them, as if trying to tease you. You also saw her red stirrups, and all that accomplished was further excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet felt light in your hands as you marveled at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well...\" Cordelia stammered, her face almost as red as her hair. \"Do with them what you will. Please, be gentle, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you went all in, it could have disastrous consequences. With that in mind, you went for a simple massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pressed your thumbs into the supple flesh of her soles, kneading them. You heard her gasp and you looked up, seeing her cover her mouth. She blinked but it was almost as if she was urging you to continue. You did, getting really into it. You massaged the balls of her feet, the heels and, eventually, her toes. You spread them out, hearing small pops and you scrunched them manually. A faint smell of sweat wafted up to your nose. It wasn't overpowering in the slightest; on the contrary, it only furthered your excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...\" Cordelia let out a shuddering breath. \"This feels really nice... I really like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, continuing to massage her beautiful feet. \"I'm glad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Cordelia mumbled back, her hands trailing down her legs. \"Please, keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho were you to say no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer you massaged her feet, the more you found out about them. There was a very thin sheen of sweat to them, but not nearly enough to be disgusting or anything like that. Enough to show that she'd been walking around a lot that day, certainly. You were too busy fondling her feet to see Cordelia, though. Unbeknownst to you, it looked as if she was enjoying it just as much as you were. Maybe even more. She was biting her lip and her eyes were fluttering as she leaned back on a pillow. After a while longer, you found her feet rising up towards your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her, questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to bite her lip anymore, she told you to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Y-You want to lick them, right? If as massage feels this good, I don't think... I wouldn't mind if you licked them. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe what you were hearing. Her toes wiggled and her soles scrunched. You remember the softness of them against your fingers, the lovely smell that came from them, and you began salivating. It was amazing how far you'd come in less than an hour. Just before then you never imagined touching Cordelia's feet, let alone licking them. Fortunately for you, Cordelia took it out of your hands. Both figuratively and literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia took her feet out of your hands and pressed them against your face. Within a moment, your world was engulfed by her lovely pale feet. The feel, the smell of her feet was all that you could feel. She rubbed her soles against your face, as if she couldn't wait for you to begin your worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to disappoint her, especially after she accepted your fetish. Hell, she even seemed to enjoy it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stuck your tongue out and pressed it against her heel. She gasped once more, and as your tongue glided along her smooth, soft, sweaty sole, she moaned aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods...!\" She exclaimed, feeling your tongue slither along her feet. \"T-To think this could feel this good...! I could get used to this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of doing something like this to Cordelia on a regular basis only succeeded in exciting you further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slathered Cordelia's soles with your saliva, losing yourself into it as you began to place your tongue between her toes. For a moment, your tongue was trapped between her long, pale toes, held there against your will. Cordelia looked down and smiled sultrily at you, her breath rapid. Without any warning, she stuffed her toes into your mouth. Against your will, her toes wiggled and played with your tongue, filling your mouth with the flavor of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sucked on her toes, which almost made her scream out of pleasure. She pressed her palm against her mouth to silence herself as you slithered your tongue between her toes, enraptured by the taste. You smiled, as much as you could smile with a mouth full of Cordelia long, sweaty toes. You sucked on her toes for a while, occasionally switching foot and sucking on different toes at time, before seeing how many of them you could stuff into your mouth at once. With the occasional lick to her already saliva-coated sole, you sucked on her toes for quite a while. This appeared to be almost too much for Cordelia; you could see the rise and fall of her chest as she attempted to get her breathing under control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her toes from your mouth and pressed them against your crotch. You hadn't noticed, but a tent had been steadily forming in your pants the entire time you were worshipping your wife's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She continued to press her feet against your crotch in anticipation for you taking them off, which you promptly did as fast as you could. Cordelia had seen your member before; you'd been married for several months, after all. But this time, something was different. There was a primal air to the way you both were acting, almost as if you were at your honeymoon again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment your cock was free, standing tall, Cordelia's beautiful feet descended upon it. You moaned aloud, feeling her smooth, soft soles cover your dick. With it sandwiched between them, Cordelia pumped up and down, doing better than any fantasy you ever had. She was biting her lip, trying to not let out any sounds as she focused her full attention on your cock, attempting to milk you dry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Cordelia firmly planted her sole against your shaft, with her stirrup going around it to ensure your dick was never without contact with her soft, slender soles as rhythmically moved up and down, with her toes playing with the tip as her other foot moved forward, all the way up to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suck on my toes...\" Cordelia breathed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd lost yourself long ago, and so all you could do was obey. Cordelia moaned loudly as her toes pushed past your lips and into your mouth once more. Without hesitation, you sucked on her long, slender digits, allowing them full range of your mouth. With Cordelia's other foot still playing with your dick, your mind almost went completely blank. You could see, though, the wetness below Cordelia's riding skirt.  The mutual enjoyment was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one single moment, you couldn't take it anymore. Cordelia pinched your tongue between her toes as her other toes did the same to your cock, and you cummed. Hot, sticky strings flowed from your dick and onto Cordelia's foot as she took her toes out of your mouth and presented her sole to you, allowing you to continue your worship as you dragged your tongue across her soft, pale ball and arches. Cordelia unhooked her dick from her stirrup and leaned back, allowing her head to fall back and showing you her sweat covered collar bone and her modest bust, held back by her red tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods...\" Cordelia gasped, wiping at her forehead. \"I'm glad Sumia told me about this. This is... well, I hope you don't mind if this happens regularly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" You exclaimed. \"I would love nothing more than to do this with you all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia smiled. \"Good. I have to admit, my favorite part was the worship. Gods, the way you licked my soles, sucked my toes... I feel as if that could happen hundreds of times and I wouldn't get tired of it.\" Cordelia looked down. \"Dear, I'm still, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou again noticed the dripping wetness beneath her skirt. It wasn't fair to let yourself have all the fun, especially when Cordelia had done almost everything to please you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, you decided to...</span></div></div>",

Someone slammed to the floor in a heap, squeaking rather cutely as their face slammed into the wooden floor. You and Cordelia exchanged glances as you looked to see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sumia?\" Cordelia asked, sadly taking her feet away from you to crawl over the bed, looking at the grey-haired pegasus knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owie-!\" Sumia rubbed at her face, unsteadily standing up and looking at you both. \"Oh, pegasus plop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" You asked, your brows furrowed. This was odd. Incredibly odd. Now that your mind was returning to you, you remembered that it was Sumia that told Cordelia that you had a foot fetish. That raised the question of how she knew that, or rather, how she knew that. Did she...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia frantically tried to explain herself. \"Okay, okay, please don't be mad! I know you two were probably having a moment and I just decided to... Gods, this is embarrassing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia crossed her arms, a light glare on her face. \"Please, by all means. I want to know why my best friend would barge in when my husband and I were... well, I suppose you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia glanced at Cordelia's bared feet, still covered in your saliva, and nodded. \"Yes! Er, that is... You know what I mean. Anyway, I just wanted to see how you guys were doing, really. See if things were going well. And, well, I guess they were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were.\" You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, great!\" Sumia gave a sheepish thumb's up. \"I just, well, I guess that's that. Though I wanted to ask you, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia seemed to have calmed down by that point, and she looked at Sumia questioningly. \"Yes? Did you need something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia began playing with her fingers. She asked...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cordelia didn't, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" She hummed. \"I suspected you had your own, er, fantasies, Sumia. Had I known you'd come here for them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, he's yours,\" Sumia assured. \"Just once, please? I helped you two out. Could you, uh, humor me? Just this one time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to Cordelia, who seemed to be conflicted for a moment before sighing. \"Fine. It doesn't have to be just this once, either, but next time, I want him alone. I've found that I, erm... quite enjoy this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia smirked. \"You do, huh? I knew you would!\" Sumia hopped onto the bed as Cordelia made room. Unfortunately, your bed wasn't that big, so you found yourself at the foot of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, I can't wait!\" Sumia giggled, her boot-clad feet wiggling with anticipation. You fell to the floor as the two pegasus knights put both their feet firmly in front of you, one bare, and one in boots. You decided to fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, keep your voice down, Sumia,\" Cordelia lightly chided. \"I don't want anyone else discovering us in this... precarious position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I closed the door when I came in, and before then I couldn't hear anything outside it. We'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices of the two pegasus knights faded away as you focused on getting Sumia's boots off. With several gentle tugs, they plopped off, revealing the mostly bare feet of the Clumsy Pegasus Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were just as beautiful as Cordelia's feet, in their own way. Her toes weren't as long, and they were perhaps a size smaller, but her soles were perhaps even softer than Cordelia's, and they carried a slightly stronger scent, as they were quite clearly sweaty. Overall, though, you still somewhat preferred your wife's feet. Nonetheless, you were not going to pass up the chance to worship two pairs of beautiful feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both of their implicit permissions, you got to work. Starting on Sumia's, you traced your tongue along the outside of her arch, allowing the flavor of her feet to fill your mouth. You hadn't even done much before Sumia started moaning. You could feel the smugness come from Cordelia; she hadn't moaned nearly as loud or as often when you were doing it with her, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gods! This is better than what I imagined!\" Sumia squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhm, Keep going, dear,\" Cordelia commanded. \"I quite like seeing her squirm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as you were told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quick licks turned into long slurps up Sumia's soles, along her smooth heels and balls, and lightly flicking up her toes. You could hear Sumia's rapid breaths as you kept going, deciding it was time to give her toes a bit of love. You allowed her toes entrance into your mouth, and you felt them squirm and wiggle, fighting with your tongue for dominance. It was different from when you sucked Cordelia's toes; there was no fight with Cordelia. She enslaved your tongue to her toes and forced you to clean them. Here? Here, there was a battle in your mouth as the taste of Sumia's feet mixed with your saliva. In the end, however, you won as Sumia's toes allowed your tongue passage everywhere. Below her toes, between them, every nook and cranny was open to you. You didn't even notice her fidgeting on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now,\" Cordelia's voices echoed in your ears as you took Sumia's toes out of your mouth. \"Both, dear. Worship us both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no room to refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou traced old and new ground as you slathered the pegasus knights' feet with your saliva, slithering your tongue between Cordelia's long toes once more as well as licking up and down Sumia's soles. You nibbled at Cordelia's heels and sucked Sumia's pale toes, you did it all. You stuffed Cordelia and Sumia's big toes into your mouth, sucking on both of them. You could hear the moans of the pegasus knights', gratifying you as you continued the worship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, however, it appeared they took matters into their own hands. What happened next made this the best night of your life...</span></div></div>",

You moan in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhm... yes, we'll be hearing that quite a bit\" Her smile grew wider as she took off her heels, revealing her feet, clad in the same bodystocking as the rest of her outfit. She gently caressed you body, tracing your sensitive areas with her foot, teasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... you're going to help me try a hex... and there's nothing you can do to say no\" She cackled. She took out her spellbook and spoke an incantation. With that, you body seemed to have become almost 100x more sensitive. Her foot grazing your stomach felt like it was touching your penis, it was that good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liking it so far? Hmhm... well, what if I...\" She touched the side of your penis with her foot and dragged it down. the pleasure was so immense you erupted in a mountain of cum. With another incantation, it was trapped in a bubble, then poured into a vial. \"This will be useful later\" She smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However... for now, enjoy that release... you won't be getting another for a good long while...\" She muttered another incantation and dark magic seemed to surround the tip of your penis, and then spread until it formed what appeared to be a chastity device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more for now... but let's see how frustrated we can make you... it's got to be perfect\" She smiled with glee as she slowly and sensually stroked your penis with her foot. With the incantation, you so desperately wanted to cum again, but couldn't. In the end, all you could do was moan loudly in your thick gag from frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahaha! Wonderful!\" She licked her lips. She propped herself down behind you, her creamy thighs surrounding your head. He feet lightly danced around your body as she used her long nails to trace your nipples, playing with them. You squirmed and writhed in frustration and a want to release, but the incantation kept stopping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww... what a shaaaamme\" She teased in your ear almost seductively. \"You're mine now... and when this is over, when you beg, and beg and beg to cum... and I finally answer, you'll wish you hadn't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being drunk on arousal those words filled you with dread. Again, there was nothing you could do but moan and write in your bondage.</span></div></div>",

Being in the position you was, you clearly had no choice but to submit and to began to lick. Her feet, obscured by black stocking, were amazing to the touch of your tongue.

Her soles were sheer joy and filled you with nothing but lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou greedily lapped at her feet, all the meanwhile, behind you, Tharja traced her long nail around your face, slightly stroking your skin in a way that, due to the increased sensitivity, only made you squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere your arms not bound, you'd have taken these feet and shoved them straight into you face, you were that lustful. Each lick was long and quick, this taste being almost addictive. The tenderness of the sole under the stocking, the feeling of the stocking against your face as it lightly grazed it now and again. It was intoxicating in its own right, and you could do nothing but obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Foot Slave of my own... hmhmhm... this is wonderful\" She soothingly teased behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her feet left your face and she stood up, lookign down at you.

Tharja took a moment to personally stroke your penis with her foot a final time before you ejaculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the sperm built up released at once, forming a massive volcano, of sorts. It was all manipulated into a group of glass containers, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me- did you wonder why I brought you here?\" She asked.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were a young man on the continent of Valm, a simple commoner by all means. And yet, you had been chosen to fulfill a duty few had the chance to even hear of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were to be the attendant of the Divine Dragon, the Voice of Naga and Dragon Oracle, Lady Tiki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a position would never had come to someone such as you. You had, of course, attended many of Lady Tiki's sermons and seances. Such things were expected of you, even as a commoner. And as a commoner, you never expected to be called upon. You had apparently caught Tiki's eye somehow, although how, exactly, she was able to pick you out of the crowd you will never know. Robed men came and took you away from your humble abode, and you were marched up the Mila Tree, Tiki's grand home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men told you of your job, and when you entered the Oracle's quarters, you felt your jaw drop straight to the wooden floor. It was far more extravagant than any castle, carved out of the wood of the Mila Tree itself. Tiki regarded you sleepily, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour job began immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man usually wouldn't become her attendant, if what the robed men from before said was true. However, there were apparently exceptions. You were immediately set to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jobs required of you were actually quite simple. Most of your tasks consisted of dusting the area, waking Tiki up when she fell too close to slumber, and occasionally helping her get dressed for her weekly rituals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Divine Dragon herself wasn't at all what you expected, either. She was usually rather sleepy, no doubt from the lengthy rituals and sermons she had to oversee. And yet, she had a strength to her that took you off-guard. When prompted, she could easily speak with you for hours about her adventures thousands of years prior. You never had difficulty listening to them; they were incredibly entertaining, and the way Tiki became animated and alive made your chest warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went like this for months, with nothing of note happening. At least, that was how it appeared to your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your eyes tended to wander when she was getting dressed, specifically towards her pale feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a foot fetish, yes, and you had known this for your entire life. It was difficult not to look at Lady Tiki in general; she had looks that could send certain, unsavory men into a frenzy. Long green hair tied into a pony-tail, with pointed ears and eyes like glittering emeralds could captivate anyone for days. Yet, when you were helping her get dressed, you couldn't help but look down at the objects of beauty that were her feet. You could never quite get a good look at them, due to not wanting to get caught, but you could tell that they were godly, perhaps the most beautiful feet you'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it turned out, one day, that Tiki had noticed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear attendant,\" Tiki called one day, stretched out on her comfy bed. \"Could you do something for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Lady Tiki,\" You replied hastily, at her side within an instant. \"What do you need of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki gave you a smile, stretching her legs out to you. \"That last ritual really tired my feet out. Would you be so kind as to give them a massage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart pounded in your chest at those words alone.You gulped. \"A-Are you sure, Lady Tiki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you have more than earned the right to call me simply 'Tiki',\" The Divine Dragon corrected. \"And yes, I am more than sure. I have been working them so very hard recently, and they could use the pampering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down at the edge of her bed, and her booted feet landed squarely in your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Easily, they came off, revealing her feet clad in pink stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may take them off,\" Tiki said, placing a stray strand of green hair behind her lovely pointed ears. \"I'd rather you massage my bare feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knowing look and smirk she was giving you was beginning to unnerve you, but you kept your facade up and began to remove her stockings. With each inch you revealed more of Tiki's milky pale thighs, culminating in what you'd been dying to see for months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki's feet were perfection, just as you suspected. They were average-sized for her height, with high arches and long, flawless toes. Her pale feet shimmered in the light available due to the slight sheen of sweat that glazed them. Tiki giggled, wiggling her toes, much to your excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already starstruck, are we?\" She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uh, nothing of the sort, Tiki.\" You hastily stammered out a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come then,\" Tiki said, raising one gorgeous foot. \"Do not be shy. Massage them to your heart's content.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your fingers made contact with her soles, you were instantly in a state of euphoria. Her pale soles were unbelievably soft to the touch. Not as soft as pillows, obviously, but it would not hurt to be stepped on by her. You had to hold back a blush as you pushed that thought to the back of your mind, and continued with Tiki's pampering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneaded her soles, causing her to sigh. You massaged her heels and her arches, taking special care to not leave a single part of your lady's feet untouched and unpampered. Soon, you reached to her toes. They wiggled upon contact with your fingers, as if teasing you, before allowing you to fondle them. You stretched them, hearing the occasional pop as the small amount of tension left in her lovely toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Tiki hummed, smirking at you. \"You're enjoying this, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood turned to ice. \"W-What do you mean, Tiki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you, my dear attendant,\" Tiki began to explain, her beautiful pale bare feet loosing themselves from your hands and landing on your crotch. You had to stifle a moan at the wonderful, euphoric feeling that spread throughout your entire body at the contact. \"You have been glancing at my feet your entire time here. Did you think you could hide such a thing from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I-I'm sorry, Lady Tiki,\" You began, shame filling your body. \"I should have kept my-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. I do not mean it like that. I was merely curious why you kept it a secret for so long,\" Tiki interrupted. \"It has been so very long since last I had a foot fetishist as my attendant. Too long, in fact. I always enjoyed playing with him. Having him worship my feet with his mouth, feeling his tongue slither between my toes... Oh, and how could I forget the footjobs? Those were always so fun. Having a human cum with only the use of my feet is rather gratifying, if I do say so myself. So you see, my attendant, there is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, I would rather like if I could participate in such activities again. And since this job is for life, you have all the time in the world with my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart pounded in your chest, so hard you felt as if you would have a heart attack. Was this real? How could this be real? Tiki, the Lady Tiki, was inviting you to worship her feet. It was like a dream come true. And if what she said about your position, then you had an entire life to look forward to worshiping the beautiful feet encircling and playing with the tent in your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As an apology for making you feel bad earlier, I will let you have the first pick,\" Tiki smiled at you, crossing her legs and resting on foot on top of the other. \"Would you like to worship my feet? Slather them with your saliva? Or would you rather I wrap them around your dick, and milk you dry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chose...</span></div></div>",

Tiki looked at you expectantly, her pale feet still resting there, waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you put your hands underneath her heels and lifted them up to your face. You admired the smoothness of her heels as you brought her soles mere inches from your face. You could smell the aroma of her feet; a faint lavender, coupled with a hint of sweat that still settled on her feet. For just one more moment, you marveled at the feet you held in your hands. Before long, however, you gave in, and her soft soles rested on your face, engulfing you in the softness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki giggled. \"Taking it slow, hmm? I can respect that. Please, cover them in your saliva. I wouldn't have it any other way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't need to be told twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tongue loosed from your mouth as you licked up her sweaty soles. Up and down, up and down, you licked the soles of Tiki's feet. The taste of her feet filled your mouth. They were perhaps the best thing you'd ever tasted; they were sweet, somehow, with a faint hint of salt from the sweat that had built up. You barely registered this before going back to licking the beautiful pale soles in front of you, making sure you soaked them in your saliva. You went down to her heels, and sucked on them, moving your tongue in rhythmic motions around the divine skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suck on my toes,\" Tiki ordered, moving her feet down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, your mouth was stuffed full with Tiki's long, sweaty toes. You were in complete bliss as you sucked on the digits spreading in your mouth. Several times Tiki caught your tongue between her toes, holding it captive for a few moments before allowing it to reign free over them again. In between bouts of rigorous toe-sucking, you moved your tongue between her toes, doing your best to clean them of the sweat and replace it with your saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fit them all inside your mouth,\" Tiki commanded as you opened your mouth wide. \"Let's see if you can, hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll ten of Tiki's long, slender toes entered your mouth, playing around with your tongue and trampling it. Even with your mouth full with Tiki's toes, you still tried to worship her; sucking on all ten of her toes, moving your tongue between them, lavishing them with your mouth. Truly, you had almost completely lost yourself to your lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki's toes were removed from your mouth, and her feet, still wet with your saliva, landed on your crotch. Your cock was as hard as it possibly could be, and strained against your pants, trying to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remove them,\" Tiki said, licking her lips. \"I want to feel your hot dick against my soft soles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your cock was almost boring a hole through your pants, and with Tiki's godly feet pressing against the fabric, you felt as if you would burst at any moment. Tiki didn't look as if she was in the mood for any hesitation on your part, considering how hard she was pressing down on the tent in your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fumbled with your pants, removing them as fast as you could as your heart beat at a million miles a minute. Tiki held her feet back as she did so, wiggling her saliva-covered toes and scrunching her soles, as if to tease you further. Or perhaps she was anticipating this as much as you were. Nonetheless, your pants fell to the floor, and soon enough, your underwear followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay down,\" Tiki ordered, her pale white feet so tantalizingly close to your manhood. \"Let me take care of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour panicked breaths settled as you laid down, your cock fully erect. Tiki giggled as she looked at it, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, but that's quite impressive,\" Tiki said sultrily. \"All of this for my feet? Oh yes, I think I'm going to have fun with you in the coming years. But first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a small bit of pride at Tiki's words, which was quickly replaced by unintelligible thoughts as Tiki's lovely feet were placed on your cock. One soft sole went up and down your shaft, her long toes occasionally playing around with the tip of your dick. Her other foot was aimed a bit lower, with her toes rubbing against your balls, massaging them and nearly scrambling your head with how amazing it felt. Her smooth soles against your hard shaft alone nearly made you cum, yet somehow, you were able to keep yourself in check, willing yourself to enjoy the feeling of her feet against your cock and she began to pump your cock between her soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still haven't cummed yet? Hehe, consider me impressed further.\" Her smile grew. \"I'll consider it a challenge, then. I was going to take it easy on you, since it's our first session, but since you appear so durable, I'll just have to up the ante, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were both frightened and aroused at what Tiki had planned. You were at her mercy now; there was nothing you could do to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed your cock between her toes, and slowly, agonizingly slowly, pumped up, and down. She was squeezing your dick between her long toes, putting special pressure on the head, where her toes seemingly covered the entirety of it, trapping it in a prison of divine, wet, smooth skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it, my attendant,\" Tiki whispered, her voice causing you to shiver. \"Cum on my feet. Glaze my toes with your seed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were finally at your limit, and it wasn't long after that that you climaxed. Hot, sticky ropes of white surged from your cock, covering Tiki's feet and a good portion of her legs. Tiki continued to play around with your cock, sandwiching it between her soles and milking you dry. After a few seconds, it was over. Tiki giggled as she wiggled her toes, watching your semen flow between her toes and drip down her soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhm, and you continue to impress me. A decent amount for sure,\" Tiki said, giggling again. \"Ah, it feels so nice to use my feet for this. It's been too long since I've felt a nice, hot cock between my soles. I thank you for this experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still too busy catching your breath to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you appear to be heading to sleep,\" Tiki continued, her voice becoming more distant. \"Hmm, what to do with you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I hope your binds are comfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked, trying to move only to realize you couldn't. You were completely bound. They were not uncomfortable, certainly, at least if you didn't try to break them. They were just tight enough to ensure you could not move much. Your arms were bound behind your back, and your legs were tucked underneath your body so you were on your knees, staring up at Tiki as she sat on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for this, but I thought I would have my way with you in a different fashion,\" Tiki smiled crossing her legs. \"My previous attendant liked it this way, too, and considering I do not have to apear before the masses for another day or so, I thought we could have much more enjoyment out of this.\" She looked down, her smile growing. \"Ah, and it appears I was correct on your end.

Your entire being was engulfed by her soft soles as her toes wiggled on your forehead. All you could smell was her feet, faintly smelling of sweat yet still retaining that curious sweetness to them. She kneaded your face with her feet, making sure you knew just who you belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that is nice,\" Tiki sighed. \"Mm, your face is an excellent foot massage tool. But now we shall get on to the real worship. Open your mouth and present your tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obeyed, opening your mouth and sticking your tongue out. Her sole glided down your tongue, allowing you to taste them once more. She did one after the other, slowly slathering her soles in your saliva as they pressed against and trampled your tongue beneath them. Your tongue went against her cool, smooth heel, her sweaty instep, her pillowy balls, and gently sliding across her toes, but those would truly come later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my attendant,\" Tiki purred. \"You are mine now, and these feet are yours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words only excited you further as your heart thundered in your chest. After a few more rounds of foot licking, she presented her toes to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss them,\" She quietly whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did so, feathering her toes with soft kisses as their scent never ceased to drive you further. You loved her feet. You wanted to be with them forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said nothing as she pushed her toes past your lips and grasped your tongue with them. She pulled your tongue out with her toes and forces it to clean them. She captured your tongue, holding it in between her toes as she used it to slather her other toes with it. The taste of her toes was pure heaven, and you couldn't get enough of it. Once more, her toes pushed past your lips, settling in your mouth, letting you know what to do next. You sucked on them, harder, making sure every nook and cranny was suckled clean of sweat. Your mouth was completely filled with the taste of her feet. Her other toes pushed into your mouth as well, and you were caught in a pure state of bliss with your mouth full with Tiki's long, sweaty pale toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, yes, suck on them. Harder,\" She ordered, and you could do nothing but oblige, forcing your tongue between all of her toes and reaching the divine skin therein. For hours, you were there, Tiki's feet in your mouth and filling you with their flavor. You covered her soft soles in your saliva, you sucked on her toes for what felt like years. Truly, this was your version of heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, however, she drew her feet back, wiggling her saliva covered toes right in front of your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are definitely my favorite now,\" She giggled. \"It has been so long since these feet have gotten the proper worship they've deserved. Now, what to do with you now...\"</span></div></div>",

You had just walked into the tent of the Junior Tactician Morgan when in an instant you shrunk to a mere fraction of your height. As you were processing your sudden decrease in size you hear a giggle almost reverberate around you. You recognized the voice and a sinking feeling welled up in your stomach. Two thuds resonate around you as you turn to look behind you. In front of you are...toes? Massive ones at that. You hear another giggle and the toes start to wiggle slightly. You look up and see Morgan smirking down at you with a mischievous look. She was holding a mysterious tome in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah finally, good to see you in one piece. I recently discovered a shrinking spell in this old tome lying around the library. I figured I'd try it out on something. Thankfully you showed up right on time, I was getting ready to search for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there slightly dazed from everything. You shake your head and asked her if she can grow you back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I was thinking about that; but now...\" She stops for a moment as she props her left foot up in front of you. \"I think I kinda like you down there at my feet, and I think you do too right?\" She gives you a small grin as she bends her foot and wiggles her toes in front of your face. You take this moment to get a better look at the foot in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot itself is very pale, most likely from being trapped inside her boot. The toes have this almost milky sheen as the soft and supple flesh bends causing creases on her sole. This is easily the best foot you've ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan notices you staring at her foot and giggles at your infatuation. She takes her big toe and boops you on the nose, knocking you over. \"You weren't exactly being subtle about it even when you were normal size. Regardless I think I have a job for you. I've been walking around camp taking stock of everything and my feet are ridiculously tired, and considering your attraction towards them I think it's only fitting that you help me out by massaging my feet. Of course if there's more you want to do besides a massage just let me know. I'm sure if you ask nicely my toes will accept a kiss or two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou readily agree to her offer due to your attraction. Now the only question is... Do you take it slow, or jump into licking and kissing?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Because you had been shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan had called you to her tent in order to discuss something. You had a small crush on the peppy girl, and figured that this was the perfect chance to ask her out. She was about your age, despite being from the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, what happened was a sudden flash of light and the feeling of your mind shutting down. When you awoke, the tent had suddenly increased in size... and then you heard a giggle from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward to the present, where you are currently nude and standing before the giant toes of what is essentially a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are cute, Trisha,\" Morgan said. \"Don't think I didn't notice how infatuated you are with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, good.

So I thought it was a waste when I noticed you swiping a pair of my socks to masturbate with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Gods help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInching her foot closer, you could practically see the sweat glistening off her toes. \"I've always had a thing for being giant... playing with little people using my feet, my mouth, my fingers... especially if those little people were sexy girls like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to sweat nervously, partially out of arousal and partially out of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she removed her coat and exposed her small breasts, playfully bouncing them with her hands. \"How about you worship my feet... and if you do a good job, I'll let you explore my giant body. As my girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Girlfriend.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh fuck yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her toes and pinched you between the big and second, lifting you onto the surprisingly comfy mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... go get 'em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe extended her feet towards you, toes wiggling and sweat glistening on her soles.

That knowing gaze and smile. She knew. The only thing you could do now was admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... love your feet\" You managed to choke out. Corrin's eyebrows raised up and a new, more... lustful glint entered her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love my feet? ooohhh, that must be why this little guy's coming out to play\" She cackled, taking her sole and slowly pulling it across the bulge in your trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou solumnly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, this isn't much of a good dare, is it? you enjoy doing it, so it's not a good dare, that's how it is, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart froze. Would she do something else to you instead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I know. We'll keep this game going, but... we'll change it up a bit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin gestured you to come closer, which you obliged. You weren't in an arguing position at this point. She placed her feet on to your face and pushed you down flat on to your back. She brought her feet back over to your groin. Between her feet you could see the bulge in full mast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's how it will go... you're going to answer Truth or Dare... then I get to do something to you! After each time, I'm going to let you place a nice few kisses on my feet, like this\" Corrin explained. She took her soles and placed them back on to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed kisses on to her feet. Each one seemingly making your whole body jitter with joy. Your master flicked about in the air, your arms and legs could barely stay still. You fought the urge to grab her feet and ram them into your face and mouth and managed to outlast it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a passionate servant! you look so ready to play these games and that's great!\" She wiggled her toes. \"If you wiggle around <i>too</i> much, though... might have to do something about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! and one last thing before we start... if you<i> lie on a truth</i>... you get a <i>punishment</i>\" Her eyes seemed to light up with glee upon the utterance of that final word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what kind of punishment?\" You asked beneath her soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, nothing much, a kick to the balls, some time unable to get your little man up... anything, really\" She explained nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she wasn't joking at this point. She'd gone this far, there was no way she wouldn't keep to her word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then! what will it be... truth? ...or dare?\"</span></div></div>",

Corrin accepted her wants, and was more than happy to accommodate, it appeared. She truly was a wonderful wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each suck, and each lick, her affection for her love's feet grew. The heat in her body caused her to trance her hand down to a source of wetness. Her hand was quickly batted away by Corrin's free foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I'll be letting you do that, you naughty little footslave\" Corrin teased with a wink. \"If you aren't sucking a foot, you'd better be massaging the other\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura nodded, with a level of contempt in a small grunt. She NEEDED that release. It was like pure torture... it wasn't like anything but Corrin was stopping her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, she continued to obediently sniff, lick and massage Corrin's soles, taking two other times to attempt to reach down and satisfy her craving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azura...! tsk, tsk, control yourself!\" Corrin teased. \"Or do I need to find a way to stop you?\" She asked with a giggle. \"I may have to punish you if you do it again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words set Azura's heart ablaze.

Yes you did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want me to punish you, hm? what do you say to that?\" Corrin got up in Azura's face, foreheads touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! yes I do...!\" Azura shot back with a reply. Corrin smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin began by tying her arms behind her back. it was a temporary solution, she mentioned. She DID enjoy the massage portion of it, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get this on you...\" Corrin purred, taking out a steel Chastity Belt, with a matching bra that seemed just right for Azura. Azura offered no resistance, letting herself be locked up. It was a dream of hers. Her arms were then untied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... let's see what this magic spell can do...\" Corrin said, propping her feet up in clear vision of Azura. She held out her arm and cast a spell, and suddenly... Azura's sexual organs felt as if they were on fire. She so desperately wanted to touch them... she clawed at the panel between her and her vagina, tried to tear off the bra, but it all held. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go...! no more of that for you!\" Corrin teased. \"Awww, is my little footslave wife too hot and bothered?\" She mocked, pulling Azura to the floor, resting her soles on top of her. \"You're my footstool now, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura stood on all fours, her mouth dripping and her libido in overdrive. \"Yes! yes, I understand!\" She yelled sensually, her voice filled with lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin smacked her with a foot. Not seriously, but still enough to cause mild discomfort. This remained simple play, after all. \"A footstool doesn't talk back! do I have to also gag that mouth of yours?!\" Corrin looked down, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what kind of things I could do to you... so many things, I'm sure...\"</span></div></div>",

Corrin laid on top of her, Azura preparing for what her wife had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started simple. Corrin simply sat on top of her, having her worship her soles. This was just as wonderful as before, as now, the wonderful form of her wife was also on full display. This worship only continued to increase in its intensity, until Azura's tongue seemed to move almost automatically between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Corrin snuggled up next to her wife, silently breathing into her ear as she slowly tapped at the caged area with her foot. The sound of her wet foot slamming against her chastity cage was intoxicating, and frustrating, at the same time. Her face was red with arousal as Corrin brought a manicured hand to her breasts, toying with them as best as she could.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was early evening in Nohr when the royal family had returned from a long, arduous day of battle, all spearheaded by their general/adopted brother, Corrin (Yes it\u2019s gonna be the male one in this story, sue me). All headed back inside the grand palace of Nohr after all the hardships of the, the family was completely exhausted, with only just enough energy for some idle chit-chat.  \u201cGreat work out there on the battlefield, Corrin!\u201d The eldest brother Xander said, patting the general on his back as they all walked towards the lounging area for some well deserved rest. \u201cTh-thank you brother\u2026\u201d Corrin responded, happy to have some form of encouragement. \u201cI suppose your tactics were\u2026 acceptable today, although you could very easily improve\u201d Leo added in, dampening Corrins mood. However soon after saying his comments, Leo was met with a swift slap to the back of his head by the youngest and most cheerful of the family, Elise. \u201cLeeeeeo! Come on, it was good victory, no need to get all meanie on us!\u201d The young princess exclaimed \u201cIt\u2019s called criticism Elise\u2026\u201d Leo scoffed. \u201cWell I for one agree with Elise\u2026\u201d Another voice chimed in. \u201cIt\u2019s not very nice to pick on our poor, sweet baby brother\u201d The eldest sister Camilla continued. These remarks resulted in quite a bit of bickering as the weary family walked through the cold, dark halls. Their arguing went on for a while, until Xander decided he was tired of listening to it all and shouted out a hearty \u201cENOUGH! Quiet, all of you, there\u2019s no need for this! Besides, we\u2019ve arrived\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder prince pushed open the grand oak doors to reveal one of the many rooftop garden lounges of the palace, complete with chairs and couches for every one of them to get their well deserved rest. Each of them eagerly went to a seat to finally get a break from running and standing, quickly removing all the heavy armour and weaponry they all had attached to them. Corrin let out a deep sigh of relief as he finally sat down in his favourite chair in the whole castle, able to at last take a break after all the fighting. Corrin closed his eyes, swiveled in his chair and took in a deep breath of what he assumed would be fresh air, only for his senses to suddenly be overcome with a thick, dank and cheesy smell more powerful than anything he had smelled before. The dragon prince\u2019s eyes shot open only for him to be face to face with a pair of stunning bare feet, immediately taking in every small detail from the cute toes with purple painted nails, the smooth, sweaty soles and the high arches. \u201cOh i\u2019m so sorry darling! Let me move those things out of the way for you sweetie!\u201d Camilla said. Her feet had been propped up on the end of the couch right next to Corrins chair, so she moved them to the ground. Although even after she brought them down, Corrin\u2019s gaze was completely fixed on them, and he didn\u2019t know why, there was just something about them. The simple scent was able to get his lower area active, a feeling while not entirely new, was still very foreign to the prince who had been sheltered for the majority of his life. \u201cTerribly sorry dearie!\u201d Camillas voice broke his trance \u201cThere was so much running today, I just had to get my shoes off to relax\u2026\u201d The princess said. \u201cUh...mhm...yeah\u2026\u201d Corrin responded, completely distracted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much later, after a bit of chatter between the royals, Corrin remaining completely silent unless addressed, trying to sneak peeks at Camillas feet when nobody was looking, Camilla stood up and stretched her arms upwards, allowing her large breasts to jiggle. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d she began \u201cI think i\u2019m going to go off to the hotsprings, any of you can feel free to join me, especially you Corrin\u201d She said with a wink. \u201cUm yeah\u2026\u201d the prince said. Camilla then went off, absentmindedly leaving her shoes behind, walking down the stone corridor barefoot. Corrin was extremely flustered at this point, contemplating if he should follow her or not, wanting to know more about this weird fascination of his, yet at the same time not wanting to make a fool of himself in front of everyone. Corrin decides to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon, Corrin got up out of his chair and decided to head off to his room \u201cWell, um, I\u2019m just going to head off to bed now!\u201d Corrin muttered flusteredly, trying to hide his erection. \u201cUh, alright big bro\u2026 sweet\u2026 dreams!\u201d Elise called out from her own resting chair, falling asleep herself in the process. Both Xander and Leo simply gave a wave, too tired to even pay attention. Realizing that nobody was paying him any notice, the dragon princes attention indiscreetly shifted towards Camilla\u2019s discarded boots. They still looked warm and he could just barely smell their permeating scent from where he was standing. Without even thinking about it, Corrin quickly grabbed the shoes unnoticed and ran back to his room, quickly going in and locking the door behind him. He gave a sigh of relief that he had avoided embarrassment and looked towards the shoes in his hands, contemplating what he just did. \u201cWhat am I doing!\u201d Corrin yelled aloud as he threw the shoes to the stone floor. \u201cThese being to my own sister! Her old shoes no less and yet here I am stealing them for my own sick twisted pleasure!\u201d The prince argued to himself. \u201cI should return these at once, this is disgusting and perverted!\u201d The prince thought to himself. \u201cAnd yet\u2026.. \u201c His attention shifted back to the shoes as he picked one back up\u201cI feel such a powerful draw to them\u201d. He went on, bringing the shoe up to his face. Then, without realizing it, Corrin took in a deep sniff, breathing in as much of the musky air as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir scent alone was enough to make Corrins erection spring back up almost immediately, to him, it was more heavenly then any scent of flower or food ever could be. He stood there for a few seconds, simply basking in the shoe\u2019s warm scent, thinking about Camilla. \u201cOh baby brother, come here, your big sister needs some pampering ~\u201d He fantasized in his head, \u201cThats a good boy, now get on your knees and lick ~\u201d Corrin didn\u2019t even notice that he had stuck his tongue out and had almost gotten it on the insole. The prince stopped himself before that, not quite being comfortable with this new fascination he had acquired, instead he picked up the other shoe, wentover to his bed and placed them underneath it. \u201cAs much as I enjoy it, perhaps I am getting too far ahead of myself.\u201d He thought \u201cI\u2019ll sort this whole thing out tomorrow\u201d. And just like that Corrin crawled into bed and drifted off to sleep, thinking thoughts of nothing but his sisters goddess-like feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Corrin woke up very groggily and tire, opposite of his usual energetic awakenings. He felt completely sapped of a well rest for seemingly no reason. Everything around him looked the same, he didn\u2019t remember waking up, his body felt mostly normal except for\u2026 \u201cOh no, please tell me I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Corrin frantically pulled away his sheets and blanket to look underneath them, only to find exactly what he had hoped wouldn\u2019t be there. Down below he saw his now flaccid cock out, dried cum and now much farther down the bed, one of Camilla\u2019s shoes. \u201cOh no no no no no no no no! How am I ever going to explain this to her!\u201d The prince thought in a panic as he picked up the shoe, stained from a wet dream. \u201cWhat am I going to do with this???\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The cum gave way, little by little, but it would take an incredibly long time to get it all off. It was obvious to him now how much he must have enjoyed it. The Boot's musky scent, the soft texture. Thinking about it, and the foot it belonged on, aroused him slightly, and made him calm down, ever so slightly. He even tentatively stroked his still-exposed penis, but was able to snap himself out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he gave up, and tossed the boot aside in frustration, the boot landing at the floor with a loud thud that echoed through the floorboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin then heard footsteps.

His goddess, in all her glory, simply smirked and continued, goading him on with insults and words that only made Corrin want to go further. She had him wrapped around her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Camilla forcefully tore the foot away from him, and slammed it into his stomach, causing him to fall to the floor, his cock being the only thing standing now.  With a forceful push, she pressed his cock back her her saliva covered feet and stepped over him, her wonderful legs looking to swallow him whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her feet danced around his penis, Camilla's large and powerful body surged over him, her legs binding his arms to his sides, and his face enveloped by her voluptuous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't struggle now, dear. You'll love what I have in store...\" She soothingly whispered to him. Corrin couldn't fight this hold even if he wanted to, and so, he resigned to his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke, he found himself tightly bound to his own bed, still naked, as before. The binds felt... good, and comfortable, but stayed firm as any other. His penis still stood at attention. He was clearly still enjoying himself, despite the odd situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Camilla came striding in, still in all her regular attire. \"Sleep well, dear?\" She asked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... Yes, Mistress\" He replied weakly. Camilla smiled deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good... I'm glad the binds weren't uncomfortable, darling. While my distaste for your lack of dominance is there... I believe this can be just as wonderful\" She walked over in a menacing, but erotic, fashion. Hips swaying, her bewitching beauty clear for him to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see this little boy is quite happy to see me\" She purred, tickling his penis with a long finger. It flopped around at the contact, the sensitivity of his penis still ever present.<br>\r\n\"And he's a lively one, too! Awww, but won't it be a shame, you won't be having fun today, my darling little boy!\" She giggled, patting it gently with her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her other hand, she slowly peeled off her boot, tossing it aside, doing the same to the other right after. \"Now, my darling... show me how much you love you mistress\" She seductively purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin wasted no time in licking at her feet. Her feet were just as wonderful as before, their taste unforgettable. The lush scent of her feet filled his nostrils and caused him to salivate even more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla rested Corrin's penis between her thighs, and it felt like heaven. Two soft, pillowy thighs belonging to a powerful woman like her curled around his manhood made him ever so aroused. He was ready to cum just from the texture and feel alone, but Camilla gave him a quick warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I see aaaany cum on my legs by the time we are done, mister, I will have to train you like a regular slave, now won't I?\" She tease, a finger gingerly placed on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the time, Camilla rested her perfect feet on Corrin's face. This beautiful woman rubbed her large feet into his face, and all he could do was accept it. She laughed at his torment wickedly, ever so happy to see him like this, it appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she let her feet away from his face, and looked down at her thighs. \"Remember what I said, darling?\" Camilla asked sweetly. \"If you did anything naughty, I will train you like a real slave: Chains, Chastity and all!\" She cackled, parting her thighs, revealing...</span></div></div>",

You've been naughty, and now I will have to show you why you are not naughty\" She said. Again, just as before, Camilla smothers Corrin with her breasts, incapacitating him. When he woke up, he was now on the floor, with bound arms and ankles, with an odd metal device around his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Darling... let me show you how it's done\" She kicks Corrin, sending him onto his back, his legs spreading out to show his chastity cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That there will prevent any naughty things, and if I still see naughty things, it will only get worse\" Camilla instructed, gently teasing it with her foot, causing a shot of pain to enter Corrin's groin. He could not longer get hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over to the chair\" She commanded, snapping her fingers. Corrin pathetically made his way to the chair, clambering as Camilla watched with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her reached the chair, he was bound to it with chains, his head resting on the seat. \"Don't mind if I take a seat, darling\" She giggled as she sent her large ass down on Corrin's face. Corrin moaned up it, his cage flopped around, unable to truly get hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a naughty boy...\" She shook her head, toying with his cage with a boot. Corrin could barely stand this sheer pleasure he got as her ass sat on top of him as she toyed with his caged cock. Despite it being in chastity, he could still feel every sensation, and that was what really frustrated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla rose up to make sure he wouldn't pass out every now and again. She wanted him to be awake the entire time, of course.Using his face as a cushion, Corrin was in heaven, he was ever so tempted to just start licking at her thick ass, but resisted  the urge, as she had not instructed him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued on until...</span></div></div>",

I won't lie and say I don't have fantasies but I am still your brother and a prince.  I won't be reduced to a worm at your feet.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla grinned. \"My sweet sweet Corrin.  Putting on such a brave face but all the while being governed by fear.  You're scared me and instead of your manhood wilting its as hard as a diamond. Isn't it!?\"  As she spoke she grabbed at Corrin's manhood feeling his hardness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin tried to step back but Camilla tightened her grip and pulled him close.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how weak you are my sweetling.

You want to follow, you want to obey, you want to <b>serve</b>.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young prince let out a low moan.

He wanted to serve but for a time, not a as a permanent condition!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't submit to you like that Camilla.  You ask too much.  I apologize for... AAAGH.\"  Corrin let out a cry as Camilla re-positioned her grip from his cock to his balls.  She had squeezed sending a wave of pain through his balls.  The pain was enough to send him to  his knees.  Camilla released her hold on his balls and pulled on his hair so he was forced to look up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrin my darling boy, you aren't being given a choice. I will break you.  You are mine, now cease your pathetic resistance and worship my feet before I grow irritated with you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin felt the strength in Camilla's grip.

For as long as you could remember, you were locked away in this fortress, only visited by your Sisters, Camilla and Elise, and your brothers, Xander and Leo. The 5 of you were as close as close could be, you could share anything with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... almost anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as long as you could remember you were utterly enamoured with your oldest sister's feet. Camilla was a beauty unlike any other, with incredible feminine features, but what struck you most was her dominant, almost possessive, demeanour. She would keep you coddled in her arms for ages, rest your head upon her lap, and so on, but it was her feet that you truly loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet were large, meaty, like great slabs of meat waiting to be savoured. Her feet were well-cared for and her teasing gaze and smilky smooth voice only wanted you to go further with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recall, one night, you snuck off with her shoes, and had the greatest time of your life licking, smelling and having fun with them. You, in a forbidden sense, wanted to see Camilla look down at you with a disgusted, cold, stare and instruct you around. You wanted to be her very own slave, not an equal to her. That was your deepest, most forbidden desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the time would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla came alone to the Fortress one night. It was a pleasant visit, she coddled you just as she did when you were children, and you couldn't be happier for it. You were enamoured with her whole being, not just her feet, after all. The quick shift from kindness to malice was both shocking and arousing to you, and so dearly wished to see that malefic gaze turned at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the night, Camilla petted your head as you rested on her lap. She had taken off her clothes for the night, now only in her nightwear. You were much the same. You were calm but not settled. You couldn't help but continue to fantasise as her beautiful toes painted with purple varnish sat there in front of you, mocking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, dear?\" Camilla asked sweetly. You looked up quickly with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, Camilla! I was just... uhh...\" You stammer. Camilla smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see these wonderful toenails of mine?\" She asked, wiggling her toes. \"They are rather beautiful, aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... really beautiful\" You asked, face hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look on edge, my darling... what's the problem? come on, big sis will help you\" She caringly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... couldn't\" You reply, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I can, darling. Anything you want, I can do, and if I can't... I'll find a way, just for my little sister\" She said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... then...\" You glanced around, not sure what to say. \"Camilla, I love your feet! I've loved them forever! please, let me-\" You were interrupted by a finger to your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, I see, darling... I see\" She smiled, but there seemed to be a dominating aura in her eyes now. You felt yourself become weak in her presence. \"In that case, go down on the floor. I'll satisfy you tonight\" She smirked, though it seemed quite evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body now on the floor, you brushed your hair out of the way, ready to receive her feet. Camilla brought one of her feet down, resting on your breasts. \"I'm so happy you were honest with me, darling...

You were so excited and aroused, all too ready to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... yes mistress!\" You reply happily as you lick at her feet with vigor. Her feet were just as you imagined. Absolutely perfect, soft in all the right places, with so much space for you to lick. Her toes were so wonderful to suck, her soles so wonderful to lick. You were in complete euphoria, almost drunk on her feet alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla coldly pulled away at your night gown, making you naked.

You're loving pleasuring yourself, it seems. You seem oh so eager to do that, but... what if I just... locked you up?\" She asked, dangling the chastity devices in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... would love that, Mistress! please, lock this naughty girl away!\" You reply, heavily drunk on the heat of the moment. Camilla's wicked smile widened. \"As you wish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla dragged you to you feet by your long hair, forcefully separating your legs with hers. \"Now, now, naughty girl. You can't resist, can you?\" She asked. You put up an act of resistance, all for her to treat you worse and worse. You wanted everything that Camilla had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attached the Chastity device without issue, then bound your wrists behind you, your tongue lolling like a dog's. The silver chastity devices were beautiufl, and with your armour, you could hide them. None would be the wiser this is what you and Camilla were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhm... come on, slave, keep worshipping!\" She commanded. You obediently lapped at her feet like a gracious dog. With your wrists bound, you couldn't bring your fingers to your vagina to relieve yourself, causing untold frustration. Of course, even if you could, you'd just be blocked by that new Chastity Cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's enough for today, darling\" She said, returning from her sadistic self. You sighed, seeing that playtime was over. \"But don't think I'm removing those. No, not even the binds. you'll be like this aaaall day, tomorrow, and I assure you... it will be hell by day 3 of no orgasm, for you\" She winked, throwing you off the floor into your bed. She tossed her boots, which she cast off earlier, on to the bed alongside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be with you in spirit tonight... or perhaps in boot spirit?\" She chuckled. \"Night night, darling... slave\" She tacked on with a giggle.</span></div></div>",

She seemed to be in perfect condition, her Maid clothes were fine. You found yourself... oddly gravitated to the heels she wore, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... is there a problem?\" She asked ditzily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap! She saw you staring, best make an excuse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahaha... yes, I think I see a small issue, is all\" You explain as you walk over to Felicia, still sat on the floor.

That couldn't have been an accident, I'm sure\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... if you insist\"  She says, taking her foot and holding it in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot was wrought with ache and strain, you couldn't believe it. You slowly kneaded at her foot like it was dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... what are you doing?\" She asked, both amazed and somewhat relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A simple massage... your feet seem in quite bad shape, though a Hall with broken plates is nowhere to just do a full foot massage. Once we clean these up, let's get to your room and begin properly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia just nodded her head slowly, getting up. \"Right! let's get to work!\" She announced with zeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two of you finish and you head into Felicia's room.

Whilst not as much as your Lady Corrin's, they were still quite nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it...\" Flora looked on with a smile. \"Know your place\" Flora then took one of her boots and tossed it awaym followed by the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just sit there. Continue. Clean the inside\" She demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your tongue and begin to lick at the inside of the boot. Unlike the outside, it was quite warm and sweaty, just as you liked it. This taste was incredible, and your arousal only grew more and more as you continued to lick at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhm... good\" She smiled, now extending a foot. \"Now then...\"</span></div></div>",

Once you finished kissing her soft foot, you slowly take your tongue out and rub it along her soles. The taste was so strong, even stronger than that of the boots. It was a taste you loved as you kneeled there, savoring every bit of sweat and dirt that resided on her pretty feet. After minutes of licking, making sure you licked all over her sole and even inbetween the toes you reach forward towards her other foot looking up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, my how low you have sunk, to be on the floor licking at my dirty feet.\" Flora laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same sensations came again with worshiping her other foot and you made sure to do a thorough job, licking the sweat and dust away, savouring the scent until eventually Flora pulled her foot away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have things to do, places to be.

Selena responded with a swift kick to your face, only it felt rather soft and damp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally noticed that Selena had taken off her long boots, revealing her long tights. They stopped just where her foot met her ankle, and had a stirrup that looped around her foot. Upon gazing at the foot, your arousal seemed to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huh? what's that down there, loser?\" She asked, stomping down on you penis, causing you to grunt int pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get hard! there's a job to do, you know?\" She said in an almost sickeningly sweet way.

They carried a beatifully stuffy scent, not irratating but not a traditional form of beauty to them. You couldn't help but be entranced as you lapped at her boot leather, taking in eat and every little taste of sweaty leather. The pleasure this brought you was both embarassing and arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah... here\" She finally said, smacking her foot into your face. \"Lick it, you nasty perv...\" She muttered, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as your current master asked, licking every inch of her foot.

Her long purple locks trailed down from her head down to her lower back. She dressed in black, and had a set of clothes that let very little to the imagination, when it came to the important areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it was true...\" Camilla looked on, a little surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!

That's basically what you are at this point\" Selena began. She wasn't quite wrong, you knew in your mind. \"We're going to have some fun today. Hope you're ready\"  Selena untied you completely. Camilla stood behind you to grab you if you ran away. There was no resistance against these two powerful women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off...\" She spoke, first pulling out a leather leash. You'd seen these things used on young Wyverns for taming and leading them around, so it was no surprise for you to see one.

In a flash, you were on the floor, legs spread, revealing your dick at full mast. \"That truly pathetic thing there... needs some help\" Camilla took out a spellbook and muttered an incantation. Around your penis came a cage made of a dark grey iron. It seemed to appear and disappear as you became more or less aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's gonna make sure you don't make a mess whilst on the job, 'ya got it?\" She said, kicking your now caged penis. From this, you felt an instense feeling coming from the cage that erupted pleasure throughout your body, but felt the frustration of being unable to release properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally...\" Selena took out some expensive, exotic, red rope. Very fine, very thin, incredibly comfortable, not like what you had before. \"Just to show our appreciation to your lifetime of servitude, but don't get the wrong idea\" She said. Eventually, the only things you could do was moan, groan and move slowly due to the way you were tied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Selena, darling... let's take this out for a spin\" Camilla smirked evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena took hold of your leash and pulled you closer. \"Lick. When I say that, you lick the person who holds this leash's feet, got it?\" She hammered into your head. YOu obeyed, licking from tip to top of her long boots. They still tasted of heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But for today, we'll be the ones doing the talking\" Camilla spoke, taking a bunch of socks and tights, and shoving them into your mouth, sealing it off with another pair of tights. \"You're just a pet for today\" She lightly tapped your dick with her heel, causing the pleasurable reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the room, tugging you along. The humiliation was intense, with the many people looking on in confusion or bewilderment. You had never felt so aroused. You were instructed by Camilla and Selena to nuzzle close to their legs, which you did, you felt the creamy thighs of Selena and Camilla against your cheeks every once and a while, and occassionally they stopped to turn around to tease your now caged penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after almost 2 hours of this...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another day, another failure. To be honest she shouldn't have even felt as down as she did considering this was nothing new. After years of constant failings to remove her curse, Nyx should've been able to brush this latest one off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately that wasn't to be the case this time around. In the past it had been just her and there was nothing to really lose if she failed. But things were different now, times had changed. She had a husband, a daughter, and a kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas in the past she had nothing, now she had everything. Now more than ever she had to break her curse, because if she didn't everyone around her would eventually grow old and die while she remained the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime had no effect on her. She was ageless. She wanted to be able to grow old alongside her beloved and die with him, not remain in the world while his spirit moved on. Add to that she would have to bury her daughter too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youthful dark mage shook her head to banish the negative thoughts creeping up in the back of her mind. She wouldn't give in to despair. She would find a solution to this... she had to. It just wouldn't be tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind the ravenette sighed. Maybe some rest would do her some good. Anything to take her mind off the dark thoughts plaguing her. She took a seat on her and her husband's shared bed and began to lie back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could dose off though, the sound of double doors creaked open. Entering was none other than her husband Corrin from a long day of dealing with advisors and his own family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the war everything had quieted down but become a lot more hectic at home, what with all the reconstruction and ascending the throne. He hardly got any free time these days. However it looks like he might've just got some if his smile was anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still awake?\" He asked before entering their private quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Nyx replied as she met his gaze. He took a seat by the edge of the bed and took not of the magic tools on the floor. He frowned slightly but covered it quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I take it you tried again today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" she sighed. \"And before you ask, no, I failed again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snow-haired man did his best to give his wife a reassuring smile. \"I know you'll eventually get it right if you just keep at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" said the dark mage, although she didn't sound very convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin knew she was really feeling down now. Normally she was so calm and composed, but today was one of those rare days where her true feelings showed. He needed to do something to take her mind off things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at her eternally youthful visage until an idea came to mind. Nyx didn't know what he was up to as she'd taken to looking up at the ceiling, but a sudden pleasurable sensation by her feet caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down she could see her husband gently giving her a massage. He certainly hadn't done that in a while. \"What are you doing?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking your mind off things.\" he answered without missing a beat. \"It has been some time since I could give you my undivided attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently squeezed and she felt a jolt run down her spine. That felt nice. \"I guess it has been a fortnight hasn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"Indeed it has. Do you mind if I put your mind and body at ease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time tonight the elder woman smiled. \"Not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
