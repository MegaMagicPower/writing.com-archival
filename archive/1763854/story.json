Candy bar wrappers and empty potato-chip bags surrounded him. Tom stared without signs of conscious thought at the television screen as he mechanically grabbed another handful of chips and stuffed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had been going on for two weeks now. Tom had just recently graduated high school and was spending his summer in a near vegetative state. You see the day following graduation, Tom's high school sweetheart, Amber, ended their two year long relationship. Needless to say, Tom was depressed. He now sat wallowing in his own filth, without bathing or changing his clothes for two weeks. His parents had been out of town during this time and weren't due back until the end of June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn high school, Tom was the star football player. He was always the muscular type and had now grown to be 6' 2\". Tom's arms and thighs were like tree trunks his senior year. His abs were once flawlessly sculpted. Though after several weeks of chilling, they began to fade a little. Overall, Tom was a big guy. Tom had short brown hair that he normally spiked and pale blue eyes. His family wasn't super rich, but they were well off and could usually afford nicer things. Thus, Tom didn't have to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's semi-conscious state was broken by his cell phone ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy boy! It's me, Eric! How the hell are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince middle school, Tom and Eric had been best friends. Eric was 6' 7\" and thin as a pole. He had never been the sporty type like Tom. In fact, the only thing the two ever really had in common was their massive appetites. They spent a good portion of their time together at a local diner. Eric, having always been skinny, could eat the way he did and still be lazy without gaining a pound. Tom on the other hand had to diligently workout to keep the pounds off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! I haven't seen you in weeks,\" Tom exclaimed, \"How was France?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was awesome man. I got back last week,\" Eric said, \"I asked around for you and everyone said that you were locked away in your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sat silently for a little bit, \"Yeah, this whole Amber thing has really hit me hard. Plus, it's summer, I can veg for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon dude, she's just a chick. There are plenty more fish in the see,\" Eric says trying to comfort, \"Hey! I know what will lift your spirits, a nice burger feast at Jimmy's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on big guy. I know you can't say to Jimmy's 1 pound special,\" Eric continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright,\" Tom agreed finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the Diner...</span></div></div>",

The diner was an old fashioned looking restaurant, complete with black and white checkered floor, 50's style posters, neon signs, and a jukebox. The diner had always been Tom and Eric's main hangout spot. They had basically grown up in the diner. There weren't many people in there at the time. Tom scanned the seats, looking fro Eric. At the bar was a tall, lanky boy. He had long and shaggy blonde hair with green eyes. He wore a green hoody and tan cargo shorts that were both too big for him. His face was long and clean shaven. He had on of his ears pierced. Eric sat smiling and waving at Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are man,\" Eric greeted with a massive grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom walked over and the two embrace with all their strength, \"Long time no see man. How was Europe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was awesome man. I've learned so many new recipes,\" Eric said. Eric had always been good at cooking and loved experimenting with new recipes, \"You'll have to taste my new recipes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New recipes?\" A man came out from the kitchen. He was old and balding. He had a big potbelly wore a white apron. He joined in the conversation smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jimmy,\" Tom greeted. Jimmy was the owner of the restaurant and had watched the two boys grow from elementary school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's certainly been a while since I've seen you two. The Diner has been slow without my two best customers,\" Jimmy said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Jimmy,\" Tom laughingly blushed, \"With graduation and everything, I haven't had much time to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've been in France for the past couple weeks,\" Eric added, \"I was just telling Tom that he needs to try some of the recipes that I learned while in France.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you've always been an aspiring cook,\" Jimmy winked, \"I could use you in the Diner. You could give a new international vibe to the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric laughed, \"That would be great. I'll have to let you try my food after I test it on Tom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely man,\" Tom began to salivate, \"I've always loved your cooking. I haven't had a really good meal in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it doesn't show dude,\" Eric said laughing and pinching a fat roll on Tom's belly, \"It looks like you've eating quite well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom blushed a little but laughed it off, \"Yeah man, it's been a while since I've had a good work out. Tomorrow I'm going to get back into my old routine and try to shed some pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on man, it's summer. You just need to relax,\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, just because you can eat whatever you want and not move while keeping slim, doesn't mean everyone can,\" Tom said, lifting up Eric's shirt to count his ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever man. However, you will join me in a burger bash will you not?\" Eric said, referring to an eating contest that would typically have at the Diner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course man,\" Tom smiled, \"I have to keep my place has burger champion don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we'll see about that,\" Eric rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Jimmy, we'll have our usual burger bash,\" Tom announced, \"So keep the burger's coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how I've missed you guys,\" Jimmy laughed, \"You guys bring in the most of my profit. So that's one burger bash coming up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feast began. The first burgers came out. They weighed at a whopping one pound. It was routine for the boys to put away eight pounds of burger at a sitting. The two had developed the fine art of unlatching their jaws to consume the burgers in only a few bites. The contest of gluttony continued. They had gotten to their twelfth burger, still showing no sign's of pain or being full. Tom's stomach swelled like a balloon. It was their sixteenth burger, Tom quickly horked it down and then noticed that Eric had only eaten half of it. Eric fell to the floor in defeat. Tom had one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, who da man?\" Tom said to begin his gloating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You (Burp) da man..\" Eric said with resent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good God boys,\" Jimmy said with astonishment, \"I've never seen you pack away sixteen burgers. That's a new record.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom smiled with triumph, \"I think I'll have a victory milk shake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.</span></div></div>",

Stripped down and completely nude, he looked at his body in the mirror. The sculpted body, he once admired was not there. His six pack was now replace by a bulging gut. Tom looked down at his newly accumulated flab and played with it mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn I've gotten fat,\" Tom said with certain disgust, \"Well today I start back at the gym and hopefully I can lose this by summer's end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom made it to the gym and walked in. The gym was full in the early. Clanks of bar bells and other weights could be sounded throughout the gym. Tom stepped up on the treadmill and started to run. A few minutes later, Tom stopped and found himself out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm out of shape,\" Tom said to himself, \"Ok, I'll skip the cardio today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over the weights and started to lift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tommy!\" Tom looked over and saw Troy, the football running back from high school. He had short blonde hair and was only 5' 5\". However, he still had a ripped body. The two had been pretty goods friends on the football team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man. What's happening?\" Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, not much. I just got a sports scholarship to FCU,\" Troy said with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice man,\" Tom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see you've been taking it easy over the summer,\" Troy laughed and patted Tom's stomach, \"Come on man, you can't let this whole Amber thing turn you into a blob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was very taken back by this and his face turned a deep red, \"I know man. I'm trying to workout and get back in my old routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta boy,\" Troy said, smacking Tom's belly. Troy left to hit the showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was left and did a few more weight lifting and started to feel hungry and left the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom headed to Eric's house. His stomach was roaring with hunger. He steps up the door of Eric's house and rings the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, come on in,\" Eric said as he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom walks into the kitchen. There was a table covered in about twenty plates of delicious food. Tom gazed with wonder and salivation at the many courses of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're awesome,\" Eric said, not taking his eyes of the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric laughed and set a place at the table for Tom. Tom sat down and the feast began. Each plate placed before him was quickly devoured and licked clean. The twenty plates were cleared in no time. Tom was left surrounded by the wake of his destruction. His belly was bloated to twice as big as it was before. He sat there massaging his engorged belly. Tom let out a massive belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude (burp), that was amazing,\" Tom said with amazing contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd like that,\" Eric laughed, \"I also made cheesecake for dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's eyes lit up, \"Bring it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom devoured the entire cheesecake in no time. He passed out in a contented food coma on Eric's couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy big boy,\" Eric said as he patted his bloated friends big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom woke up and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Consciousness slowly regained as Tom woke up. The blur of where he was came into focus as he realized that he was still at Eric's house. He sat up and looked down at his stomach. He stomach was now a rounded and soft belly. He rubbed it a little and watched it jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Eric said as he walked in, \"I thought you'd never wake up. Come on there's a party happening at Andy's place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, still adjusting to reality, nods and the two head off. They reach the party place. The music was booming and the lights were flashing. The place was packed with kids from their high school. A big guy, wide as he was tall, came out. He had darker skin and short, spiky, brown hair. He was wearing all white and purple glasses. He wore a goatee that helped distinguish his face from his neck (but not much).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'up guys. Welcome to my party,\" Andy said, greeting Tom and Eric. They had known Andy since eighth grade. He had always been a big guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Andy,\" the two boys said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tommy,\" Andy directed towards Tom, \"Haven't seen you since graduation. Barely recognized you with this thing.\" he pointed towards his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom rolled his eyes, a little annoyed by all the attention his gut was now getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you man,\" Andy added with a chuckle, \"Joining the fat guy club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom didn't know how to take this. He mainly laughed it off, \"Yeah man, I guess with my big appetite, I need a belly to truly show it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit,\" Andy said, patting is own rounded girth, \"There's plenty of food here. Enjoy yourselves. I'm going to go see if Amber needs any company. Catch you guys later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom lunged after him with hate in his eyes. Eric quickly grabbed him to hold his fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let it go man. We're here to enjoy are selves,\" Eric said with his usual rational cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot how much I hated that guy,\" Tom fumed and began to mimic him, \"'Welcome to the fat club,' What a jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just,\" Eric began, quickly forgetting what he was going to say, \"Andy...Anyway let's grab some beers and some food and try to enjoy ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Tom said, still ticked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party continued and boys primarily stood by the food stable, stuffing their faces and drank beer after beer. Tom was most tired of having people comment on his weight. So, he tried to avoid conversations. People gossiped about the fat guy at the bar, how Tom had let himself go, and of course the whole break up. Tom could easily hear the whispers but chose to ignore them. With a few more beers in him, Tom started to loosen up. Tom then challenged Andy to eating competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Andy!\" an obviously drunk Tom shouted across the room, \"Yeah, I'm in the fat club and you know what I like it man. So how about an eat off, fatty vs. fat ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room went silent. Nobody really knew what to make of this. Andy stared in shock for a little bit. Being a good party host, he agreed. The two sat down at the table and began the feast. Eric, being a good friend and of course long time eating competitor of Tom, cheered him on. The remaining 20 pizzas were consumed in no time. thirteen were eaten by Tom, and the remaining seven were eaten by Andy. Tom had won but he was far from done. He continued to hork down the remaining party foods and then chugged a keg. Some of the party members watched and cheered the glutton on. Others quickly left the party in disgust. Tom then passes out on Andy's floor, and the party ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning</span></div></div>",

The room was painted a sickening shade of salmon and was decorated with eerie dolls that all stared at him. Tom knew this was neither his room nor the last place he remembered being. As he scanned the room, still trying to rack his memory for what happened, where he was, and how he got there, his thoughts were interrupted by the fresh fragrance of:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bacon!\" Tom shouted pointing his nose in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's stomach growled and he ran to the source of the aroma. He walked into a kitchen where Eric was standing over the stove, frying bacon. He then looked and saw the table completely covered in crepes, eggs, muffins, pastries, bacons, ham, sausages, and scones. His mouth instantly dropped and drooled a waterfall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning sleepy head,\" Eric said smiling, \"I thought you'd never wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened,\" Tom said remembering his massive headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You passed out at the party last night, dude,\" Eric said, still frying bacon, \"You were completely smashed. You challenged Andy to an eating contest and then continued to eat all the rest of the food. You were the life of the party man! I picked you up and dropped you here. I told my parents that you were just to tired to go home, so they were chill with letting you crash. Sorry you had to wake up in the creepy guest room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom sat processing the events and finally said, \"Who won the eating contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did, man!\" Eric said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Tom said with triumph, \"Let's eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom sat down and began to pack away the massive breakfast that Eric had prepared. Both of them ate and ate and ate some more. The table was then empty without a single morsel. The two boys sat contented rubbing their stomachs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(burp) You know dude, I could get used to this kind of living,\" Tom said, patting his bloated gut, \"I don't care what people say, I'm big and I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah man?\" Eric said, rubbing the tiny bulge in his midsection that said he was full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I mean why not? I've spent the past five years perfecting my body,\" Tom said with growing confidence, \"I deserve a break to do whatever the hell I want, and I'm going to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the summer spirit dude,\" Eric said grinning from ear to ear, \"What do you want to do now?\"</span></div></div>",

The waves crashed against the shore and the seagulls cawed as they always do. The two boys sat and did what they do best: eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom took off his shirt and officially revealed the chunky body that was kept inside. His belly was round and flabby. Rolls of fat were plainly seen when he sat. His chest had gotten a little softer and man boobs were developing. Eric gazed at the amount of fleshy flab. Eric too took off his shirt only to show that he was still as bone thin as ever. Eric still could not take his eyes off tom as he rubbed sun screen on his massive body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, do you mind getting my back?\" Eric was at first shocked by what he said then realized what he meant and laughed it off, \"Sure dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric lathered his hands with the lotion and rubbed and massaged Tom's broad back. He felt something strange. He liked it. He loved feeling the soft flab and massaged it with subtle vigor. He knew at that moment that he wanted Tom to get fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boner alert,\" Tom laughed and shouted, breaking Eric's train of thought, \"Who's the girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric panicked and quickly scanned the beach for an excuse. Lucky for him there was a group of girls playing volleyball, \"Over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice! Dude you should go try and get one of their numbers,\" Tom suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok bro,\" Eric said trying to smooth over the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on man. You're a high school graduate and you've never had a girl,\" Tom continued to prod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo keep a good cover, Eric agreed to go talk to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey ladies,\" Eric said with a fake confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" the girls replied looking quite uninterested in either of them. Eric was too thin and Tom was too fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom nudged Eric with his elbow to make another move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you guys want to come over and join us for lunch? We have plenty of food,\" Eric invited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the Blob over here hasn't eaten it all,\" the girls laughed with the most maniacal bitchiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey just shut up!\" Eric shouted with fury, \"Let's go Tom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked off as the girls rolled their eyes with disinterest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude I'm sorry about that,\" Eric said with a righteous fury, \"Those bitches mean nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever man,\" Tom shrugged it off, \"the next woman I find better like me the way I am and no how to cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed.</span></div></div>",

He stretched and scratched himself, grabbing some of his newly acquired flab. Tom stripped out of his boxers and sleepily sauntered to his bathroom. After his shower, he gave him self a good look in his full-length mirror. The body that was once there, that perfectly sculpted and muscular body, was now hidden layers and layers of fat. His belly had grown to be flabby and jiggly. His pectorals were now on their way to becoming full fledged man boobs. The only traces of muscle left were in his arms and legs. Although, even they showed signs of softening. His face was now fuller and rounder than before. A second chin could be seen. He scanned his body over and over in sheer amazement of his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" he whispered to himself, \"I'm a freakin' whale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom stood on top of his scale. The last time he had weighed himself was nine weeks ago in April. At that time, hi weighed 180 pounds of muscle and tone. Tom looked down at his feet, trying to suck in his gut for a better view of the number. The scale processed for a moment and then rang up 216 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! I've gained 36 pounds?\" Tom shouted in in astonishment. He flexed his arms and tried to suck in his gut, trying to regain the body he once had. It was useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cellphone buzzed. It was a text from Eric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey dude! Meet me at the diner. I have a surprise'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom quickly went to his closet and tried to put on his jeans. He struggled for a while with the button and zipper but finally got them on. His shirts that were normally kinda tight on him now rose to expose his midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to by new clothes if I keep this lifestyle up,\" Tom said gazing at himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom gets to the diner and sits down at the bar as always. He looks around and sees no sign of Eric. Jimmy comes out from the kitchen fat and jolly as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I get for ya today?\" Jimmy said with a rosy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have two pounders with extra cheese,\" Tom ordered, \"Hey have you seen Eric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's around,\" Jimmy winked and said nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed and Tom got his two massive burgers and proceeded to devour them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you enjoying those burgers?\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're excellent,\" Tom stopped and looked up to see Eric wearing an apron and hairnet, smiling from ear to ear, \"Dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know man. I work here now!\" Eric exclaimed, \"Today's my first day on the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome bra! I'm going to have to come in more often than usual knowing that you're the cook,\" Tom laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You should check out some of the new menu items we've added,\" Eric said pointing at the back of the menu, \" They are all European dishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom salivated over the menu, \"I'll have one of each.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up,\" Eric said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe courses piled on and Tom devoured in all. The other customers stared with amazement and disgust. Tom reclined on the bar with empty plates surrounding him. He rubbed his full belly and belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for cheesecake?\" Eric said as he came out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.. (burp) Maybe one slice,\" Tom said in near painful bloatedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go big boy,\" Eric said and smiled as he place the big slice of cheesecake in front of Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to make me the size of a planet if you keep cooking for me like this,\" Tom said as he gulped down the cheesecake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure am,\" Eric smiled, staring at the massive stud. </span></div></div>",

He never made it to the store to buy more forgiving jeans.  Instead he started to rely on sweatpants and gym shorts rather than fighting to fasten the uncooperative button.  He thought about making a stop at the gym every couple of days but he always ended up walking right past it, winding up on his usual stool at the diner.  <br>\r\nThe only thing getting a workout these days seemed to be his stomach.  Between Eric's  new job as a cook and his own enormous appetite, Tom was pretty sure he was eating more now than he had been at the beginning of the summer.  Lunch usually consisted of several of the different dishes that Eric was working on, and he usually needed a couple hours planted on his stool to finish everything that was placed in front of him.  By that time Eric was usually ending his shift, which was lucky for Tom since it meant he could hitch a ride in his friend's car instead of walking back.<br>\r\nDeep down, Tom realized that things were getting a little out of hand.  Ironically, the only way he knew to stifle the concerns about his growing body was to drown them out with food.  It wasn't going to make him any slimmer, but he couldn't help himself.</span></div></div>",

Eric then followed suit and took his shirt off too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah the cookies are ready!\" Eric got up and pulled the steaming pan of molten hot chocolate chip cookies. He fixed up a platter of the cookies and a tall glass of whole milk and brought them over to Tom. Tom began to salivate over the plate of delicious cookies. Without much thought, Eric fed a cookie to Tom. Tom was too drunk to thing much of it either and just sat back in bliss. Eric continued to feed Tom the cookies and ended up feeding him the entire plate. Eric was enamored with Tom's massive belly. He could not help but to rub it. He looked for Tom's reaction to the massage. His eyes were closed but he seemed to enjoy it. Eric rubbed every soft roll of fat on Tom and was completely hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them ended up passing out on the couch.

Tom's belly was no longer stretched to the limit with food, but with his best friend lying prone and sleeping, Eric is finally able to survey the progress without checking his staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom hadn't been a lineman, but if he ever wanted to play football again, it looked like that was going to be the position. His rapid gain and extremely limited cardio workouts were leaving him destined to be a human wall. If, he ever stopped being a human sofa cushion. Either way, Eric knew he'd enjoy the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric decided to put a huge breakfast together. If there was any fallout from the impromptu feeding of the night before, he knew Tom waking up to the smell of bacon and eggs would dramatically reduce it. In a shockingly short time, Eric whipped up 5 large quiches. He'd learned the basic recipe in France, but cooking it himself, and especially for Tom, had prompted some alterations. His crusts were loaded with shortening and butter, his eggs with real creme, and the whole thing piled with about twice as much bacon and cheese as any frenchman ever put in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom roused as they came out of the oven, filling the house (thankfully empty of his parents) with the wonderful smell of a homecooked breakfast. A grunted good morning was all Eric got, and expected, as his friend took a fork straight to the full pie.

Given Tom's track record, the best case scenario, and a likely one, was that Tom wouldn't remember how they'd ended the last night. But Eric had misjudged just how much Tom had drank, or been too wrapped up in watching his best friend's new and improved eating habits to think about how it got in the way of Tom's usual drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric is too nervous to take or respond to the compliment, and takes a large bite of his own quiche as an excuse to say nothing. He waits for the axe to drop, barely daring to consider that it might not, that Tom might have enjoyed it as much as he does. The future prospects of both scenarios are somehow nervewracking at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, Tom doesn't seem to expound on the issue. He just keeps eating his quiche, which Eric would normally be very carefully not staring at. He finishes the first quiche quickly, by any usual measure of time, but to Eric each bite is is painful not knowing how Tom will react, hoping that he remembers the cookies but not the belly rub, and doesn't think too much about why he woke up without a shirt on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tom gets a third of the way through his second quiche, Eric can't take it any more and decides to ask the question. Or, at least, an indirect one that may or may not indicate the real answer he's looking for. No need for unnecessary risks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have a good time last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, man.

He hadn't bothered to go home and change clothes, or even shower judging by his unkempt hair.  He had felt a bit too lazy for the long walk to the diner today so he had taken the bus instead.  Eric hadn't expected Tom to get there quite so early, but the restaurant was surprisingly empty that day and he had managed to finish most of the food that he had planned on making.  Dessert was still in the works, but it would take even Tom a decent amount of time to work through the small feast that his friend had prepared. <br>\r\n\"Hope you're ready for me bud, because I'm startin' to get hungry again.\" Tom grinned as he took his usual spot at the counter and immediately asked for a large coke and a chocolate milkshake.  \"What'cha got for me?\"<br>\r\nEric couldn't help but smile at his friend's subtly demanding nature.  Tom knew what he wanted and he knew that Eric would provide it.  It was a system that worked well for both boys.  Eric couldn't complain, especially now that he was getting so much more out of the arrangement.  <br>\r\n\"I whipped up a lasagna just for you, but we've got these potato skins laying around if you want something to get you started.\"  Eric had actually prepared the large appetizer for Tom purposefully, and he was pretty sure that Tom knew it, but they played innocent as Tom began to dig into the loaded snack.  As a last minute addition, Eric added some extra cheese and a few spices to the pan of lasagna before he carried it out to his hungry friend.<br>\r\nTo his credit, Tom didn't look the least bit surprised by the size of the meal that was placed before him.  It was somehow reassuring for Eric to see that he wasn't concerned or suspicious over being presented with personal feasts.  He had to be aware that it was unusual for one person to eat so much, so either he was okay with the idea of being stuffed regularly, or he was just more of a glutton than Eric had ever given him credit for.  He wouldn't complain either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like Tom had been serious when he said that he was feeling hungry again so soon.  He was making surprising progress as he dug into the lasagna in front of him.  Before very long he had cleared a third of the pan.  Cheese and sauce covered his chin, and his shirt was looking even more dirty and stained than ever, but Tom had more important things than neatness on his mind when he was eating.  It was about getting his fill, not looking pretty.  <br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes he paused and grabbed his cup, chugging down half of his coke and letting out a massive burp.  Without any further delay he went back to eating, steadily emptying the rest of the pan.  By now his belly was packed pretty full of food and he could feel it, but he wasn't about to stop until he had cleared the entire lasagna.  He took just long enough with each bite to savor the taste before swallowing and shoveling more into his mouth, grunting and belching occasionally in the process.  <br>\r\nFinally, he finished the rest of the food and gulped down about half of his milkshake.  He let out another raucous belch.<br>\r\n\"Dude, you always surprise me,\" Tom panted, rubbing marinara sauce into his shirt as he massaged his stuffed gut and tried to catch his breath.  \"I love having you around to feed me.\"<br>\r\nThat statement seemed like the sign that Eric had been waiting for.  He tried to think of a smooth and tactful way to raise his question, but nothing came to him.  \"Speaking of which,\" he began awkwardly before forcing himself onward, \"how much do you remember about last night?\"</span></div></div>",

He was humming cheerfully at the fact that Tom wasn't mad and that he was actually happy. Things were looking up for Eric. Now he only had to think of how to tell the big guy how he really felt. He did not expect him to reciprocate. He knew that he was a player through out high school, always dating the hottest, most popular, and, albeit, sluttiest girls. However, a boy could dream. Eric decided to put a pie in the oven for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric came out of the kitchen a little bit later will a platter of eight monster-sized cheeseburgers, a ten-piece chicken platter, and a bucket of fries. The feast was set before Tom. He still had marinara sauce around his lips and on his t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon appetite!\" Eric said with a triumphant smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's eyes lit up and he immediately started to chow down on all the food. The restaurant was completely empty and even Jimmy was out, putting Eric in charge. Eric watched the behemoth, that is Tom, devour burger by burger. He had often eaten with Tom, but normally, Eric was eating too. Eric now got to thoroughly enjoy watching Tom eat and eat and eat. His stomach slowly expanding with every swallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, buddy, do you want something? I feel like an awful pig right now,\" Tom asked, realizing that Eric was just staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine,\" Eric said simply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shrugged and continued to eat. Eric continued to watch but started to clean up the counters as not to look too intent on watching. Tom stopped eating to take a breather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Few!\" Tom said, patting his belly, \"You have out done yourself man. I don't know if I can eat all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but you must. I have dessert baking in the oven,\" Eric said playfully, \"and you can't have dessert until you've eaten everything on your plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Belch) That does sound good,\" Tom said, \"but I'm so full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let me help you,\" Eric said, seizing the moment. He draped his arms over Tom and fed him with one hand while rubbing his stomach with the other. Eric fed Tom burger after burger. Tom gave in and sat helplessly just chewing and swallowing. Eric's hands felt nice as they massaged his overstuffed belly. Tom was in ecstasy. He was perfectly content being fed by Eric, and Eric was thrilled to feed Tom. Soon the platter was gone and Tom's belly was about to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's my pie, I'll be right back, big boy,\" Eric said running back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he returned, Eric resumed feeding Tom the pie. Tom was now helpless to resist. He was so sedated by the amount of food and the soothing belly rubs from Eric. Tom just took in every bite. Once the pie was gone, Eric wrapped his arms as far as they could around Tom's massive belly. He squeezed a big fat roll on Tom and massaged in the deep layers of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that feel?\" Eric said in a hushed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels so good,\" Tom responded, completely content to just lay there being rubbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is an moment of silence.

He was eating as much as ever, only now it seemed like he was feeling bad about it.  Eric didn't know what was up, but he certainly didn't like it.  Still, he thought it best to give Tom some space.

Unless you're gonna be taking care of me,\" Tom added hopefully.<br>\r\n\"Come on man, I ain't looking for a full time job,\" Eric teased.  He began collecting the dirty dishes from the table and dropping them into the kitchen sink, giving the food in his friend's belly some time to settle.  He hadn't slouched his way through the meal, but Tom had still managed to devour the lion's share of the meal.  They had both always been big eaters, but now it looked like Tom was in a league of his own.  \"C'mon, I'll drive you.  You wanna head home and get changed first?\"<br>\r\nTom looked down at the shirt he was wearing.  Right now it was stretched pretty tight by his stuffed gut, but it would be fine once he had started digesting.  There was a stain or two on its front, telling him that table manners weren't a big part of the eating contest last night, but people probably wouldn't even notice.  <br>\r\n\"Nah, lets go while I'm still full.  They say not to shop on an empty stomach.\"<br>\r\n\"You know, I don't think it'll make that much of a difference with you,\" Eric chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we looking for buddy,\" Eric asked as they walked into the Super Wal-Mart.  It appeared that Tom had underestimated the size of his belly; it pressed up against the fabric, clearly displaying its shape.  Eric couldn't help but notice the slightest hint of flesh tone peaking out beneath the hem of the shirt.  <br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Tom replied, unconsciously tugging at the hem of his shirt. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Lets just get snacks.  They're right here anyway.\"<br>\r\nThe boys went through the bakery section first, Eric took his time walking down the aisles and looking for any pastries that would inspire him in his own baking.  Tom, on the other hand, hardly spared the treats more than a glance before tossing them into the cart and moving on.  Eric would have accused anyone else of having eyes too big for their stomach, but he knew that these snacks wouldn't stand a chance against his friend's greedy appetite.  By the time they made it through there were enough cookies, cupcakes and donuts to feed an army in the cart.  <br>\r\n\"So much for shopping on a full stomach,\" Eric quipped as he and Tom went in search of more junk food.  <br>\r\n\"What are you, my mom?\" Tom asked.  \"Who cares what I eat.\"<br>\r\nEric cupped his large friend's softening gut, giving it a bit of a bounce.  \"Does it look like I'm trying to put you on a diet?  How much of this do you think is here because of me?\"<br>\r\n\"Good point.  You do keep me pretty well fed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the two guys had made it through the store, the cart was practically overflowing with all the best and most unhealthy snacks.  The pile of junk they were buying won them a judgmental look from the girl working the cashier, but Tom was oblivious to it.  He handed over the money and immediately began rummaging through a bag until he found a snickers bar which he unwrapped quickly and gobbled quickly.<br>\r\nEric just stared as his friend devoured the candy bar.  He had never been shy about his somewhat lacking manners, but Tom had never acted like such a slob in front of other people before.  Maybe he had been spending too much time alone stuffing himself or something, Eric wasn't sure.  All he knew was that his friend's suddenly slovenly behavior was kind of turning him on.  <br>\r\n\"Come on dude,\" he said, putting a hand on Tom's fleshy side and guiding him out of the checkout line, \"you're holding up the line.\"  He kept his hand against Tom's side, cupping the his blossoming love handle as they walked towards the exit.  Feeling exhilarated, Eric decided to press his luck a bit.  \"I'm hungry,\" he said innocently.  \"You want to eat?\"<br>\r\nHe surprised Eric by taking a moment to consider.  \"Yeah,\" he said thoughtfully as he pressed a hand into his belly.  \"Yeah, I'm getting kind of hungry.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When he finally rolled out of bed the next day, Tom thought about hitting the gym.  He hadn't been there since before graduation and he knew he ought to get a bit of exercise, especially considering how he'd been spending his summer vacation so far.  With a groan he trudged into the bathroom and peered at himself in the mirror.  Even empty, his belly stuck out in front of him a bit.  His boxers rode beneath the curve of his new gut, pushed down by the weight of the new flab.  His chest was looking beefier and less defined and a set of developing lovehandles were making his formerly trim waist noticeably thicker.  <br>\r\n\"Who-ho, gettin' pretty soft, big guy,\" Tom muttered to himself as he hefted his belly playfully.  He knew he was getting a little out of shape and he knew that he should do something about it before it got out of hand, but he wasn't really that bothered by it.  He'd been a sexy hunk of muscle and Amber had still dumped him.  If he had the choice Tom wondered if he would even bother with the gym.<br>\r\n\"Ah, I'm still a catch,\" he told his reflection.  He was still tan, despite spending almost all his time locked away in his bedroom.  He still had great looks and a great smile.  \"Just gotta get the belly under control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was just stepping out of the shower when his phone went off.  Not bothering with his boxers (he was alone after all), he hurried off in search of his cell.  <br>\r\n\"Yo, what's up?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey bud.\"  It was Eric, of course.  \"Wanna hang out?\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno man,\" Tom said.  \"I was thinkin' of hitting the gym.  I'm getting a little soft here.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll make you lunch.\"<br>\r\nEric really knew how to convince him.  Tom couldn't pass up free food.  \"Alright, you got me.   You gonna pick me up or do I gotta walk there?\"<br>\r\n\"Heaven forbid.  I'll be there in a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you gonna feed me,\" Tom yelled from his place in the living room.  He was useless in the kitchen, so he parked himself in front of the TV while Eric did his thing.  It suited him just fine.  He was getting a great meal and he didn't have to spend a buck or lift a finger.  What more could a man ask for?<br>\r\n\"Hold your horses!  It'll be ready soon.\"<br>\r\n\"Hurry up bro, I'm starving!\"<br>\r\nAs usual, Eric was pulling out all the stops.  Cooking was a passion of his and he didn't cut corners, especially when it came to Tom.  It wasn't how most guys chose to spend their time together, but food was something that both boys had in common, though for different reasons.  Eric definitely loved to eat and could pack away an impressive amount of food, but his true love was cooking.  Tom could burn water, but he could never get enough good food.  Eric had never seen someone who could stuff down more than Tom could.  Their friendship had been centered around food for so long that cooking for his buddy just seemed normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright dude, it's ready,\" Eric called from the kitchen.  He waited for a few minutes before taking the hint.  \"Have it your way your highness.  Wouldn't want to tire you out with a walk to the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n\"You make it too easy,\" Tom grinned.  Eric was too good a host to keep his guests waiting for their meal.  He always let Tom get away with being lazy.  He grabbed his belly with both hands and grinned expectantly.  \"What'cha got for me?\"</span></div></div>",
